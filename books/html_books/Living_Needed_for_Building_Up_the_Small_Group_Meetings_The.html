<h1 class="title">A LIVING THAT IS OUT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />
AND THROUGH THE HUMAN SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:2, 4; Gal. 5:16, 25</h1>
<h2 class="head1">TWO KINDS OF MEETINGS</h2>
<p>This time the Lord has led us to have a number of weeks of special weekly conference meetings. Because of this, my spirit is leaping. I am especially happy when I see so many young people attending these meetings. In October 1984 we were led by the Lord in Taiwan to see how Christians should meet. At that time the Lord opened up to us all the verses in the New Testament concerning the matter of Christian meetings. We had a thorough study of this matter. As a result, the Lord showed us that at the beginning of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, that is, at the beginning of the New Testament age, the Holy Spirit led the first group of Christians, those who were freshly saved at Pentecost, to have two kinds of meetings. On the one hand there were the big meetings, and on the other hand there were the small meetings in the homes. The big meetings were held in public, while the small meetings were conducted from house to house (Acts 2:46). At the beginning of Acts, the believers had the big meetings as well as the house-to-house meetings. Not one house was excepted or excluded.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BIG MEETINGS AND THE SMALL MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Strictly speaking, it is not easy to have the big meetings. The reason is that not everyone is gifted or has the spiritual capacity to conduct a big meeting. On the day of Pentecost, the leading ones were Peter, James, and John. But according to the record in Acts, it seems that only Peter took the lead in the big meetings. However, in the small home gatherings there is no need for the spiritual &ldquo;giants.&rdquo; To use an illustration, the big meetings are like preparing a big feast; not everyone can make such a preparation. But the small home meetings are like home cooking; everyone can do it, and comparatively speaking it is easier than preparing a big feast.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is a simpler matter to have a big meeting. As long as you have a spiritual giant you can have such a meeting. However, the small meetings are not that simple. If you are alone, you might be satisfied with burnt or uncooked food. But if others are with you, it would not be adequate to offer them this kind of food. For a big feast, you only need to hire a few good cooks with a few helpers, and you will have many delicious dishes. But it is not easy for every home to have that same kind of cooking.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A HISTORICAL VIEW OF THE SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>At the time of Pentecost, there were the big meetings and there were the small meetings. The believers met in every home. This was an entirely new move of God. All of God&rsquo;s move is perfect and complete. But as soon as it falls into man&rsquo;s hand, there is degradation and regression. From the record of the Bible and from history, we can see that the way Christians meet has always been on a downward course. In the book of Acts we have the creative move of God. This was a beginning initiated by the Holy Spirit. In this beginning there were the big meetings and the small meetings, and the standard was high. But gradually there was a downward trend. By the end of the first century and the beginning of the second century, the emphasis had shifted. Virtually no more attention was paid to the small meetings, and all the attention was paid to the big meetings.</p>
<p>When the big meetings became prevailing, the students of theology were forced into existence. This is because without these students of theology, no one could preach, and if no one could speak in public, the big meetings could not be maintained. For this reason many theology students and preachers were produced. This just matches the natural concept and the way of organization. From that time on, the big meetings began to replace the small meetings, and gradually a clergy-laity system like that in today&rsquo;s Christianity came into being.</p>
<p>At the time of the reformation, Martin Luther did not touch this matter. He only saw one aspect of the truth. Two centuries after Luther, at the time of Count Zinzendorf and the Moravian Brethren, the matter of church meetings was touched. We might say that this was the beginning of the recovery of the church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. However, at that time they did not see the importance of the small home gatherings. Another century passed, and in the nineteenth century the Brethren were raised up by the Lord in England. They were more advanced than Zinzendorf in the matter of the recovery of the practice of the church life. But if you read the history and writings of the Brethren, you will not find much evidence that they emphasized meeting from house to house. Most of their meetings were held in their meeting halls.</p>
<p>Sixty years ago when the Lord raised us up in China, we saw something concerning the home meetings, but what we saw in the beginning was not very much. It was not until a number of years later that we saw the importance of this matter. However, while we were in mainland China, there was very little practice of home meetings. The church in Shanghai did not subdivide into two &ldquo;home&rdquo; meetings until 1934. Although the term suggests something close to a home meeting, actually the two meetings were in two different districts of Shanghai. One was in Hu-si, and the other in Jia-bei. From Home One in Hu-si to Home Two in Jia-bei there was a tram ride of over one hour. At that time we met every other week in the two &ldquo;homes.&rdquo; But actually they could not be considered as two home meetings; they could only be considered as two meeting halls in two different districts of Shanghai. They were not meetings in homes.</p>
<p>When we went to Taiwan, there was a further progression. Not only did we have meeting halls in every district, but under each meeting hall we had the small groups. However, we still had not moved the small groups into the homes. Some small groups began with meetings in the homes, but gradually they also moved to schools or other larger facilities. There was not the serious practice of meeting in the homes. And in less than ten years even this kind of small group meeting gradually deteriorated. By October of last year, there were no small groups left.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BIG MEETING BEING ABLE TO GATHER PEOPLE,<br />
 BUT NOT TO BUILD THEM UP</h2>
<p>It is difficult to have the small meetings. Consider the church in Taipei as an example. Last October we divided the church there into 399 small groups. If the meetings of these groups were to be conducted by gifted preachers, we would need 399 preachers. A simpler way would be to consolidate the small groups into twenty-one meeting halls. By having only twenty-one speakers, the problem would be greatly simplified. This is the reason why all the denominations must have seminaries. However, this way of organization is not found in the Bible. We cannot take the way of the denominations, emphasizing only the big meetings, with only a small number of people who can deliver messages. This way is appealing only to the natural taste. We must see that although the big meetings can gather and stir up people, they cannot build them up.</p>
<p>The meeting hall in Anaheim did not come into being suddenly. It was not that there were piles of material lying around, and one day suddenly they all came together to become a building. The design of that hall was first drafted by me personally. Then it was handed over to the brothers to lay out the architectural plan. Every day I came to supervise. Truckloads of material came in, but there was the need for some to do the fine work of building all the wood, stones, and steel together. Only then would there be the building. If we only gathered the material, but there was no one to build, then after all these years of rain and wear, the material would all be ruined.</p>
<p>For this reason we say that the work of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost was absolutely right. God is the Creator, and whatever He has created is good. There were the big meetings under Peter&rsquo;s leadership, which attracted the three thousand and then the five thousand (Acts 2:41; 4:4), and there were the homes into which these new ones were added. It was in the homes that these believers as building materials were practically built together. It is not sufficient merely to gather the materials together. That is easy to do. But to put the materials together to form a building is not the work of one man. There must be many small groups working together. Only then will the building be gradually completed.</p>
<p>The big meetings can gather the people, but how can they be built up? Many evangelists can bring thousands of people to the Lord, but where is the building? At most, these evangelists have caused sinners to become believers. But all the materials are piled up, and there is no building. This principle may also be applied to us. Among us, group after group of people have been saved and baptized. But today we have lost contact with many of them. Not many have remained and been built up together. I believe many of the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have a desire to seek after the Lord. But my question to you is, how many of us are built up together?</p>
<p>History shows us that up till today there is very little building in Christianity. What has been accomplished through all the centuries is only a work of revival. The entire history of Christianity is a story of revivals. It is like the book of Judges. Every time a spiritual giant such as Samson was raised up, the Israelites were revived. But when the spiritual giant died, the revival was buried with him. This is the problem in Christianity. The way of Christianity is the way of big meetings. But God&rsquo;s created way of meeting, as recorded in the first few chapters of Acts, was to have small meetings as well as big meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SMALL GROUP MEETINGS BEING<br />
THE FOUNDATION OF THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The foundation of the building of the church is in the small meetings. It is not in the big meetings. We need the big meetings to gather in the building material, for without the material there can be no building. But the job is not completed when the materials have arrived. There is still the need for the fine building work. Just as an airplane requires both wings to fly, these two sides must have a proper balance. To have big meetings alone is like having only one wing; it is impossible to fly that way. To have only the small meetings would likewise be inadequate. Only when we have both the big meetings and the small meetings can we take off with both wings. The same is true in God&rsquo;s creation. We all have two legs, two hands, two ears, and two eyes. In a similar way, we need both the big meetings and the small meetings.</p>
<p>The big meetings can attract the people, but only the small meetings can build people up. Our present need is to find a way to improve the small meetings so that they will become rich, strong, fresh, living, attractive, and able to uphold all the saints. The small meetings are the foundation of the building of the church; this is an unshakable law. If we do not keep this law, we will not have any building. It is easy to gather materials, but it is not easy to build them together. In Christianity we only see the gathering in of the material; we do not see the building. However, we ourselves have made the same mistake. For this reason, we all must have a change. We all need to be balanced. It does not mean that we do not need to go out and gather people in. It only means that we should not gather in at the expense of sacrificing the building.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED IN THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH&mdash;<br />
A LIVING THAT IS OUT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />
AND THROUGH THE HUMAN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In the past six months, after much seeking of the Lord, I have realized a basic problem. As long as a man has the gift, the eloquence, and the biblical knowledge, and is logical in organization and quick in grasping doctrinal points, he can conduct a big meeting. His daily living has little relationship to the meeting, and he does not need to grow in life. But for a man to build up the small groups, it is not sufficient to depend on eloquence. There must be adequate life plus truth.</p>
<p>Every human being has his basic needs in life. These needs cannot be met by human eloquence. We must take care of the small groups in a basic way. We must have some basic elements in us. When people come and taste of this basic thing, no one can chase them away. In brief, this basic thing is our life and our living. The first subject of these few weeks of training is to see the living that a Christian should have. What kind of living do we need for the building up of the church life? In a word, it is a living that is out of the Holy Spirit and through the human spirit.</p>
<p>The Bible is all-inclusive. According to my understanding of the Bible and my experience through so many years, I can say that in summary what the Bible talks about is this kind of living&mdash;a living that is out of the Holy Spirit and through the human spirit. The Christian life is not a life of ethics and morality; neither is it a life of purity in conscience. It is true that the Bible speaks of these things. In fact, it speaks of them in an even higher way than Confucius and all the sages spoke of them. However, these things are not the focus of the Bible. The reason that the ethics and morality mentioned in the Bible are higher than those of all other teachings, is that they are produced out of the Holy Spirit and through the human spirit.</p>
<p>Many Christians have read Ephesians chapter five. They see in verses 22 and 25 that husbands should love their wives and wives should obey their husbands, and they determine to keep these words. But no one has ever succeeded. Even the minister who conducts the wedding does not succeed. Actually, they forget that in the earlier chapters of Ephesians there is a basis for the teachings in chapter five. This basis is that the Holy Spirit has entered into our spirit. When we live by this spirit, spontaneously the husbands can love their wives, and automatically the wives can submit to their husbands. This is not produced by teaching; it is produced out of the Holy Spirit and through the human spirit.</p>
<p>For example, the Bible says, &ldquo;children...honor your father and mother,&rdquo; &ldquo;fathers, do not provoke your children,&rdquo; and &ldquo;be angry, and do not sin&rdquo; (Eph. 6:1-2, 4; 4:26). All these words are right, but when your anger rises up, it is so easy to sin. When you are stirred up, you forget that you are to honor your parents, or that you are not to provoke your children. These words are from the latter half of Ephesians. In the first half Paul explained clearly that the Triune God has become the Spirit, that He has entered into you, and that He has filled you in your spirit, so that you can live by this spirit to live out a superb living. This living is out of the Holy Spirit and through the human spirit. Only this kind of living can build the church.</p>
<p>Verse one of <em>Hymns,</em> #499 says:</p>
<p class="hbody">Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace!<br />
The Christ who&rsquo;s all within me lives.<br />
With Him I have been crucified;<br />
This glorious fact to me He gives.<br />
Now it&rsquo;s no longer I that live,<br />
But Christ the Lord within me lives.</p>
<p>You can sing this hymn enthusiastically, but you may not have the reality of what it says. Christ indeed lives within you, but you may not have much realization of what it means to be crucified with Christ. You can sing &ldquo;now it&rsquo;s no longer I that live,&rdquo; but how much have you really experienced this? How much have you understood this? This is not a doctrine. This requires us to exercise and to deny ourselves in our daily life. Only then will we experience the fact of being crucified with Christ and living with Christ.</p>
<p>It is easy to preach, and it is easy to listen. It is easy to sing, and it is not difficult to pray. But when it comes to the real situation of our daily life, it is a different story. Christ is gone, the Spirit is gone, and we are all left with nothing but self and the flesh.</p>
<p>Verse two of <em>Hymns,</em> #499 continues:</p>
<p class="hbody">Oh, what a joy! Oh, what a rest!<br />
Christ now is being formed in me.<br />
His very nature and life divine<br />
In my whole being inwrought shall be.<br />
All that I am came to an end,<br />
And all of Christ is all to me.</p>
<p>We must experience all these things in our daily lives. When a situation arises and circumstances become difficult, we should tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, grant me grace, that I may allow You to constitute Your life and nature into my whole being. I desire that all that I am would come to an end, and that all of You would be all to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know that it is easy to sing this kind of hymn, but it takes time to experience these things. This experience cannot be ours simply by being excited in the meetings. We must allow all these things to be constituted into us in our daily life. This is an organic metabolism. It terminates everything of ourselves, and makes all of Christ to be all to us.</p>
<p>Verse one of <em>Hymns,</em> #841 says:</p>
<p class="hbody">Thou art all my life, Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In me Thou dost live;<br />
With Thee all God&rsquo;s fulness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou to me dost give. <br />
By Thy holy nature<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sanctified, <br />
By Thy resurrection,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vict&rsquo;ry is supplied.</p>
<p>How can His holy nature sanctify you? This requires much work of permeation. How can His resurrection supply you with victory? This also requires a kind of transforming work.</p>
<p>Hence, verse two continues:</p>
<p class="hbody">Now Thy flowing life, Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth enlighten me, <br />
Bringing in the spirit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fellowship with Thee;<br />
All my need supplying,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making Thy demand, <br />
Leading me to cleansing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in Thee to stand.</p>
<p>When the Lord&rsquo;s life flows, we will be enlightened. If we live in the light of the Holy Spirit, the light and fellowship of that life will not only bring us all kinds of supply, but will also bring in demands. It will ask you to deal with your problems. It will ask you to deal with the hidden world within you. It will ask you to deal with your sins, your trespasses, your selfishness, and even your self, your disposition. Since you love the Lord, come to meetings, seek after the Lord, and pray, surely the Holy Spirit will flow through you. But here is an unbreakable law: every time He flows, you will be enlightened. If you do not have any light within, it shows that you have no flowing; you are still in darkness. If you have not experienced this enlightening recently, you must realize that this is a proof that you are definitely not in the flow of life. Life has no way to flow within you. As long as life flows, this life will become light. John 1:4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&rdquo; When this life flows, it shines within you, causing you to see your own corruption, sin, desire for the world, and selfishness. You will realize that you belong to the flesh and are filled with the self. Then you will pray, &ldquo;Lord, take away the world here, and my self there; and put to death the flesh here.&rdquo; If you will pray this way, you will be cleansed, and you will enjoy all that the Lord is. Only then will you truly enjoy His riches.</p>
<p>Verse three of <em>Hymns,</em> #841 says:</p>
<p class="hbody">Thy anointing Spirit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me shall permeate, <br />
All my soul and spirit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wouldst saturate;<br />
Every part transforming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till conformed to Thee, <br />
Till Thy life shall bring me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maturity.</p>
<p>All this takes time and work. It is by this process of life and transformation that your whole being is transformed.</p>
<p>In a small group meeting, if two or three would have this kind of living, then the small group meeting would surely be rich, strong, fresh, living, attractive, and supporting. Furthermore, it will be difficult to find out who the &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; are in the small groups. In all the small groups we have not assigned any leaders, because we all can be wrong. All of our assignments can be wrong. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we should avoid this kind of assignment as much as possible. Everyone has an opportunity; everyone can rise up. But if you try to rise up by your flesh or self, that is not genuine. You can cheat others, but you cannot cheat their spirits. Furthermore, the Holy Spirit will not testify to it; He will not follow you nor bless you. In that case, you are not the riches and strength of the home meeting. Neither are you the freshness, vitality, attraction, and support of that meeting.</p>
<p>But if you would be in the reality of hymns 499 and 841, if you would allow life to flow and would fellowship with the Lord, you will be enlightened. You will see that many things in you need to be dealt with. You will confess your sins before the Lord and will deal with them one by one. Consequently, the blood will wash you, and the Holy Spirit will be in you to deal with all the elements that need to be dealt with, and will replace them with Himself. If you are such a person, whenever you come to the meetings you do not need to say much, and you do not have to exhibit yourself. The minute you pray, sing, or share, you are the riches, the strength, the freshness, the vitality, the attraction, and the support of that meeting.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, if we love the Lord, if we love the church, and if we have a heart for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we need to see clearly that we must put our efforts here. We must put our effort into the growth in life, so that daily Christ can be formed in us, and daily His life and nature can be constituted into us, that all of Himself can be all to us. This must become our daily experience. Furthermore, when His life flows, we will be enlightened, and we will be able to have fellowship with God. In this fellowship, God will make demands on us, and we will realize what is the world, sin, the flesh, the self, and everything of the old creation within us. By allowing Him to remove these things little by little, we will be cleansed and will be able to enjoy all that He is. In this way we will spontaneously grow and be matured. If every small group would have two or three such persons, that small group meeting would surely be rich, strong, fresh, and living, and would be full of attraction and supporting power.</p>
<p>May the Lord be merciful to us, that we would not take this merely as a message. Surely I have a heavy burden concerning this matter. I would even fast and pray for this, hoping that the church would be brought into the reality of the small group gatherings. This is a high mountain, and we have to climb over it. May we all strive for this.</p>
<p>A concluding prayer: Lord, You know that we desire to accomplish Your purpose. Lord, may You bless these words. Bless every heart and spirit, so that we would touch You from within, and we would touch this way of the spirit. May we live this kind of living day by day and moment by moment, a living that is out of the Holy Spirit and through our human spirit. Lord, hear this prayer. Pour down Your answer, so that we would see a real revival. Amen.</p><h1 class="msg">NOTES FROM MESSAGE TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">A LIVING THAT IS ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:4; Gal. 5:16a, 25</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SMALL GROUP GATHERINGS</h2>
<p>In the previous message we talked about a living that is out of the Holy Spirit and through the human spirit. In this message we will continue to see a living that is solely according to the spirit. These two kinds of living are both for the strengthening of our present practice of small group gatherings in the homes.</p>
<p>The small group gathering is the foundation for the building of the church life. However, in Christianity today most people only pay attention to the big meetings. The big meetings are used to gather people together. After the people are gathered together, very little attention is paid to the work of building. For this reason, among most Christians the element of building is lacking and is almost nonexistent. The history of Christianity is a history of revival. This history is similar to the record in the book of Judges. When a judge was raised up, everyone was revived for a while. But when the judge was gone, everyone fell back to the same condition as before.</p>
<p>The Bible shows us that from the beginning of the church life there were two kinds of meetings. The big meetings were held in the temple, while the small meetings were held from house to house. The big meetings raised up and brought in the people, who were then put into the small meetings. In the small meetings they were nurtured and edified. There they coordinated together to be built into the house of God. Hence, the foundation of the building of the church is in the small group gatherings.</p>
<p>However, we have a wrong concept concerning the small group gatherings. We think that there is the need for a few able preachers to conduct these meetings. Actually, it is impossible to have enough preachers for all the homes. Even the seminaries cannot produce the required number of preachers. At Pentecost after the three thousand were saved, it is possible that the same night they began to meet in the homes. If that were the case, there might have been at least six or seven hundred small meetings in the homes. During the day they probably listened to a message from Peter in the big meeting. Then at night they returned home to preach the same message. Because of this practice, they all could testify, and they all could preach and teach (Acts 8:1, 4).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE GROWTH IN LIFE</h2>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Christianity puts too much emphasis on the big meetings. As a result, the small meetings are neglected. Even among us we have the same situation. Although we attempted to have the small group meetings in the past, they were not very successful. It was not difficult to have seven or eight people come together to discuss the news and chat about their families. But when the time came to talk about spiritual things, they became lost. They found that they did not know how to conduct themselves. After a few meetings everyone became discouraged, and no one wanted to come together any longer.</p>
<p>The reason for the failure of the small group meetings is that believers are not saved in a thorough, strong, and living way. A child does not become full-grown the day he is born. There must be the daily feeding and care. Only then will he grow up properly. When my youngest daughter had her first baby boy seven or eight years ago, we visited our little grandchild in the hospital. The baby was so thin and small in the incubator that we were concerned whether he would be able to grow up at all. But today the child is lively and healthy. This tells us that life is wonderful; it can grow and flourish.</p>
<p>Although the human life is wonderful, we Christians have a more wonderful divine life in addition to our human life. Medical doctors have made such a thorough study of human birth that even babies born three to four months premature can survive if they are given the proper care. Unfortunately, Christians have not been as thorough in the study of the spiritual birth. Some people are saved in such a poor way that their salvation may be likened to the birth of a premature baby. Among us it is especially easy to have premature spiritual births, because after we talk with people concerning the gospel, we ask them to call on the name of the Lord. The Bible does say that whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved (Rom. 10:13). But while some are nine months in the womb already when they call, others are less than four or five months old. When we try to persuade them, we are forcing a premature birth. Actually, the time is not yet ripe. We should have waited a little longer. If a person is born prematurely, it will be difficult for him to grow well.</p>
<p>The realization of many Christians concerning the matter of salvation is that we were fallen sinners who were in need of the Lord. By outwardly stretching forth His hand, He delivered us from sins, the world, and hell. In their concept, the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is like pulling a drowning man out of deep water. Actually, the salvation of the Lord covers all the processes that He has passed through: His incarnation, His thirty-three and a half years of human living, His crucifixion, and His tasting of death for us all. He entered into the Hades of death, passed through death, and came out victoriously from it. Then He rose from the dead to become the life-giving Spirit. After this He ascended to the throne and poured Himself out upon His believers. Today He is not only on the throne, but He is also the Spirit waiting for you to believe in Him, call upon Him, and receive Him. If you call on His name out of a sincere heart, this life-giving Spirit will enter into you to be your life and will be in you as your salvation, saving your entire being from sin and the world. This is the real salvation. This is also called regeneration. Regeneration is to receive the divine life in addition to the human life that you already have. This divine life will be in you as your salvation and supply.</p>
<p>Life is wonderful. Even a lower form of life such as the plant life, which has neither sense nor consciousness, is very wonderful. For example, the different fruit trees bear different kinds of fruit of various shapes, tastes, and color. The many kinds of flowers are also adorned beautifully with so many different colors. The human life is of course much more mysterious than the plant life. But even more excellent and mysterious than this is the life of God. A regenerated person has received this excellent and mysterious life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FOCUS OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Because of the influence of culture, tradition, religion, philosophy, morality, ethics, customs, and habits, whenever we read the Bible, we are affected by all these things in our background. As a result, we think that the Bible teaches us concerning all these things. Superficially, much of the Bible does deal with these things which relate to human behavior. It does speak of how husbands and wives should treat each other. It also talks about how parents and children should get along with one another. The Bible talks about humility, and it also talks about love, forbearance, patience, and other similar virtues. The Bible does not annul ethics and morality, nor does it reject culture and teachings. But these are not the focus of the Bible. Some think that if these are not the focus of the Bible, then the focus must be God&rsquo;s love to man, His mercy, forbearance, lovingkindness, and so forth. Surely the Bible also talks about all these things, but they are still not the focus.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A HYMN THAT REVEALS<br />
THE FOCUS OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p><em>Hymns,</em> #501 can be considered a masterpiece in our hymnal. It extracts the focus of the Bible from the New Testament and describes it fully.</p>
<p>Verse one of this hymn says:</p>
<p class="hbody">O glorious Christ, Savior mine,<br />
Thou art truly radiance divine;<br />
God infinite, in eternity,<br />
Yet man in time, finite to be.</p>
<p>Then verse two says:</p>
<p class="hbody">The fulness of God dwells in Thee;<br />
Thou dost manifest God&rsquo;s glory;<br />
In flesh Thou hast redemption wrought;<br />
As Spirit, oneness with me sought.</p>
<p>This hymn does not speak of the love of God or of the grace of God. It does not talk about God&rsquo;s mercy or lovingkindess. Rather, it speaks of the fulness of God and the glory of God.</p>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;As Spirit, oneness with me sought&rdquo; speaks of the focus of the Bible. This focus is the Triune God, the Creator of the universe, the eternal God, who came one day to the earth to become a finite man. He accomplished redemption in the flesh, and on the cross He terminated sin, the world, darkness, the self, the flesh, and everything of the old creation. Then in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. When we believe in Him, He enters into us to have an organic union with us. In this way this life-giving Spirit becomes one with us.</p>
<p>This union is not a union like one hand holding another hand. It is a union comparable to the grafting of a branch into a tree. Romans 11:24 says that we are the wild olive branches that have been grafted into the cultivated olive tree. The cultivated olive tree is Christ, and the wild olive branches are we the sinners. Without passing through the redeeming death of Christ, we and Christ can never be grafted together. It is through the death and resurrection of Christ that He became the life-giving Spirit to enter into us and to have an organic union with us.</p>
<p>Verse three of <em>Hymns,</em> #501 says:</p>
<p class="hbody">All things of the Father are Thine;<br />
All Thou art in Spirit is mine;<br />
The Spirit makes Thee real to me,<br />
That Thou experienced might be.</p>
<p>All that the Father has is the Son&rsquo;s, and all that the Son is, is in the Spirit (John 16:13-15). This Spirit is the ultimate expression of the Triune God. The Bible explains in detail how all that belongs to the Father is inherited by the Son, and how all that the Son is, is in the Spirit. Hence the Spirit becomes the reality of the Son, and the Son is the expression of the Father. In this way, the Son is the manifestation of the Father, and the Spirit is the realization of the Son. Today this Spirit has entered into our spirit to become our reality. The result is that our spirit is organically joined to His Spirit, and His story becomes our history.</p>
<p>As descendants of the Chinese race we are spread today throughout the whole world. In the early days our ancestors crossed a vast span of land. When they did this, we also crossed over together with them. Hence their story is our history. In the same way, all that the Lord Jesus has passed through&mdash;His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension&mdash;has become our experience by His being joined to us.</p>
<p>Verse four continues:</p>
<p class="hbody">The Spirit of life causes Thee<br />
By Thy Word to transfer to me. <br />
Thy Spirit touched, Thy word received,<br />
Thy life in me is thus conceived.</p>
<p>Today this Spirit enters into our spirit to make His history our experience. But that is not all. By the word of the Bible He is making Himself real to us. Whenever we come to read the Lord's Word, we touch this Spirit, and He becomes our supply.</p>
<p>Verse five says:</p>
<p class="hbody">In spirit while gazing on Thee,<br />
As a glass reflecting Thy glory, <br />
Like to Thyself transformed I&rsquo;ll be,<br />
That Thou might be expressed thru me.</p>
<p>Every time we come to the Lord, it is a matter of the spirit. We must forget about our culture and forget about teachings. We must drop our religion and philosophy, and we must drop our ethics, our morality, and all our customs and habits. Of course, this does not mean that we can indulge ourselves in whatever we desire. It means that we should forget all these things and turn to our spirit. In spirit we should worship and behold the Lord, as a mirror reflecting the Lord&rsquo;s glory.</p>
<p>I was born in northern China, but when I went to Shanghai, I did not reflect the North, and when I came to the West, I did not reflect the East. What I reflected was Christ. On the one hand Christ is in the heavens; on the other hand He is in our spirit. As long as we will turn to our spirit, we can contact Him and enjoy Him, as a mirror reflecting His glory. The result is that we are transformed into His image, and He is expressed through us.</p>
<p>Verse six continues:</p>
<p class="hbody">In no other way could we be<br />
Sanctified and share Thy vict&rsquo;ry;<br />
Thus only spiritual we&rsquo;ll be<br />
And touch the life of glory.</p>
<p>Today we have only one way&mdash;the way of the spirit. The Triune God, the Creator of the universe, who was incarnated, died on the cross, and rose from the dead, is now the life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is the ultimate expression of the Triune God. He is also the consummation of the Triune God. He has entered into the spirit of us who have believed and is now being mingled with us as one spirit. Now we should walk according to this mingled spirit and live a daily life that is inseparably attached to this spirit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many people read the Bible as if they are wearing a pair of colored eyeglasses. They read into the Bible many things of culture, teachings, ethics, morality, religion, philosophy, customs, and traditions. As a result, they do not receive any light from the Bible. Even many seminary students are coming to the Word in this way. They come with their colored eyeglasses. I hope that the Lord will be merciful to us all, so that we may all remove our colored glasses to read the Word of God solely with our God-created spirit.</p>
<p>The last verse of <em>Hymns,</em> #501 says:</p>
<p class="hbody">Thy Spirit will me saturate,<br />
Every part will God permeate, <br />
Delivering me from the old man,<br />
With all saints building for His plan.</p>
<p>This mingled spirit is in you saturating and permeating your whole spirit, soul, and body. The result is that your whole being will be filled with the Triune God, so that in every part of your being you will see God. In this way, every part of your being will be saturated with God, and you will be delivered from the natural self and be built together with all the saints to become God&rsquo;s habitation.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:22 says, &ldquo;In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; Only when we are all living in spirit, worshipping in spirit, beholding and reflecting His glory in spirit, and being transformed in spirit will it be possible for God to have a way. And only then will it be possible for us to be built together in spirit to become the dwelling of God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TEACHING OF LIFE&mdash;<br />
TO WALK ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Christian life is not a life according to culture. It is not a life of religion, ethics, morality, tradition, or customs. The Christian life is a living that is out of the Holy Spirit and through the human spirit. It is also a living whose walk is according to the spirit. Unfortunately, you and I have not yet attained to that standard. Many brothers and sisters are very pious toward God. They are very strict toward themselves and very forgiving toward others. Their manner of life is very honest and faithful. We Chinese have been taught this way from our youth, and in our daily life we are very much controlled and governed by these teachings. As far as Confucius is concerned, this kind of behavior is good, and as far as morality and ethics is concerned, it is excellent. Such behavior is upheld by tradition and welcomed by natural reasoning. But as far as God&rsquo;s economy is concerned, it is off the mark. God does not approve any of these things. He does not approve anything that is not according to His economy. As the New Testament apostles came to realize, even the ordinances that were given by God in the Old Testament have all been set aside (Eph. 2:15; Col. 2:14).</p>
<p>Paul shows us in the book of Galatians that if a man desires to keep the law, he is severed from Christ and has fallen from grace (Gal. 5:4). Christ is made of no effect to him (Gal. 5:2). This does not mean that we have the liberty to break the law. It is not a matter of keeping the law or of breaking the law. To keep the law is a matter of good, and to break the law is a matter of evil. Both good and evil are from the same tree, the tree of knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 2:17). But the tree of life is neither a matter of good nor a matter of evil. It is a matter of life, and this life is Christ (John 14:6).</p>
<p>In Romans 7:21 Paul said that whenever he desired to do good, evil was present with him. This is the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Those who live in the realm of the tree of knowledge of good and evil are always in turmoil. Paul cried, &ldquo;Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?&rdquo; (7:24). Then in chapter eight he declared that the law of the Spirit of life had freed him (8:2). Here we have not the law of good nor the law of evil, but the law of life.</p>
<p>To most people, it is commendable to be able to differentiate between good and evil. To their way of thinking, it is right to be lawful, moral, and ethical. The Chinese classics say that the way of the higher teaching is in the development of the &ldquo;bright virtue.&rdquo; As long as a person will develop the bright virtue within him, he is good. But to the Christian this is not adequate. The teaching of life is not a matter of developing the bright virtue. The teaching of life is to walk according to spirit. The teaching of Confucius exhorts man to cultivate and develop the bright virtue within him. But we Christians are not here to develop that bright virtue. We are here to develop the spirit within us which is mingled with Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit. This mingled spirit within us is much higher than the bright virtue.</p>
<p>Actually, the bright virtue is simply the conscience. The bright virtue of Confucius is the conscience that Wang Yang-ming, another Chinese philosopher, spoke about. All the teachings concerning the development of the bright virtue are the result of the highest discoveries of the Chinese philosophers. They discovered that within man there is the noblest part, which is the conscience. But within us the believers is a spirit which contains the divine Spirit. This is much higher than the conscience. I hope that the brothers and sisters will hear this word. What many seeking Christians are doing today is simply developing their bright virtue. They are not walking according to the spirit within them which is mingled with God the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Bible does not teach us to develop our bright virtue. It does not tell us to cultivate our natural man. Rather, it teaches us to walk according to the spirit (Rom. 8:4; Gal. 5:16a, 25). This spirit is the mingled spirit which is produced when the Spirit of God enters into our spirit. The Spirit of God is the life-giving Spirit who has passed through creation, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. Today this Spirit has entered into the spirits of all those who are saved. God&rsquo;s intention today is not for us to develop our bright virtue. Rather, He wants us to walk according to that inward spirit in which God&rsquo;s presence dwells. The way of the higher teaching is in the development of the bright virtue; but the teaching of life is in walking according to the spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">PRACTICING WALKING BY THE SPIRIT<br />
IN OUR DAILY LIFE</h2>
<p>I have been saved for sixty years. I read books by many different schools of Christians. Each school had its own theory and practice, and I tried and practiced them all. In the end I saw that the Bible only shows us one way, and that way is to walk not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit in our daily life.</p>
<p>When we wake up in the morning, no matter how busy we are, we should spend a few minutes to have a time with the Lord. We should open ourselves to the Lord and say, &ldquo;Lord, I come to contact You. You are my life and my everything. Today I am not here to live out my morality. I am here to live out Christ. I do not wish to act merely according to my conscience. I want to act according to the spirit.&rdquo; After you pray, perhaps you will read a few verses. Then in your daily life you should simply practice to have a walk that is according to the spirit.</p>
<p>Often God will allow our wives or children or other matters to come and trouble us. They are there to test whether we are actually living in the spirit, or whether we are living by ourselves. Sometimes if our wives bother us a little, we begin to exercise our patience. This is nothing but the development of our bright virtue and a cultivation of our behavior. We must see that whatever happens to us is for us to learn to turn to our spirit. We do not care for the development of the bright virtue, nor do we care for the cultivation of our behavior. If the spirit would not move, we would not move. We only know how to walk according to the spirit.</p>
<p>Sometimes when we manage to be patient, we feel very proud of ourselves. We think that we have succeeded in our effort and that we have achieved something. But when we turn to the spirit, we are enlightened. We realize that although we have succeeded in cultivating a good behavior, we have not lived Christ. Although we were successful in exercising our patience, we failed to walk according to the spirit.</p>
<p>In the past certain saints have come to me, saying, &ldquo;O Brother Lee, you are marvelous! You have done such a wonderful work for the Lord!&rdquo; When I heard this, I felt like the cherubims. I felt as if I had six wings with which to fly away. Although I said with my mouth, &ldquo;This is not me; it is all the Lord&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; in reality it was all me. It was not Christ; it was not walking according to the spirit. After I confessed this before the Lord, I learned the lesson, and I dared not be so proud. We are all like that. When others praise us a little, we are in the heavens, but when others criticize us a little, we are in hell. We can neither take praise nor take rebuke. We must exercise to walk according to the spirit, and not be bothered by anything else. We would not be distracted either by others&rsquo; praise or by their rebuke. We would only pay attention to walking in the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RICHES OF LIFE AND THE SHINING OF TRUTH<br />
FOR THE STRENGTHENING<br />
OF THE SMALL GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Today as Christians, in order for us to strengthen the small group meetings, we must have the riches of life; and in order for us to have the riches of life, we must exercise ourselves to walk according to the spirit. We should not be moved when the wind is favorable, and we should not be hindered when the wind is unfavorable. We should not exercise patience, nor should we exercise self-control. We should only walk according to the spirit. We should not live out ethics or morality; we should only live out the Christ who is the Spirit.</p>
<p>If you will walk according to the spirit all day long, you will surely be filled with joy and exultation within. Spontaneously, you will overflow with praise and thanksgiving. You will say to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I worship You. You are truly my life and my everything day by day. Lord, You are truly my enjoyment. My wife may be giving me a hard time, but I am not touched. She may be praising me, but I am not moved. Lord, I only desire to walk according to the spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we have this kind of living, when the meeting time comes and we are all gathered together, our meetings will be an expression of our daily life. We should not come to the meetings to perform. The meetings are a testimony of our daily life. If from morning till evening we are led by the Spirit, spontaneously psalms and praises will well up within us, and when we come to the meetings we will continue to be led by the Spirit in prayer, praise, and thanksgiving.</p>
<p>This is the aspect of life. Later we will add to this the aspect of truth. We need to be rich in life and shining in the truth. Then when a person sits in our meetings, he will be touched and he will be fed. Those who are rich in life and shining in the truth will spontaneously become the core of the small group meetings and they will become the riches, the strength, the freshness, the livingness, the attracting power, and the supporting power to the small groups. It is in this way that the small group meetings are strengthened.</p>
<p>For this reason we do not agree that one person does all the speaking while everyone else does the listening in every meeting week after week, month after month, and year after year. We hope that the big meetings will render us some help, so that all the saints can be perfected and equipped to seek after the growth in life and edification in truth. Then as we become persons who are saturated with life and equipped with the truth, whichever small group meeting we attend, we will become the riches, strength, freshness, livingness, attraction, and support to that meeting. This is my hope, and this is also the revelation of the Bible.</p>
<p>I hope that all the brothers and sisters will see this. We are not here for a religion; we are not here to practice ethics or to teach morality; and we are not here to go along with traditions or customs. We are here today to live Christ. Our job is not to develop the bright virtue. Our desire is simply to live a life that walks according to the spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">NOTES FROM MESSAGE THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">A LIVING THAT IS OUTWARDLY BAPTIZED IN<br />
AND INWARDLY SATURATED WITH<br />
THE HOLY SPIRIT, AND IN WHICH<br />
OUR WHOLE BEING IS CONSTITUTED<br />
WITH THE ELEMENTS OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 12:12-13</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE THIRD KIND OF LIVING</h2>
<p>In the two previous messages we covered two kinds of living. The first kind of living is one which is out of the Holy Spirit and through the human spirit. The second kind of living is one which walks solely according to the spirit. In this message we come to the third kind of living. Actually, these three kinds of living are just three aspects of the one living. In the two previous messages we did not see the constituents of this living. This is like saying that a certain kind of tea is good, thirst-quenching, and invigorating without telling people what elements are in the tea.</p>
<p>In this message we want to go deeper to consider the normal Christian living. No doubt the normal Christian living is one which is out of the Holy Spirit and through the human spirit, and no doubt it is a living that walks according to the spirit. But that is not enough. We need to go on to see what the constituents of this living are. This is my burden in this message. Hence, the subject of this message is &ldquo;A Living That Is Outwardly Baptized in and Inwardly Saturated with the Holy Spirit, and in which Our Whole Being Is Constituted with the Elements of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SERVICE IN ROMANS TWELVE</h2>
<p>The proper service in the church is based on Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12. Romans 12 speaks of service to God in the church, that is, in the Body of Christ. In this service, the first thing is that we must present our bodies (12:1). To present our bodies is to present our time. If your body comes, your time comes also. This is very practical. But when the body comes, problems also come. This is because when the body is here, opinions are here as well. There is no one in the world who does not have an opinion. Everyone, whether he is old or young, has his opinions. Opinion is a great problem to the church. For this reason Paul says that we need to present our bodies and not be conformed to this age (12:2).</p>
<p>Recently I was holding a conference in a certain city. One sister in the congregation was a medical doctor. When she heard my message, she was very impressed. After the meeting she came to see me and said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, our church is very good. Only one thing is lacking. I feel that we should have a hospital.&rdquo; You see, her body came, and her opinion came also. This is to be conformed to the age. If we allow a hundred people to speak in the meeting, there may be a hundred opinions. Some may suggest putting house plants all over the meeting hall. Others may suggest having a four-part choir. This is conformation to the age, that is, to the world.</p>
<p>The church is heavenly and spiritual. This is why, immediately after Paul mentioned the presenting of the body, he went on to say that the mind must be renewed (12:2). This renewing of the mind is a turn in our concept. We are not a social club, nor are we a society or an association. We are the children of God meeting together in spirit. For this reason, when we come to serve in the church, we should take our concepts from the Bible, and not from the world. It is right for you to present your body, but the opinions in your mind should not come along with it. Your mind should be renewed and be transformed. Furthermore, your spirit must be burning (12:11). Our service to God in the church should be one where the body is presented, the mind is renewed, and the spirit is burning. This is the service described in Romans 12.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SERVICE IN FIRST CORINTHIANS TWELVE</h2>
<p>The service mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12 has a foundation. This foundation is the constituents of a Christian&rsquo;s spiritual life. These constituents can be found in verses 12 and 13 of that chapter. The section from 12:12 to the end of the chapter covers only one subject&mdash;the Body. There we see that the church is a body. The church is not an organization; it is an organism. An organization has no life, while a body has life because it is organic. For example, a chair may be considered as an organization. It is very orderly, but it has no life. Our body, on the contrary, is not merely orderly; it also has life. The church is the Body of Christ. It is not an organization, but an organism.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12 also talks about the service of the members of this Body in the church. In this service everyone functions according to his part. However, this service of the Body has a foundation. This foundation is seen in verses 12 and 13. In this foundation we see the constituents of the daily life of those who serve. This is a deeper point. To talk about the outward function is easier and more readily understood, but to talk about the inward constituent is deeper and more difficult, because man does not have this concept within him.</p>
<p>These two verses show us the constituents of the living of those who love the Lord, follow Him, and serve Him. The first constituent is the Spirit, and the second is Christ. Verse 12 says, &ldquo;For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body being many are one body, so also is Christ.&rdquo; This Christ is not merely the Head; He is the whole Body. Hence, this Christ is not the individual Christ, but the corporate Christ. This verse reveals that Christ is not only the Head but the Body as well. Here we have Christ and the church. Christ and the church together make one universal man. The Head of this man is Christ Himself, and the Body is the saints who are the members. Paul says that this Body which is composed of all the saints is also Christ.</p>
<p>After this, in verse 13 Paul said, &ldquo;For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; On the one hand, we were all baptized into one Body. This is outward. After being baptized, we were all given to drink one Spirit. This is inward. We were baptized into the water once, but we drink water every day. This does not mean that the water into which we were baptized and the water which we drink are two different kinds of water. They are the same kind of water, but this water has two functions. Today the Lord is only one Spirit; He is not two Spirits. But this one Spirit has two functions. One function is to baptize us. This Spirit has baptized us into one Body. After we are baptized, we go on to drink this Spirit. To drink is to take something into your being. Baptism is the outward function, and drinking is the inward function. We get into the water, and the water also gets into us. All these are illustrations. Because spiritual matters are too deep, the Bible uses illustrations to describe them to us.</p>
<p>When we drink water into us, it quenches our thirst. Moreover, it has the function of moistening and dissolving our food. After you have eaten some solid food, the only way for the nutritious elements in the food to get into your cells and blood stream is to dissolve them with water. This also is an illustration. Please do not think that because the Spirit is mysterious, He is therefore abstract. Although the Spirit is mysterious, He is not abstract. Rather, He is very practical. We must daily drink this Spirit. Only then will we be able to live a proper Christian life.</p><h2 class="head1">A LIVING THAT IS SATURATED<br />
WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT AND<br />
WHOSE CONSTITUENT IS CHRIST</h2>
<p>If you study thoroughly verses 12 and 13, you will see that the functioning of all the members of the Body of Christ is nothing but a living. And this living is composed of two kinds of elements. One is the Spirit, who is like water; the other is Christ, who is like food. The growth of the human life depends on these two elements. Food is solid, and water is liquid. Within these two elements are many rich nutrients. The nutrition in food is greater than the nutrition in water. However, food is dry. When it gets into you, without water to dissolve it, it is difficult for the nutrition in the food to saturate your cells and blood stream. We need the solid food, and we also need the liquid water. The food is Christ, and the water is the Spirit.</p>
<p>My body can stand upright because it is sustained by food and water. All of us grow and live by the supply of food and water. They sustain our work and activities. For our physical being to grow up healthily, we need to eat rich food and drink nutritious drinks. The Chinese who are born in America are all tall and strong. This is because the American food is exceedingly rich. American milk, American steak, American chicken, American fruits, and many other kinds of American food are eaten and constituted into their being. As a result, they are constituted with American food. But if they do not eat the riches of American food, then naturally they will be small, skinny, and unhealthy. Today many Christians are small, skinny, and bony. This is because they have not been eating Christ and drinking the Spirit. Christ and the Spirit are the two necessary constituents for the growth in life of the believers. They are also the foundation of the service of the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROBLEMS OF THE SMALL GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<p>In this message we are considering the small group meetings. We have no desire to gather the brothers and sisters together merely to have one person speak while all the rest listen. We desire to see all the saints functioning in the meetings. But if we have a few hundred or a few thousand people meeting together, how could it be possible for everyone to function? It is for this reason that the Bible mentions both the big meetings in the temple and the small meetings from house to house. This is where our difficulty lies. Suppose you have begun to meet in your home, and you have seven or eight people meeting together as a small group. The first two meetings may be very good. But by the third time you run out of content; there is no more supply. One brother may say, &ldquo;I am going home&rdquo; and another may say, &ldquo;I am leaving.&rdquo; In the end you find that you cannot carry on such meetings any longer.</p>
<p>This situation may be likened to a group of children growing up in America who refuse to eat hamburger or drink milk. They do not want to eat anything or drink anything. If you put five of them on a team and ask them to play ball, of course they will not have the strength to play. The reason that our small group meetings are not attractive is that we are all dry and skinny, weak and dead. We do not act like living persons. In such a condition it is all right for us to come to attend a &ldquo;service&rdquo; or to sit in a pew. There we may have a few who can sing professionally and who can lead us in singing. We may also have a few who are trained in praying who can lead us in prayer. Of course, there is also the preacher who will preach to us. It is easy to attend a &ldquo;service&rdquo; in that way. However, if six or seven of us are put together by ourselves, what should we do? Who will pray for us? Who will preach to us? In such a situation we may look at each other, or just talk to each other about many irrelevant things. In the end there is nothing more to say, and the meeting cannot be carried on any further. For this reason, we cannot talk about propagation or increase. We can only remain where we are, get by with what we have, and overlook our real needs. This is why my whole being is overloaded with this heavy burden. My hope is that in every local church we would see a total mobilization of all the members. In order to have a total mobilization, there is no other way but to have the small groups. Only in the small groups will everyone be able to function.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST IN THE SPIRIT AS MAN&rsquo;S SUPPLY</h2>
<p>We must have a kind of living that is initiated from the Holy Spirit and which passes through the human spirit. In other words, we must have a living in which we walk according to the spirit. However, that is not all. Tonight the Lord has shown us the constituents of this kind of living. The first constituent is food; the second is water. The food is Christ, and the water is the Spirit. According to the Bible, Christ is in the Spirit. This is like all the nutrition in the food being in the water. From Revelation 22 we can see that the tree of life grows in the river of life (vv. 1-2). Wherever the river of life flows, there the tree of life grows. The fruit of the tree of life comes out of the two sides of the river to supply man&rsquo;s need. Christ must be in the Spirit before He can be our supply.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO DRINK THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>How then do we drink this spiritual water? Both milk and honey are not solid, but are liquid food. There is rich nutrition in the milk, but it is all in the liquid. Likewise, all the riches of honey are in the liquid. Today, all the riches of Christ are in the Spirit. However, in Christianity the question of the Spirit has never been resolved during the past two thousand years. This is because the Spirit is too mysterious and deep. Many Christians do not have an adequate knowledge concerning the Spirit; hence, they have no way to experience the Spirit. For this reason they are constantly in poverty.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Believe What the Bible Says</h2>
<p>Thank the Lord that by His mercy I was saved sixty years ago. After I was saved I loved the Bible to the uttermost. There was hardly a day when the Bible was not in my hand. I read it every day. Later the Lord called me and gave me grace to give up my job, and from then on I did almost nothing but study the Bible. After all my studying plus my experience, I arrived at a conclusion: first, in order to enjoy this Spirit we must believe what the Bible says.</p>
<p>The Bible tells us first that the God in whom we believe and whom we worship, serve, and enjoy, is a Triune God. In the Triune God we have the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the consummation. Although the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are distinct, They are not three Gods. They are still one God. There is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, with one source, one course, and one consummation. In the consummation there is not only the Spirit, but the Son and the Father as well. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not only coexistent; They are also coinherent. The Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father. Both the Father and the Son are in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in both the Father and the Son. The Lord Jesus said clearly in John 14 that He is in the Father and the Father is in Him. Hence, His speaking is the Father&rsquo;s working. He said that when men see Him, they see the Father, for the Father is in Him, and He is in the Father (vv. 9-11). Therefore, the Father and the Son cannot be separated. Although there is a distinction between the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, They are inseparable.</p>
<p>God is triune because He desires to work Himself into His created and redeemed people, that is, into us who have believed. How then does the Triune God work Himself into us? First, He accomplished creation. In His creation, the Father, Son, and Spirit were there together. The Triune God worked together to accomplish creation. In creation His main goal was to create man as the center, so that man could become the object of His dispensing. But after He created man, man fell. Because of man&rsquo;s fall, the Triune God became flesh (John 1:1, 14). It was not merely the Son of God who became flesh. The Lord Jesus told us that when He came, He brought the Father with Him (John 8:29). This is contrary to the concept of most Christians. Their concept is that when Christ came to put on the flesh, He left the Father in heaven. The fact is that when the Son came to be incarnated, the Father came also. Furthermore, the Son became flesh in the Spirit. That is, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit through Mary (Matt. 1:18, 20). Hence, the Father, Son, and Spirit were all involved in the incarnation. For this reason, the Bible does not say that the Son became flesh. Rather, it says, &ldquo;Who (God) was manifested in the flesh&rdquo; (1 Tim. 3:16). It was not a partial God, but a complete God, who was incarnated.</p>
<p>The Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;became flesh and lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. He passed through the human life and tasted all the joys and sufferings of the human living. At the end of His human life He went to the cross to accomplish the all-inclusive death. Then He was buried. He entered into Hades, but death could not hold Him (Acts 2:24); neither could Hades detain Him, for He is life (John 11:25). He came triumphantly out of death, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). This Spirit has passed through creation, incarnation, human living, and death, and has entered into resurrection. This Spirit, who is the very consummation of the Triune God, has passed through so many processes and steps to become the life-giving Spirit. In this life-giving Spirit there is the Son, and there is also the Father; there is God, and there is also man. The Bible tells us that this Spirit in resurrection is the resurrected Christ (John 14:17, 20), who is also the pneumatic Christ. It was this pneumatic Christ who came into the midst of the disciples on the night of His resurrection to breathe into the disciples, saying, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (John 20:19-22). From that time on, the Triune God has entered into His chosen people. This is what happened on the day of resurrection.</p>
<p>Essentially speaking, the Triune God entered into the disciples on that day to become their life and life essence. Economically speaking, forty days later He ascended into heaven (Acts 1:9). This does not mean that in His ascension He left His disciples. He was still within the disciples as their essence. Ten days after He ascended, He poured Himself out from the throne (Acts 2:1-4, 16-18). This is the Spirit at Pentecost. By this time, you can see that this Triune God has become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. On the one hand, He entered into His believers to be their life essence. On the other hand, He fell upon them to be their power for work.</p>
<p>What should we do with such a record of the Scripture? We must believe! We need to say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to every point recorded in the Bible. The Bible says that God is triune&mdash; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. To this we should say &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; The Bible says that this Triune God created the heavens, the earth, and all things, including us. To this we should also say &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; The Bible also says that the Triune God became flesh and lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. Again we should say &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; The Bible says that this Triune God died on the cross for our sins, and dealt with sin, the world, Satan, and all the negative things. We should say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to this. The Bible says again that He rose from the dead to become the life-giving Spirit, and that He has entered into those who believe in Him. Again we should say &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; If you believe in Him, He will enter into you. There is no need to analyze with your mind. Simply &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; what the Bible says from the depth of your being. Do not be deceived by your unreliable feelings. If you say &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; you will realize that He is in you. This is real.</p>
<p>Hebrews 11:1 says that &ldquo;faith is the substantiating of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.&rdquo; What is faith? Faith is the substantiating of the substance. Let me explain this with an illustration. Suppose that in a certain house there is a sweet fragrance, but you cannot see it, nor can you touch it. How then can you substantiate this fragrance? All you need to do is to exercise your nose a little, and the fragrance will be substantiated. You must use the right organ to substantiate a particular substance. For example, you must use your ear to hear. The hearing of the ear is the substantiating of sound. Likewise, faith is the substantiating of spiritual things. All spiritual things are substantial, but we must use our spirit to believe in them. This believing is the substantiating of the substance of spiritual things.</p>
<p>When you pray, do not exercise your mind as you do when you recite something from memory. Neither should you preach to the Lord in your prayer. The Bible has no preaching prayers, but it has prayers of confession, where a person confesses his failures. D. L. Moody said a hundred years ago that long prayers kill the prayer meetings. The most living prayers are those with two or three sentences. I can still remember a story about Moody. One time in a meeting, a person began to pray a long prayer. Moody said, &ldquo;While our brother is still praying, let us go ahead to do such and such.&rdquo; Sometimes I think that this is a good way. If someone should pray without stopping in our prayer meeting, we should say, &ldquo;While our brother is praying, let us all have some fellowship.&rdquo; We do not want any long prayers.</p>
<p>Once a blind man came to the Lord and cried, &ldquo;Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!&rdquo; The Lord said, &ldquo;What do you want Me to do for you?&rdquo; The answer was simple: &ldquo;Lord, that I may receive my sight!&rdquo; (Luke 18:35-43). That is enough. If the Lord asks you today, &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; and you say, &ldquo;Lord, I am thirsty today; I want the Spirit,&rdquo; that is very good. All you need to pray in the prayer meeting is &ldquo;Lord, I want the Spirit! I am so thirsty. I want a drink.&rdquo; Do not say, &ldquo;Lord, You know that I am very thirsty, and because I am thirsty, I need a drink. The drink today is the Spirit, and without the Spirit there is no drink. Only when I have the Spirit can I have the drink.&rdquo; This is preaching prayer. You are praying as if God needs you to preach to Him. When God asks, &ldquo;What do you need?&rdquo; you should say, &ldquo;Lord, we need a revival! We are all nearly dead. We want to be alive. We are neither hot nor cold. We want to be hot. Lord, burn us!&rdquo; Do not say, &ldquo;Lord, You know that unless You do the burning, nobody can burn. Even if we try to be burning, we cannot burn. Only You can burn. If You do not burn us, what can we do? For this we come to beseech You.&rdquo; Simply say, &ldquo;Lord, burn us at once!&rdquo; Do not preach so much doctrine. The Lord will do the burning.</p>
<p>When we were in Shanghai we had a slogan which had been developed through the years. Some brothers and sisters would come to every meeting, and at every meeting they would pray. Furthermore, every prayer they prayed was long. We tried for some time to find a way to help these saints. Eventually, we found the way from Moody&rsquo;s story. We do not need to pray for so many things. God knows that we lack clothing or food. We should seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added unto us. We should especially avoid praying for big houses or fancy cars. We should say, &ldquo;Lord, I am not burning today. Burn me!&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Lord, I am half dead now. Make me alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you sense that there is a lack of air in a particular room, open the windows. Once you open the windows, the air will come in. Although you cannot see the air, you can feel it. Likewise, when you wake up in the morning, simply open up the window of your being to the Lord and say, &ldquo;Lord, I am open to You. Breathe on me. Lord, I want You to fill me. I want to walk this day according to the Spirit.&rdquo; If you would pray this way for a few sentences, you will feel that the Spirit is moving in you. Brothers and sisters, if you have breathed deeply, how can you not feel anything? Surely you will feel refreshed. The Lord Jesus Christ today is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). This is why the Bible says, &ldquo;Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved&rdquo; (Rom. 10:13). Try it! You will receive the Spirit. You need to believe the words of the Bible, and you need to claim them by living prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Pray according to the Words of the Bible</h2>
<p>Then you must pray according to the words of the Bible. The more you do this, the better it is. You should do this ten times, even twenty times, a day. You need to spend time on this, the more the better. Our prayer to the Lord is our breathing of the Lord. Spend five minutes before the Lord to breathe and pray, and you will feel like a tire having air pumped into it at a gas station. You will be filled with the spiritual <em>pneuma.</em> The Spirit in you will become your inward constituent, and in this Spirit Christ comes and is added into your being. In other words, the reality of the Spirit is Christ. Hence, Christ today is the pneumatic Christ. This Spirit will fill you from within, and the elements of Christ will be constituted into your being. You will no longer be a natural man. Rather, you will be a man of Christ. You will be one who is constituted with Christ. Only then will you be a living member of the Body of Christ, and only then will you be a part of Christ as His member.</p>
<p>For this reason, 1 Corinthians 12:12 says, &ldquo;Even as...all the members of the body being many are one body, so also is Christ.&rdquo; We must be constituted with the elements of Christ, so that we may become the members of Christ. The elements of Christ are constituted into us by the Spirit. How do we receive this Spirit? To receive this Spirit we need to believe the words of the Bible, and every day we need to come before the Lord to open up to Him. You need to open up yourself like opening up a window. Let the Spirit come in; then breathe Him in by prayer. The more you pray the more you will be filled.</p>
<p>Verse 3 of <em>Hymns,</em> #841 says:</p>
<p class="hbody">Thy anointing Spirit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me shall permeate,<br />
All my soul and spirit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wouldst saturate...</p>
<p>When this pneumatic Christ operates in you, He will move into your mind, into your emotion, and into your will. When He moves, and if you would give ground to His moving, He will permeate your whole being with His elements, and you will be transformed into His image, full of His stature. This is like taking food into you. After a few hours of softening up by water and digestion by the stomach, the food will permeate into your cells and blood stream. After the completion of this process, the food will become your constituent. This is our need today. I hope that all of you will exercise yourself in this way, so that you will be full of the Spirit and full of Christ within. In this way our lives will be filled with the Spirit and with Christ, and whether we go to the small group meeting or to other meetings, we will go with the supply. In fact, we will all become a supply to others. This is my burden in this message. May the Lord be merciful to us.</p><h1 class="msg">NOTES FROM MESSAGE FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">A LIVING OF MEETING<br />
IN THE SPIRIT AND BY CHRIST</h1>
<p>Scripture Reading: Matt. 18:20; 1 Cor. 12:7-8; 14:26</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRISTIAN MEETING<br />
BEING A KIND OF LIVING</h2>
<p>In this message we shall see a living in which we meet in the Spirit and by Christ. Our meeting together is a kind of living. To go to work is not a living, and to run a factory is not a living, because these things only bring in frustration, trouble, bondage, and pressure. For you young people, neither is going to school a living. What then is a living? A living is something which brings enjoyment. According to the principle in God&rsquo;s creation, the human living should be a kind of enjoyment. No one would ever say that eating and drinking are a frustration, because eating and drinking are an enjoyment. The Christian meeting should be a kind of living. As such it is an enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SINGING AND SPEAKING TO ONE ANOTHER<br />
WITH PSALMS IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>The Christian meeting is not a so-called worship service. The Bible does not teach us to come together to have worship services. First Corinthians 14:26 does not say that when you come together you are attending a worship service. It says, &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm.&rdquo; We saw during the last two weeks that psalms are not just for singing; they are also for speaking to one another. This kind of speaking is not a common or light way of speaking; it is a speaking by being filled in spirit, in which everyone speaks to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs (Eph. 5:19).</p>
<p>Furthermore, Colossians 3:16 says, &ldquo;...teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.&rdquo; Here we see a teaching with psalms. Not only should we sing to one another in psalms, but we should also speak and even teach one another with psalms. Whenever we come together, everyone should have a psalm to sing, speak, and even teach one another. Thank the Lord that He has given us this hymnal. Some have told me that to sing one of the hymns in this book is better than to listen to a message. For example, <em>Hymns,</em> #863 was first written by me in English. Later, during one of my trips to the Far East I translated it into Chinese. I am not boasting. This hymn is too good. Let us try now to speak to one another with this hymn. I will speak to you all the first line. Then all of you will speak back to me the second line. Let me start first:</p>
<p class="hbody">In daily walk and in our meetings too,<br />
Christ is the center, Christ is everything;<br />
&rsquo;Tis not for form nor doctrine good and true,<br />
But &rsquo;tis for Christ alone we&rsquo;re gathering.</p>
<p class="hbody">Christ is the way and Christ the light of life,<br />
In Him we walk and by Him we are led;<br />
Christ is the living water and the food;<br />
Of Him we drink and we with Him are fed.</p>
<p class="hbody">Christ is the truth, &rsquo;tis Him we testify,<br />
Christ is the life, &rsquo;tis Him we minister;<br />
Christ is the Lord, &rsquo;tis Him we magnify,<br />
Christ is the Head, and we exalt Him here.</p>
<p class="hbody">Christ is the All in all to God and man&mdash;<br />
With Him both we and God are satisfied;<br />
Christ, the reality within the church&mdash;<br />
By Him are life and numbers multiplied.</p>
<p class="hbody">By all the hymns and prayers we offer here,<br />
Christ the reality we would express;<br />
All the activities in fellowship&mdash;<br />
Christ thus in operation manifest.</p>
<p class="hbody">&rsquo;Tis in His Name we meet, in Spirit act,<br />
With nothing in our mind to formalize;<br />
&rsquo;Tis by His pow&rsquo;r we pray, in unction praise,<br />
And with Himself in spirit exercise.</p>
<p class="hbody">All things forgetting, cleaving unto Christ,<br />
Applying Him until maturity;<br />
Let us count everything but loss for Him,<br />
For Him, our All in all, eternally.</p>
<p>In the small group meetings, sometimes we can select a hymn to read or to speak to one another. This will make a good message. For example, you can use the above hymn to proclaim, &ldquo;Brothers and sisters, in daily walk or in the meetings, Christ should be the center, and He should also be the content. We are not meeting here for forms or doctrines, but for Christ alone. He is the center of our meeting, and He is the content of our getting together.&rdquo; This will become an enlightening message. We should all learn to take the lead in speaking in the meetings. This speaking is not a kind of teaching; it is a mutual enjoyment with others. Never forget that the meetings are a living.</p>
<p>According to the order in God&rsquo;s creation, every man needs to sleep six to eight hours a day. In addition to this he must work or go to school. This is God&rsquo;s arrangement. Do not think that when I say working and running a factory are frustrating that I am urging you not to do anything. If you do not do anything, how are you going to eat? You may say, &ldquo;The Lord is taking care of my food.&rdquo; No doubt the Lord is taking care of your food, but not in the way you think.</p>
<p>Let me share with you a testimony of my own. In 1943 I was imprisoned by the Japanese Imperial Army in Chefoo for 30 days. During that time, they used all kinds of methods to try me twice a day. After three weeks of interrogation, they realized that I was genuinely a preacher. They considered me a fool, a lunatic for God. One day they attempted to trap me. I knew that the trial was coming to a conclusion. They summoned me before them in the morning, and placed before me a Bible which I gave to them the day I was put into prison. They began by saying, &ldquo;We reckon that you don&rsquo;t know anything except God. To you God is everything, whether this or that. I want to ask you a question today. Which is more important, God or the country?&rdquo; The &ldquo;country&rdquo; he was referring to was the Japanese-controlled puppet government of north China. I fully realized the meaning of his question. So I kept my mouth shut. The more he forced me to speak, the more I shut my mouth. Finally, when he insisted on an answer I said, &ldquo;I am afraid that you will be angry if I give you my answer.&rdquo; He pressed me further and assured me, &ldquo;Speak up. I will not be angry.&rdquo; To that I replied, &ldquo;God is more important.&rdquo; He exclaimed in a mocking way, &ldquo;Very well, then. God is more important. Go back then to your cell. We will let God take care of you!&rdquo; When I perceived that his tone had calmed down a bit, I began to preach to him saying, &ldquo;It is true that God is more important. And it is true that God takes care of us. But God has a way to care for us. He created the earth, and He made fertile lands for cultivation. But there is still the need for man to plow and sow before there can be a harvest. Even after the harvest, there is still the need for reaping, selling, and buying. You may say that all these are human labor. But without God&rsquo;s creation of the earth, and without Him supplying the sunshine, the rain, the wind, and the air, the crop cannot grow. So, you see, everything still depends on God. God is the One who supplies our food; He does take care of us that way.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Fine. You do not know anything except God. We will let God feed you tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was put in the same cell as a Greek young man. He was a Greek Orthodox Christian, and spoke a little English. We began to fellowship with each other. When he found out that I was suffering for the name of Christ, he began to respect me very much. When the guards walked past us, we broke our conversation and were quiet. But once they walked away, we continued with our fellowship. In the prison the Chinese prisoners were apportioned hard dough, while this Greek brother was given white bread and milk. That evening when the guard came around to pass the bread and milk to that young man, he smiled at me and pointed his fingers upward, saying, &ldquo;Yours, there.&rdquo; He left without any food for me. The Greek man wondered. He said, &ldquo;What is happening? Are they not going to give you food today?&rdquo; I told him what had happened that day during the trial. He responded by saying, &ldquo;Mr. Lee, I will let you have my share today. You are suffering for Jesus Christ. It is my honor to give up my food for you.&rdquo; I insisted that he keep the food. After pushing the food back and forth between him and me for a while, we agreed that we would share the food together. The next morning the guards took me out of my cell again. The minute they walked in they asked in a mocking way, &ldquo;Did your God feed you last night?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Yes, He did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We can all testify that God takes care of us. But on our part we need to fulfill our duty. We all must work, but work is not our living; it is our laboring. After man fell, God ordained that man must labor and sweat and that woman must undergo the suffering of childbirth.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH MEETINGS BEING THE HIGHEST FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT</h2>
<p>Under God&rsquo;s ordained way, every man needs to sleep, work, and eat. In addition, man needs the proper enjoyment. But when sinners go about seeking for enjoyment, they end up in nightclubs and sinful places. As a result, humanity becomes degraded and people&rsquo;s health is damaged. Their pastimes even force many into bankruptcy.</p>
<p>If you read the Bible carefully you will realize that the proper &ldquo;pastime&rdquo; for man is God. God is our proper pastime, and God is our real entertainment. We do not need to watch TV or go to the ball game. We only need to fellowship with God and to sing to God, and we will be filled with joy and satisfaction. In short, the Christian meeting is the proper entertainment of a proper living.</p>
<p>Our meeting here tonight is a kind of pastime and entertainment. This is our best pastime. The more you pass your time here the healthier, cleaner, and nobler you will be; you will have a higher morality and a more uplifted humanity. There is no entertainment that can match the Christian meetings. Sometimes I have heard parents say that they dare not let their children come to our meetings, because our meetings exhaust people; we meet every day. A few times I said to the parents, &ldquo;If you do not allow your children to come to the church, where will they go? If you keep them home and look at them every day, even you eventually will be bored by them, not to mention the fact that they will never be bound by you anyway. Surely they will go to the dance halls and associate themselves with bad friends. What would you do then? But now they are coming to the church meetings, and you should feel happy, because the Christian meeting is the best form of entertainment.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH MEETING CAN ATTRACT<br />
AND CHANGE PEOPLE</h2>
<p>Someone once came to me and said, &ldquo;Mr. Lee, you are marvelous. I admire your ability to draw people. In Shanghai you attracted a big crowd to your church. When you went to Taiwan you attracted more people. Now you are in America, and you have even captured the Americans. How did you attract and capture all these people?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I like your word capture. We Christians are those who are captured by Jesus. Isn&rsquo;t this much better than being captured by card games or parties?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I first came to America in the sixties, I saw groups of &ldquo;hippies&rdquo; roaming the streets of Los Angeles. A few came to our meetings and were saved. When they came they all had long hair, long beards, and bare feet. Some even wore red headbands. It was such a strange sight. But, praise the Lord, they were saved one after another. After a few weeks their headbands were gone, and after a few months their hair was cut. After awhile the beards were gone, and they began to wear socks and shoes. They also began to testify in the meetings. When we saw this, our joy was unspeakable. We can never forget those times. Our meetings were full of God and full of entertainment. At that time, half an hour before the meeting time the hall was filled with people. If you came late you could not find a seat. And when everyone came together they began to sing psalms about exhibiting Christ. Once you stepped into the meeting, you could not help but be lifted into the heavenlies. Those were truly meetings of the exhibition of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEETING BEING AN EXPRESSION<br />
OF OUR DAILY LIFE</h2>
<p>The meeting is a kind of enjoyment; it is the proper pastime and entertainment of our lives. We must change our concept. When we come to the meetings, we are not here to do something; we are here to have some entertainment. If our daily lives are filled with joy, our meetings will be the same. During the last few days I have loved to sing a hymn. It is <em>Hymns,</em> #717 in our hymnal:</p>
<p class="hbody">O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,<br />
Though all things around us be trying,<br />
Though floods of affliction like sea billows roar,<br />
It&rsquo;s better to sing than be sighing.</p>
<p class="hbody2">Then rejoice evermore, rejoice evermore,<br />
It is better to sing than be sighing:<br />
It is better to live than be dying;<br />
So let us rejoice evermore.</p>
<p class="hbody">O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,<br />
When the darts of the tempter are flying,<br />
For Satan still dreads, as he oft did of yore,<br />
Our singing much more than our sighing.</p>
<p class="hbody">O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,<br />
When sickness upon us is stealing,<br />
No cordial like gladness our strength can restore,<br />
For joy is the fountain of healing.</p>
<p>When you sing a hymn such as this in the meeting, do you not feel refreshed? And is this not a kind of entertainment? Our meeting is not a work; it is an expression of our daily life. It is because we live this way all day long that we come and express ourselves in such a way in the meetings. This is not a performance nor a theatrical play. This is our living.</p>
<p>If possible we should meet every day. This is quite scriptural. When the church first came into being, the disciples met daily in one accord in the temple and from house to house (Acts 2:46). Sometimes, to meet every day seems to pose some difficulties. To allow for that, we leave at least three evenings a week when there is no meeting. The other evenings we meet together to have some spiritual pastime and entertainment. This entertainment is not apart from God. It is an entertainment in God, and it is an entertainment in the church. We must have this concept, because once you have this concept, you will not go with the attitude of attending worship services. To attend a worship service is to have one man speaking while everyone listens. The result is the hierarchy of a clergy-laity system. This kills the Body of Christ. This form of worship service is absolutely wrong.</p><h2 class="head1">EVERYONE SPEAKING IN THE MEETING</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 14:26 says, &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.&rdquo; Psalms are for singing, and teachings are for speaking. The proper way to meet is not in the way of Christianity where one speaks and all listen. It is in the way of every saint speaking. Each has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, and even has an interpretation. Each one of these five items involves speaking. One is even speaking with the words of psalms, that is, with words of praises to God.</p>
<p>Although I am speaking here tonight, I am not satisfied. I hope very much that every one of you sitting here would compete to speak. Moreover, I hope that they would not be long speakings, but would be in the way where I speak a few sentences, you speak a few sentences, and every one stands up and speaks a few sentences. Some may stand up to sing a hymn; another may stand up to read a song. If this is the case, our meeting will become living and enjoyable, and you will see the riches of Christ displayed here. I hope that every one of us would see this.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:7-8 says, &ldquo;But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit. For to one through the Spirit is given a word of wisdom, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit.&rdquo; First we have the word of wisdom, then we have the word of knowledge. Here we see that in a meeting there should not be only one speaker. Rather, all the brothers and sisters should speak. The Spirit is already operating in us; we cannot say that we have nothing. To each one of us is given the manifestation of the Spirit, and we all have a word of wisdom and a word of knowledge to speak.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETING IN THE LORD&rsquo;S NAME AND BY CHRIST</h2>
<p>Matthew 18:20 says, &ldquo;For where two or three are gathered together in My name.&rdquo; The preposition here should not be &ldquo;in,&rdquo; but should be &ldquo;into.&rdquo; We must be gathered together into His name. Every time we meet together we are gathering together into His name. Wherever two or three gather together, we have a small group meeting, and we are told that we must meet into the name of the Lord. In the Bible, especially in the New Testament, the name denotes the person. Hence, to meet into the name of the Lord is to meet into the Person of the Lord. Christ is the center of our meetings. He is also the content of our meetings. We do not gather with any other center or content. Christ is our unique center and content. For this reason when we come together, we have the inner sense that we are gathering together into the Lord.</p>
<p>Many times when we read the Bible or pray at home, we experience a certain measure of enjoyment and sweetness. But this enjoyment is different from that which we enjoy in the meetings. The flavor of our enjoyment at home is not that strong. But when we come to the meeting, the flavor is much stronger. This is because we are gathering together into the Lord. This is what it means to have a living of meeting by Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING IN THE MEETINGS<br />
TO RELEASE OUR SPIRITS</h2>
<p>Today Christ is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). Furthermore, He is living in our spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit,&rdquo; and 2 Timothy 4:22 says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit.&rdquo; Therefore we all must exercise in our speaking to release this spirit. If I come to you today and stand before you silently, no matter how much I look at you, my spirit will not be released. How can I release my spirit? I must open my mouth. As soon as I open my mouth, the spirit comes out. I often say that if one does not know what it is to release his spirit, all he has to do is to lose his temper. If you would say, &ldquo;I just hate you!&rdquo; right away your spirit will be released. When you talk politely with others, your spirit will not come out. But if you shout in your anger, your spirit will be released. Of course that release of the spirit is not the proper kind. But the principle is there, and it is very applicable. When you open your mouth to release one or two sentences in the meeting, your spirit must be released. That means you have to utter something from the depths of your being. You must use your mouth, because your spirit is connected to your mouth. When you speak some words, the words will carry the spirit with them. When you shout in your temper, the spirit of anger will come out through the words of anger.</p>
<p>The Christian meeting is a part of our entertainment in our daily life. Moreover, this meeting is one where we meet into the Lord&rsquo;s name. The Lord is the Spirit; hence, for us to meet into Him is for us to meet into the Spirit. This Spirit is today in our spirit. In order for this Spirit to come out, there is no other way than to open our mouth. Brothers and sisters, if you do not open your mouth, even God has no way. Although you can have a strong wind blowing outside, without opening the windows, there is no way to have any air. Today the Triune God has been incarnated, has died, and has risen from the dead to become the Spirit. This Spirit has been breathed into us (John 20:22), and has also been poured out upon us (Acts 2:1-4; 10:44-46; 1 Cor. 12:13). But there is no response on our side. This is our problem.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BEGINNING OF THE PENTECOSTAL MOVEMENT</h2>
<p>How did the Pentecostal movement come about? From church history we know that the Pentecostal movement did not exist until two centuries ago. At that time in England, no one was allowed to preach in an unsanctified house; the preaching must be done in the sanctuaries, that is, in the church buildings. Moreover, ordinary men could not preach; it had to be done by ordained clergymen. At that time everyone going into the sanctuary must be sober and quiet. They must realize that they were there to worship God. Hence, no one dared to move or to say anything in a rash way. It was not until John Wesley was raised up by the Lord to speak for the Lord that he began to preach on the streets. Once he preached to the coal miners while they were on their way home. By the end of the preaching, the crowd was so touched that they began to weep and cry. Tears were rolling down their cheeks, leaving white streaks on their blackened faces. I saw pictures of this. After another century, Christian worship services in England again became so dead that the Pentecostal movement was started. The Pentecostals would shout and cry, thinking that by so doing they would come alive. In the end three types of people appeared. First, there were the laughers. Then, there were the rollers. Last, there were the jumpers. Fifty years ago, when I first attended a Pentecostal meeting in Shangtung, I saw all these people. Some were jumping, others were rolling, and still others were shouting. No one paid attention even when the pastor went to the platform to speak. Later there was the holy parade; everyone marched excitedly around the meeting hall. By 1932 the Pentecostal movement also came to us. One time in our meeting in Tsinan a co-worker by the name of Yuen began to play act. He was acting like the little donkey which bore Jesus into Jerusalem. Everyone around him shouted &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; Some even took off their coats and laid them on the floor for him to tread upon.</p>
<p>In 1943 I was recuperating from illness in Chefoo. A brother by the name of Chang came from another city to meet with us in the church in Chefoo. He rebuked the church saying, &ldquo;Look, our Brother Lee is bedridden with tuberculosis. How dead you all are!&rdquo; When he said this everyone began to pay attention to the Pentecostal movement and to practice speaking in tongues. One sister named Lee who was a nurse spoke in tongues more frequently and vehemently than all the others. At that time I spent most of my time in bed. The elders came to invite me to attend one of their meetings. Because I was a veteran in this matter, I was thoroughly familiar with the matter of speaking in tongues. I told the elders that I did not need to go because I knew the situation already. By that time I already had had over ten years of experience in this matter. But because of their insistence I later complied. The brothers arranged a cot for me to lie on during the meeting. When the meeting began, that sister Lee knelt down and was getting ready to speak in tongues. But strangely she was not able to utter anything. Right away she said that she would not speak that day.</p>
<p>After this, the winter solstice festival passed, and a sister who loved the Lord very much died of tuberculosis. This sister Lee then told the husband of the deceased sister that he should not prepare any coffin or gravesite. She told that brother Wong not to prepare any funeral, and that his wife would rise at twelve o&rsquo;clock noon the next day. There were over a thousand brothers and sisters in the church in Chefoo. All were shocked by the news. Everyone waited for noon the next day. When the time came, nothing happened. The tongue-speaking sister worked hard on the dead sister to try to resurrect her. But in spite of everything she did, the dead person remained dead; nothing could resurrect her. After about three hours of fruitless effort, an older elder told the husband of the dead woman to go ahead and make preparation for her burial. From that time on, no one in the church in Chefoo would believe anything about tongue-speaking anymore. As a result, the church in Chefoo was rescued.</p>
<p>My point is this: the reason why all these Pentecostal tongue-speaking things came about is because Christianity is too dead. When Christians would not speak in the meetings, Satan would fabricate some false things to stir people up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FALSEHOOD<br />
OF THE PENTECOSTAL TONGUE-SPEAKERS</h2>
<p>I have studied this matter for over fifty years, and I have seen many tongue-speakers both in the Pentecostal movement as well as among us. For a year I even took the lead to help others to speak in tongues. I tried during all these years through much objective study to find out if those tongues were genuine or not. Now I can tell you that the result of my studying gives me definite proof that these people&rsquo;s tongues are not genuine. Acts chapter two tells us that the tongues were dialects; they were languages. Paul in 1 Corinthians 14:26 also tells us that tongues can be interpreted; it is a language that can be interpreted. I have heard Chinese speaking in tongues, and I have also heard Americans speaking in tongues. Their tongues are not like those in the Bible, which can be interpreted. For this reason I know that my judgment is correct. If you are a linguist and you record the tongues of these people and study them thoroughly, you will find out that they consist of at most a few sounds. How can a few sounds constitute a language? For this reason they come up with the explanation that tongues are not necessarily a language; it can be sounds of the tongue only. When they teach you to speak in tongues, they all tell you to roll your jaw and turn your tongue. As a result you get the tongue-sound.</p>
<p>Some find it hard to roll their jaws or turn their tongues. For these it is difficult to speak that kind of tongue. In China, there are people who can imitate all kinds of sounds by their vocal faculties. This is their skill. They can utter something which sounds like English, or Japanese, or Chinese. Sometimes they can imitate the bird&rsquo;s singing. Sometimes they can mimic the sound of a woman walking. For these people, surely you do not need to teach them to speak in tongues; they can all speak in tongues fluently.</p>
<p>Moreover, when the Japanese speak in tongues they speak with a Japanese accent. When the Mexicans speak in tongues they likewise speak with a Mexican accent. The Chinese speak in tongues with a Chinese accent, and the Americans speak in tongues with an American accent.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR PRESENT NEED</h2>
<p>The tongue-speaking of the Pentecostal movement is wrong, but the principle of opening our mouth to speak in the meetings is right. We do not need to use that kind of method to open our mouth in the meeting. We have a spirit within, and we have the word of the Bible for us. We can use our mouth and exercise our spirit to speak forth the words of the Bible. This is so much better than speaking in tongues. Call on the name of the Lord. Pray-read His words. The best way is to open your mouth and speak. But here is our problem: we will not open our mouth to speak in the meetings. This is especially true of the Chinese. We are not used to opening our mouth in public. This is unfortunate. For this reason we often quench the Spirit. If you want to start a fire in the stove, you must give it air above and below. If the opening on top is closed and the door underneath the fire is shut, you can never start the fire. You must first open the vent as well as the door. Then the fire will be started. In the same principle when you open your mouth, the Holy Spirit will burn within you. But if you close your mouth, the Spirit will not move. This is the quenching of the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Christian meetings are to us the amusement in our daily life. Here we amuse ourselves in God. For this reason when we meet together, we must meet in the Spirit and into the Lord&rsquo;s name; that is, we have to meet into the Lord Himself. He is the Spirit abiding in our spirit. For this reason we must release our spirit. In order to release our spirit we must open our mouth to speak. We can speak two or three words about our experience of Christ in our daily life. In every circumstance we need to experience Christ. Enjoy Him in everything, great or small. Take Him as your strength, your wisdom, your support, your comfort, your light, and your guidance. Paul said, &ldquo;I can do all things in Him who empowers me&rdquo; (Phil. 4:13). If we would be like this, then when each one of us comes to the meeting, we will have a few words to say about Christ. This is the exhibition of Christ. In your daily life you live by taking Christ as your life and by experiencing Christ. Then in the meeting you bring your experience, just as the farmers bring in the harvest for an offering. When you present in the meetings the Christ that you experience and speak forth this Christ with your mouth and spirit, you are offering up your harvest and you are exhibiting Christ. In this way your living is one which meets in the Spirit and by Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">NOTES FROM MESSAGE FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">A LIFE OF MEETING BY SPEAKING<br />
BY THE SPIRIT OF FAITH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 4:13; 1 Cor. 12:3, 8, 10; 14:1, 4, 26</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT OF FAITH&mdash;<br />
A MINGLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT <br />
WITH THE HUMAN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The title of this message is &ldquo;A Life of Meeting by Speaking by the Spirit of Faith.&rdquo; Have you ever heard of such a title before? &ldquo;The spirit of faith&rdquo; is a term in 2 Corinthians 4:13 that is very difficult to understand. Because it is so difficult to understand, the Chinese Union Version Bible did not translate it properly. This version rendered the first part of the verse as, &ldquo;But we all have faith.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; is omitted. The proper translation should be, &ldquo;And having the same spirit of faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Recovery Version, there is a footnote for the phrase &ldquo;the spirit of faith.&rdquo; In this footnote, I quoted commentaries from two authorities in the Greek language, Alford and Vincent. Alford said, &ldquo;Not distinctly the Holy Spirit,&mdash;but still not merely a human disposition: the indwelling Holy Spirit penetrates and characterizes the whole renewed man.&rdquo; Vincent&rsquo;s interpretation of Greek words mainly followed that of Alford. His words are, &ldquo;Spirit of faith: not distinctly the Holy Spirit, nor, on the other hand, a human faculty or disposition, but blending both.&rdquo; In the two passages above, due to the lack of light, they both used the term &ldquo;disposition.&rdquo; This term describes the inward conditions of man, including the human spirit. The Bible scholars at that time did not have a thorough understanding of the human spirit. It was not until the beginning of this century that the matter of the human spirit was properly understood. People like Mrs. Jesse Penn-Lewis spoke much about the human spirit. We received much help sixty years ago from them. After further study during the past few decades we became even clearer about the matter of the human spirit.</p>
<p>The spirit of faith mentioned in 2 Corinthians 4:13 is a mingling of the Holy Spirit with our human spirit. We must be like the psalmist who exercised his spirit to believe and to speak the things which he experienced concerning the Lord, especially those things concerning His death and resurrection. From the context of this verse, we know that here Paul was talking about his experience concerning the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection. He said that we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus&rsquo; sake, that the resurrection life of the Lord might be manifested in our mortal flesh. He also said that the death of the Lord operates in us, in order that His resurrection life may be dispensed to others through us (vv. 11-12). Paul spoke all these things in the spirit of faith.</p>
<p>Faith is not in our mind; it is in our spirit, which is mingled with the Holy Spirit. Doubts are in our mind. The &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; here indicates that it is by the mingled spirit that the apostles live a crucified life in resurrection for carrying out their ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />
TO SPEAK BY FAITH</h2>
<p>Some have asked me what it is to release our spirit. Often I would use an illustration. The best way to describe the release of the spirit is to look at a man when he is angry. When a man becomes angry, he cannot help but open his mouth. Once the mouth is opened, the temper is released; the spirit of temper is released through the mouth. In lighting a fire in a stove, if you close the lid on top and lock up the vent underneath, the fire will not burn, but if you open up all the openings the fire will be kindled right away.</p>
<p>Satan knows about this principle much more than we do. In the matter of speaking in the meeting, we have all been made dumb by Satan. We can talk without ceasing at other places, but when we come to the meeting we become silent. We may still be talking when we walk up the stairs to the meeting hall, but once we sit in our seats we become quiet. Who has sealed your mouth? This is all due to the tactics of Satan. Some say that we have to be proper and quiet when we come to worship God, but actually this is the way of degraded Christianity. Unnoticeably we have been deceived by Satan. The Bible tells us, &ldquo;Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled in spirit&rdquo; (Eph. 5:18). To be drunk with wine is to have the body filled with wine, but to be filled in our regenerated spirit is to be filled with Christ and with the Triune God. The filling of the body results in dissipation, but the filling with Christ and with the Triune God results in &ldquo;speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord&rdquo; (Eph. 5:19).</p>
<p>When we come to the meetings, we should neither be as the pastor who does all the speaking, nor should we be the pew members who do not speak at all. Our meeting is a life of meeting by speaking, not with the spirit of temper, but with the spirit of faith. Faith is not in our mind; it is in our spirit. Second Corinthians 5:7 says, &ldquo;We walk by faith, not by appearance.&rdquo; Our walk today is not by the outward circumstances, but by faith. Faith does not depend on the circumstances around us. Hence, to speak by faith is to speak independent of the outward circumstances. Paul was not downtrodden or disappointed when he met with difficulties, but he could still say, &ldquo;Rejoice in the Lord!&rdquo; (Phil. 4:4). Verse one of <em>Hymns,</em> #717 says,</p>
<p class="hbody">O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,<br />
Though all things around us be trying,<br />
Though floods of affliction like sea billows roar,<br />
It&rsquo;s better to sing than be sighing.</p>
<p>These are words of faith. They are not spoken according to circumstances. That is why faith is not in your mind. It is not in your discernment. Faith is in your spirit. In the meetings every one of us, whether a brother or a sister, whether young or old, can all speak by this spirit of faith. We can all speak by the spirit which is inwardly filled by the Triune God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO PRACTICE SPEAKING IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 14:31 says, &ldquo;For you can all prophesy one by one.&rdquo; But when I look at the way you stand up to speak, I am convinced that you all need to practice speaking in the meetings. For a child to learn to speak Chinese, he has to start at the age of one or two. Gradually he will become more proficient and by the age of eight or nine he will become very fluent in the language. When the older Chinese sisters come to America, they have to learn the English language. It is hard for them to pronounce the words, because they have never practiced speaking in English.</p>
<p>To speak in the meetings is absolutely a matter of practice. The reason you cannot speak is because you do not practice speaking. As long as you do not speak you will never be able to speak. Actually, when you converse with others at home, you do have a lot to say. This is especially true with the sisters. When they pick up the phone they can go on indefinitely. They can fellowship, and they can even pray on the telephone, but when they come to the meetings they can neither fellowship nor pray. You say that you come to the meetings to worship God, but if your mouths are shut it is difficult for you to be released to serve God. God wants man to speak. First Corinthians 12:3 says, &ldquo;No one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Therefore, in the meetings you can all say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moreover, we have a hymnal in our hand. Every hymn in this book is a message. You can use it to speak a little. Do not be so legal, waiting silently for the piano to play it through once before singing it. You can speak to one another with the songs. This will make a very good meeting. Some have complained that it is difficult to conduct a small group meeting. At least you can all pick a few hymns to sing together and to speak to each other.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING THE SPIRIT TO MAKE<br />
DECLARATIONS IN FAITH</h2>
<p>In the meetings, whether we are reading the Scripture or speaking about the Lord Jesus, or whether we are proclaiming the hymns to one another, we all have to exercise our spirits. When you exercise your spirit, you are exercising your faith to make declarations in faith. If you would exercise your spirit to declare, &ldquo;Dear brothers and sisters! The Lord Jesus is the Savior of mankind!&rdquo; your spirit will be full of faith. If you just murmur in a limp way, &ldquo;The Lord Jesus is the Savior. I am crucified with Him,&rdquo; there is no spirit and there is no faith. The listeners may ask in their hearts, &ldquo;What are you talking about? How can I be crucified with Christ? He was crucified two thousand years ago. How can I possibly be crucified together with Him?&rdquo; It is only when your spirit comes out that your faith comes out also. Only then will power, light, life, and the gospel come out as well. Only then will your words supply and help others.</p>
<p>Some may say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, this is your profession. You have been in this line for over fifty years. Of course you can speak.&rdquo; They are right, but you have to know that this should be every Christian&rsquo;s profession. We are all witnesses of the Lord. Jesus said in Acts 1:8, &ldquo;But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth.&rdquo; I do not agree with people calling me a preacher; we are all witnesses of the Lord. We can all speak for the Lord, and we should all open our mouths to testify for the Lord.</p>
<p>As witnesses of the Lord, when we open our mouth we have to release our spirit. I am afraid that many people release their spirit only when they lose their temper, but when they speak about the Lord Jesus their spirit is not as strong. Why do we have to pray before we preach the gospel or give a message? Although I am very busy, every time before I come to speak I have to lay aside everything else to pray before the Lord. Our prayer is like inflating the tires of a car; before we take a long journey, we have to inflate the tires at the gas station so that we will not have a flat tire along the way. We Christians are all witnesses of the Lord. We all have to go to the Lord every day to fill ourselves up with air. We all have to learn to speak; this is the burden of this message.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERY SAINT SPEAKING IN EVERY HOME MEETING</h2>
<p>In the meetings we should pay attention to mutual speaking. First Corinthians 14:26 says, &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.&rdquo; Here we see that it is not one or two persons speaking while others listen; rather, it is everyone having a psalm, or a teaching, or a revelation. Everyone can speak.</p>
<p>A brother told me that at the place where he works, he has a colleague who meets in a church with three hundred people. They also discovered that it is not so effective to have one man speaking while the rest listen. As a result, they divide the big meetings into many small groups with every small group having a leader. This practice is not according to the example set forth in the Bible. This is just to transfer the method employed in the big meetings to the small meetings. It is still one man speaking. Originally you have three hundred people listening to one person. Now you have ten small groups. What you have is thirty people listening to one man. The principle is still the same. But the Bible says that when we come together each one has a psalm, a revelation, a teaching and so forth. In other words, everyone can speak.</p>
<p>A strong country and a healthy society depend not so much on the masses or the communities as on strong individual families. If in a family only the mother does everything, while everyone else does nothing, when the mother gets sick, then the whole family will be in trouble. They can only go out to eat hamburgers or hot dogs. The meetings that the Bible talks about are house-to-house meetings. In these meetings everyone speaks, and everyone can cook.</p>
<p>For this reason we must build up meetings in the homes of the Christians. Every home must live a normal life. Every home has to prepare home cooking, and everyone can cook for others. If every home is healthy, then the community will be healthy. If the community is healthy, the country will be strong.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY NOT DEPENDING ON ORGANIZATIONS OR PREACHERS</h2>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Protestantism depends on organization. In addition, they also depend on preachers produced through theological training. Actually, in organization and in the study of theology, the Protestants are much inferior to the Catholics. The organization in the Catholic church is much tighter than that in Protestantism. To some extent, the study of theology is much deeper in Catholicism than in Protestantism. However, although Catholicism has more fine flour, it also has more heresies which are not found in Protestantism. Although Protestantism does not have as much leaven, neither does it have as much fine flour. Both are lacking. Protestantism survives and propagates by organization and by producing preachers. However, in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the local churches cannot depend on organization or seminary students.</p>
<p>Because of the influence of our environment and the background of Christianity, we have never rid ourselves completely of the ways of Christianity. We do not call it organization; we change the term and call it arrangement. We do not use the seminary students; we have a few &ldquo;mouthpieces,&rdquo; a few gifted and eloquent ones. We cannot take this way any longer. We have been doing this for many decades. We cannot go on like this; we have to change. We should no longer pay all our attention to the big meetings where one preaches and everyone else listens. We have to put two thirds of our effort on the small groups. The big meetings should take up only one third of our effort.</p>
<p>I do not expect that your home meetings will be a success right away. If you fail, try again. I expect that I will need to spend two to three years to turn around the situation among the churches. Once the small groups are built up, we will experience the blessing. This is a slow work; it cannot be accomplished by us merely having a so-called experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The Pentecostal movement with its tongue-speaking and miracles is like a tide; it comes and goes away. It can never build up the church. Paul&rsquo;s work was not a tide. It continued on, because his work was built upon life and truth. Today we will not depend on Pentecostalism, nor tongue-speaking, nor any big meetings. We can use the big meetings, but we cannot depend on them. We can use the big meetings to gather in the people; but those who are gathered in have to be brought into the small groups. In the small group meetings we are determined not to have any leaders; everyone is a leader, and everyone will speak. Although this is difficult, we have to strive for it. Otherwise, we will be degraded and become merely another part of Christianity. If we want to preserve the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we have to build up the small groups.</p>
<p>I hope that the young people would realize today&rsquo;s situation. And I hope that the older ones would see the need of today. As to the middle-aged ones, you have to rise up to be the core members. You have to put the burden on your shoulders, and you have to take the lead to pursue a life of living in the spirit. In order that our home meetings be strong, living, and fresh, we all have to strive to grow in life, to be filled in the spirit constantly, and to seek after the truth, so that we can be an expression of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE CAN PROPHESY</h2>
<p>In order for a man to grow in life, to be able to exercise his spirit, and be equipped with truth for his expression and utterance, he needs to open his mouth to speak. Everyone has to learn to speak in the meetings. Even if you cannot speak, you have to learn to speak. We must practice speaking. You may feel that you do not know how to speak, but if you open your mouth you will know how to speak. Many can testify that if you do not speak in a particular meeting, you will go home with little supply. But in the meeting if you open your mouth a little bit, you will get some supply. The more you open your mouth, the more you will enjoy the meetings, and the more you will get the benefit. The more you speak, the more you can speak; the more you speak, the more you have things to speak about. In the meetings we have to speak by the spirit of faith. We have to speak in the Spirit. The minute you open your mouth, your spirit will come out. This is to speak in the Spirit. In this speaking, faith comes out, and there will be much content and power in your speaking.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:8 shows us that the first manifestation of the Holy Spirit in a believer is a word of wisdom. The second manifestation is a word of knowledge. Then there are those who can prophesy (v. 10). It does not mean that they prophesy in the sense of foretelling, but in the sense of speaking for and speaking forth God. For this reason Paul said, &ldquo;Desire earnestly...that you may prophesy&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:1). Again he said, &ldquo;For you can all prophesy one by one&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:31). Why? Because &ldquo;he who prophesies builds up the church&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:4). After this, Paul goes on to show us that whenever we come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, or has an interpretation, and that all these should be done for the building up (1 Cor. 14:26). The revelation mentioned here is similar to the word of wisdom mentioned in 12:8, and the teaching mentioned here is similar to the word of knowledge.</p>
<p>After you read through all these verses you will see that our meeting is nothing but speaking. If you take away speaking from the meeting, there would not be much left; the meeting will be void of content. It is a pity that we have been so deeply influenced by traditional Christianity. Whenever we come together, everyone is silent. We all wait for one or two to speak. This is wrong; we must change this concept.</p>
<p>Today the Spirit is like the air; He is blowing everywhere. But if you close up the window, the wind can never come in, and you can never get any air. You have to believe that today the Spirit of the Lord in us is like the air; He is also upon us like the wind. The problem is that we would not open our mouth. From my youth, after I was saved I knew that as a Christian I had to open my mouth to testify and speak for the Lord, but I was not used to speaking. Whenever I spoke I would blush. Because of this, I decided to exercise myself. I went often to the seaside and spoke to the waves. I hope that you would all practice to speak in the same way. When you speak, do it by the spirit of faith, and learn to exercise your spirit to push the words out.</p><h2 class="head1">SPEAKING IN THE MEETING<br />
CONCERNING OUR EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Our speaking in the meetings should avoid the tone of preaching. We have to learn to speak forth our experience of Christ by our spirit in a simple way. This is most helpful in the small group meetings. A lot of times when you stand up to speak there is no spirit, and there is no faith. As a result there is no content, and there is no power. The reason is that you have not practiced enough. First, we have to learn to open our mouth. Whether we speak well or not is another thing. This is like learning English; if you do not speak, you will never learn. Even if you are wrong, you should still speak. If you speak often enough, you will not be wrong any longer. You will be familiar with the language, and you will find out the secret of speaking the language. Then you have to learn to push your words out by the spirit. This kind of speaking is surely with faith; it will surely be full of power and content.</p>
<p>For many of us, our difficulty is first that we do not speak. Second, when we do speak, our spirit does not come out. Third, the content of our speaking is mostly in the tone of preaching. We have to speak, and our spirit has to come out, and there should not be the tone of preaching. Especially in the small meetings, doctrines do not help others that much. The best thing to do is to speak the factual experiences of Christ.</p>
<p>For example, in the context of 2 Corinthians 4:13, we do not see any preaching in Paul&rsquo;s words. He was giving his own testimony. Verse 10 says, &ldquo;Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body.&rdquo; Then he continued, &ldquo;For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus&rsquo; sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh. So then death operates in us, but life in you.&rdquo; All these words are Paul&rsquo;s testimony of his experience of the death of Christ and the life of Christ. Then in verse 13 he said, &ldquo;And having the same spirit of faith...therefore also we speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have to learn to open our mouth, and we have to push out our spirit. Furthermore, we should avoid the tone of preaching. We should only speak of our experience. I do not believe that we who trust in the Lord and love Him can have no experience of Him. What makes me experience the Lord the most in my daily life is when others speak things different from my speaking. At such times I am unhappy. Likewise, when others do not act according to my way, I also get bothered. These things happen frequently. They are all good experiences. If we would learn to live Christ in our daily lives, we will not be bothered when others speak things contrary to our will and act contrary to our desire. It is not a matter of cultivating a certain kind of behavior; it is a matter of who is living in you. If you are living in yourself, you will talk about cultivating a certain attitude or behavior. You will not give others a bad face, and you will not rebuke others. Most Christians are like this; but this is not living Christ. A person who lives Christ has Christ living in him. He is not influenced if others speak things suitable to his taste, and he is not bothered if others speak things contrary to his will. I hope that you will give this kind of testimony. Do not preach doctrines. What happened to your spirit today while you were putting on your shoes? What happened to your spirit when you went to the barber? What happened to you when you were negotiating with others? There should be a lot of testimonies of this kind. If you do not have this kind of testimony, you are merely a Christian who comes to meetings; you are not one who lives Christ and experiences Him in your daily life.</p>
<p>I would like to tell you that although I have a lot of burdens for prayer, when I wake up every morning I set aside all these burdens. I pray only one quiet prayer to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, thank You for giving me another day to live You. Lord, grant me the grace to live in the spirit and to live You today.&rdquo; This prayer helps me every day to realize that I am not living according to the spirit and am not living Christ in many things. Before the Lord I would confess my sins and ask for forgiveness. Actually, in my daily life, most of the time there is only Sister Lee with me alone. Sometimes others would come and visit a little. However, many times I feel that I am not living Christ in this or that way, and I am not walking according to spirit in many things. We all need this kind of practice. We should experience what the Bible says, that &ldquo;it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20), so that we can all walk according to the spirit.</p>
<p>I hope that you would all take these words to heart, and bring them to the Lord in prayer. Make them your daily exercise. You have to pray sincerely, asking and telling the Lord that you really desire to walk according to the spirit in everything, and that you truly desire to live a life that is no longer you, but Christ living in you. When you pray this way, you will see that during the day, maybe only five percent of your living is Christ, but even if you would bring that five percent to the meeting, the meeting would be filled with a lot of testimonies. Everyone should bring a little and everyone can speak a little. This is like the children of Israel in the Old Testament during the feasts; everyone brought his produce and ate, drank, and enjoyed it before God.</p>
<p>This is what is lacking in Christianity. Christians are accustomed to worship services and preaching meetings. This has become their custom and habit. There is not the situation where, when everyone gathers together, each one testifies of his personal experience of the Lord in his daily life. In the small group meetings we do not need preaching; everyone can testify of his daily experience of the Lord. We can also use the hymns to read and speak to each other. In this way, the small group meetings will become rich and living. I hope that all of you can take in this word.</p>
<p>A concluding prayer: Lord, we really need Your mercy. We know that You are doing something here to change the age. Lord, may You break forth from among us. We all want to be those who love You. We do not want to hinder You here. Lord, kindle our love for You from deep within. Deepen our desire for You. Grant us a deeper thirst, so that we would not be satisfied with the present situation, and that we would not be content with the condition of our church meetings or the home meetings. Lord, be merciful to us all, so that we would all seek after the abundance of life, that we would all be filled in spirit, clear in truth, and exercised in speaking. When we speak, may we be speaking from the spirit of faith, with the spirit going out, and the faith matching. Lord, be merciful to us all. May all of us, family by family, one by one, whether young or old, newly saved or not, exercise in this matter. May You grant us all the blessing. By Thy name we pray, Amen.</p><h1 class="msg">NOTES FROM MESSAGE SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">EVERYONE CAN PROPHESY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Num. 11:29; 1 Cor. 14:1, 31; Col. 3:16; 1 Tim. 2:4</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUR MEETING BEING AN EXHIBITION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In every meeting we have the Bible and the hymnal in our hands. We should not sit in our seats quietly to wait for the meeting to start. Everyone can stand up to declare the Lord&rsquo;s word or to choose a hymn to speak to one another. The Christian meeting is not a worship &ldquo;service&rdquo; where one speaks and all the rest listen. Rather, it is our coming together with an open spirit to speak forth the Christ whom we experience, treasure, and love with the utterance that He gives us. Our speaking in this way is our exhibition of Christ.</p>
<p>Verse one of <em>Hymns,</em> #864 says:</p>
<p class="hbody">Whene&rsquo;er we meet with Christ endued,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surplus of His plenitude<br />
We offer unto God as food,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus exhibit Christ.</p>
<p class="hbody2">Let us exhibit Christ,<br />
Let us exhibit Christ;<br />
We&rsquo;ll bring His surplus to the church<br />
And thus exhibit Christ.</p>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;exhibit Christ&rdquo; is unfamiliar not only to our unbelieving friends, but it is also quite new even to those believers who have been saved for many years. This song was first written in English in 1963. Then in 1966 we translated it into Chinese. After this song was written, everyone liked to sing it. The more I sing this hymn, the more I enjoy it.</p>
<p>The Bible gives us a type in the Old Testament to describe the situation of God&rsquo;s people when they gather together. After the children of Israel entered the land of Canaan, they had to labor and cultivate the land. If they did not do this, there would be no produce. The more they labored, the more they were blessed by God; God sent rain, fresh air, and the proper climate for them to have a rich and abundant harvest. God commanded that three times a year they had to bring the rich produce of their land to offer to God and to satisfy God (Deut. 16:16). There at the feast everyone enjoyed all the riches together with God.</p>
<p>We have all received the all-inclusive Christ as the good land (Col. 1:12). It is a land flowing with milk and honey. In our daily life we should experience this rich Christ all the time. When we come together we should present this Christ whom we have experienced and offer Him to God to be His food. Then we can all enjoy this Christ together as our enjoyment. If you were to enter into Jerusalem during one of the feasts of the children of Israel, you would have seen the temple surrounded by all kinds of produce of the good land. This is truly an exhibition. It is an exhibition before God of all the produce that the children of Israel harvested.</p>
<p>The way of meeting as revealed in the Bible is not like today&rsquo;s Christian worship services. The way of worship services in Christianity is completely natural and religious. It is a product of habits and traditions. As it takes doctors to handle sickness, and lawyers to handle legal disputes, so some assume that it takes pastors to handle Christian worship. They consider preaching to be the job of the pastors; the rest have nothing to do but listen. The Lord&rsquo;s way for us is not like this. He wants us to gather together to exhibit Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING GATHERED TOGETHER INTO THE LORD&rsquo;S NAME</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;For where two or three are gathered together in (lit. into) My name, there I am in their midst&rdquo; (Matt. 18:20). The preposition here is &ldquo;into.&rdquo; We are not merely meeting in the Lord&rsquo;s name, but we are gathered together into His name. Every time we meet together we are gathered into His name.</p>
<p>A name denotes a person. The name of Jesus denotes the Person of Jesus. When we are gathered together into the Lord&rsquo;s name, we are actually gathered together into the Lord Himself. The meaning here is very deep. To have two or three gathered together into the Lord means that they are led out of themselves to gather into the Lord. Only when we have such a meeting will the Lord be among us. For example, if two or three are gathered together, yet they all remain in themselves&mdash;one disliking another, one being unhappy with another, no one paying any attention to the Lord Jesus, but everyone arguing among themselves&mdash;how can the Lord be among them under such circumstances? Although two persons may dislike each other very much, when they come together they may not express this outwardly, but instead they may try to put up a front. They may even do this in their prayers. Such a meeting can never have the Lord&rsquo;s presence, because neither of the two have come out of themselves.</p>
<p>Whenever we come out of ourselves and into the Lord Jesus, we will be filled with psalms, songs, and praises from within. Under such a circumstance, when we come together, of course the Lord will be among us. As we open our mouths Christ will be exhibited. Today the Lord Jesus is the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17), and the Spirit is in the Word (John 6:63). The Lord Jesus is the Word (John 1:14), and the Lord Jesus is also the Spirit. He is life, He is the real Lord, and He is the real God (John 14:6; 20:28). Furthermore, all these items are in the Word. If you do not speak the Word, the Spirit will not come out, and the Lord cannot be released. To speak in the Spirit is to express the Lord, and this expression is the exhibition of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD DESIRING<br />
THAT ALL HIS PEOPLE WOULD PROPHESY</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament Moses led about two million Israelites out of Egypt into the wilderness (Exo. 12:37-38). Due to the heavy burden of daily affairs, Moses began to complain a little (Num. 11:10-15). God then charged Moses to gather together seventy elders to the Tabernacle. When the elders were gathered together, the Spirit of Jehovah descended upon them, and they all prophesied (vv. 16-17, 24-25). However, two of the seventy elders remained in the camp; they did not go to the Tabernacle of Jehovah. Nevertheless, the Spirit of Jehovah also rested upon them, and they also prophesied in the camp. When a young man saw this, he came and told Moses. After Joshua, the helper of Moses, heard this, he said, &ldquo;My lord Moses, forbid them&rdquo; (v. 28). But Moses said to him, &ldquo;Enviest thou for my sake? Would God that all the Lord&rsquo;s people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them&rdquo; (v. 29). Moses seemed to say, &ldquo;Even you, Joshua, should prophesy. Would God that every one of God&rsquo;s people would prophesy in that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words of Moses reveal the desire of God. God desires that every one of His people would prophesy. This is similar to what Paul said in 1 Corinthians 14:31, &ldquo;For you can all prophesy one by one.&rdquo; Again, in 1 Corinthians 14:1 he said, &ldquo;Desire earnestly...that you may prophesy.&rdquo; These words of Moses and Paul reveal to us the mind of God. God desires that all of us who believe in Him would prophesy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE TRUTH TO PROPHESY</h2>
<p>When we prophesy, we do not speak ordinary words. Rather, we speak for and speak forth the Lord. Christ is a mystery. No one can understand Him, and no one has ever seen Him. But if you have experienced Christ, He will become a fact and a reality in you. In this way you can speak Him forth.</p>
<p>First Timothy 2:4 says that God &ldquo;desires all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s intention is not only that all men be saved, but that they would all come to a full knowledge of the truth. Many Christians have a wrong concept in that they think that only the preachers need to know the truth. According to their concept, ordinary people who are not pastors do not need to know the truth. But God&rsquo;s desire is not only that all men be saved, but that they would come to a full knowledge of the truth. His desire is that all men would not merely know the truth, but come to a full knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p>Every regenerated believer has a desire to please the Lord. But we cannot please Him merely by being saved. We must strive to go on to have a full knowledge of the truth. Only then will God&rsquo;s desire be met. Actually, if we do not know the truth, we have nothing to prophesy for the Lord.</p>
<p>Recently I have heard the same words from two or three different sources. I was told, &ldquo;Brother Lee, for all these years we have been listening to your ministry. Every year we attend two big trainings for ten days, each covering thirty messages. We have been doing this for over ten years, but we still do not feel that we know very much of the truth. However, one day when we were put in a situation that required us to open our mouth, we realized that the more we spoke, the more there was in our spirit. Only then did we realize that over the past ten years so many truths have been deposited into us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you do not open your mouth, you do not know how much deposit there is in you. But if you do have some deposit, then once you open your mouth, you will not be able to stop. The sad thing is that many of our brothers and sisters, especially the Chinese among us, would never open their mouths. The Chinese are naturally conservative; they do not like to make a show of themselves. From our youth we were taught by the older generation not to open our mouth lightly. We were told that all troubles come out from the mouth. We were taught, &ldquo;More speaking, more mistakes; less speaking, less mistakes; no speaking, no mistakes.&rdquo; This has become our social norm and habit. We may have a lot to say in private, but when we come to the meetings, we become completely silent. We were influenced from our youth by this kind of teaching. Because of this, it is very difficult for us to speak in the meetings. However, do not think that this is your quietness, politeness, or decency. This is the subtlety of Satan. He is using these things to shut your mouth, so that you will not speak forth for the Lord.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the Spirit of Jehovah had to fall upon men before they could prophesy. But in the New Testament, we do not need to wait for the Spirit of God to come down upon us. This is because on the day of Pentecost, and later in the house of Cornelius, the Lord once for all poured out Himself as the all-inclusive Spirit upon His Body, which includes all those who believe in Him throughout the ages (Acts 2:1-4; 10:44-47; 1 Cor. 12:13). Today this all-inclusive Spirit is already upon us. I truly believe that as I am speaking to you the Spirit of the Lord is upon me. I also believe that the Spirit of the Lord is not only upon me, but also in me.</p>
<p>We all need to claim the word of the Lord by faith. Since the Lord has said that His Spirit is poured out upon us, we should simply believe. This is the same as the Lord saying that He has died for us. To that we say &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; He does not need to be crucified for us again. He has already been crucified and has already accomplished redemption. This is a fact that has been accomplished once for all. All we need to do is simply to believe, and we will come into the enjoyment of this fact.</p>
<p>The Bible also says that the Lord has already risen and ascended. To this we say &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; Again, the Bible says that we are seated with Him in the heavenlies (Eph. 2:6). To this we also say &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; Then the Bible says that the Lord Jesus has breathed the Spirit of life as air into His believers (John 20:22). To that we say &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; Moreover, the Bible says that after the Lord Jesus ascended to heaven, He poured out the Spirit of power upon His believers. To that we say &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus has died for us, He has risen and ascended, and His Spirit is within us as well as upon us. Today we do not need to seek after these spiritual facts. All we need to do is to seek after the experience of these facts. The best way to experience all these riches is to speak forth all these facts by the spirit of faith (2 Cor. 4:13).</p><h2 class="head1">PRACTICE AND PREPARATION NEEDED<br />
TO SPEAK BY THE SPIRIT OF FAITH</h2>
<p>The more we speak by the spirit of faith, the more we will experience the Lord as our riches. However, some have stood up to speak with no spirit and no faith. The reason for this is that they are not well-prepared; they have not prayed properly. To do anything we need to be well-prepared. We cannot take the excuse that we are busy, and thus overlook our preparation.</p>
<p>The Spirit of the Lord is in us as well as upon us, but we still need prayer and the proper preparation. If a man has been occupied the entire day, and he comes home and becomes involved in an argument with his wife, there is no way for him to come to the meeting and speak by the spirit of faith. If he speaks, there will be no spirit, and there will be no faith. Before the meeting starts he must confess his sins immediately and ask for the Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness. He must take the cleansing of the blood. But even after the blood has cleansed him, the Devil will still bother him by reminding him of his failures. When the brothers and sisters come to the meetings, many are ill-prepared; therefore, when they speak there is no spirit, and there is no faith.</p>
<p>It takes preparation and practice to speak in the meetings with spirit and with faith. Before every meeting you have to pray before the Lord. For myself, before every meeting, especially those in which I have to speak, I must pray. Without prayer, I cannot be well-prepared. If you come to the meeting without praying, Satan will accuse you of many things. He will expose all your shortcomings. For this reason you must pray thoroughly, first to chase out all the demons and to deal with all the condemnations, so that you will have the peace and confidence within. In this way your speaking will be with spirit and with faith.</p>
<p>Faith is not in our mind; it is in our spirit. If we have faith, we have the spirit. When our spirits are released, the Holy Spirit, who is mingled with our spirit, is also released. This is the spirit of faith spoken of in 2 Corinthians 4:13. We all need to learn to speak by the spirit of faith. To speak in this way is to prophesy. To prophesy is not to preach; it is to speak for God and to speak forth God.</p>
<p>Whenever we come to a meeting, we must prophesy. Every brother and sister must learn to open his mouth. Otherwise, there is no way to go on in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The only remaining alternative is for one capable one to speak, and everyone else to listen. If this is the case, immediately we fall back into Christianity to become a part of its degradation.</p>
<p>The Bible shows us that whenever we come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, or has a revelation (1 Cor. 14:26). It is not that one man speaks and all the others listen. Rather, it is that all speak and all listen. Colossians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.&rdquo; We can teach and admonish one another with hymns. You can speak to me, and I can sing to you. The second part of this verse says that we teach and admonish one another in psalms, while the first part of this verse says that we should let the word of Christ dwell in us richly. Is it the word or is it the psalms? It is difficult to say. If a man has been speaking the words of the Lord for a number of years, the words to him will almost become a psalm. This is my experience. Not long after I was saved, I became very zealous to preach the gospel. I wrote my own tracts. The title of one tract was &ldquo;The Wonderful Way to the Salvation of Our Soul.&rdquo; That was all that I could speak at that time. But through all these years I have been constantly speaking. Today, when I open my mouth to speak for the Lord, the words are almost like psalms and songs.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I listen to your speaking, either your subject is wrong or your verbs are wrong. Your speaking is not proper, much less like a psalm. The reason for this is that you have not been exercising. Your speaking is like gossiping. However, you cannot speak the word of the Lord in the same way that you would engage in idle talk. You need to practice in everything&mdash;what is the subject; what is the verb; what phrase goes first; and what phrase should come next? All this requires exercise. I am not trying to give you a hard time. The word of the Lord says plainly, &ldquo;Desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:1).</p>
<p>Very few of us who are saved have been helped in this way. Many have been saved for decades, but today they still cannot speak in the meetings. When a child is born, he begins to receive education step by step. From elementary school he graduates into high school. From high school he graduates into college, and from there he enters into graduate school. At the end of his graduate study, he may receive his doctorate. He may be only twenty-six years old when he receives his Ph.D. degree. There is no waste of time. But if he spends his years in a loose way without receiving a proper education and without going through formal training, he will still speak broken English by the time he is thirty years old.</p>
<p>This is the situation with many Christians today. They are busy with many things every day. When Sunday comes they breathe a sigh of relief and go to attend Sunday worship. Their going to the church is for relaxation. Everyone has been busy for five days. When Sunday comes, there is no need to be busy anymore. Everyone goes to the church to let the pastor do the busy work, since on Monday everyone will have to go to work, and the pastor will have his holiday anyway. So everyone sits in his pew, looks around, listens to the choir singing, and is content. This is degraded Christianity. We cannot take this way. Today we are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We must receive the Lord&rsquo;s grace. The more we receive grace, the more grace will abound in us. First Corinthians 14:1 says that we should desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that we may prophesy; verse 31 of 1 Corinthians 14 says that we can all prophesy one by one; and Colossians 3:16 tells us to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in our hearts to God. We cannot do any of these things. For these things we need much grace.</p>
<p>Because we do not have this kind of exercise or teaching, I am burdened to have more fellowship with you concerning this matter. If we do not do this, we will become nominal Christians. We will come to the worship service when the time comes. Others will call the hymns for us, others will play the songs, others will sing, and others will speak. And when the speaking is over, everyone will go home. We may have a pleasant time that way, but the Lord will not have a pleasant time. He will have no way, and His word will not be realized.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD DESIRING THAT ALL MEN BE SAVED<br />
AND COME TO THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>Although I have expounded all twenty-seven books of the New Testament during the past twelve years, and although my exposition has been printed and published in volumes totaling over 10,000 pages, I am afraid that it is difficult to find one in a hundred among us who has come to a full knowledge of these truths. If we have not learned these truths and have no deposit within us, then when the time comes to speak, we will have no words; we will have nothing to say. This deposit was mentioned by Paul in 2 Timothy 1:13-14. There he charged Timothy to hold the pattern of healthy words which Timothy heard from him, and he entreated him to guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>We all know that it is not enough for a young person to receive an education from textbooks alone. Other than the textbooks, he still must read many other books. The more books he reads, the more deposit he will have. If we do not read the Bible every day, we will have no deposit within us. I hope that you would read carefully through the books and Life-study messages that we have published. Read them every day and everywhere. You do not need to spend too long each time in reading them. Just spend five to ten minutes each time. Gradually, you will accumulate a great deal. Any page is good for reading. I am happy when I see that the brothers in Texas have their homes filled with Life-study messages. They have Life-study messages on the coffee table in the living room, on the counter in the kitchen, by the sink, and on the dresser in the bedroom. You can simply pick up any message and receive the supply and the nourishment.</p>
<p>We all desire that the Lord would have a way in His recovery, and we all desire to grow in life and be filled with the Lord within. In order to have this, we must read the Lord&rsquo;s word. We must let the word of Christ dwell in us richly. The word &ldquo;let&rdquo; is very appropriate here. It implies that the Lord is knocking at the door, and that His word is waiting at the door. We need to let the Lord and His word come in.</p>
<p>Everyone who believes in and loves the Lord treasures the word of the Bible. But many times we do not understand it. Either we do not understand the meaning of the words, or we fail to grasp their content. I have put together my experience of over fifty years and expounded in detail every book of the New Testament. My purpose in doing this is to unlock the riches in these books. Now the Bible is here, and the Life-study messages are here. The word of the Lord is waiting outside the door. Let this word of Christ come in and make its home richly in you.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIFE-STUDY MESSAGES FOR THE SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>How can we make the small group meetings rich, strong, fresh, and living? After much investigation, I found out that for many, to use the Bible alone is not sufficient to unlock its riches; there is the need for the Life-study messages to serve as an aid. We treasure the Bible, but the words of the Bible must be opened up before we can receive light from the Bible. The same is true of the food that we eat. For example, wheat must first be ground into powder and kneaded into dough or made into noodles before it can be consumed by us. In the small group meetings, not only do we need to put before others the Bible; we need to put before them the books that explain the Bible in a most simple and clear way. The Life-study messages are not meant to replace the Bible. Rather, they are meant to help people to unlock the Bible, and to supply them with spiritual life and nourishment.</p>
<p>If we love the Lord and His recovery, we should follow His leading. In the present stage, the Lord&rsquo;s leading is the recovery of the small group meetings in the homes. This is the way of meeting that was initiated by the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:46). After many centuries, all the other ways have been proven to be unfruitful. Only meeting in the homes affords the Lord a way. For this reason the Lord is recovering this way of meeting among us.</p>
<p>Every brother and sister who meets with us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery should pursue the way of the small group meetings. You will do this if you love the Lord and His recovery. As we have said in other occasions, &ldquo;The heavens may pass away, and the earth may be removed, but the small group meetings should never be forsaken.&rdquo; Whenever you come to a small group meeting, do not come in a loose way. Rather, prepare yourself. Come with prayer and with the deposit which you have picked up in your daily life. Everyone must come with his loins girded and his mind refreshed. Leave all the oldness and forms behind. Open your mouth, release your spirit, exercise faith, and demonstrate the power. In this way the small group meetings will surely be rich, strong, fresh, living, attractive, and able to support people. May we all strive in this matter, and may we all learn and practice together, so that the Lord may have a way among us.</p><h1 class="msg">NOTES FROM MESSAGE SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRACTICING TO SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 3:16; John 6:63b; Eph. 6:17; 1 Cor. 2:13</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRISTIAN LIFE BEING A LIFE OF SPEAKING<br />
THE WORD OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>It is not easy to speak the word of the Lord. This is because we do not have this concept or practice in our daily life. To speak the word of the Lord is to speak forth something concerning God&rsquo;s mystery, God&rsquo;s will, something concerning His riches and His truth, and especially something concerning Christ. It is rather easy for us to speak ordinary words, but to speak spiritual words, words that speak of Christ and speak forth Christ, requires special practice.</p>
<p>The title of this message is &ldquo;Practicing to Speak the Word of the Lord.&rdquo; To speak the Lord&rsquo;s word does not mean that you recite the words of the Bible verse by verse. Neither does it mean that you quote some Scriptures to support what you are speaking. Rather, it means that when you have some experience of the Lord and some understanding of God, you relate to others your experience and understanding by biblical words and spiritual expressions (1 Cor. 2:13). When you speak, you should not speak as if you are writing a formal composition; rather, you should speak in an ordinary way. This kind of speaking is not easy, but this kind of speaking is the speaking by the word of the Lord.</p>
<p>A proper Christian life that is up to standard is a life of speaking the Lord&rsquo;s word. In other words, if we have been a Christian for many years, but we still cannot speak the Lord&rsquo;s word today, we are not proper and are not qualified. After many years of observation, I have found this to be a fact.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of Christians today. First, there are the pastors, evangelists, and preachers. To put it in a simple way, preaching is their profession. Most of them can go up to the platform and give a sermon, but many of them cannot speak the Lord&rsquo;s word in their daily life. This is like some Chinese scholars in the old days. They might have ranked first in the national examinations, but it is possible that they could not write a letter home. When asked to compose a classical writing, these scholars could easily do that; but when they were asked to write a letter home, many of them could not do it. Today many preachers and pastors can preach on the platform, but when they talk with people in their daily life, they cannot speak the word of the Lord. The main reason is that they are short of experience. They lack the understanding of God and the experience of the Lord.</p>
<p>Another reason for this inability is the lack of prayer. How much a man can speak for the Lord depends on how much experience he has. But even if he has the experience, if there is no prayer, his experience cannot be converted into speaking. It is by prayer that his experience is converted into words. But even if a man has the experience and also has prayed, still he needs to digest the Lord&rsquo;s word and have the word of the Lord constituted into him. Only then can he speak the word of the Lord in his daily life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING AND DRINKING THE LORD<br />
BY PRAYING AND READING THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Verse seven of <em>Hymns,</em> #811 says:</p>
<p class="hbody">Feeding and drinking, Lord Jesus, of Thee,<br />
Feeding by reading, and drinking by prayer;<br />
Reading and praying, I eat and I drink,<br />
Praying and reading&mdash;Lord, Thou art my fare.</p>
<p>The third line of this verse speaks of reading and praying, and the fourth line speaks of praying and reading. To pray-read is to eat the Lord, and to read-pray is to drink the Lord. In pray-reading the emphasis is on reading, and this reading is an eating. In read-praying the emphasis is on praying, and this praying is a drinking.</p>
<p>In the Bible spiritual breathing is linked to spiritual drinking. This is very meaningful. In the air there is water. Air would be harmful to us if it did not have water in it. In one sense, when a man breathes in air, he is drinking in water. The Bible likens prayer to breathing. Since breathing also includes drinking, prayer is also a kind of drinking. This is not my experience alone; sister M. E. Barber in one of her hymns also said, &ldquo;Just to breathe the Name of Jesus, / Is to drink of Life indeed&rdquo; (verse 2 of <em>Hymns,</em> #73). Her experience also confirms that to breathe is to drink.</p>
<p>If you want to digest the word of the Lord, you need to pray-read; that is, you must first read and then pray. To pray-read is to turn what you read into prayer. Then you also need to read-pray, which is to mingle the Lord&rsquo;s word in your prayer. To pray-read is to eat; to read-pray is to drink.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MORNING WATCH BEING A TIME<br />
OF FELLOWSHIP WITH THE LORD<br />
BEFORE THE LIVING WORD</h2>
<p>I can never forget the first article I read about morning watch. Its title was &ldquo;Plan the Year Early in Spring, and Plan the Day Early in the Morning.&rdquo; The writer of the article said that morning is the most precious time, and that the best way to spend the morning is to have morning watch. Of course, a formal morning watch will not avail much. The true morning watch is one in which you take the Word of the Lord as the Lord Himself, and fellowship with Him face to face through His Word.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you have your morning watch, you try to hurry a little because you want to be on time to go to work. Under such a circumstance you would give inadequate attention to your reading and prayer. At other times you may not be in a hurry, but you may use your time to read in a light way and talk to each other. Neither of the above practices is good. If while you are reading the Word of the Lord, your spirit is not exercised and you do not take the words you read as the Lord Himself, your morning watch is not right. Whether you are having morning watch by yourself or with a few others, a principle must be kept: whenever you come to read the word of the Bible, you should regard it as the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s Word is the Lord Himself (John 1:1). If you write me a letter, it is one thing for me to receive your letter, and it is another thing for me to talk to you face to face with the letter in my hand. When we come to the Bible, we should have the attitude that we are coming to the Lord with His Word in our hand, taking the Word as Himself. We are not merely reading His Word; we are coming to talk to Him, and to let Him speak to us. This is the way to make the Word of the Lord living to us.</p>
<p>The Bible is not a secular book. The words of the Bible do not originate from the human mentality. The Bible is the breath of God; that is, it is God Himself. This does not mean that we worship the Bible as an idol. We need to realize that the words of the Bible are God Himself. Whenever you read the Bible, God speaks to you there. You should not read the Bible merely with your eyes; neither should you merely memorize or understand it with your mind. You must pray-read it with your spirit (Eph. 6:17-18a). In other words, you must mingle your reading with prayer. Prayer is your communication with the living Lord. While you pray-read in this way, you are converting the words of the Bible into your prayer. In the end, you are not merely reading the word of the Lord; you are speaking to the Lord with His word. This is the proper way to fellowship with the Lord. This kind of pray-reading is most helpful to us. For this reason, every time we have our morning watch, we should have the deep sense that we are there to speak to the Lord and to have the Lord speak to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL SCRIPTURE BEING GOD-BREATHED</h2>
<p>The whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation shows us that the word of God is living. Paul told us from his experience that &ldquo;all Scripture is God-breathed&rdquo; (2 Tim. 3:16). The word &ldquo;breathe&rdquo; in Greek is a strong word. In translating 2 Timothy 3:16 the Bible translators were not bold enough. The translators of the King James Version rendered the first part of 2 Timothy 3:16 as &ldquo;All Scripture is given by inspiration of God.&rdquo; The New American Standard Version renders this phrase as &ldquo;All Scripture is inspired by God.&rdquo; Actually, neither of these renderings is accurate. The accurate translation should be, &ldquo;All Scripture is God-breathed.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD OF CHRIST BEING CHRIST HIMSELF</h2>
<p>The words of the Bible are different from all the words of the great ethical teachers in the world. All their writings were produced from their minds; their whole being was not involved. When a person speaks in a refined way, most of his speaking is probably a pretense. It is only when he loses his temper and speaks out of his anger that his words are not pretentious. The word of God is His breath. It comes directly from God; there is no pretense whatever. God is Spirit (John 4:24), and God is life (1 John 5:20). Whatever comes out of God is, of course, also spirit and life. This is why the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (John 6:63b).</p>
<p>Colossians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.&rdquo; In the past I did not understand this verse. To me this was as strange as someone telling me, &ldquo;Let the rice get into you and dwell in you.&rdquo; Only recently my eyes were opened and I began to realize what Paul was saying. Paul considered the word of Christ as a person. To Paul, the word of Christ is the same as Christ Himself. If I were to visit your home, when I knocked on the door, you would let me in. But how could we speak of letting some rice come in? No matter how much we let the rice in, the rice will never come in, because rice is not a living person. If someone were to place a desk and two chairs at your front door, and you were to open the door to let the desk and chairs come into your study and dwell there, you would never see those pieces of furniture come spontaneously into your house. This is because they have no life; they are not living. But when a living person knocks at your door and waits there, you can let him come in.</p>
<p>The word of Christ is living. It is like a living person. You must let this word come in and dwell in you. The word of Christ has been waiting outside for a long time; it is not far from you. Because of this, you can let this word come in. &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.&rdquo; This verse proves first that the word of Christ is living. Second, it shows that this word is very near to you; it is even waiting at your doorstep. Whenever we come to read the Lord&rsquo;s Word, we need to realize that the Lord&rsquo;s word is not only living; it is a living Person, the Lord Himself, who is waiting to come into us and dwell in us. For us to come to the Word of the Lord is to come to the Lord Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RESURRECTED JESUS TRAINING THE DISCIPLES TO BE ACCUSTOMED TO HIS INVISIBLE PRESENCE</h2>
<p>When the Lord was on the earth for three and a half years, He was with the disciples visibly. When the Lord Jesus came, Peter followed Him. When He ate, Peter ate also. When He walked in and out, Peter could follow behind Him. There was no need for any training in order for the disciples to become accustomed to the Lord&rsquo;s visible presence. Later the Lord left the disciples; He died, was buried, and rose from the dead. In resurrection He came back to the midst of the disciples. At that time His presence became an invisible presence. Because of this He needed to train His disciples to experience this invisible presence.</p>
<p>On the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection the disciples were assembled in a house. It was evening, and the doors and windows were closed. Suddenly the Lord appeared in their midst and said, &ldquo;Peace be to you&rdquo; (John 20:19). Eventually, after spending some time with them, He disappeared. Actually, He did not leave the disciples; He only withdrew His visible presence. The difference was merely one of being visible or invisible. The Lord appeared unnoticeably, and He withdrew His visible presence unnoticeably.</p>
<p>On the road to Emmaus the Lord walked with the two disciples, listening to them as they discussed the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection (Luke 24:13-35). The two disciples did not know that it was the Lord. When they came to a village, the Lord was about to journey on, but they asked Him to tarry, and the Lord stayed with them. When they sat down to eat, the Lord took the bread and broke it. At that moment they recognized that it was the Lord. Suddenly the Lord disappeared. When they did not know that it was the Lord, the Lord followed them and walked with them for a long journey; but when they recognized that it was the Lord, He disappeared from them.</p>
<p>After the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection He also appeared to Peter (1 Cor. 15:5). However, when the Lord withdrew His visible presence from Peter, he became impatient and said to the other disciples, &ldquo;I am going fishing,&rdquo; and they followed him (John 21:3). That night they caught nothing. I believe that the Lord Jesus commanded all the fish that night to stay away from them, so that not a single fish came to their net. They did not realize that the Lord Jesus was with them in their fishing. At dawn the Lord asked them if they had anything to eat. They answered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The Lord told them to cast the net on the right side of the boat. They obeyed and caught an abundance of fish. It was then that they realized that it was the Lord. In dealing with the disciples after His resurrection, the Lord seemed to appear suddenly and disappear suddenly. Actually, it was not a matter of being present or not being present; it was a matter of being visible or invisible.</p>
<p>Today we enjoy the presence of the Lord not in a visible or physical way, but in an invisible and unseen way. This is rather difficult for us. I have been practicing this matter for sixty years. Gradually, through much practice I have become accustomed to this. Now I have learned the secret. The Lord&rsquo;s presence is real. You have the Lord&rsquo;s presence, and I also have the Lord&rsquo;s presence. Every one of us has the Lord&rsquo;s presence. But though the Lord&rsquo;s presence is practical to me, it may be very abstract to you. In the morning I only need to spend at most ten or twelve minutes, and immediately I can enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence. I can touch the Lord&rsquo;s word as well as the Lord Himself, and I can enter into fellowship with the Lord. I hope that you will practice fellowshipping with the Lord in this way. In this way the words of the Lord will automatically be digested by you. If you would learn to do this, my next advice to you is that you need to practice speaking these words.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT SLOTHFUL IN THE WORD OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>I believe that you all love the Lord, but I must say that even in loving ourselves we are sometimes lazy. This is especially true of the young people. If their parents are not with them, their eating and sleeping habits will be very loose. Only those who are not slothful can cook and eat on time. Although I have never visited your homes, I know that some of you never make your beds. You would not care even if half of your pillow had slipped out of the pillow case, or if one of your socks was under the bed and the other under your pillow. When the time comes you just fall on your bed and sleep, and when you wake up you do not care to tidy up anything. You say that you love yourself, but your life is so loose that you are actually wasting yourself.</p>
<p>All of you love the Lord, but your laziness is a big problem. You say that you love the Lord, but during the day do you spend a few minutes to fellowship with the Lord and to talk to the Lord? Do you put the Word of the Lord before you and let the Lord speak to you? This kind of practice requires a great deal of effort. I am afraid not too many brothers and sisters spend a portion of time each day to be with the Lord and to fellowship with Him in His Word.</p>
<p>Romans 12:11 says, &ldquo;Not slothful in zeal, burning in spirit, serving the Lord as a slave.&rdquo; Our first service is to fellowship with the Lord. When you fellowship with the Lord, your fellowship will become your prayer. In this way, the Lord&rsquo;s word will automatically be constituted into you, and spontaneously you will have the burden to speak for the Lord. Furthermore, you will have something to say, and whatever you say will be full of content.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROPER WAY BEING<br />
IN THE SMALL GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<p>In these days our attention is focused on the small group meetings. We must spend time in this matter. All the pastors and preachers in Christianity today know that it is very difficult to help believers lead a life of constant fellowship with the Lord. For this reason, two methods have been developed in Christianity. One is to have a Sunday morning worship service to sustain the people. During the week very few people go to church meetings; most of them go only on Sunday for a worship service. The preachers or pastors prepare a sermon for them each week. In addition, at least twice a year there may be some so-called revival meetings or retreats. Through these revival meetings or retreats they try to stir up the congregation. Most of the fundamental Christian churches depend on this method to maintain themselves.</p>
<p>The other method is that of the Pentecostal movement with its tongue-speaking. This group considers the fundamental Christians too dead; they use the Pentecostal gifts, especially tongue-speaking, to stir up the people. From 1932 on I began to attend their meetings. After many decades of observation and experience, I have the confidence to say that most of today&rsquo;s so-called speaking in tongues is false. The tongue-speaking mentioned in the book of Acts and in 1 Corinthians is a real dialect (Acts 2:4, 6, 8, 11; 1 Cor. 13:1). It is not like what the tongue-speakers of today practice. Most of today&rsquo;s tongue-speaking is only a kind of nonsensical sound; it is not a dialect. We have a brother among us who is a scholar in linguistics. He told us that today the most simple language in the world is the Hawaiian language; but even this language has at least thirteen consonants. However, the tongue-speakers can produce at most only ten consonants. This proves that the so-called Pentecostal gift of tongues today is not a real dialect.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1963 I was conducting a training in Pasadena. At that time tongue-speaking was quite prevailing on the West Coast. I read a report by a pastor who was very much in favor of tongue-speaking. He said that he had contacted two hundred tongue-speakers, and every one of them told him that they doubted that their speaking in tongues was genuine. After that the pastor exhorted the readers not to doubt their tongues. All they needed to do was to speak; it was all right for them to speak anything. He said that as long as they could speak something, that was a tongue. During the training I asked a brother to read aloud the article to everyone. After that I asked them, &ldquo;On the day of Pentecost when the apostles spoke in tongues, did any one of them doubt that his was a real tongue? Why is it that today, of the two hundred mentioned in this article who speak in tongues, all doubt their genuineness? This proves that their tongues are not real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some are not happy unless they speak in tongues. They must shout and cry before they feel happy. At first I did not understand this. Gradually, I found out that even an unbeliever when he is depressed can experience an emotional release by shouting a little; he does not need to speak in tongues. I remember that as a child in my hometown I watched the carpenters and the bricklayers build houses. They kept themselves busy from morning until evening. When it was time for them to stop to eat, they threw their tools aside, waved their arms around, and shouted some nonsense. In this way they felt relieved and refreshed.</p>
<p>Concerning the tongue-speaking of today, I would say that most of it, if not all, is false. However, the principle which tongue-speakers apply is correct. The principle of tongue-speaking is to open people&rsquo;s mouths. To close our mouth is to be shut up, and to open our mouth is to be released. When a person is angry, if he is a cultured man he will shut up and not speak anything. This will give him an ulcer. If you are angry but have no way to vent your anger, just go out into the yard and shout, &ldquo;Oh, heaven! This is unfair!&rdquo; Then sing some songs, or recite a poem, and your anger will be gone. You do not need to speak in tongues. It will be just as effective if you shout like the heathens do.</p>
<p>A brother read in some books that even in ancient Egypt and Babylon, a kind of tongue-speaking was practiced in the places of idol worship. There is a brother among us from Ghana in Africa. He told me that when he was young, while he was still an unbeliever, he saw the idol worshippers speaking in tongues.</p>
<p>The reason I have mentioned all these things is to advise you not to take the way of tongue-speaking. Do not take this short cut. Tongue-speaking is like a tide; it comes in fast, and it goes out fast. The Pentecostal tongue-speaking movement began roughly in the middle of the nineteenth century in England. By now nearly a century and a half has passed. Historically, very few churches or Christian groups have been definitely built up through tongue-speaking. The Assembly of God is the most solid group among the tongue-speakers. They told their seminary students clearly that they cannot depend on tongues to build up the churches. To build up churches, the only way is by teaching. They can speak in tongues in private, but in their meetings they do not speak in tongues.</p><h2 class="head1">LABORING DILIGENTLY TO<br />
BUILD UP THE SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>We must be clear that the big meetings cannot build up the church. In order to build up the church, there must be the small groups, and to build up the small groups, our concepts and ways must be changed. We cannot take the old way of Christianity any longer. The way of one man speaking and everyone else listening is definitely wrong; such a thing is not in the Bible. First Corinthians 14:26 shows us that when the whole church gathers together, it is not that one man speaks and everyone else listens; rather, it is that each one has a psalm, a revelation, a teaching, a tongue, or an interpretation. It is mutual; it is reciprocal. Everyone who comes to the meetings must learn to speak for the Lord, and everyone must open his mouth to speak forth Christ.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, all the responsible brothers who minister to the children of God must labor diligently. For a pastor to take the old way today is very easy; all he has to do is to meet together with his congregation every Sunday and prepare a sermon for them. But to help everyone to seek after the Lord, fellowship with Him, read His Word, digest it through pray-reading, and then speak for and speak forth the Lord is not easy. This requires a great deal of laboring.</p>
<p>In order for the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to be strong, we cannot depend on one man preaching in the big meetings. There must be the diligent labor to speak for and speak forth the Lord. The leading brothers must especially take the lead to labor in the Word (1 Tim. 5:17). If a mother has five children, she should not expect to have very much rest. There must be a great deal of laboring every day. She has to take care of every aspect of the family. In addition, she must bear the responsibility of teaching and nurturing the children, so that every one of them will grow up to be proper and decent, with a clear mind and a healthy body. For a mother to do this is not easy; she must put all her efforts into this work.</p>
<p>If we love the Lord we must realize that the way of the Lord today is in the building up of the small groups. We cannot take a short cut. We should not be misled to think that tongue-speaking and the so-called Pentecostal gifts is the way. If we love the Lord and we love the church, we must pray much before the Lord. In our prayer there must be thorough confessions. Whenever we sense in our prayer that we have sinned or been defiled, or have done anything wrong, we must confess and repent of our sins one by one. If necessary, we need to go to others to deal with all our unrighteousnesses, so that our conscience can be without blemish. Whenever we come to the Lord&rsquo;s Word, it is as if we are coming to the Lord Himself, fellowshipping with Him face to face. If we would practice this way, the word of Christ will surely be constituted into us, and our daily experience and enjoyment of the Lord will become our words. When we come to the meetings, surely we will have a lot to speak. If we speak and express ourselves in this way all the time, we will be edified, and others will be built up. We must labor diligently in this way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIFE-STUDY MESSAGES<br />
IN THE SMALL GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<p>We need to use the Word of the Lord frequently in the small group meetings. We are not replacing the Word of God with the Life-study messages. Rather, we are using the Life-study messages to open up and unlock the Bible to us, so that we can have a deeper understanding of the Bible. Hence, in the small group meetings, on the one hand we need to read the Word of God, and on the other hand we need to receive some guidance and explanation from the Life-study messages, so that those who attend the meetings may be further enlightened in the Word of God and be nourished through the reading of the Word.</p>
<p>When we read the Life-study messages, we will find that there are passages which are not so important. The function of these passages is to connect the main points together. They can be read over quickly. Other passages contain the main points of the message. They should be read repeatedly and with emphasis. You should not feel that you need to read every single word in a lifeless and legal way. Instead, you should read the Life-studies in a living way. At times some terms in the messages may be unfamiliar; you may want to explain them briefly while reading them. We call this expound-reading. At other times you can pray-read; at the end of a paragraph you can stop to pray for a short time. You can also give testimonies to strengthen and confirm the words that you read. Then there are times when you can sing-read; when you come to a passage that touches you, you can put the words to a short tune and sing it together.</p>
<p>We must come to the small group meetings with preparation and much practice. Before we come to the small group meetings, everyone should read the message first at home. We should read through the main points, and we should pray and be prepared before the Lord. In the small group meetings, everyone should be diligent. Those who are somewhat taking the lead in all the small groups should all the more be prepared beforehand. Since you take the lead, you should be the first to be diligent. This is the situation in a good family. If the mother takes the lead to be diligent, all the children will follow her example and be diligent. In this way, the whole family will be busy and everyone will have his part of the work. I hope that you all will take this word and put it into practice in your daily life, so that the Lord may have a way among us in the building up of His church.</p><h1 class="msg">NOTES FROM MESSAGE EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THREE THINGS FOR FOUR THINGS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 4:31; 6:4; Jude 20</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THREE THINGS</h2>
<p>Acts 4:31 says, &ldquo;And as they were beseeching, the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness.&rdquo; In this verse, first there is the beseeching, the prayer; second there is the Holy Spirit; and third there is the word of God. Here we can see the three things which we shall consider in this message. These three things are prayer, the Holy Spirit, and the word of God. From the day of Pentecost the disciples were severely persecuted by Judaism. Under such persecution, they prayed to the Lord and were filled with the Holy Spirit. After this they spoke the word of God with boldness. In the account of Acts 4:31, on one hand there is prayer, and on the other hand there are the Holy Spirit and the word of God.</p>
<p>Acts 6:4 says, &ldquo;We will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.&rdquo; Both the word and prayer are mentioned in this verse.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Building Up Ourselves in Our Most Holy Faith</h2>
<p>Jude 20 says, &ldquo;But you, beloved, building up yourselves in your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This verse begins with faith and ends with the Holy Spirit and prayer. In the New Testament the word &ldquo;faith&rdquo; has two meanings plus one additional meaning. Of the first two, one is objective and the other is subjective. The objective faith is our belief. It is the truths in which we believe, the contents of the New Testament. The Christian belief includes the whole Bible. We believe everything in the whole Bible. This is our belief. This belief is objective. The subjective faith is the act of our believing. It is the action and functioning of our believing. The third meaning of the word &ldquo;faith&rdquo; is found in Galatians chapter three. In verse 23 Paul says that in the Old Testament the law was at work to guard the chosen people of God like a fold, keeping the sheep until faith came (cf. John 10:1, 16). In verse 24 Paul likens the law to a child-conductor to watch over God&rsquo;s chosen people until Christ came. Galatians 3:25 says, &ldquo;But faith having come, we are no longer under a child-conductor.&rdquo; When faith comes, the law is over. During the Old Testament time, the law came. During the New Testament time, faith came. It is difficult to define this faith which came in the New Testament time. For a detailed explanation of this faith, I would encourage you to read the messages in the <em>Life-study of Galatians</em> that deal with this matter.</p>
<p>Our belief is the contents of the New Testament. The New Testament tells us that the Lord Jesus is God incarnated to be a man. He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. In His living there was also His work. He died on the cross. His all-inclusive death solved all the problems in the universe. Then He willingly walked into death and Hades. He stayed there for less than forty hours. After this He walked out of death and Hades, and He rose up with His physical body. In His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. He then ascended to the third heaven and was exalted by God to be Lord and Christ. He was crowned with glory and honor, He was made King of kings and Lord of lords, and He obtained the throne.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Bible tells us that we, the descendants of Adam, are all sinners destined to death and perdition. Our spirit is dead, and we are wicked, fallen, and corrupted. Our behavior is offensive to God, and we are all condemned before God. Although this is our condition, God desires that we would repent and be saved. If we will repent, confess our sins, call on the Lord, believe in Him, and receive Him, our sins will be forgiven, and God will justify us. The Lord will enter into us to be our life, and we will be regenerated and saved. The Triune God will be in us as our life and everything. By faith we will enter into Him and have an organic union with Him, and in faith we will testify of our organic union with Him by baptism. He died, and we also died. He was buried, and we also were buried. He rose from the dead, and we also rose. We are one spirit with Him. In this one spirit we enjoy one life with Him and have one living with Him. In this way we become sons of God and members of the Body of Christ. When we come together, we are the Body of Christ. Here we practice the church life together and wait for His return. When He comes again He will transfigure us and make us His co-kings in the millennial kingdom. This kingdom will bring in the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem. These are the crucial points of the New Testament, and this is our belief. Therefore, our belief includes every holy thing revealed from Matthew chapter one through Revelation chapter twenty-two. This is our most holy faith. According to Jude 20, we should build up ourselves in this most holy faith.</p><h2 class="head2">Laboring on the Lord&rsquo;s Word Being<br />
to Build Up Ourselves in Our Most Holy Faith</h2>
<p>In these messages we have been concerned with the matter of strengthening the small group meetings. In order for the church to be built up by the saints, we must labor on the Lord&rsquo;s word. To labor on the Lord&rsquo;s word is to build up ourselves in our most holy faith.</p>
<p>Today, in the twentieth century, especially in the United States and in Taiwan, education is popular, and the standard of education is high. Technology is advancing daily. In such an age, if we are illiterate, we will be of little use to society. We will not be able to do anything except eat and sleep every day, and we may even become barbarians, knowing nothing but quarreling and fighting. If a man is not educated, he will be very uncultured. The more educated a man is, the more refined he will be. Men in the world are seeking after worldly knowledge. Although they may obtain such knowledge, they know nothing about spiritual matters. Concerning spiritual matters, they are ignorant.</p>
<p>We have all believed in the Lord. We love the Lord and we love the church. This is wonderful. Yet most of us are short of spiritual education. Because of this, in God&rsquo;s hand we are not very useful. On the side of our old creation, our flesh, we have received adequate education. But on the spiritual side, we have not labored for our spiritual education to prepare and build up ourselves. This is what concerns me.</p>
<p>During the fellowship of these few weeks, we have exposed the poor and ignorant situation of Christianity. Because of the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we have been raised up by Him. In the past sixty years the Lord has continually granted us bright and rich truths. Especially in these past twenty years, after the Lord&rsquo;s recovery came to the United States, we have continually seen new light, and we have published a great deal concerning biblical truths. We have expounded in detail the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, and we have printed these expositions in many books. But my point is this: We cannot say that we have attained simply because we have some truths and some books. Have we read these books? Have we digested the truths contained in them? Have we built up ourselves in our most holy faith? This is the key.</p>
<p>Our meetings are not so rich, and they are lacking and sometimes even void of the living word. Because you have not received an adequate spiritual education, when someone mentions a spiritual matter, many of you become speechless. If you have not received a proper elementary, high school, and college education, your speech will indicate that you are an uncultured person, or what is commonly known as a &ldquo;country boy.&rdquo; Among Christians today there are many spiritual &ldquo;country boys.&rdquo; Many among us are also spiritually uneducated. To me, the Chinese-speaking meeting is a heavy burden. Sometimes I sigh because during the meetings it seems that you do not know how to exercise your spirit to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word. But in other places you have a lot to speak. In the previous message I mentioned that we must exercise to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word, but after my speaking no one exercised. It is like a coach practicing with his players. Suppose the coach passes the ball to his players, and no one continues to play. Rather, suppose they say, &ldquo;You are the coach; you are an expert. We will watch you play because playing ball is the coach&rsquo;s business.&rdquo; Some of the saints have come from a distance to attend this meeting. A number of them said that if I were not speaking, they would not come. You want to hear me speak. If I do not speak, you will be unhappy. However, I also want to hear you speak. If you do not speak, I will also be unhappy.</p>
<p>It is difficult to deal with this concept of not opening our mouth to speak. If the older ones do not speak, the younger ones will also be silent. The older ones take the lead, and the younger ones follow. In the end, no one speaks. In the natural realm it is easy to speak and difficult not to speak. In your own home would it be possible for you to be completely silent for an entire day? When you are at home, it is impossible for you not to speak, but once you are in a meeting, it is easy for you to stop speaking. We have said repeatedly that we need to exercise to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word. But eventually, we still do not speak. What is the reason? I agree with the Chinese proverb which says, &ldquo;What is impregnated within will take form without.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;...for out of the abundance of his heart his mouth speaks&rdquo; (Luke 6:45). Because you are not filled within and you are short of content within, you have nothing to speak. For this reason I am very burdened.</p>
<p>I feel that everything in the United States is very good. However, if you are not one who loves the Lord, I wish that you would not come to the United States, because in the United States there are also many evil things. In this country people receive high wages for their jobs. The income from one person is sufficient to support an entire family. People are required to work only eight hours a day and five days a week. For many people there is no work on the weekends. All the weeknights and the whole weekend afford people extra time for entertainment. However, in the worldly entertainments all the lusts come in; all the sinful things creep in. Therefore, it is dangerous to live in the United States if you are not one who loves the Lord and seeks after the Lord. You may be busy working every day to earn money, but it is still meaningless to have so much money. If you have a large amount of money, though you may not sin now, one day the abundance of money will encourage you to sin.</p><h2 class="head2">Using the Footnotes<br />
of the Recovery Version and<br />
the Life-study Messages<br />
to Study the New Testament</h2>
<p>Since life in the United States is simpler and there is more time, we can have meetings every day. But how should we have meetings? How should we use our time? This is my point. I encourage you all to labor in the most holy faith to prepare yourselves. You need to spend time to research the book of Matthew. At present we have already expounded the whole New Testament book by book. This exposition is a collection of the church&rsquo;s biblical knowledge over the past two thousand years. We have collected all the gems, and we have printed them in simple language. If you want to understand the book of Matthew and desire to know what is contained in this book, I encourage you to buy a copy of the Recovery Version of Matthew and read it every day. I also encourage you to read the footnotes and the Life-study messages. In a relatively short time you can finish the reading, and you can grasp the main points. By digesting these main points, you will be able to study the entire book of Matthew within three months.</p>
<p>I once encouraged those among us who just graduated from college not to pursue their careers immediately but to spend the first two years full-time in the church life and to get into the study of the Bible. At present, there is already such a group of full-timers. There may be nearly one hundred of them in Taipei alone. For four hours every morning they study the New Testament with the footnotes and the Life-study messages. I told them that if they would continue for four years, they would finish the whole New Testament. Do not think that four years is a long time. Four years is just the twinkling of an eye. Of course, I do not expect all of you to do this, but in principle, you all need to accept this exhortation. If you cannot finish in four years, you can do it in twelve years. Do not think that you need to study the whole New Testament consecutively from the first book to the last. You may first study these seven books: Romans, John, Hebrews, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. As long as you are persistent and do not stop, you can finish these books in one year. The Gospel of John concerns the matter of life. The book of Romans is an outline of the Christian life and the church life. The books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians are the heart of the New Testament truths. The book of Hebrews points us to the present Christ who is in the heavens and who is our daily salvation and moment by moment supply. If you study these seven books thoroughly, you will then have something in you. After this, I recommend the first book of the New Testament, Matthew, the last book, Revelation, and one in between, the book of Acts. This makes a total of ten books. If you thoroughly study these ten books, I assure you that you will have something to speak. You will definitely have something to speak. You cannot help but speak. If I ask you to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word, it may be difficult for you now because within you there is a shortage of vocabulary and utterance. But after you have thoroughly studied these ten books, you will be full of words and you will speak. In this way the problem of your speechlessness will be solved.</p>
<p>In addition, you must get into the truths of the Bible topic by topic. For example, what is repentance, faith, remission of sins, justification, reconciliation, sanctification, transformation, and conformation? These are all truths in the Bible. Two years ago I suggested that the brothers arrange all the biblical truths topic by topic into lessons. Last year many local churches began to have junior and senior high school truth trainings. Two weeks ago I went to Berkeley, California for a conference. I stayed at the home of a brother who has a thirteen year-old son. On Saturday his son went to the University of California at Berkeley and contacted eleven people who were all adults. He said that out of the eleven, seven refused but four received the Lord. He told us what he was preaching. He said, &ldquo;I told them that man is created by God as a vessel to contain God.&rdquo; After hearing this, I felt that he was excellent. Furthermore, another brother&rsquo;s daughter who is sixteen years old also went to the college campus to speak to others, saying, &ldquo;Man is created by God as a vessel, and God wants to put Himself into man.&rdquo; I was amazed at the younger generation. Later I found out that they had just finished this lesson in the church&rsquo;s truth training summer school this year. Since they had just graduated, they all spoke on this.</p>
<p>Two years ago I mentioned in Texas that it is not adequate merely to concentrate on the inspiration of the Spirit, to create an atmosphere, and to give a message during the meetings. This has no educational value. Our meetings and our messages must be educational. To be educational is to follow an educational system to teach the students. All the things that must be learned in an educational system should be compiled into lesson books. Beginning with kindergarten, and then advancing to first grade, second grade, and so forth, the children should be taught grade by grade. After the sixth grade, they will graduate, and then they will attend junior and senior high school. After six more years, they will graduate again and will be qualified for college. In this way, what they have learned will be useful. Without a consistent educational system, it is not possible to properly educate the students merely by teaching them a little this year and a little next year.</p><h2 class="head2">Conducting Educational Teaching<br />
on the Truth Twice a Week</h2>
<p>We do not need to have more meetings, but we do need to utilize two meetings per week to give some educational teaching on the truth. The first meeting which we can use for this purpose is the Lord&rsquo;s Table meeting. We can use the second half of this meeting to give a lesson on the truth. There is no need to preach a moving message. We need to give a lesson to everyone and do it according to the lesson book. In order to do this, we need someone who can spend the time to write the lesson book and someone who can spend the time to learn it. There are fifty-two Lord&rsquo;s Table meetings in a year. If we can give one lesson on each Lord&rsquo;s Day, when a saint stays in one locality for a year, he will receive fifty-two lessons.</p>
<p>The second meeting we can use is the prayer meeting. In most of our prayer meetings, after praying for one hour, the burden is discharged and the praying atmosphere is almost gone. But because it is still early and the saints do not want to leave, we may do some unnecessary things to fill in the time. This is a waste! We need to utilize this time to give everyone some lessons on the truth. We should give one lesson in the Lord&rsquo;s Table meeting and another lesson in the prayer meeting. In this way we can have two lessons per week. In fifty-two weeks we can have one hundred and four lessons. Consider how much we can teach in one hundred and four lessons! We should no longer have routine meetings: Lord&rsquo;s Day morning preaching, evening breaking of bread, Tuesday prayer, and Thursday small gathering. If we meet in such a habitual and routine way, we may all come to the meeting but have no feeling concerning what happens in the meeting. When the time comes, we may all sing hymns; then some will pray and others will give messages. As we meet in this way we let time slip by week after week. If we all hold the concept of merely maintaining the meetings, our children will graduate from grade school, high school, and college, but we ourselves will still remain in the spiritual kindergarten. Surely we cannot tolerate such a poor situation.</p>
<p>In 1949 I went to Taiwan. Brother Liu Suey went with me to visit different places. One day when we came to Taichung, we sat in a park. I said, &ldquo;Our church meeting not only needs to be spiritual but also educational.&rdquo; An educational meeting is to give the saints spiritual lessons on the truth. I arrived in Taiwan in April 1949. When I started to work in August, I gave sixty lessons on &ldquo;The Essential Topics of the Bible.&rdquo; The foundation of the work and of the churches in Taiwan is built upon these sixty lessons. Everyone who was saved at that time received a good foundation. If a person came to the meetings every week, he at least received one lesson on the truth each week. In sixty weeks he would have received sixty lessons. The brothers and sisters had a solid spiritual foundation. But today we lack this kind of educational meeting. Therefore, today we do not have many who can teach others and share something solid. Most of what is shared is inspirational. Some would praise the riches of the ministry. However, the riches of the ministry are not their riches because they have not received the spiritual education.</p>
<p>If a person desires to be useful, he needs to receive an education for twenty-five years and then learn by his experiences for another twenty-five years until he reaches the age of fifty. Then in the third twenty-five years he should endeavor to serve and contribute to society. If he lives beyond the age of seventy-five, within him there will be many riches. He will have been educated, and he will have the experiences and the supply. He will then be very useful. If anyone has not received an education for twenty-five years, his foundation is not adequate. He needs to go to kindergarten, grade school, junior high, high school, college, and even graduate school. Through education he will build up himself. Then he can be useful in the future.</p>
<p>Approximately ten years ago, many of the English-speaking young people among us had an attitude of not wanting to study. They thought that the Lord would come back in a few years and that even if a person had very little education, he could still make a living. They thought that there was no need to be highly educated, and many did not even care to finish high school. According to their concept, they did not need to waste their time on studying. They felt that it would be sufficient to use all of their time to pray-read and fellowship with one another. At that time this kind of atmosphere was very prevailing. In order to make a living, the brothers were content to do some gardening, swimming pool cleaning, or carpentry. In February 1977 I gave message eighty-six of the <em>Life-study of Genesis</em> entitled &ldquo;The Builder of the Pillars&mdash;the Skillful Hiram.&rdquo; In this message I told the young brothers and sisters that their attitude was wrong and that they needed to abandon their wrong concept and study diligently to receive an adequate education, even the highest education. This message went out and had a great impact. Today, many of those who received this word have graduated from college. Some came and said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, thank the Lord. If you had not released that message, I would not have finished my schooling today.&rdquo; One brother, having heard this message, studied Greek and received a Ph.D in Greek. He is now an expert in Greek and has become one of the most useful assistants among us in doing the translation of the New Testament. The reason I say these things is that I hope that in the matter of meeting we will advance and make progress. We should not merely come to many meetings yet not build up ourselves in the truth. If we do not build up the spiritual education, we will have no future at all.</p>
<p>I myself have been taking the lead to minister to the churches for over thirty years, and I have gained many experiences. Ten years ago I realized that it was not sufficient just to have conferences. I realized that we needed to dig out the truth. Therefore, I determined to finish the digging of the New Testament. The more I dug, the more I felt that this was right. Today you cannot say that you lack educational materials. Our educational materials are very rich. But if all these materials are just on the bookshelf, without being labored on by you, without being read and researched by you, they will never become yours. If you love the Lord, you need to spend time on the Lord&rsquo;s word. As Jude 20 says very well, you need to build up yourselves in your most holy faith. You will then have knowledge and wisdom, and you will be able to supply others and speak the Lord&rsquo;s word in the meetings.</p>
<p>The overseas work began in 1949. At that time the total number of churches overseas was not more than one hundred. Now there are more than six hundred churches. In other words, we have increased by more than five hundred churches in five continents in the past thirty-six years. However, my emphasis is not this kind of numerical increase. I feel that it is not enough to have a large number of churches if the quality of the saints is poor. This would be like a nation that has many people, yet these people are void of the proper education and, hence, their quality is very low. This is inadequate. We need to build up the quality of our brothers and sisters. On what should we build them? On educational truth. All of you love the Lord and seek the Lord. For the sake of the future of the Lord, for the sake of our personal spiritual benefit, and for the sake of our next generation, we desperately need this spiritual education. This spiritual education requires the leading ones to promote it and all the saints to rise up and act.</p><h2 class="head2">The Need of Prayer</h2>
<p>On one hand we need to rise up to build up a spiritual education, and on the other hand we need the adequate prayer. It is necessary to read the Bible, the Life-study messages, and books on the truth so that we can build up ourselves in the truth. But if we do this without prayer, all this will merely be in our mind. If you want the truth in your spirit, you surely need prayer.</p>
<p>Acts 6:4 says, &ldquo;We will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.&rdquo; Steadfastly means with perseverance. Although in principle it is not difficult to pray, the opposition to our prayer is very strong. Praying is like rowing a boat against the tide. It requires our strength and it needs perseverance. Today everything in human society works to prevent us from praying. Everything is against our praying. Therefore, you need to pray earnestly and steadfastly. You need to struggle and fight in order to pray. You need to remind yourself, &ldquo;I must pray. I cannot give up prayer.&rdquo; I have had a great deal of experience in this matter. My work is quite demanding. For example, recently I have had to review more than one hundred messages in thirteen days. In addition to this, there is a large stack of letters waiting for my response. All these things have opposed my praying. If I do not pray, my spirit is dry and flat. Therefore, I have to pray.</p>
<p>If you merely memorize the Bible without prayer, the Bible will not be in your spirit but in your mind. It will not be the living word to you. Therefore, you need to pray while you read the Bible. When you pray, do not pray for many other things. The Lord Jesus told us not to worry about what we should eat, what we should drink, and with what we should clothe ourselves. Do not pray for these things. Your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. He will give you all these things (Matt. 6:31-33). You need to pray for God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness, that is, to pray for spiritual things. God&rsquo;s kingdom and God&rsquo;s righteousness are spiritual things. When you pray for these things, God will give them to you and also add to you the necessities of your living. You need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, I want to know what is justification and what is sanctification. Lord, grant me the grace to know these things!&rdquo; When you pray in such a way, your whole being will be in the spirit and will be filled with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>To read the Bible is to work on the Lord&rsquo;s word. To pray is to work the Lord&rsquo;s word into your spirit. When the Lord&rsquo;s word gets into your spirit, you will be filled with the Holy Spirit. Thus, the Lord&rsquo;s word, your prayer, and the Spirit of God will be mingled together and will saturate you within. In this way, you will be not only a man who receives spiritual education, but a man saturated by the Holy Spirit. You will be living, fresh, and full of wisdom. If you want to preach, you will have something to preach. If you desire to speak, you will have something to express. If you desire to shepherd others, you will have riches to supply. Then you will fulfill the ministry of the word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR THINGS</h2>
<p>After considering the three things in Acts 4:31&mdash;prayer, the Holy Spirit, and the word of God&mdash;we need to go on to consider four additional things. The previous three things are for these four things. The first of the four additional things is to preach the gospel, the second is to release the truth, the third is to minister life, and the fourth is to recover the saints. We need to preach the gospel and lead others to salvation. We need to release and teach the truth so that people can receive the proper knowledge and enlightenment. We also need to minister life so that others can grow in life. But there are some who have become weak, sick, backslidden, stumbled, and troubled, and who have stopped coming to meetings. We should not leave them alone, because they are members of our family. By all means we need to seek them out and recover them.</p>
<p>We all need to do these four things: preach the gospel to save sinners, release the truth to teach the saints, minister life to build up the saints, and recover the weak ones. In order to do these four things, we need to be those who are fully saturated with the word and those who pray. When the word is mingled with our prayer, it becomes the Spirit (John 6:63; Eph. 6:17-18a). It is then that we are able to preach the gospel, release the truth, minister life, and have the riches to nourish and recover others.</p>
<p>If you lack the word, prayer, and the Spirit, when you go to preach the gospel and you meet your relatives, you will not have the word to preach to them. You will only be able to say, &ldquo;The Lord Jesus is wonderful. You need to believe in Him.&rdquo; But they may still not believe because you said this a number of years ago, and you are still saying the same thing today. This kind of preaching will not work. You need to tell them the truth of the gospel. You can tell them that man is a vessel created by God and that God desires to fill man with Himself. Those who formerly opposed you will be interested to hear your speaking. You can then tell them that man has three parts&mdash;a body to eat food, a soul with a mind to read books, and a spirit within the depths of man. The body has its need, the soul has its need, and the spirit has its need. The need of the spirit is God. If the need of the spirit is not met, man is empty. When you speak in such a way, they will be moved to believe what you have preached. Only the truth can touch people in the most prevailing way.</p>
<p>In the matter of releasing the truth, if you do not know any truth, you have nothing to speak. In the matter of ministering life, if you are not rich in life, you have nothing to minister. In the matter of recovering the saints, you may visit someone, but if you have no life supply, you can only say, &ldquo;We have not seen you for a long time. Where have you been?&rdquo; Initially, the person you are visiting will welcome you, but when you ask him such a question, he will think that you have come to judge him, and everything will be finished. Instead of asking him such a question, you should speak some truth from the Bible. You should share with him the benefit that you have received from the word of truth and those things that the holy Word has built up in you. Sometimes unconsciously, while you are speaking the truth, one word may touch the depths of his being; then he will be able to rise up.</p>
<p>Today if we want the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to have a future and we desire that the church be built up, we must labor in the word of the Lord. We also need to lead the brothers and sisters to pray and to touch the spirit. When the disciples prayed earnestly, they were filled with the Holy Spirit. This is an unchangeable principle. This kind of prayer is like deep breathing. If you breathe deeply, you are bound to be filled with air. Your persevering in prayer is a kind of spiritual deep breathing. If you pray perseveringly, you will definitely be filled by the <em>pneuma.</em> Having the word of the Lord, being willing to pray, and being filled with the Holy Spirit, you will receive the higher spiritual education and will build yourself up fully. Then you will be able to preach the gospel, release the truth, supply life, and recover the saints. Only in this way will the church be built up and have a bright future. I hope you will consider these words before the Lord.</p>
<p>I fully understand that now we are making a big turn to get into the Lord&rsquo;s word and to meet in the small gatherings. But we cannot expect a quick success. Everything that is successful quickly will only last a short while. We must be patient and work seriously. We need to remember that to bring up our children and make them useful persons requires more than twenty years of laboring. This requires patience.</p>
<p>We do not want to take the Pentecostal way, thinking that once a person speaks in tongues everything is accomplished. The way of the small group meetings will require at least three or four years before we see any success. I hope the co-workers, the elders, the leading ones, and all the brothers and sisters understand this. We need to have patience. Do not try to be fast. Do not try to get quick results. We need to do this work slowly, step by step. I myself am also prepared to take this way. When we have educated all our children successfully, the family will be prosperous. Our labor will not be in vain. When all the brothers and sisters have received the cultivation and education of the truth and have been strengthened in their spirits, they will be useful materials. The church will grow every day, and the day of the glorious church life will be here.</p></body></html>
