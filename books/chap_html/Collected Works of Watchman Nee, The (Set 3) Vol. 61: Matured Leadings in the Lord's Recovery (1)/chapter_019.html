<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">A SIGN BEFORE THE LORD'S COMING</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: February 13, 1950<br />Place: Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong<br />Scripture Reading: James 5:1-5</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>How shall I follow Him I serve?<br />How shall I copy Him I love?<br />Nor from those blessed footsteps swerve,<br />Which lead me to His seat above?<br /><br /></li><li>Privations, sorrows, bitter scorn,<br />The life of toil, the mean abode,<br />The faithless kiss, the crown of thorn&mdash;<br />Are these the consecrated road?<br /><br /></li><li>Lord, should my path thro' suff'ring lie,<br />Forbid it I should e'er repine;<br />Still let me turn to Calvary,<br />Nor heed my griefs, rememb'ring Thine.<br /><br /></li><li>O let me think how Thou didst leave<br />Untasted every pure delight,<br />To fast, to faint, to watch, to grieve,<br />The toilsome day, the homeless night:<br /><br /></li><li>To faint, to grieve, to die for me!<br />Thou camest, not Thyself to please;<br />And, dear as earthly comforts be,<br />Shall I not love Thee more than these?<br /><br />(Hymns, #462)</li></ol><p>The first stanza of the above hymn consists of a series of questions. The writer is speaking to himself. He is fellowshipping with his own heart. This musing results in his awareness of his straying away to outward things. The word still in stanza 3 is very good. In stanza 1 there is a yearning for consecration; in stanza 3 the prayer is that the consecration would not change. Consecration is not a once-for-all thing; it should be something continuous. The writer yearns for a continual consecration. The emphasis in this stanza is the word still. Stanza 4 is a reflection on the Lord's forsaking of "every pure delight." There are many delights which are not pure, but the delight that the Lord enjoyed was pure; no sin whatsoever was found in this delight. Immediately after this the word to is used four times. This is a very unusual hymn. In the first two lines of stanza 4, the Lord leaves something behind, while in the third and fourth line, He takes something up. Here we can feel that the Lord's Spirit has brought the writer to a new height. On the one side, there is the "pure delight." On the other side, there are the "toilsome day" and the "homeless night."</p><p>Stanza 4 describes the Lord's work, but this description is still somewhat objective. Stanza 5 brings a subjective tone to the hymn: "for me!" He came for me! The word to appears here three times, and they are somewhat different from the previous stanza. The Lord not only grieved and fainted for us, but died for us. The Lord's goal was to accomplish God's work of redemption for us; He did not come to please Himself. Although "earthly comforts" are hard to give up, the Lord's love enables us to overcome them. The hymn concludes with a question.</p><p>This song describes a person who was once very prosperous and successful in the world, but who forsook everything for the Lord. We can sense the height that his spirit has soared.</p><p>In 1924 I chose this hymn for the brothers and sisters to sing in the meeting. They sang well with spirit and with much feeling; their voices were loud. While they were singing, I was meditating on the song. It is sometimes difficult to meditate on some hymns if they are sung too loudly. Some hymns which are suitable for meditation cannot be sung loudly at all. Between 1923 and 1924, a few of us young people were zealous for the Lord. One couple among us considered quitting their jobs to work full-time for the Lord. They felt unsure about their future. While they sat quietly this way, they began to sing this hymn. As they sang they made the decision to serve the Lord. This hymn has a grand feeling to it, yet it is not overbearing. Some people are carried away by the grand feeling of a song, yet they do not touch the tender spirit behind the song. When this couple sang this song, they touched the tender feeling behind it. If we feel that our future is unsure, we can try to sing this song and offer ourselves once more to God.</p>
