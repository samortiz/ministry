   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since the interruption of postal service, how we have desired to know the footsteps of our brothers and sisters!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although our hearts are thinking about you, there is nothing we can do.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can only ask the Lord to protect, comfort, supply, and lead every child of His, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Recently, we received a letter from Sister Chang Pei-ling, together with Issue Nos.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>4 13 of The Open Door.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I was overjoyed and did not know what to say except, "Hallelujah" and "Praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Praise the Lord that He has raised up a small number of people who are of one mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I was very encouraged by some brothers and sisters who voluntarily went out after the conference to visit people and to preach the Lord's word to them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are many seekers of the Lord in this area.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is the need for Him to send men to come and preach His glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this small district a few villages already have local churches.</S>

   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All these ones have taken up the responsibility by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some are saved but are not yet baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They intend to have baptisms in one or two places when the warm weather comes in spring.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, we do no know how many will be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They are also willing to pioneer to the frontier lands for the gospel's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They intend to push towards the "mini-northwest" beginning in January.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is different from the "great-northwest" of China.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many brothers and sisters have migrated to the frontier provinces in the northwest and southwest of China.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The saints here cannot go that far, but they want to at least move out to nearby areas.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>May the Lord create a good opportunity to promote the gospel in the "mini-northwest" and to attract a great number of people to Himself, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The truth in Rethinking Our Work meets my need.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although I am not a worker, I need it very much.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We wonder whether Gospel Truth has been published yet?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Not yet Editor.</S>
