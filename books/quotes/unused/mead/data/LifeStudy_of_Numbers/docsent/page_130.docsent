   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Balaam Knowing That It Was Wrong to Go,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and the Angel of Jehovah Allowing</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Him to Go and Charging Him to Speak Only What</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>the Angel of Jehovah Would Speak to Him</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although Balaam came to know the real situation, seeing that the Angel of Jehovah was standing in the road in front of him, he did not go back.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Instead, he kept on going.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Balaam knew that it was wrong to go.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He said to the Angel of Jehovah, "I have sinned, for I did not know that You stood against me in the road.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now therefore, if it is evil in Your sight, I will go back again" v. 34 . However, the Angel of Jehovah allowed him to go but said to him, "Only the word which I will speak to you, that shall you speak" v. 35 .</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Balaam appeared, Balak welcomed him at the capital of Moab vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>36-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As we will see in the following messages, Balak did not get what he wanted, but God gained what He wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although Balaam was a greedy prophet, he was still under God's control.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The record concerning Balaam in Numbers 22 contains a valuable lesson that we all need to learn today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The lesson here is that we should not seek the Lord's will as long as we have the desire to do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we have a particular desire, yet still want to seek God's will, the result may be self-deception.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to learn to seek the Lord's will without having any other desire.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that we should be able to pray in simplicity, "Lord, I am here seeking Your will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>My only desire is to know Your will and do it."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If this is our situation, we will eventually know the Lord's will.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, if we seek the Lord's will but are actually inclined to carry out our own desires, we may deceive ourselves, even as Balaam deceived himself.</S>
