   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 5 says, "And she brought forth a son, a man-child."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to see the relationship between the woman and the man-child, let us look at Galatians 4:26: "But the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The last part of Galatians 4:27 says, "Because many are the children of her who is desolate rather than of her who has her husband."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Jerusalem that is above is the New Jerusalem, and the New Jerusalem is the woman, the goal which God desires to obtain in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The woman in creation is Eve, the woman in the age of grace is the Body of Christ, the woman at the end of the age of grace is described in Revelation 12, and the woman in eternity future will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the Word says that the Jerusalem which is above has many children, it does not mean that the mother and the children are separate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It means that one has become many, and many are composed into one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The many children added together equal the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not as if the mother delivers five children, and then there are six individuals, but that the five children added together compose the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Each child is a portion of the mother one portion of the mother is taken out for this child, another portion is taken out for another child, and so for each one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It seems as if they are all born of her, but in fact they are herself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The mother is not another being in addition to the children; she is the summation of all the children.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we look at the whole, we see the mother; when we look at them one by one, we see the children.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we look at the totality of the people in God's purpose, we see the woman; if we look at them separately, we see many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a special principle.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The same meaning is applied in Revelation 12 when it speaks about the woman delivering a son, a man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The man-child delivered by this woman is a wonder and a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The words "bring forth" do not mean that the child had his origin with her and was then separated from her, but merely that within her there is such a being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"She brought forth a son, a man-child" simply means that a group of people is included in this woman.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All of God's people have a part in His eternal purpose, but not all assume their rightful responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, God chooses a group of people from among them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This group is a portion of the whole, a part of the many chosen by God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the man-child brought forth by the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a whole it is the mother; as a minority it is the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The man-child is the "brothers" in verse 10 and "they" in verse 11.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that the man-child is not a single individual, but a composition of many persons.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All of these persons added together become the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In comparison with the mother, the man-child appears to be small.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the group is compared with the whole, their number is in the minority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But God's plan is fulfilled in them and His purpose rests upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 5 says, "She brought forth a son, a man-child, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This speaks of the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The overcomers are the instrument that enables God to achieve His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Revelation mentions shepherding "the nations with an iron rod" three times.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First, 2:26-27 says, "And he who overcomes and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations; and he will shepherd them with an iron rod."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This passage quite obviously refers to the overcomers in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The last mention of this phrase is 19:15, which says, "And out of His mouth proceeds a sharp sword, that with it He might smite the nations; and He will shepherd them with an iron rod."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This passage refers to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To whom then does the passage in chapter twelve refer?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It must refer either to the overcomers in the church or to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Is it possible that it refers to the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No. However, it is not wholly impossible, for later we will see that the Lord Jesus is included here.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Why is it not possible?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First, the man-child was caught up to the throne of God immediately after he was born.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, this could not be a reference to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord Jesus was not caught up immediately after He was born.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He lived thirty-three and a half years on this earth, died, resurrected, and then ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For this reason we believe that the man-child refers to the overcomers in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is the portion of the people in the church who are the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The man-child refers to them, not to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, the man-child does include the Lord Jesus, since the Lord Jesus was the first overcomer and all overcomers are included in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The man-child and the mother are different, and yet they are also one.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The overcomers differ from the church, but they are included in the church.</S>
