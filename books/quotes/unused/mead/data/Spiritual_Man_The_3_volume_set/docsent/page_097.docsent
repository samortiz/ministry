   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Danger of Being Used</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>by the Power of Darkness</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of James was written to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verses 14 and 15 of chapter three say clearly what the relationship between the soul-life and the work of Satan is: "But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not boast and lie against the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This wisdom is not that which descends from above, but is earthly, soulish, demonic."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We see here that there is a kind of wisdom which comes from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This kind of wisdom is also from man's soul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This causes us to conclude that this kind of wisdom is the result of the work of Satan in man's soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"The flesh" is the factory of the devil, but the work of Satan on the soul is no less than his work in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These two verses tell us that envying and strife occur due to the believer's seeking of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is because the devil works in man's soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A believer may only know that the enemy can tempt man to sin but may not know that he can also give thoughts to man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fall of man was due to man's love of knowledge and love of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even now Satan still uses this to cause a believer to keep his soul-life as a machine for his work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Satan's plan is to preserve a believer's "old creation," and the more the better.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If he cannot make a believer keep his sin, he will use the foolishness and unwillingness of the believer to preserve the believer's natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Otherwise, the armies of Hades would soon lose their jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a believer would join with the Lord more in his spirit, the life of the Holy Spirit would flow more into his spirit, and the cross would daily work more deeply.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus the believer would be delivered more from the "old creation," and the devil would have fewer places to work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should know that all Satan's temptations, attacks, and work are in our "old creation."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our "new creation" is the life of God Himself, upon which Satan will never waste his energy working.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, Satan must devise a way to make a believer keep some of the "old creation," either sin or the good natural life, through which he can continue to do his work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, the enemy troubles the believer again and again and confuses the believer, letting him, although having hated sins, still love his own life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When a believer was still a sinner, he was "doing the desires of the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This refers to sins, especially those which are related to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"And of the thoughts."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This refers to the soul-life Eph 2:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, verse 2 tells us that these two are under the operation of the evil spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our purpose is to let the believer understand that not only is the body the place wherein Satan works, but also the soul is what the enemy likes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What we would now emphasize is that the believer was saved to be delivered not only from his sins, but also from his natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Oh, may the Holy Spirit open our eyes to let us know how important this step is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a believer is delivered from the power of sin and the soul-life, layer by layer, the work of the enemy will be a great failure.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Simply because a believer is soulish, not knowing how to guard his own mind, the evil spirit can very easily utilize man's natural wisdom to make his scheme a success.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He can easily put misunderstanding and prejudice into man's mind unconsciously, causing man to have doubts toward God's truth and man's honesty.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The work of the Holy Spirit within man is greatly frustrated by an evil spirit's occupation of man's own mind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although man's intention may not be wrong, his thoughts are betrayed by his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These good ideas resist the work of the Holy Spirit just as the foolishness of the worldly people does.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The work of an evil spirit is not only this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sometimes an evil spirit can give a vision or other wonderful thoughts to a believer, making him think that since this is supernatural, it must be of God, thus deluding him to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before the soul-life is put to death, it is impossible for the mind of a believer to not be curious, exhibiting such phenomena as "wanting," "grabbing," and "searching."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, an evil spirit indeed has the opportunity to work.</S>
