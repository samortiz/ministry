   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WHO IS NARROW?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we say that this is wrong and that we all must be one, others say that we are narrow and exclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But in all these years, it has been proved who is narrow and exclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church in the locality is not narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It includes all the believers in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The only thing in which you may say that the church on the proper ground is narrow is that it will not take anything divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We will accept all kinds of Christians as long as they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We will accept those who are sprinkled as well as those who are immersed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Would those who say that we are narrow receive such?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What does it mean to be narrow and exclusive?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Most people simply do not know what they mean when they speak thus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To be narrow means to disregard the proper ground of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we are on the proper ground, we can never be narrow, for the ground of unity is common to all the people of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some missionaries in China said to us, "We are all one in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let us work together."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But we made the situation very clear to them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We said: "Yes, we are all one in the Lord, and we are all working for Him, but there is a big difference.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are working to build up the local church, but you have been sent by your mission to come here to build up the church of your mission.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We appreciate the fact that you have sacrificed to come to this foreign country, but you have come here to build up something other than the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You have come to build up the church of your denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is impossible for us to agree with this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As far as Gospel preaching and edifying of the saints is concerned, there is not much problem; but in building up the mission and denominational churches, we cannot go along with you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You must recognize that the building up of the mission and denominational churches is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you would relinquish this, there will be no problem."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Who is narrow?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some are narrow in their mission work!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some are narrow in their personal work!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We, as the local church, are not narrow; we are broad to include all the Lord's people in our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why do the missionaries insist upon building up their mission churches in the mission fields?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why do they not give up all divisive ground and come to build the local church?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we say this, they say that we are narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the Lord knows who is narrow, who is sectarian, and who is exclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The local church is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It embraces all the believers in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the problem is that so many are sectarian in their opinions and in their work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>So when the local church will not take their sectarian opinions, they say that the local church is narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brothers and sisters, the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In such a time of confusion, we must be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only the ground which the Lord ordains is the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the brothers and sisters who have been with us in these past years have tasted the real enjoyment of Christ in the church on the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those too who have only recently begun to meet with us have sensed the sweet enjoyment there is here in the local church on the ground of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is here that the Lord has commanded His blessing, even life forevermore!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The ointment is on the Head, and the dew is on Mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the proper ground, and this is the unique place to enjoy the Lord to the uttermost.</S>
