   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Building Up of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being by Our Experience of Christ as Life,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Bringing In Oneness and Harmony</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>under the Control of the Light of Life</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The building up of the church includes oneness and harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This harmony can be realized only by life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the church must be built up through our experience of Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then in this life we will have light, and under this light spontaneously every one of us will be controlled and will be one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We cannot simply adopt a saying, Let us build up a New Testament church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not adequate merely to come together to study the New Testament and learn certain matters from the four Gospels, the Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation to work out a formula for the scriptural way, the New Testament way, to have a proper church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can never work out the building up of the church in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may have the formula, but we will not have the life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We will not know how to be filled with Christ, live by Him, take Him as our life, experience Him, and be dealt with by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this case, even if we have a scriptural formula, we still will fight with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Merely to have a formula does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose, however, that by the mercy of God our eyes have been opened to see that God s economy is to work Himself into us as life, that we have to love Him, take Him as life, fellowship with Him, be filled with Him, and live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then spontaneously within us and among us there will be light.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There will be no arguments, division, fighting, or jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There will be only the oneness under the control of the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We will have oneness, and this oneness will be the real building up.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By this oneness, that is, by this building, God will head up all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All Creation Being Brought into Order</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>under the Shining of the New Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The New Jerusalem is composed with many members, represented by the twelve tribes and the twelve apostles Rev 21:12, 14 , but they all are one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do you think Peter and John will argue in the New Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the arguing, debating, and fighting will have been swallowed up by life and light.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Death will be entirely swallowed up, and all darkness will be chased away by light.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, everyone in the New Jerusalem will be wholly in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The New Jerusalem is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is the water of life flowing and satisfying, and there is the tree of life growing and supplying 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the holy city is also full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God Himself is the light, and Christ the Lamb is the lamp 21:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What then will be the condition of the creation?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 24 says, The nations will walk by its light.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the nations, representing all of creation, will be controlled by the shining of the city; therefore, all nations will have order.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today in Los Angeles there are millions of people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Physically speaking, they are walking under the sun by day and under electrical light by night, but spiritually speaking, they are walking in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first time I came to the United States in 1958, I was surprised to see the lights on in the stores after they were locked for the night.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I said, This is a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Don t these people know how to save electricity?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Gradually I came to understand that the lights are left on in the stores to prevent robberies.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If all the lights in the stores and on the street were turned off, there would be robberies under darkness every night.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the electricity in Los Angeles were turned off for only one night, the newspapers would not be big enough to report all the confusion that would take place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the New Jerusalem the nations will walk in the light of the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Is there such a holy city today?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No, there is not, but God is going to work out such a city.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the age in which God is working to save people and build them up to produce the New Jerusalem as the universal lampstand that holds Christ as the lamp with God within Him as the light.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God will shine on all creation through this universal lampstand, and by this shining, this enlightening, God will bring all things into order.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Consider the picture of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the center and at the top of the city Christ is sitting as the Head to supply His life to all His members.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His members are enlightened, and they become the vessel from which He shines out.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By this shining all the nations, representing all the creatures, will be brought into order.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They will all be under the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The whole universe will be headed up in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Within the city there is life, and this life is the very God who is ministered and imparted to all His members.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Strictly speaking, though, this life does not come out from the city.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rather, out from the city comes the shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The creation, the nations, will not have life, but they will be under the shining of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We will enjoy God as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then we will be full of light, and this light will shine through us upon all the creation to bring the creation out of darkness, confusion, the slavery of corruption, and vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All creation will be brought into the order of the manifestation of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God Carrying Out His Process</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>until the Fullness of the Times</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>One hundred years ago the church did not see this truth in a subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At that time the Brethren thought that the fullness of the times would arrive suddenly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today the Lord has shown us that this is not so.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is the need of a process.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In 1936, after we first received this light, Mussolini was still living.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Many students of the prophecies in the Scriptures predicted that he was the Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Even D. M. Panton, the editor of the magazine The Dawn, published pictures of Nero and Mussolini side by side, trying to prove that Mussolini was the Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we read that article, we realized that this could not be true.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We knew that Christ would not return at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The fullness of the times had not come, because the harvest was not yet ripe Matt 13:30; Rev 14:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>At that time God s cooking was only partly finished.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we come into a kitchen and see things in a mess, we know that we have to wait for another few hours.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We cannot expect that a minute later we will have a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There is the need for more time.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God has a process to carry out.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He has much work to do in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He needs to work Himself into you, me, and every one of us as life, that we may be full of light and be controlled by this light.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then we will have the oneness, the harmony, and this will be the real building up.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is by this building that God will shine out and shine upon all creation to bring them out of confusion, the slavery of corruption, and vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>That time will be the fullness of the times.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It will be the time that all creation will be liberated, because death will have been swallowed up.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>After the ancient serpent is cast into the lake of fire, death will also be cast in 20:10, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Death will be the last enemy to be dealt with by God 1 Cor 15:26, 54 .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>After death is dealt with, the universe will be full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Under this light all creation will be freed from the slavery of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>All creation will be liberated from vanity and brought into the freedom of the glory of the sons of God, which is the shining of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The shining of the New Jerusalem is the manifestation, the glory, of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>All the nations will be brought into this shining, and they will walk in this light and be controlled by this light.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>There will be no more confusion, so there will be no more vanity and slavery of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Creation will be completely released from the slavery of corruption and will be brought into the freedom of the glory of the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>All this depends on the work of God within and through us.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>God must work out this city as a corporate vessel that He may be life in every way to us and shine through us as light upon the whole creation.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Then the whole creation will be delivered, liberated from confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Oh, how important it is that the church be built up!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Without this vessel, that is, without the built-up church, God can never head up all things.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>It is by His being life to the church and by the church being built up through this life that God shines out as the controlling factor, and it is by this shining that all creation will be brought back to God, released from confusion, and brought into the liberty which is under the shining of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>At that time Christ will be the Head to head up all things under His headship through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Christ will be at the top of the holy city as life and light.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Under this light and in this light the nations, representing the whole universe, will be controlled.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Then all things will be in order.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>God s desire will be satisfied, and we also will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>God s enemy will be cast out, and all His problems will be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Moreover, all creation will be brought back, released from all bondage, and brought into the freedom of the glory of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>All these things will be fulfilled through the church at the fullness of the times.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>I do not have the adequate utterance to speak all these great matters to you in the fullest way.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>However, I trust the Lord that He will show you all these things so that you may see what the church is in a high and deep way, not in a low and shallow way.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We must not say that we are merely poor people to whom God has been merciful; that He has saved us and put us together as the church; that we are waiting for the Lord s coming to bring us into the glorious kingdom; and that if we die before that time, we will be taken into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>It seems that there is nothing wrong with this teaching and theology, but it is too low.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Rather, today God is working Himself into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Therefore, we need to be cooked, dealt with, and we need to be permeated and saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Then we will be full of light, and under this light we will be controlled, we will have oneness and harmony, we will be built up, and we will become the universal vessel through which God will head up all things under the shining of His Body.</S>
