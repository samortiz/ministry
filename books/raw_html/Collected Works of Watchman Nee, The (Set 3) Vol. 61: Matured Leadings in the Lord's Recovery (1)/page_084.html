<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE SPIRIT<br />OF THE ELDERS TO BE OPEN</h2><p>The elders' spirit must be open to the Lord all the time. Their spirit must be meek. In order for a person to be an elder, he must receive uninterrupted impressions from the Holy Spirit. It is useless for an elder to force others to obey his own judgments. This kind of judgment is no better than that of a young sister who has just been saved. Both are nothing more than sinners saved by grace. In making any judgment, an elder must be able to say that it is the Lord making such a judgment through him. This is the reason he has the capacity to touch a matter while others do not have the capacity. This is the reason he can claim that the authority of the Holy Spirit is upon him, not upon others. However, he must realize that this does not come from his private, individual authority. He does not assume authority in himself. He only carries out God's authority upon him. The validity of his authority lies in his fellowship and enlightenment. All the brothers and sisters have to learn to accept the result of the elders' fellowship with God and the enlightenment they have received from God. If they do not accept it, they are being rebellious.</p><p>The elders must have an open spirit as well as an open heart. They must be pliable before the Lord. They have to be quick in listening to the brothers and sisters, and they have to discern God's speaking in their speaking. Suppose a brother or a sister is speaking. The elders have to learn to listen carefully. Their ears have to be quick, and they have to understand the very meaning of what the Spirit is trying to say. Someone may speak fifty sentences, but only one is a word from the Holy Spirit. They should identify this word. For example, when I was in Shanghai, I once spoke with Brother Luk. Another brother, a foreigner, was also present in the meeting. In the course of our conversation, we forgot about our foreign brother. After we finished our conversation, the brother said that he had understood a few of the words we spoke. From these few words, he was aware of the nature of our conversation. Actually, he only understood a few English phrases that were interspersed in our conversation. An elder should be like this foreign brother in his ability to pick up the "English." He should be able to catch the few words that God is saying in the brothers' and sisters' speaking.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS MUST BE RICH</h2><p>The elders must be the richest persons in the whole church. They must be able to freely dispense themselves to others. They must also be able to receive a supply from every member. Only a rich person can give to others, and only they can receive the supply from the Body and learn from the brothers and sisters. The elders must be this kind of persons. They must be able to make others rich, and they must be able to receive a supply from others. They must be able to draw out the good points of the brothers and sisters. This means not only that their spirit must be open but that they must humble themselves to learn from others.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS MUST BE COORDINATED</h2><p>When there is no authority in the church, there is no coordination. Among the elders there must also be mutual submission; they must learn to coordinate among themselves. This is the only way for the church to be in order. This kind of coordination will result in the whole church serving together. At the same time, the elders have to learn to not build up their own authority. I hope our arrangement and fellowship this time will direct the service of the church on to a good track.</p><h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD</h2><p>The church is the Body of Christ. Every brother and sister is a member of this Body, and everyone is useful. If the elders can call the whole church into function and bring out all the one-talented ones and if everyone submits to authority, we will gospelize all of Hong Kong in a short time. The church will be able to build up itself as well as spread outward to gain more people. May we pray much for this.</p>
