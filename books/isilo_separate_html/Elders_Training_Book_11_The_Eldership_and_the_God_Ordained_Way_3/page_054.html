They need to go to each of the saints' homes outside the group meeting. This is why Paul said in Acts 20 that he taught the saints publicly and from house to house and that he admonished each one of them night and day with tears (vv. 20, 31). Paul used both the day and the night. We mostly use our meeting time to contact the saints. We think that as long as we have attended every meeting, we have fulfilled our duty. But that is not the complete fulfilling of our duty. The fulfilling of our duty is also outside the meetings.</P><P>Our priestly duty and labor are mainly in the visiting and contacting of people. When I found out that some of the full-timers were being used by the church to take care of arranging the chairs, I was grieved. This is not the reason we have full-timers. The full-timers are not for the arranging of chairs. If we do not have the people to arrange chairs, we should hire someone. The saints should be absolutely freed to contact people. The full-timers need to spend all of their time getting themselves educated in the holy Word and contacting people. I encourage the full-timers to spend two hours every day with the Lord in His Word. Then they should use the rest of the time for contacting people one by one.</P><P>There is no way to carry out the God-ordained way except by the individual contact with people. What is needed today is for the full-timers, co-workers, and elders to spend their time, energy, and spiritual capacity to take care of people individually. The main thing we are learning to do in the elders' training is to contact people for their salvation, their feeding, their spiritual education, their equipping, and their perfecting. Within a period of one or two years, they should be able to do the same thing that we are doing in our service to the Lord. Today the result of our work is not like this. I hope that we would consider this fellowship seriously and have a full change in our concept and practice.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_053.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_055.html">Next</a> </body></html>
