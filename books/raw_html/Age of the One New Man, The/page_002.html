        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING UP TO DATE<br />
WITH THE AGE OF THE ONE NEW MAN</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE HISTORY OF THE DIVIDING<br />
AND SCATTERING OF FALLEN MANKIND</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals that God&rsquo;s intention in creating man was to gain a vessel to express Him and rule for Him (Gen. 1:26-27). Bible students agree that in Genesis 1 <em>man</em> refers to all mankind. God did not create an individual man; He created a corporate man in one man, Adam. Hence, according to God&rsquo;s intention, mankind should be considered as one man.</p>
<p>However, after the flood, fallen mankind was divided and scattered on the earth according to families and tongues in their lands and nations (10:5, 20, 31-32). After mankind rebelled against God at Babel, man&rsquo;s language was confounded, and man was scattered (11:9). The history of fallen man is a history of division and scattering. The nations on the earth became independent and were in conflict with one another.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ESTABLISHING OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE<br />
PAVING THE WAY<br />
FOR THE SPREAD OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Unifying the Jewish, Greek,<br />
and Roman Worlds</h2>
<p>Two thousand years ago the known world was limited to three continents&mdash;Europe, Asia, and Africa&mdash;centered around the Mediterranean Sea, and the nations around the Mediterranean Sea were divided. Around 27 B.C. Caesar Augustus unified the nations around the Mediterranean Sea and established the Roman Empire. The Hebrew religion, Greek philosophy and culture, and Roman politics and law were three dominant elements prior to the establishment of the Roman Empire. When the Roman Empire unified the territories around the Mediterranean Sea, the Hebrew religion, Greek philosophy and culture, and Roman politics and law were merged. When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, &ldquo;Pilate wrote a notice also and put it on the cross; and it was written, JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS&rdquo; (John 19:19). This notice was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek (v. 20). The fact that these three languages were used shows that the Roman Empire had unified the Jewish, Greek, and Roman worlds into one empire.</p>
<p>The Roman Empire was established before the Lord Jesus was born. It paved the way for the gospel to spread to all the peoples on the earth. After the Lord Jesus died on the cross to accomplish redemption according to God&rsquo;s plan, the gospel was ready to be spread. Because the Roman Empire had unified all the territories around the Mediterranean Sea and merged Roman politics, Greek culture, and the Hebrew religion, a broad way was paved for the gospel to spread around the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Making Greek the Common Language</h2>
<p>The Roman Empire made Greek the common language among the nations around the Mediterranean Sea. Having a unified language was a major contribution to the preaching of the gospel and the truth. How could the apostles preach the gospel if the Roman Empire had not been unified and if every nation around the Mediterranean Sea had its own language? Under God&rsquo;s sovereignty, before the Lord Jesus was born and long before the apostles were sent out, the Roman Empire made Greek the common language among the nations around the Mediterranean Sea. This paved a broad way for God&rsquo;s plan to be carried out, that is, for the propagation and spread of the gospel of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Merging the Nations<br />
around the Mediterranean Sea</h2>
<p>Furthermore, because the Roman Empire unified the territories around the Mediterranean Sea, Romans could go into Jewish regions, and Jews could go into Greek and Roman regions. There were Jews in nearly every city around the Mediterranean Sea. This can be seen in the account in Acts 2. During Pentecost devout Jews from every nation came to Jerusalem for the feast. Because they had been scattered for a long time, they had forgotten the Jewish language and could only speak their local tongues. While the Jews were at the feast in Jerusalem, the Holy Spirit was poured out on the disciples, and the church was produced (vv. 1-4, 37-41). According to verses 9 through 11, the Jews who were present came from at least fifteen nations represented by fifteen dialects. The establishing of the Roman Empire merged the nations around the Mediterranean Sea together.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Developing Transportation<br />
on Sea and on Land</h2>
<p>In the Roman Empire transportation on sea and on land was developed. There was convenient maritime transportation on the Mediterranean Sea, and roads that went all over Europe and Asia Minor were built so that there was no problem traveling from Spain to Jerusalem. The Roman Empire accomplished four things. It unified the Jewish, Greek, and Roman worlds; it unified the language; it merged the nations; and it built convenient sea and land transportation. As a result, the gospel could be spread to every place around the Mediterranean Sea. In other words, there were believers and followers of the Lord in all the nations, tribes, peoples, and races around the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
