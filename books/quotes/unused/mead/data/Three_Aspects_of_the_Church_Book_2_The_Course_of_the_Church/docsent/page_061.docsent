   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RECOVERY OF GIVING ALL FOR THE LORD S USE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The recovery of giving all for the Lord s use is still practiced among us cf.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Acts 2:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1943 in northern China, the flow of the Holy Spirit was so strong that of eight hundred brothers and sisters, more than ninety percent placed their all into the Lord s hands not merely in prayer or in word, but even more, they placed everything practically in the Lord s hands.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I was present at that time, and there are other saints among us today who were in that flow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That was an unprecedented occurrence since the church came to China.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If it had not been for the war between China and Japan, more than three hundred brothers and sisters would have migrated to the northwest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first migration to the northwest included more than seventy people; another thirty went to Korea and to the border of Manchuria.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The brothers and sisters who went to the northwest in the spring of 1943 raised up meetings in more than forty places in less than one year.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first group to migrate did not have much education and was somewhat weak.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One brother s father-in-law was a doctor, and he was probably the most highly educated person among that migrating group; that family is still in the northwest today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, when this group of saints consecrated themselves and all that they had and placed it in the Lord s hands, God did marvelous things through them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That recovery still influences us today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is a pity that when it happened, we did not record all the details.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>May the Lord have mercy on us and make us humble, because after we have recovered a spiritual item, it cannot be kept in oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must live every day in newness, and we must renew our vision daily in order to be able to continue the former things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Otherwise, we will not experience anything new, and we will lose even the old things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During the revival in northern China in 1943, Brother Sun Feng-lu said to me, I feel that the condition of the church today is just like the condition of the church on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He suggested that we should make a record of what was happening because so many things were God s wonderful working and demonstrated the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Regrettably, those things passed without being recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It would be difficult at this point for me to recall what happened and write something about it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It would require special grace from the Holy Spirit to remember everything that happened; we really had the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One brother, a doctor, was very proud and had a terrible temper; everyone was afraid of him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, in that flow of revival, the Lord gained him strongly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even today, thirteen years later, that brother is diligently following the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That flow was very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a person is graced with being part of one of God s special moves on this earth, it is the greatest blessing of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God s move makes an impression that he will never forget, and it becomes an unending source of supply to him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whoever can participate in such a flow is most blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I believe that whenever someone who was in such a flow thinks back on it, he will have fond memories of that time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The revival in northern China in 1943 was a very strong flow; many people were gained by God at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many of the consecrations were not loose but were very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That flow of revival had a great influence on the churches in China after the war ended.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is a great blessing for a person to be able to participate in the flow of God s work, the flow of revival, at least once in his lifetime.</S>
