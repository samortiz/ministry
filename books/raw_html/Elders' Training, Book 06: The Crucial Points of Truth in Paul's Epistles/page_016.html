<h2 class="head1">A MAN IN CHRIST AND<br />
THE SUFFICIENT GRACE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Chapter twelve covers two very crucial points. In verse 2 Paul said, &ldquo;I know a man in Christ,&rdquo; and in verse 9 he said, &ldquo;And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you.&rdquo; At least to some degree Paul considered these points together in the writing of this chapter. The man in Christ has a particular characteristic in that he always shows his weakness. Although his weakness was not actually great, he still preferred to display it. In this respect he takes the Lord Jesus as his pattern. We know that the Lord Jesus was not weak; rather He was powerful. However, when He was arrested, brought to the cross, and nailed there, Christ appeared to be weak. When Judas brought the officers from the temple to arrest Christ, Christ did not struggle. In the eyes of the arresting ones Christ was very weak. If He were not weak, surely he would have fought back, not tolerating their arresting. He did not struggle. He did not have any reaction. That was His display of weakness. When He was brought the long distance from Gethsemane to Golgotha, He did not resist. That was a sign of His weakness. To nail a living person on a cross is not easy. Even an animal resists being slaughtered. The Lord Jesus, however, apparently had no strength to struggle. In this He showed His weakness.</p>
<p>Paul, as a man in Christ, was just like Christ. In the preceding chapters Paul reminds the Corinthians of the many ways in which they had wronged him. However, Paul never reacted to them. He always showed them his weakness. Even when they accused him of manipulating them for the sake of money, he did not fight back or react (vv. 16-19). Instead he displayed his weakness. In verse 5 Paul said, &ldquo;On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on behalf of myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.&rdquo; The weakness here does not refer to the actual weakness of Paul. Rather it is like that of the Lord Jesus, who when He was arrested, brought to Golgotha, and put on the cross, did not do anything to resist. Apparently He was weak, not doing anything. If while one is suffering persecution, he reacts and struggles against it, he is not under the cross. Rather, he is quite strong. No strong person could ever be crucified. Every crucified one must firstly be a subdued one. Only when one is subdued could he be put on the cross. Being subdued is a sign of weakness. Throughout His whole life, Christ was subdued. He was subdued by His opposers, and He was subdued by His environment. Paul followed the Lord to be subdued. The Corinthians did many unfair and unrighteous things to him. Yet Paul remained subdued, showing his weakness. The sign of a man in Christ is weakness. This is opposite to our natural feeling. We may consider that the sign of a man in Christ would be his power and his strength. It seems that such a man should be very great. But Paul as a man in Christ appeared to be so small.</p>
<p>In verse 9 Paul comes to the matter of the Lord&rsquo;s sufficient grace. However, when he comes to this point, he comes in the way of weakness. In verses 7 and 8 he tells us that there was a thorn in his flesh. Although he entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from him, the Lord would not answer him. The thorn remained there, and Paul was eventually subdued by it.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the great teachers of the Bible agree that the thorn in his flesh was a disease in his body. In Acts Paul performed mighty miracles. Even handkerchiefs carried away from him healed people (Acts 19:12). However, he himself could obtain no healing. This disease was a sign to him. A thorn is not a knife to kill you. A thorn is something which penetrates into your skin to bother you. Certain diseases do not kill you but instead bother you continually. As an old brother I know what the thorn in the flesh is. How glad I would be if there were no thorn. However, I am subdued by the thorn. The thorn was assigned by the Lord to subdue Paul continually. Paul prayed three times. This indicates that he bargained with the Lord. He may have said, &ldquo;Lord, why would You not take this away? You used me to do miracles in a mighty way. In Acts 19 I could perform miracles of healing. But now I cannot.&rdquo; Apparently, the great miracle worker could do nothing. Not only could Paul not heal himself, but he would not even heal his intimate spiritual son Timothy (1 Tim. 5:23). Some of today&rsquo;s Pentecostals might pray on a handkerchief and mail it to the ailing co-worker. This has been done many times in this country. Instead, Paul returned to the practices of ancient medicine. In the ancient time, one with stomach trouble drank less water and took a little wine. It seems that Paul had forgotten his healing miracles and had returned to the natural way. In 2 Timothy 4:20 Paul said, &ldquo;But Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.&rdquo; Although he cared for his co-worker, he had no way to heal him. This word is for those who seek after the Lord to be subdued, to learn how to be weak, that they may enjoy the sufficient grace of Christ.</p>
<p>In verse 5 Paul mentioned his weaknesses, and in verse 9 he again said that he would rather boast in his weaknesses. This indicates that these two portions are related and should be combined together as one crucial point. Quite often we understand the sufficiency of grace not in the way related to the man in Christ. A real man in Christ is one who is not so strong in the physical, natural sense. Rather he is always troubled. This means he is subdued, unable to handle his situation. This kind of weakness affords a good opportunity for the sufficient grace of Christ. If we are not weak but are strong in any way, we do not need Christ&rsquo;s sufficient grace. If I am a millionaire, I do not need your help. But if I am poor in every way, I need your sufficient help. If I were so strong and rich so that I had the means to walk, act, and do everything, I would not need your help. I would be strong, weak in nothing, and poor in nothing. In such a case how can I be a man in Christ? If we are so strong, so rich, and so perfect in everything, then not only would we not need the grace of Christ, we would not even need Christ Himself. We would be sufficient in ourselves.</p>
<p>The Lord, in order to train us as a man in Christ to enjoy Himself as the all-inclusive Christ, surely needs to subdue us. In the past I have seen some strong brothers, wise and capable in every way, nearly lacking nothing. I have seen such a one carefully select his wife from among the sisters. Eventually his selection became the best thorn for him. Before their marriage no one knew that this sister would be such a thorn. But after their marriage, she became a typical thorn, not to anyone else but to her husband. Throughout the following years that brother became fully subdued by that thorn. In one sense his situation was pitiful, but in another sense it was glorious, because under that thorn that brother experienced the sufficient grace of Christ.</p>
