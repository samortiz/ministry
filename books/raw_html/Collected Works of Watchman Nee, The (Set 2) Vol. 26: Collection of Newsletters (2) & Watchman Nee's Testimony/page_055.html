<h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM NAN CHANG</h2><p>To my dear brother in the Lord, Brother Wu:</p><p>It has been three months since we parted, and I really miss you. I also mention you often before the Lord. How have you been recently? I worry about you.</p><p>Since Brother Mu left the hospital and returned home, I have had no news of him. Is he well?</p><p>The so-called Christmas is here. It is still the busiest time for the denominations in Nan Chang...Therefore, I did not go there...Actually, you cannot blame them. Were we not just the same before? I really thank God! He has clearly shown an error that has existed for more than one thousand years to a small number of His children. May we not receive His grace in vain but be faithful to Him daily. (Parts omitted.)</p><p>I have been constantly praying since I came to Nan Chang, hoping that God would raise up His loyal soldiers to walk in the way with me. I wrote a letter to Brother Mu before with this idea. God also clearly tells us in the Bible, "Not abandoning our own assembling together, as the custom with some is." It is so pitiful! The church is desolated to the uttermost. This condition is also true in Nan Chang. I have gone to listen to the messages in the denominations a few times, but they all speak..things that are fashionable to men. They do not even have the remembrance of the Lord. My requests are: (1) Please instruct me in love concerning all things related to the "Brethren Church." (2) What are the difficulties in establishing a table meeting? (3) Can questions regarding the church be sent by mail?</p><p>There are also some other matters that I would trouble you about: (1) Please greet Brother Chou Wei Ku, Brother Chi, Brother Yang, and Brother Shen. (2) Please find some news about Brother Mu.</p><p>I am writing in this year, but you will receive it next year. I ask the Lord to bless us with new life from the heavens in the coming year. May you have health in your body and spirit!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chin Yi Min<br />December 28, 1934</p><h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM TIENTSIN</h2><p>Greetings in love to our beloved brothers in the Lord, Philip, Watchman, and Witness:</p><p>We think of you often because we are members one of another in the Lord. We are also brothers and are drawn into oneness by the Lord's great love.</p><p>Not long ago, we heard that Brother Nee's health was not good, and we were very worried. In our prayer we asked God to heal him quickly. Brother Nee has a commission to preach the gospel, and this is a time when the harvest is great and the workers are few. We deeply believe God will hear our prayer.</p><p>Has Brother Witness arrived in Shanghai yet? Since he started out, the brothers in Chefoo pray for him often. We believe that he is very safe in his travels.</p><p>The assembly in Tientsin has become more living lately. Brothers Liu Huan Hsin and Tau Meng help us much. Thank God, He recently opened a door for us to preach the gospel. Every Sunday we preach the gospel in the district court jail. Please pray for this.</p><p>A friend of the Salt Inspection Office named P'an Yi Yuan received the Lord Jesus as his Savior recently. He has now been transferred to the Tax Department in Nan Hsiang. He will go south soon. When he leaves we will give him a letter of recommendation.</p><p>Sister Miao Hai Ch'en of Chefoo was completely healed after the saints anointed her and prayed. She is still weak physically and cannot get out of bed. We ask the brothers and sisters to continue praying in love&mdash;the Lord will hear. May you have peace.</p><p>From,<br />Chou En Kai, Miao Hai Ch'en<br />January 2, 1935</p>
