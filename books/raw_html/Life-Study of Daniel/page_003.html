<P>The second point is the upcoming appearing of Christ (2:34-35, 45). He will appear as a stone cut out without hands to strike the great image (vv. 31-45) at its feet of iron and clay. The entire image, which represents all human government, will be crushed, not from the head to the toes but from the toes upward to the head. This smashing of the image from the toes to the head will occur at the coming of Christ, and it is something only God Himself can do. At Christ's coming, all human government, from Nimrod in Genesis 10 to Antichrist, the last Caesar of the Roman Empire, in Revelation 19, will be crushed and become like chaff blown away by the wind (Dan. 2:35). The coming of Christ will also be the opening of the eternal kingdom of God. Hence, Christ's coming will be the landmark which closes human government and brings in the eternal kingdom of God.</P><P>The third point is Christ as the Son of Man who comes to the throne of God to receive dominion and a kingdom (7:13-14). In Luke 19 Christ is portrayed as a certain man of noble birth who went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and then to return (v. 12). Christ's coming to the throne of God to receive the kingdom from the God of the heavens takes place in Daniel 7. After Christ receives the kingdom, He will come back.</P><P>The fourth point is the excellency of Christ in Daniel 10. Before Daniel spoke in chapters ten through twelve about the destiny of Israel, he received a revelation of Christ in His excellency. Every part of Christ is excellent and precious (vv. 5-6). We need to see and know this excellent Christ before we can know the destiny of God's people.</P><P>The last point is Christ as the companion of the suffering witnesses of God. In chapter three, Nebuchadnezzar had Daniel's three companions, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, thrown into the midst of a blazing furnace of fire because they would not bow down and worship the golden image which Nebuchadnezzar had set up (vv. 13-23). Three were thrown into the furnace, but to his astonishment, Nebuchadnezzar saw another person within the furnace. The fourth person was "like a son of the gods" (v. 25). This One is the excellent Christ, who goes through the same kind of blazing fire as His suffering overcomers. Whenever we are witnesses for God, testifying something for God, we may suffer. Yet, in our suffering, Christ as the Son of Man&#151;the One who is qualified and capable of sympathizing with us in everything&#151;comes to be our companion.</P>
