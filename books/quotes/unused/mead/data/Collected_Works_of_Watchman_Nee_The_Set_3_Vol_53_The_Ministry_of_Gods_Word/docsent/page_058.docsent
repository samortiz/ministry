   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BREAKING OF THE OUTWARD MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some may ask, "Does not 1 Corinthians 2:13 teach us that spiritual things require no human wisdom?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What should we say?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to realize that this verse refers to the breaking of the outward man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If our mind can be like a servant standing at the door of God's light, waiting for its shining and looking for the interpretation of its meaning, it is the best servant of all.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without it, there is no ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if the mind is not employed in the interpretation of light and instead is being used to devise one's own thoughts, it is the worst master of all.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is a big difference between the mind acting as a servant and the mind acting as a master.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the mind is the master, it tries to find God's light by itself; it tries to figure out God's will or understand God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is human wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When man tries to come up with something by himself, he is exercising human wisdom, and this should be condemned and destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our mind should be a servant standing at the door, waiting and preparing itself for God's use.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not create light; God is the One who shines the light on us, while the mind only prepares itself to retain the light, to understand it, and to translate it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can say that the mind is an important servant in the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is a fundamental difference between the mind creating light and retaining light.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All those who have learned their lesson before the Lord know when they listen to a message if a speaker's mind is acting as his master or if it is translating the light it has received.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When man's mind intrudes into God's affairs and tries to be the master, it becomes a frustration to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why the outward man has to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once a man's mind is broken, it is no longer confused or independent.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should bear in mind that when the outward man is broken, the power of the mind is not damaged; rather, it is enhanced.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The breaking of the mind refers to the breaking of the self-centered mind, the self-motivated and self-propelled mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once such a mind is broken, its usefulness is greatly increased.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose a man's mind is always occupied with a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He thinks about it day and night to the point that he is obsessed with it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a man's mind is in such a state, is it reasonable to think that he will be able to read the Bible well?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Surely not!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should realize that in God's eyes our mind is already disoriented.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes our mind can be obsessed with one matter all day long; it can be totally occupied with it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Or our mind may be occupied with thoughts about what we want; it can be totally centered upon ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then when God wants to use our mind, it has no more capacity for anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a consequence, God cannot use our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brothers, we have to realize the seriousness of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One basic qualification of the ministry of the word is an uncluttered mind, a mind that is reserved for God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a basic requirement for anyone to participate in the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we say that the outward man needs to be broken, we do not mean that our mind should be so torn down that it can no longer function.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, we mean that it should no longer be full of thoughts for the self; it should not think in an undisciplined way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It should not be taken hostage by outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The wisdom of the wise has to be broken, and the cleverness of the clever has to be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then our mind will become a useful organ; it will no longer be our life or our master.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some people simply love to think; they love to be clever.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Their thoughts become their life, and they live by their thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you tell them not to exercise their mind, you are asking them to give up their life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Their minds are turning all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They are so active that we are not sure whether or not God's Spirit can shine into their spirits at all.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But even if He can, their minds cannot receive such light.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should know that in order for one to see anything, he must not be subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If he is subjective, he cannot see anything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a person's mind is his very life, it is impossible for him to see and understand God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is because he is too subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order for the mind to become a useful organ, it must be dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It must be totally smitten.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the breaking of the outward man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If our mind remains the center of our being and our whole being is centered around ourselves, thinking about our own things, with everything revolving around ourselves, our minds are unavailable even if God's light shines into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We do not know what God is saying, and we do not understand the meaning of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As a result, the ministry of the word stops in us; it terminates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If the word cannot get through our mind, there is no ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The ministry of the word needs a channel, and that channel has to be through us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are the channel through which God's water flows.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He uses living men to be His channel, and the water flows out in stages.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once there are obstacles along the way or a section of the channel is blocked, water cannot flow through.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many people are blocked from having a ministry of the word through a blockage in the mind; the mind is blocked, and the ministry of the word cannot flow out.</S>
