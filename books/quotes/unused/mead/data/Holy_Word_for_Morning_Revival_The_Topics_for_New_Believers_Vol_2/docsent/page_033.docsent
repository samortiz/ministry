   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Twelve Descriptions of the Church: The Mystery of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The mystery of God in Colossians 2:2 is Christ; the mystery of Christ in Ephesians 3:4 is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>194 All the stories of God are related to Christ, and all the stories of Christ are related to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church came out of Christ; the church is also the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>195 God is a mystery, and Christ, as the embodiment of God to express Him, is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ also is a mystery, and the church, as the Body of Christ to express Him, is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This mystery is God s economy, which is to dispense Christ, as the embodiment of God, into God s chosen people in order to produce a Body to be the increase of God s embodiment in Christ, that God may have a corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>196</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Masterpiece of God</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Greek word for masterpiece in Ephesians 2:10 , poiema, means something that has been made, a handiwork, or something that has been written or composed as a poem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not only a poetic writing may be considered a poem, but also any work of art that expresses the maker s wisdom and design.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We, the church, the masterpiece of God s work, are a poem expressing God s infinite wisdom and divine design.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The heavens, the earth, and man, created by God, are not God s masterpiece; but the church, the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all 1:23 , the corporate and universal new man 2:15 , is a masterpiece.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>197 This masterpiece of God was created in Christ through His death and resurrection with His divine element in its all-inclusiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is why this masterpiece is a poem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>198 The phrase we are His masterpiece indicates that we are His best; there cannot be any better.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>199</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Israel of God</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Old Testament God had a people to be His testimony, expressing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This was the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the New Testament the real Israel of God is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Israel of God is the term Paul uses in Galatians 6:16.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is today the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is Israel in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not the real Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The real Israel of God today is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus there are two Israels: the one in the flesh, located in what was called Palestine, and the one in the Spirit, to which we belong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul tells us that as many as walk according to the rule of the new creation which is to walk by the Spirit 5:25 are the Israel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>200 They... express God s image, and execute God s authority, and are typified by Jacob, who was transformed into Israel, a prince of God and a victor Gen 32:27-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>201</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Flock of God</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 1 Peter 5:2, literally, the Greek word rendered flock is little flock.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This refers to the church of God Acts 20:28 , 203 which is little in number Luke 12:32 compared with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church as the little flock is a little herb for the supply of life, not a big tree for birds to lodge in Matt 13:31-32 and notes , not a huge religion like Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>204 In today s Christendom, there are many evil persons, evil things, and evil matters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christendom has become a big tree producing no fruit, but having become a lodging place for so many evil things....Although Christianity has become a big tree, in Luke 12 the Lord Jesus called His church the little flock.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not be in the big tree, but remain in the little flock.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>205 Here as the Shepherd, He...feeds His flock.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>206 Here one can find food and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>207</S>
