The Way<br>of Jehovah's Humiliating Judgment</H2><P>The way of Jehovah's humiliating judgment is to make the earth tremble (v. 19b). In His judgment, He will shake the entire earth and cause it to tremble.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Result<br>of Jehovah's Humiliating Judgment</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Men Being Abased and Humbled</H2><P>As the result of God's judgment, men will be abased and humbled (vv. 11a, 17a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Men Casting Their Idols of Silver<br>and Idols of Gold to the Moles and to the Bats</H2><P>As a further result of God's judgment, men will cast their idols of silver and idols of gold to the moles and to the bats (v. 20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Men Entering into the Rock and Hiding in the Dust</H2><P>Because of Jehovah's judgment, men will enter into the rock and hide in the dust (v. 10). They will also go into caves in the rocks and into holes in the dust, and they will go into the crevices of the rocks and into the clefts of the cliffs (vv. 19, 21). Men will do all these things in the attempt to hide from the dread of Jehovah and from the splendor of His majesty. They will not love God but, seeing only that God is fearful and full of splendor, they will be afraid of Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Lesson<br>of Jehovah's Humiliating Judgment</H2><P>The lesson of Jehovah's humiliating judgment is that we should stop regarding man "whose life breath is in his nostrils" (v. 22a). We should not put our trust in man. Concerning man, Isaiah asks, "For of what value is he considered to be?" (v. 22b). The answer is that man is nothing.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Isaiah &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
