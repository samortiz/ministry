   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>J. Pharez and Zarah</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From Tamar we go on to her son, Pharez Matt 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Tamar conceived twins Gen 38:27-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the time of delivery, one boy, Zarah, tried to come out first, but he did not succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He put out his hand, and the midwife marked it with a scarlet thread, indicating that he would be the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, Pharez preceded him to be the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, the first became the last, and the last became the first.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The midwife was surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a good illustration of how to gain the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Pharez inherited the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man did not choose him, but God sent him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This proves that it is not up to man's endeavoring; it is up to God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The mother's story tells us one side: that we should be anxious for the birthright, trying our best to obtain it; the son's story tells us the other side: that although we may strive to obtain the birthright, it is actually a matter of God's choice, not our efforts see Rom 9:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I remember a story concerning D. L. Moody.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One day a student at his Bible institute said to him, "Mr. Moody, by reading the New Testament I have learned that all the saved ones are the chosen ones, predestinated by God before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now I have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If I preach the gospel and convince people to believe, I may do something wrong and persuade someone whom God has not chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What shall I do?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moody replied, "My son, just go ahead to do your best.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As people enter the door, they will see written on the outside, Whosoever will may come.'</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But once they have entered the door, they will look back and see written on the inside, Chosen before the foundation of the world.'"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Tamar's story means, "Whosoever will may come."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Tamar willed and Tamar came.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But her son's story means, "Chosen before the foundation of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Perhaps you are today's Tamar, striving and laboring to obtain the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But once you gain it, you will look back and see that you were chosen before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The birthright does not depend on us; it depends on His choice.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>K. Rahab</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We proceed to Rahab Matt 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rahab was a harlot in Jericho Josh 2:1 , a place cursed by God for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although she was a harlot in such a place, she became a grandmother of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How could a harlot become a grandmother of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In order to answer this question, we need to find the principles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The entire population of Jericho was destroyed except Rahab, her family, and her possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She was saved because she turned to God and God's people Josh 6:22-23, 25; Heb 11:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After she turned to God and His people, she married Salmon, a leader in the army of the leading tribe of Judah and one of the men sent by Joshua to spy out Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At that time, Salmon became acquainted with Rahab and, in a sense, saved her.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eventually, Rahab married him, and they brought forth a godly man named Boaz.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now we must pay our full attention to the principles governing our association with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first principle is that, no matter what our background is, we must turn to God and to God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Second, we must marry the proper person, not in a physical sense, but in a spiritual sense.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After we have turned to God and to God's people, we must be joined, built up, and involved with the proper person.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Third, we must bring forth the proper fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then we will be fully in the portion of the birthright of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It seems that many Christians today have lost their birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They do not have Salmon and Boaz.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you would have a Salmon and a Boaz, you must become involved with the proper believers, with the proper leading ones in the leading tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then you need to bring forth the proper fruit, Boaz, who will be a forefather of David.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must turn to the Lord, and we must turn to the Lord's people; we must also take care of how we become involved with others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we become involved with the proper persons, surely we shall bring forth the proper fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This will keep us in the full enjoyment of the birthright of Christ.</S>
