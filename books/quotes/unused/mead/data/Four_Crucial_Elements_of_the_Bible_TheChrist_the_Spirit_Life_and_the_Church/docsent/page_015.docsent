   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ Being the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord Jesus not only lived a human life but was eventually crucified for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Moreover, He was resurrected from death and became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, "The Lord is the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the Lord were not the Spirit today, He could not have an organic relationship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord's intention is not only to live by Himself but to enter into us that we may become His members to be His corporate Body for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, for Him to enter into us He has to be the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Both in Greek and in Hebrew the word spirit may also be rendered breath.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Spirit is like the breath, the air.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This does not mean, however, that the Lord as the Spirit is no longer a person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the Spirit, He is still God, and He is also man as a person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today the God-man Jesus Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is truly a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>None of the religions on earth is like Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The true power of Christianity altogether lies in the inner life; this is why Christianity is able to spread worldwide.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are insignificant people, but we can testify that since we believed into the Lord Jesus, we have had an intrinsic power in us that enables us to live out a transcendent life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the intrinsic power of Christianity and the story of the life of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may use sowing as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you sow a stone into the earth, there will be no reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, if you sow a seed into the earth, it will sprout after a short while.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The soil of the earth may be thick and hard, yet the seed still will sprout and grow because it has the intrinsic life power.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once the intrinsic life power operates, it can break through the limitation of the hard soil.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Likewise, within a Christian there is the life power.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The source of this power is the Christ who is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now He as the Spirit is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we pray in spirit for just ten minutes, the life power within us immediately begins to operate.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is what is lacking in religion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This also proves that the Jesus in whom we believe, the Lord upon whom we call, is not only the God-man but also the Spirit dwelling in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ Being Our Wisdom: Both Righteousness and Sanctification and Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This Christ who is in us is wisdom to us from God 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Wisdom here does not refer to cleverness; it denotes righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Righteousness is to be proper, accurate, and without mistakes; this is mainly toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sanctification is to be absolutely for God, without any human mixture; this is mainly toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Redemption implies that we cannot have wisdom, righteousness, and sanctification by ourselves but by Christ's divine life; this is mainly for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ as the God-man is in us as the Spirit, and He is also our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more we trust in Him and pray to Him, the more we have wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once we have wisdom, our walk, our conduct, will be proper, and thus we will have righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Moreover, our actions and attitudes will be sanctified, wholly separated unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the same time, Christ in us is our redemption to save us from anything in which we fall short.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the excellent One within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is God, man, and the Spirit for our wisdom: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ Being Our Life</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the Spirit, Christ is not only our inner power but also our life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Colossians 3:4 says that Christ is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We live and move on earth because we have life; once we die, we cannot move any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As Christians we have not only the human life but also the Lord Christ in us as our surpassing life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is the Spirit to be our life, by which we may live and walk and be transcendent and excellent, as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ Having the Unsearchable Riches</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ is God, man, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is also our life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, He is the all-inclusive One with the unsearchable riches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is our kindness with justice, our morality, and our virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What He is, which far exceeds the kindness, justice, and morality taught by the Chinese sages, cannot be expressed by human language.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How rich He is!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whatever we need, He is, and He is abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we need power, He is our power; if we need patience, He is our patience; if we need virtues, He is our virtues; if we need love, He is our love; if we need consolation, He is our consolation; if we need the leading of light in darkness, He is our light and leading.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He is everything, and He is rich and all-inclusive in us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The apostle Paul saw this; therefore, he said that grace was given to him that he might announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel Eph 3:8 .</S>
