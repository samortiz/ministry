   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SUFFICIENCY OF ASHER A. The Exceeding Blessing and Surpassing Grace</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the recovery with Gad, we have the sufficiency of Asher.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The account of Asher begins with the exceeding blessing and the surpassing grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Deuteronomy 33:24 says, "Asher shall be blessed more than the sons; let him be favored among his brethren" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Asher received the exceeding blessing and the foremost grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many of us are able to understand this language.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Dan's apostasy we lost all the blessing and the grace, but in Gad's victory the blessing was recovered and the grace was returned.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now in Asher we are enjoying the exceeding blessing and the surpassing grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>B. The Rich Provision of Life</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Asher we also see the rich provision of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Firstly, Asher has the rich provision for living and growing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Genesis 49:20 says, "Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Deuteronomy 33:25 indicates that Asher also has the rich provision of life for fighting and building.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first part of this verse says, "Under thy sandals shall be iron and copper" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fat bread and royal dainties are for Asher's living and growing, and the iron and copper are minerals for fighting and building.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Asher certainly received the richest provision.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>C. The Bountiful Supply of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>for Our Daily Walk</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Asher also has the bountiful supply of the Spirit for his daily walk Gal 5:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Deuteronomy 33:24 says, "Let him dip his foot in oil."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This certainly is figurative speech.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The spiritual significance of dipping the foot in oil is being full of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In typology oil refers to the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Asher does not have a mere trickle of oil, but enough to dip his feet in. This means that in Asher we have the rich, bountiful supply of the Spirit Phil 1:19 . Oh, we can walk in oil! A number of times in the Lord's recovery I have had the sense that we are walking in oil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I worship, thank, and praise the Lord, saying, "Lord, this is too rich!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The supply of the Spirit here is too rich!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our oil is so bountiful!"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do you have oil in which to dip your feet?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have the fat bread, the royal dainties, and the rich, bountiful oil in which to dip our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>D. The Absolute Rest with Peace,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Strength, Security, and Sufficiency</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Deuteronomy 33:25 says of Asher, "And as thy days, so shall thy rest be" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we have the exceeding blessing and surpassing grace, the rich provision of life, and the bountiful supply of the Spirit, we have absolute rest with peace, strength, security, and sufficiency.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This was the experience of the Apostle Paul in Philippians 4:11-13.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was content in any situation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I can testify that this week I have had the deep sense that I am walking in oil and that I have satisfaction, peace, and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have also been full of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, I have security and sufficiency.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord is my Shepherd, and I have no want, shortage, or lack Psa 23:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead of want, I am full of sufficiency.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I have fat bread, royal dainties, deep oil, and iron and copper under my sandals.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Everywhere there is provision.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, I am safe and secure, and I have rest and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do you have the boldness to say that you have this security and sufficiency?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Or would you say that this morning your wife gave you a difficult time and that you barely endured it?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You need to be able to say, "This morning my wife gave me a difficult time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But praise the Lord that I walked in deep oil!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now I have rest, peace, security, strength, and sufficiency.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>My strength is as lasting as my days.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As my days, so shall my rest, my security, and my sufficiency be."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the experience of Asher.</S>
