   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX CONCERNING THE CHILDREN S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the past, according to our concept of the church life, we did not focus on the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, with the development of human society and culture, there has been more social and educational emphasis put on children.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If children s education is not developed, it will be difficult to have a healthy society.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For this reason, more and more scholars and experts are beginning to pay attention to children.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE BEGINNING OF THE CHILDREN S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I entered the church life in 1932, and a church was raised up in my hometown in July of the same year.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The following year there was the need for a children s meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We did not know anything and were simply groping around.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the time, our purpose in beginning a children s meeting was mainly to care for the saints who brought their children to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was simply a child-care service.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later, I moved to Shanghai where the children s meeting was more developed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we began the work in Taiwan, we also began the children s work because the number of children among us was increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is also the principle in America.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The children s work there is more important than any other work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In America before a child turns twelve years of age, his family has quite an influence on his life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Families there manage children as if managing a machine.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A child does whatever his parents say.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have been received by many American families and was never bothered by the children under twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, one family who offered me hospitality had their children take a nap at one-thirty in the afternoon or simply stay in their bedroom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The children were also sent to their bedrooms at six-thirty in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The children could even jump in their rooms, but they were not allowed to shout.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This allowed us to have dinner with the parents without any disturbance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Neither was there any interruption in our fellowship when we returned from the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, it was entirely different when I stayed with a Chinese family.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At ten-thirty at night the children were still running around and very noisy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This often did not allow us to have good fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since American society pays much attention to the children, when we began the work in America, we studied extensively the best way for children to participate in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the American custom, when parents go out, they never leave their children alone at home.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, most American parents bring their children to the meeting, and the children even sit next to the parents.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the children squirm a little, the mother stops them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a result, all the children sit quietly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, this way of handling the children gives them an unpleasant feeling, and eventually they do not like to attend the meetings when they grow up.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Based on our study, we decided to watch the children for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Children s meetings began with the intention of babysitting the children.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Gradually, the matter of preparing teachers came in, and we compiled material.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The work progressed like a snowball that grows bigger and bigger as it rolls down a hill.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes the children s work needed more than fifty serving saints to prepare the material, teach the lessons, and care for the children.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many saints joined the children s service.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I returned to Taipei in 1965, I saw that there were quite a number of children.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to the brothers, from 1966 to 1967 there were about four thousand children in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, currently there are not more than five hundred children in the twenty halls in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This situation can be likened to the sun going down.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For this reason, I often reminded the brothers to pay attention to the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CHILDREN S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From our experience we feel that the children s work is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The children s work should not simply be babysitting in order for the saints to come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Due to their circumstances, the saints need to bring their children to the meeting, and there is the need to take care of the children for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, the children s work has another function, that is, to cultivate and nurture our next generation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is worthy of our careful consideration and examination.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today several young brothers are elders in various halls.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In 1949 when we began the work in Taiwan, the parents of these brothers were not married.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They were brought together by us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thirty years later, their children have grown and are serving in the church, bearing important responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Similarly, last November I was in the Philippines and was greatly surprised, because a new generation of serving ones has replaced the older generation; a younger generation has been raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The co-workers, elders, and my translators were young brothers who were born after 1950.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This situation shows that the children s work is very important.</S>
