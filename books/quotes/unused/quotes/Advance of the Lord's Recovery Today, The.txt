We thank You for Your heavenly oracle, and we thank You that You can be and would be one with us in the spirit
We feel that a better translation of this phrase is 'a ministering priest of the gospel of God' or 'a working priest of the gospel of God'
The truth concerning the priesthood began to be recovered from 1828 when the Brethren were raised up by the Lord in England
The British Brethren however saw that in the New Testament according to Revelation 15b6 and 1 Peter 25 and 9 every believer is a priest
In 1 Peter 2:5 and 9 the priesthood refers to the assembly of priests, the corporate body of priests that form a 'hood'
The Hebrew word for 'breath' is the same word for 'spirit' in Proverbs 20:27, which says, 'The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord'
Although man has a human spirit as an organ to contact God, he cannot contact God because there is a great obstacle between him and God
In addition to the four particular characteristics in God's creation of man, God added something after man's fall
After the judgment of the flood, Noah built an altar and offered sacrifices to God, which became a sweet smelling savor to God
Later in the history of mankind, the Bible tells us that God called Abraham out of the world of idols to a new land, the land of Canaan
From this fellowship, we can see that Abel, Noah, and Abraham were individual priests because they offered something to God
Before God ordained the formal, official priesthood at Mount Sinai, there were individuals offering sacrifices to God already
Eventually, all the believers will participate in the priesthood for eternity in the New Jerusalem, in which we will serve Him as priests
The priests who compose the New Jerusalem will undoubtedly have the four characteristics of man in God's creation of man
Since John the Baptist was born a priest, he should have remained in the temple, which would have been a joy to his father Zachariah
Of serving with Zachariah in the temple, he stayed in a wild place, wore wild clothing, ate wild food, and did a wild work
John the Baptist denied the entire Old Testament priesthood, but his work was the beginning of the priesthood in the New Testament
He did not offer bulls and goats as sacrifices , but he offered sinners saved through his preaching as sacrifices
From that time on, the New Testament priesthood is busy with the preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ, which is the gospel of God
We must be persons who are one with God, who know God's will, God's heart, and who receive God's oracle to speak for God
We must be those who bring God to man to impart God into man and who bring man back to God to make man one with God
A New Testament priest should be a person who lives Christ in His death, in His resurrection, and in His ascension
In the Old Testament, there were items typifying Christ, but they were not Christ in actuality in His death, resurrection, and ascension
In the New Testament, he taught much concerning our human spirit, and he used his spirit to contact God, to receive God
In Philippians 3 he expressed his desire to know Christ and the power of His resurrection that he might be conformed to the death of Christ
If we do not have all these items, we are not qualified to preach the gospel because every gospel preacher must be a priest
We are the New Testament priests, and this priesthood is not composed of a minority of the saints as a clergy that becomes a hierarchy
Peter 25 tells us that we are being built up into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ
Paul told us in Romans 15:16 that he was a priest of the gospel who offered the Gentiles saved through his preaching as sacrifices to God
To tell out God's virtues is the preaching of the gospel of God's salvation in His virtues according to our experiences
The spiritual sacrifices mentioned in 1 Peter 2:5 are the results of our telling out, the results of our preaching
By this telling out, we make sinners sacrifices and offer them to God as spiritual sacrifices for His acceptance
There are spiritual sacrifices to offer to God because there is the telling out the preaching of Gods wonderful salvation in all His virtues
Now we can see that the spiritual sacrifices are the persons saved by God's wonderful salvation through His virtues
In 15:16 he said that he was a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, an energizing priest of the gospel of God
From verse 18 of chapter one through verse 20 of chapter three we see God's condemnation on ungodly and unrighteous mankind
Our preaching work includes setting up local churches and also taking care of all the troubles in the local churches
We must be enlightened, and we must be adjusted in our thinking and in our consideration concerning our service
Our service should be the biblical gospelizing, beginning from Christ's person and consummating in the local churches
Surely the gospel of God comprises the entire book of Romans, but we need a further enlargement of our definition of the gospel of God
It is not only the entire book of Romans but also the entire twenty-seven books of the New Testament, from Matthew to Revelation
The term God's New Testament economy is new among today's Christians, so we need to be clear about the definition of this term
Joseph was the one who carried out a household administration with a certain plan for the distribution of the rich food
Even in the Old Testament, God's economy was for dispensing, or distribution, to dispense the riches of God to His chosen people
In that consummation the Triune God in His processed Trinity will be one with His redeemed people in their transformed, tripartite being
The very God entered into the womb of a young virgin and remained there for nine months to be born as a God-man
God's glad tidings, His all-inclusive gospel, is that God enters into us to be mingled with us and to be one with us for eternity
Everything covered from Christ's incarnation to the New Jerusalem are the glad tidings, the gospel, that God gave to us
We need to see how the Apostle Paul functioned as the unique pattern of the priests of the gospel in the New Testament
Just as a photograph of a person is a picture of that person, so the Old Testament priesthood is a picture of the New Testament priesthood
We have seen that our priestly duty in the New Testament is to offer saved sinners to God as spiritual sacrifices for His acceptance
In chapter five Paul shows us that Christ is the sphere and the element in which we can have the divine life and escape death
We were born in Adam, who was the sphere and element of death, but through regeneration we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ
In Romans 5 we are told that we are now in Christ, and in this Christ, who is our sphere and element, we have life
He is the very Christ in death and in resurrection to be our share, our portion, that we may partake of Him, enjoy Him, and experience Him
Peter 2:2 says, 'As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word, that by it you may grow unto salvation'
The lampstand in the tabernacle and the temple typifies Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, as the light of the world
Our enjoyment of Christ as life at the showbread table issues in our enjoying Him as the light of the lampstand
Displaying the showbread, trimming the lamp, and burning the incense are all done in the tabernacle, the dwelling place of God
In the New Testament Christ is the dwelling place of God the church is the dwelling place of God and our spirit is the dwelling place of God
We display Christ as the showbread to feed people we trim the lampstand and we burn the incense in Christ in the church and in our spirit
We have seen that the New Testament ministry to carry out God's economy is the preaching of the all-inclusive gospel of God
We offer the reality, and the reality is not just the individual Christ Himself without any enlargement or increase
One day we will see the Lord, and we will have to give Him an account concerning our living and labor on this earth
When we talk about knocking on people's doors for the preaching of the gospel, what we mean is to visit people
After the saving of sinners, Paul continued to nourish the new ones, to bring them up in the same way that we would raise up our children
When we bring up our children, we first teach them what to do, and after a period of time, we charge them to do it themselves
After revealing in Romans 1 and 2 that the believers were sinners, Paul did this feeding work in chapters three through eleven
We have to offer ourselves directly to God, but we do this by being helped, by being perfected, by the preaching apostle
After a period of time of feeding on Christ, they grow and grow in life until, spiritually speaking, they enter into their teens
Now that they are in their 'teens,' he begs them to present themselves to God, to present their bodies as a living sacrifice to God
After being perfected, the saints will do the same work as the gifted ones-the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
Because the believers are still not fully matured, there is the third step of Paul's gospel work in the New Testament priesthood
By this teaching from house to house to admonish each one of the saints, Paul ministered Christ to the saints to cause them to grow in life
We need to labor on others by warning them and teaching them in all wisdom until they are full-grown in Christ
Some of us may have grown to the stage of Romans 12:1, the stage of presenting our bodies as a living sacrifice
The apostles who handle us, who serve us with Christ, desire to present us in Christ to God as parts of the corporate Christ
Paul did not labor according to his own ability or strength, but according to Christ's operation which operated in him in power
Christ is working in us but do we realize and sense that daily day and night Christ the living One is indwelling us and operating within us
The Lord told us in the New Testament that all of His chosen people, who are today's believers, are His priests
As the New Testament priests, we have to make the preaching of the gospel a part of our daily life, our daily walk
As the New Testament priests, we should offer sinners, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and even conformed to the image of Christ
To be presented to God full-grown in Christ is the last step to finish the sacrifice of the New Testament priesthood
We all have been drugged by the traditional and unscriptural way of practicing the church life and of Christian service
The gospel of God is according to the teaching of the apostles in the New Testament and includes all of God's New Testament economy
Although the Old Testament priests did not realize this, we should realize it because we are in this present New Testament age
If we only practice having big gospel preaching meetings for ten years, most of the saints will not know how to preach the gospel
The more big gospel preaching meetings we have, the more these gifted evangelists get fostered to be the clergy
There have been some big evangelists preaching the gospel for many years, but they did not perfect others to preach the gospel
There are millions of Christians in Christianity who do not and who have not been enabled and equipped to preach the gospel
That practice fostered the building up of the clergy, and at the same time it killed the organic preaching function of each member
According to the record of the book of Acts, however, that is not the regular and ordinary preaching of the gospel
Such a practice of having only big gospel preaching meetings regularly annuls the preaching function within all the saints
Many dear saints among us have been in the church life for over ten years, but they have never been stirred up to preach the gospel
Of preaching the gospel, they feel that they can only bring their contacts to certain brothers who can explain the gospel in a proper way
Our practice has annulled the preaching ability, the preaching capacity, the preaching function, of the saints
The obligation to speak Christ is the fulfillment of our spiritual service in which we are indebted to God's salvation
It would be good if all of us could take thirty minutes to write down everyone that we know, beginning from our nearest relatives
The first crucial item of the advance of the Lord's recovery today is the priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament
We may think that it is easy to understand the organic building up of the Body of Christ, but actually this matter is difficult to define
We may have the terminology of the organic building, but we may not have the proper understanding of what this organic building actually is
Formerly in our meetings, a certain brother was appointed to share a message, and another brother led us in the reading of the Scriptures
If this is organic, however, all the shouting and excitement at sporting events, which are very spontaneous and automatic, are also organic
In order to illustrate the organic building up of the Body of Christ, let us consider the difference between a house and a tree
The house comes into existence by being built up, and the tree comes into being by growing, which is also a building up
Just as our physical body needs the circulation of the blood, the Body of Christ also needs the circulation of the divine life
The Body of Christ, as the church of God, is an organism of the Triune God, not an organization of human beings
The church as the Body of Christ is an organism, and the building up of the church as an organism is its organic growth
The Body of Christ is an organism composed of people who have the very God as the Spirit indwelling their spirit
The church as the Body of Christ is an organism of the divine person, the Triune God, to express the Triune God
The first section of Ephesians 1 tells us that the Father is dispensing Himself into us through His selection and predestination
The second section shows us that the Son is dispensing Himself into us through His redemption to make us God's inheritance
The Son as the embodiment of the dispensing Triune God entered into resurrection and ascension to become the Head of all things
The Triune God has an embodiment, who is Christ, and the issue of the Triune God is the Body of His embodiment
The church is the Body of the embodiment of the Triune God, and this Body is the fullness of the unlimited Christ
The organic building up of the Body of Christ is the increase of the Triune God in the believers for their growth in Christ
Some may have pointed out that God grows in us in knowledge, but we need to see that God Himself essentially grows in us
The building up of the Body of Christ is the increase of our processed Triune God within us in full essentially
They have God within them, but they are short of God in their conversation, in their expression, and in their attitude
They may be good brothers and sisters, but when you listen to them speak, you can sense that they are short of God
On the one hand, we are members of the organic Body of Christ, and on the other hand, we are the builders of this Body
Some sisters may say that they have very little time to read the Bible, but they may spend much time in front of a mirror combing their hair
The gifted persons are the joints of the rich supply, and the saints are the parts, the members, of the Body of Christ
Ephesians 4:16 tells us that out from Christ, the Head, all the Body causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of the Body itself
The frames of the building need to be joined closely together, and the stones of the building are put together by being interwoven
The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are the joints of the Body of Christ with the rich supply
When the joints of our physical body are exercised, the blood circulates throughout our entire body to supply our body
In the Body of Christ, the joints of the rich supply have to be exercised to promote the circulation, the fellowship, of the Spirit
In the previous chapter, we saw that the Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God, not an organization of human beings
We also saw that the organic building up of the Body of Christ is the increase of the Triune God in the believers for their growth in Christ
For the organic building up of the Body of Christ, we need to serve in an organic way by ministering Christ to others
Our ministering of Christ into others causes the increase of the essence of Christ within them for their growth in Christ
When he receives my word and brings this word to God, the Lord will have the room in him, the place in him, to move and to operate
Their objective knowledge concerning Christ may be increased, but the essence of Christ Himself within them will not increase
To merely teach ethics and not to minister Christ is the sickness and the deficiency of today's Christian work
According to my thinking, there was no need for the missionaries to come to China to teach us what we already knew
The proper Christian teaching ministers Christ not only in knowledge but also as people's life and life supply
Christian teaching ministers Christ into people essentially to cause people to gain more and more of Christ every day
For the organic building up of the Body of Christ, the elders need to shepherd all the dear saints who have problems
According to my concept, the Word merely told us that the husband should love the wife and the wife should submit herself to the husband
In their growth they build themselves up in their Christian life, and this building up overcomes all their problems
A Christian worker should minister Christ Himself as the life-giving Spirit into the saints to be their life supply
As long as we live Christ under the cross with anyone and in anything, we are getting ourselves gradually in everything into Christ
The organic building up of the Body of Christ takes place when some take the lead to live Christ under the cross
The increase of the Triune God within the believers is the growth of the Body of Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God
Day by day we need to exercise our spirit consciously, purposely, and intentionally to receive Christ essentially more and more
We're Thy total reproduction, Thy dear Body and Thy Bride, Thine expression and Thy fullness, For Thee ever to abide
We are Thy continuation, Thy life-increase and Thy spread, Thy full growth and Thy rich surplus, One with Thee, our glorious Head
Every day, beginning in the morning, we need to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord by calling, 'O Lord Jesus'
In order for the Body of Christ to be built up organically, we need to feed on the milk and food of the holy Word
We need to preach the gospel in this life-imparting, organic way to make people children of God and members of Christ
The book of Hebrews shows us two categories of God's word: one is the good word of God, and the other is the word of righteousness
The word of righteousness is deep, and it is the solid food for the mature ones so that they may be full-grown
We should always feed the believers with organic matters, that is, with God, Christ, the Spirit, life, or the word of life from the Bible
We will be judged by the Lord according to what we have been, what we have done, and how we have worked after our salvation
Enter into the joy of your lord' , or He could call us an 'evil and slothful slave' and cast us out into the outer darkness
Paul tells us in Hebrews 3 that the Lord was disgusted with them and that their carcasses fell in the wilderness
We who have been receiving mercy and grace at the throne of grace for years will eventually be judged at the judgment seat of Christ
For us to grow we need either the good word of God as milk to nourish us or the word of righteousness as solid food
We all have to grow by being nourished by the word of the Holy Bible, either the good word of God or the word of righteousness
By feeding on the milk and food of the holy Word, we grow and this growth is the very organic building up of the church
The organic building up of the Body of Christ is also through the saints being perfected, equipped, by the gifts, the gifted persons
If we are being perfected by the gifted persons-the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers-we will grow
To arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God is to arrive at the oneness of truth and of life
We may be peaceful in the churches, but when a storm comes, one saint will have his toy, and another saint will have another toy
There is also a lot of 'noise' in the churches when the saints are fighting and disputing over their views, opinions, and ideas
The church as the Body of Christ has a stature, but this stature may be very short, so the measure is not that high
The measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ is the measure of the stature of the expression of Christ, the Body of Christ
When the Lord Jesus set up His table, He told the disciples to eat the bread, and He said that this was His body which He gave for us
The measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ is the measure of the stature of the mystical Body of Christ
An older person, on the other hand, does not care for toys regardless of how much you encourage him to play with them
In chapters three and four, we saw that the Lord desires to recover the organic building up of the Body of Christ
In order for the Body of Christ to be built up, there is the need for the circulation of life and the growth in life
Every believer should be able to do the work of the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers
There is a capacity in the divine life which the believers possess and enjoy, and this capacity needs to be developed unto their ability
All these capacities need a certain amount of development, and for the development to take place there is the need of practice
The traditional practice of Christianity annuls the capacity in the divine life that the believers possess and enjoy
The practice of Christianity with one pastor speaking to many believers week after week annuls their spiritual ability and function
Ephesians 4:11-12 shows us that for the building up of the Body of Christ, the saints need to be perfected by the gifted persons
The organic building up of the Body of Christ is carried out by the living, organic perfecting of the saints by the gifts
The distance from the earth to the moon is very small compared with the universal system that Christ passed through to ascend to the height
In His ascension, Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan's captivity and took them to Himself
These gifts were constituted and formed through Christ's incarnation, human living, all-inclusive death, resurrection, and ascension
The Father gave us as gifts to the Son, and the Son gave these gifts to the church, His Body, for its building up
As a result, many Americans are able to read, write, and be active, functioning, and productive members of society
Just as people in society should be educated trained and perfected we believers also need to be perfected to function in the Body of Christ
All the believers in Christ need to be perfected by the gifted persons so that they can do the work of the gifted persons
The practice of Christianity is to educate only a small number to be the gifted persons, and these gifted persons become a class of clergy
The practice of the perfecting of the saints by the gifts is absolutely different from the practice of Christianity
In Christianity, they ask people to devote themselves, and they send these people to seminaries to study and learn the Bible
After their graduation, they become pastors who have been instructed to establish churches in an organizational way
Within twenty years, we spread the gospel to all six continents, yet we did not have formal missionaries or a mission board
In addition to preaching the gospel and establishing the churches, an apostle should be able to give the definition of the truths
We need to be taught concerning the forgiveness of sins, the cleansing of sins, justification, and reconciliation
The church life is not merely a matter of attending corporate meetings week after week with no issue or result
In the past, the saints mostly heard general teachings concerning matters such as the cross, resurrection, and ascension
Many times the saints were stirred up, but to stir up the saints without their gaining something solid is meaningless
The teachers are not there merely to stir up the students who have a willing heart to study without giving them anything solid
If you ask them to share something concerning what it means to be sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified, they cannot do it
Even though they may have heard many messages on certain truths, they are not able to share these truths with others
They may even feel that it is not their job but the job of certain gifted brothers to know these truths and to share them with others
In the past we may have preached to the saints and taught them time after time, but there was very little issue from our teaching
He told him in 2 Timothy 215 Be diligent to present yourself approved to God an unashamed workman cutting straight the word of the truth
Paul told Timothy that he should learn to cut the word straight, that is, to define the truths rightly and straightly without distortion
To teach the truths rightly and straightly in such a way without distortion is to cut straight the word of the truth
The heavenly Head, Christ, constituted Paul the apostle a gift to the Body, and He made Paul an apostle directly
One day under His sovereignty, He placed Timothy under Paul, and Paul taught Timothy and perfected him all the time
Paul charged Timothy to commit what he had heard from him to the faithful ones, who would be competent to teach others
Paul perfected Timothy, Timothy perfected the faithful ones, and the faithful ones bore the burden to perfect the other saints
If a brother goes to a place to preach the gospel and to set up the churches, he must perfect some 'Timothys' there
We all have to be perfected to do the work of the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers
The prophets listed in Ephesians 4 and the prophecy that Paul talks about in 1 Corinthians 14 are not like this
According to verses 24 and 25, when we prophesy, our speaking convicts others, judges others, and manifests the secrets of their heart
We all need to be perfected to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, and to speak the Lord into others
Prophesying is a particular gift given to a small number of the saints, and this small number become the clergy to build up a hierarchy
Whenever the Lord's children come together in the congregational way, only one person speaks for the Lord time after time
Among the congregation that is listening to him, there may be a number who are very gifted according to their natural birth
Some saints are very talented, and because they love the Lord and the Lord is filling them, they have the Spirit richly
They may give marvelous messages to their congregations at the beginning, but after a period of years, their supply is limited
In the system of Christianity the clergy is built up to be a hierarchy leaving the rest of the believers robbed annulled killed and disabled
The evangelists not only preach the gospel to save sinners to bring people to Christ but also perfect others to preach the gospel as they do
If a person is an evangelist, he should ask himself how many saints he has perfected to do the same work as he does
If someone is a lover of money, we need to preach the gospel to him in a particular way according to the kind of person he is
Moody, the great evangelist, was speaking to a certain lady after his preaching of the gospel to a large audience
If they keep talking after a certain point when the deal can be closed, they will not be able to make the deal
If a person does not have a knowledge of the basic truths, he can be affected by the speaking of the Jehovah's Witnesses
Since they practice this way, how much more should we be trained and equipped to preach the truth of the gospel?
We have to be perfected to preach the gospel as energizing priests who offer saved sinners to God as sacrifices
There is the expectation, the possibility, and even the capacity within every saint for them to be such priests
On the other hand the way of everyone preaching the gospel as New Testament priests develops the saints preaching function to the uttermost
Most people are born with the capacity of being able to speak, but if they are not allowed to speak for many years, they will become dumb
Most of the saints were not able to speak to people concerning basic matters like justification by faith and regeneration
According to the grammatical construction, 'shepherds and teachers' refers to the same class of gifted persons
Because the elders are so busy, they may not have time to make a living, so they have to be job-dropping full-timers
Peter charged the elders not to lord it over the saints because they are God's possession, allotted to the elders for their care
An elder may think that Ephesians 4:11-12 does not apply to him, but an elder should be both a shepherd and a teacher
Parents may teach their children and even help them with their homework, but they are not able to teach at a university
There are also teachers who travel through the churches to hold conferences and give the churches messages full of revelation
The gifted persons only doing the work in their respective lines without perfecting the saints is the practice of today's Christianity
The gifted persons not only do the work in their respective lines but also perfect the common believers to do what they do
Just as the Army perfects soldiers by teaching them, equipping them, and furnishing them, the gifted persons need to perfect the saints
We would like to see small numbers of saints migrating to cities and knowing how to set up the churches in these cities
The work of the ministry is the work of God's New Testament economy for the building up of the organic Body of Christ
After being perfected, the saints can do the work of the New Testament ministry to build up the Body of Christ
The organic Body of Christ is the organism of the processed Triune God because Christ is the very embodiment of the processed Triune God
We will know how to feed them, how to bring them into the group meetings, and how to bring them to meet with the saints as the church
After half a year or one year of being perfected, many saints will be enabled to go out and set up the churches
One is the traditional concept of Christianity, and the other is according to what is revealed in the Bible, the God-ordained way
It would be good if we would make a list of all the people we know, including our relatives, classmates, and colleagues
As we go with prayer, we will surely go with the Lord, with the Lord's authority, and with the Lord's sovereignty
When we go, it will be so easy for us to talk to him, and he will be ready to receive the Lord and be baptized
As we practice we will perfect ourselves to such an extent that we will be able to conduct the group meetings to the highest degree
We can put this fellowship into practice to perfect ourselves, and spontaneously we will set up a pattern for others to follow
We need to practice the priesthood, and the first step in this practice is to go to the sinners to get them saved
The entire church will be equipped to do the work of the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers
In verse 12 he says, 'So also you, since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel to the building up of the church'
When those in the Pentecostal movement talk about prophesying according to 1 Corinthians 14, they talk about it in a wrong way
The book of Isaiah the prophet has sixty-six chapters, and most of these chapters are not predicting but are speaking for the Lord
Building up is for the church, encouragement is for the believers, and consolation is for the saints' spiritual welfare
Gold, silver, and precious stones signify the three main characteristics of the Triune God, and the embodiment of the Triune God is Christ
If the Triune God were not embodied in Christ, He could not be the materials with which we could build the church
With Him there was nothing human, but one day He entered into the womb of a human virgin and stayed there for nine months
When Judas came with a band of soldiers to seize Him, Peter took a sword and cut off the right ear of the slave of the high priest
His body was a visible, touchable body, yet He suddenly appeared in the room where the disciples were, without entering through a door
He did this for forty days after His resurrection to train the disciples to enjoy His invisible, indwelling presence
All of us were conquered and carried to heaven by Christ in His ascension, and Christ presented us to the Father
In His ascension, as a man in resurrection, He received the lordship, the headship, the authority, and the kingship
The Triune God is altogether embodied in Christ, so Christ is actually the building material of the Body of Christ
They may tell us that we were too hot a few years ago, but that now we are acting properly by not attending so many church meetings
To say that we are speaking Christ is too general, but speaking encouragement is to speak Christ in a particular way
To prophesy is to speak for Christ, to speak forth Christ, and to speak Christ into others, to dispense Christ into others as everything
When all the saints prophesy, speak for the Lord, the unbelievers and unlearned persons are convicted and judged by all
She told this lady that this showed that our God, our Jesus Christ, is living and that He spoke an intimate word to her
When the whole church comes together and each one prophesies, the new ones, either non-Christians or believers, will be convicted and judged
Any church meeting should be convicting through the speaking of the saints, through the prophesying of the saints
If many saints in the meeting share on the same subject of loving others, this person certainly will be convicted by all and judged by all
Because of this, she had to repent to the Lord and ask for forgiveness and also ask her mother for forgiveness
Just after these two sharings, this new one may believe and be saved because he was convicted, judged, and exposed
When the church meeting is a meeting of mutuality in which all the saints prophesy, the riches of Christ are exhibited
When the newcomers hear him, they will say that his speaking is marvelous, but the older ones in his congregation are used to his speaking
The practice of one man speaking and the rest listening is the manmade way the natural way the way according to the customs of human society
Regardless of how powerful or capable a speaker is, his speaking cannot be as rich as the speaking of all the saints
Because of this, there is a kind of spiritual principle that no one should speak too long in the church meetings
The kind of meeting in which one gifted person speaks and the rest of the saints listen may be considered as a ministry meeting
If we only speak to carry out our obligation apart from the Spirit and life, what we speak will be mere doctrine
If all of us speak in such a way in the meetings of the church, everyone will be impressed with the riches of Christ and the presence of God
Prophesying is for the building up of the church, which is the organism of the processed Triune God, in the way of life
Whenever we gain Christ, the Christ gained by us becomes our support, our supply, and our nourishment, and then we grow
The Apostle Paul's speaking is centered on Christ for the building up of His mystical Body to fulfill God's eternal economy
Everyone prophesying for the building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ has not been seen in Christianity
Because Christianity has become deformed in relation to the divine revelation, we have to come back to the Scriptures
To prophesy is much higher and more valuable than speaking in tongues because prophesying builds up the church
Paul tells the Corinthians that since they are zealous of spiritual gifts, they should seek to excel to the building up of the church
We become excelling when we seek to prophesy because prophesying builds up the church as the organic Body of Christ
Prophesying is also excelling in convicting people, exposing people's real condition, and showing people their spiritual need
Prophesying is excelling in speaking forth Christ to minister and dispense Christ to people for their nourishment
To prophesy is to dispense Christ into people just as a waiter or a waitress in a restaurant dispenses food to people
He is our lot, our portion, and God has called us into the fellowship of this portion, the enjoyment of this portion
Many of the saints will fellowship about this, will be brought into this, and will practice this because it is in the holy Word
His capacity to walk is developed based on the growth in life with the help of some instruction from his parents
Right after someone receives the Lord Jesus and is regenerated, a desire is put within him to speak something for Christ
As he continues to practice speaking, he is like a babe who learns to stand, to walk, and eventually to run and jump
As we attend the meetings regularly and practice speaking with some instruction, we will be perfected to prophesy
A newborn babe who is only five days old is not able to speak, but as he grows in life, there is the increase of his capacity to speak
When we practice the truth in the Bible, the Triune God will be with us, and we all will enter into this truth
The obligation to prophesy is the fulfillment of our spiritual service, in which we are indebted to God's salvation
We have received the dynamic salvation, yet we have been annulled by the traditional practice that made us passive
On the other hand, we may speak for five minutes, but our speaking may be a 'sea story' with little content of Christ
A brother may even speak things in a scriptural way with quotations from the Bible but his speaking may not be the actual speaking of Christ
We can pursue, desire earnestly, and seek to prophesy by learning in the Word of God, in the growth of life, and in our contact with God
Perhaps we should even put it on our desk or hang it on our wall where we can see it every day-'No Bible, no breakfast'
Spiritually speaking, we pass through stages of infancy, babyhood, childhood, teenage, and then we become a full-grown man
If we get into the Lord's Word, pursue the growth in life, and keep ourselves in contact with God, we will learn to prophesy
In this meeting the saints can fellowship with one another, intercede for one another, and care for and shepherd one another
We need to labor together in the Lord and with the Lord so that we can have church meetings in which we all come together to prophesy
We need the group meetings so that the saints can fellowship with one another, pray for one another, and take care of one another
In these group meetings, the saints can ask questions concerning the truth and concerning life, and everyone can answer these questions
Brother Nee wrote a hymn that says for his life and for his work he is always under the light of the judgment seat of Christ
For today's life and today's work, we have to consider that day when we will stand before the judgment seat of Christ
When the Lord recovers these four major items of the advance of His recovery today, that will be a big revolution to all of the Christians
We may appreciate our shoulder, but only our little finger can 'comfort' our ear when we have an itch inside of it
Acts 20 records that Paul stayed in Troas for seven days, but it does not give a record of their meetings during those seven days
On this day they had the Lord's table and a special time for the apostle's speaking and conversation with them
They discovered that if all five thousand came together in a big hall, eventually the number of those attending the meeting would be reduced
They love the Lord and are steadfast and faithful, but none of them was accustomed to meeting on the Lord's Day with all prophesying
At the beginning of our practicing to divide into district meetings for the universal prophesying, it was not so easy
Of course, anything new is difficult, but gradually after a few months, all the saints became used to this way of meeting
They also have some brothers who act as coaches or tutors to coach and tutor the saints before they come to the meeting
Regardless of how much a person loves the Lord, he cannot prophesy properly unless he learns the 'language' of prophesying
Gods creation plus human learning builds up an ability which is a base for the Lord the saving One to give us the spiritual talent the gift
He needs to get himself soaked in the Word, to become fully familiar with all the biblical phrases and clauses
If we all live such a prophesying life, all of us will be able to speak something for the Lord when we come together
During each month, all the dear saints can practice the priesthood of the New Testament gospel by going out to visit people
When we visit people for the gospel, we do not have that much time to give them an adequate knowledge of the gospel truths
We can set up a gospel preaching and reaping meeting every month for these two evangelists to speak to the audience
They may have already been saved and baptized, but they need to hear a series of messages on the Christian faith from these two evangelists
When the young ones get some new knowledge, they may not be so happy with their older parents because they are so conservative
On the one hand, the young people need to be aggressive to pick up all the new concepts and practices of the new way
When we take this way the saints will be developed to the uttermost and more chances will be created for the riches of Christ to be released
Whatever we have among us will be manifested, the gifts among us will also be manifested, and the saints will be perfected
The second step is to have home meetings not in our homes but in the homes of the new ones for the purpose of nourishing and cherishing them
The group meetings will have the fellowship, the interceding, the mutual care, the shepherding, and the mutual teaching
Paul's desire in 1 Corinthians 14 is not just for the gifted persons as prophets to prophesy but for every common believer to prophesy
The conclusion of that conference was that they were short of manpower, despite their having many millions of members in the United States
A newborn babe has a listening organ, a speaking organ, and a seeing organ, but all these organs need years to develop
Because all his organs and members have been exercised, he can see, hear, speak, smell, walk, and do many other things
Their eyesight would become useless because the capacity, the ability, of their seeing organ would have never been developed
Nearly all the chances are given to a small number who are educated in seminary or some kind of theological school
The practice of Christianity does not give the believers equal opportunity to function as the organic members of the organic Body of Christ
From this erroneous teaching came the hierarchy of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the Pope in the Roman Catholic Church
In Peter's first Epistle, he says that the church is God's possession and that God has allotted His possession to the elders
The churches are allotted to the elders as their allotments, their portions, entrusted to them by God for their care
For someone to become a carpenter, he should finish his high school education and also learn the trade of carpentry
If a person is going to be a barber, he should finish his high school education and learn the trade of a barber
In the way that we practiced the church life, there was no possibility for us to afford equal opportunities to all the saints
In order to practice democracy, the principle and the system of government need to be completely changed to a democratic system
Perhaps a number of people were brought to these meetings by the saints, and through these meetings a number were saved and baptized
The traditional way of preaching the gospel, the old way, 'drugs' the minds of the believers concerning the preaching of the gospel
Most believers do not have the consideration that the preaching of the gospel must be every believer's obligation
We have to plant another system in which every saint is a New Testament priest to carry out the New Testament priesthood of the gospel
We may have preached the gospel in the past without having the thought that we have to be priests in order to preach the gospel
The main sacrifices he offers to God are living persons, sinners who have been regenerated to become members of the living Christ
That meeting will result in the offering of some sacrifices, but all these sacrifices will be offered up by only one or two brothers
Of going fishing, we may send out invitations, spreading them in the 'ocean' and asking the 'fish' to come to our gospel preaching meeting
He did not build a big meeting hall or a big cathedral and send out invitations inviting people to come to hear Him speak
Visiting people for the preaching of the gospel is God's ordained way, and this is also the way practiced by the Lord Jesus
He sent the twelve to go to the cities and villages to visit the lost sheep of the house of Israel and bring them peace
He sent the seventy to go to every city and seek the sons of peace , whom God the Father had chosen in eternity past
In order to carry out the priesthood of the gospel, we have to go to the wolves because among the wolves there are some sons of peace
When we get two or three baptized, we need to stop producing more new ones in order to care for these two or three
On the one extreme, we may not go to preach the gospel, saying that it is too difficult to visit people by knocking on their doors
After three months, however, we may get excited and go out to knock on doors to get twelve baptized in one month
We need to go out to preach the gospel in a regular way, but we also need to exercise to control the new births
If we get three baptisms in the first week, we should stop and go back to the baptized ones twice a week to nourish and cherish them
We need to go back to them in a sober way with much prayer and fellowship with the Lord to help them by feeding them
To feed someone does not mean that you have to give him a lecture, a message, a doctrine, or even a small booklet
If we visit the new ones, but do not minister Christ to them, this will cause them to starve, so there will be no growth, no building up
After feeding them for a period of time, we have to lead them, to beg them, and to help them offer themselves to God as living sacrifices
When we bring them to the group meetings spontaneously they will participate in the fellowship interceding and mutual care with the saints
Among all the meetings in the church life, no other meeting is as intimate, as practical, and as all-inclusive as the group meeting
Some hold the concept that the big congregation can be divided into groups, making every group a worshipping group of believers
When they come together, they come together with the understanding that they need to worship God in a traditional and religious way
When we have a group meeting in a traditional way without the Spirit and without life, everyone will be disappointed
Because the wife cannot go to the meeting with him, this brother goes by himself to the group meeting with his Bible and hymnal
Because this brother does not know the sister that well, they do not talk to one another, and they wait for someone else to come
As one of the elders, he feels that he must do something, so he asks the saints to start the meeting by singing a hymn
We may consider that this is a group meeting, but this is Christian service and Christian worship in a traditional, inorganic way
When we first proposed to have the group meetings, nearly all the churches had the group meetings in a traditional way
The saints may not even want to return to such a meeting because there is very little enjoyment and hardly anything genuine there
Throughout the day he practices to be one with the Lord, to live in the Lord's presence, by calling on His name and by singing
As the saints begin to fellowship with one another, some prayers are made, and these prayers are interceding prayers
In this kind of meeting there is no set program, but things are brought out according to the needs of the saints
Another brother can continue by saying, 'Today this kind of circumcision by the cross of Christ is applied by the Spirit within us
After about nine or more months, this group may grow to about thirty-five because they have brought in some new ones
To come together to incite one another to love and good works and to exhort one another is by our being in our spirit
It implies giving instructions, even with rebuking, admonishing, and warning, but this is not done without consoling
We also have to go to their homes, from house to house, to admonish them as Paul did night and day with tears even for three years
Both the brothers and the sisters need to be nursing mothers and entreating and consoling fathers in taking care of the new ones
It is better to have the group meetings one week in our home, the next week in someone else's home, and the third week in another's home
Today only a minority of the saints can do the work of the ministry, but the day will come when everyone will be able to do the same thing
The perfecting of the saints also helps the saints to be no longer babes carried about by every wind of teaching
If we are persons always under the light that we may be enabled to know the divine things, we will be able to prophesy
To prophesy we need to be always ready to receive spiritual inspiration in the constant fellowship with the Lord
In the past, we may not have known what to speak or how to speak, but now we can have something when we come to the meeting
At the beginning, what we speak may not be so organic, but we should try again and again by exercising our spirit
If we love the Lord and allow the Spirit to work in us, this working will be added to our natural capacity, producing a spiritual gift
As a result some of the saints will not only prophesy in the Lords Day morning meetings but will also prophesy in the way of giving messages
The phrase 'one another' indicates that Paul is not talking about a meeting of the entire congregation of the local church
If we were invited to a feast and there were only empty glasses on the table with no dishes, we would be very disappointed
These truth lessons are based upon the holy Word, but if we handle these lessons in an improper way, they will become empty and dead
We need to exercise our spirit whenever we come to the Holy Bible or to the printed ministry that opens up the Bible
Our Lord's table meetings should also have these four basic elements and factors: the Word, the Spirit, praying, and singing
Many new ones who attend the Lord's table may partake of the bread without knowing the significance of the bread
We need to have the Lord's table in a living way that is full of singing, full of praying, full of the Spirit, and full of the holy Word
They need someone to speak a living word in the table meeting concerning the significance of the cup that we drink
If there are no group meetings in our local church, our church life cannot be that practical, strong, and living
Before a brother begins to eat his dinner, he can sing to the Lord with a view that he is going to the group meeting
After he eats dinner, he can continue to sing to the Lord and keep singing in his car on the way to the meeting
Together they can pray, 'Lord Jesus, how we thank You for Your cleansing blood which keeps us living in Your presence and joyful in You
Thank You that we can live in Your presence without any hindrances or obstacles because Your blood cleanses us all the time'
The cleansing blood that this brother and his wife experience on the way to the meeting can be a subject for the group meeting
We began to thank and praise the Lord for His precious blood that always keeps us living in His marvelous and wonderful presence'
When we confess our sins and apply the Lord's blood to our situation, this blood cleanses us in the eyes of God'
When this brother gives such a word, it is a teaching to the young sister and also to all the other attendants
When we confess our sins to God and apply the blood of the Lamb, which is the blood of the Lord Jesus, this blood washes away our sins
If this kind of spontaneous teaching takes place in our group meetings the saints will hear something of the truth every week and yearround
After the two brothers speak, a young sister who is strong in praising the Lord may say, 'Lord Jesus, how we praise You!
These teachings are not out of a lesson book as in a classroom, but they are teachings in a living way through the fellowship
Another young brother who was recently saved last week may ask another question concerning what God's economy is
We should not assign anyone to take the lead in a group meeting, but someone will spontaneously bear the responsibility of that group
If we assign a brother to be the leader of a group meeting and also assign a helper to help him, this is organization
Just as we illustrated, the truth concerning the blood of Christ, the Sabbath, and God's economy may be taught in a group meeting
When we come to the group meetings, however, we should forget about having lessons according to the proper sequence
If we read just a few lines from the Recovery Version footnotes or the Life-studies, we will receive some profit
The group meetings are also for us to participate in the fellowship, interceding, and mutual care with the saints
If some problems or hardships arise in the group meeting that the members cannot solve, they can refer these matters to the elders
He shared with them all the things concerning God's will, including God's purpose, God's plan, and God's economy
We co-workers must cooperate with the Lord, doing our best to speak in the meetings and also to go to the homes of the saints
We can go to him and make an appointment with him to see him the next day or at a time that is convenient for him
If we work as Paul worked, the saints will be properly raised up through our instruction, teaching, charge, warning, and admonishing
To have merely a Lord's Day morning meeting with a good speaker in a congregation cannot take care of the Lord's interest
The traditional, unscriptural practice of Christianity just maintains a big congregation as a facade to make a show
We should not advise the saints in an ethical, philosophical, and logical way without ministering God in Christ to them
If we merely minister ethics to people, our work is in the same nature as the work of someone like Confucius, who had many ethical teachings
The New Testament revelation concerning the priesthood of the gospel is entirely different from the practice in Christianity
Because the priesthood of the gospel is according to the divine biblical revelation and not according to human thought we have to receive it
The Lord Jesus said that all authority had been given to Him in heaven and on earth, and then He charged us to go and disciple the nations
She may have three children-one in kindergarten, one in elementary school, and another one in junior high school
All three children are different with their particular characteristics, and they may want different things for breakfast
Because she realizes that this is her duty as a housewife, she carries out her daily duty regardless of her feeling
Later as He traveled, He saw Matthew the publican sitting in the customs office, and He said to him, 'Follow Me'
Luke 8:1 tells us that the Lord Jesus traveled from city to city and from village to village to visit and gain the sinners
If they are not at home but working in the factory, we may need to go visit them in the factory during the time that they have a break
When someone answers the door we may say, 'We were sent by Jesus Christ to come here to pass on grace and peace to you'
We must go out to visit people with much prayer and with much realization that we are not ordinary persons but God's priests
We came to make him rich in salvation, rich in Christ, rich in grace, rich in peace, and rich in many other things
We should go back to visit these new ones again and again until we realize that they are settled in the Christian faith
We can bring them to the group meetings so that they can become acquainted with other Christians and have fellowship with them
After we feel that these new ones have been raised up, we can go out to get some others saved, and we can do this kind of work year-round
To raise up children is not an easy task, but if we do it properly, regularly, constantly, and continuously, it will not be too difficult
If many saints labor as priests of the gospel, there will be a good percentage of increase in all of the local churches
He proposed that we put this kind of meeting aside and encourage all the saints to go out and preach the gospel on the Lord's Day
It was hard for them to change because they had been practicing according to the traditional way for many years
From the time of its delivery, an infant is complete in the sense of having all the capacities in its human life for it to function properly
An infant's growth in life will increase what he can practice, and the more he practices, the more development he will gain
Now we are the children of God, and there are many capacities in the divine life that we have received from our spiritual birth
Despite all of these capacities many have been Christians for years and they can do very little for the Lord in the way of spiritual service
We may have been saved for many years, yet we have never spent an adequate time with our relatives to speak Christ to them
After six months of this kind of exercise, a brother or sister will be a top expert in preaching the gospel by visiting people
We can carry out the New Testament priesthood of the gospel on the one hand and the perfecting of the saints on the other hand
In totality, however, the work of all the saints put together will be much more than the work of the gifted persons alone
Now the Lord has given us the new light that we have to practice the universal prophesying because Paul says we can all prophesy one by one
That was a special meeting for a gifted person such as the Apostle Paul to function for the perfecting of the saints
We need to see, however, that there is much need of the proper, able, capable, and experienced prophets among us
When the saints in Tokyo had this big gospel preaching meeting in this small town, over three hundred new ones came
Because of the Lord's rich mercy, we may have a number of gifted evangelists among us, and they can be used to reap the new ones
There could even be an entire weekend of big gospel meetings for the purpose of reaping the new contacts of the saints
Not every believer can give such a long message on a certain topic of the gospel but every believer can visit people to bring them to Christ
Although the new ones have believed and called on the name of the Lord Jesus, they may wonder how we can prove that God exists
Ephesians 4:16 shows us that the Body causes itself to grow by two categories of members: the joints of the rich supply and each one part
In the organic Body of Christ, everyone should be busy with much to do, but is the situation among us today like this?
A number of the saints among us are really gifted, but they are covered and even annulled by our present practice
The priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament is altogether missing in the practice of the Lord's children today
Prophesying for the building up of the church is mentioned clearly in 1 Corinthians 14, but where is such a practice on this earth?
