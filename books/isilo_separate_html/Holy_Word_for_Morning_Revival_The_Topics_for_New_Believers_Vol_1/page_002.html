Some people consider that it is impossible to know today that we are saved, while others think that after we are saved we may still perish. The Bible shows us, however, that our salvation is not a matter of speculation nor is it a matter of uncertainty. Rather, it is something which can be confirmed with assurance and which we may know with full confidence.</p> <h2 class="head1">Receiving Salvation at the Moment of Believing</h2><p>Many people consider that believing is a present matter and that receiving salvation is a future matter, that is, that a man believes today and will be saved in the future. However, the Bible tells us clearly and definitely that at the moment a man believes, he is saved (Acts 16:31; Rom. 10:10). It is not that he will be saved in the future, but that he is already saved today. He is saved at the very time that he believes. Salvation immediately follows believing, for there is no space of time between the two.</p><h2 class="head1">Being Redeemed</h2><p>When a person believes, he is saved. The Bible clearly reveals that when a person believes, he is forgiven of his sins (Acts 10:43; 1 John 2:12), freed (John 3:18; Gal. 3:13), washed (1 Cor. 6:11; Acts 15:9), sanctified (1 Cor. 6:11; Acts 26:18), justified (Rom. 5:1; 3:28, 30; Gal. 3:8, 24; Acts 13:39), and reconciled to God (Rom. 5:10). Therefore, when we believe, we are redeemed and we are saved.</p><h2 class="head1">Being Regenerated</h2><p>When a person believes, he is not only redeemed but also regenerated. John 1:12-13 clearly points out that anyone who believes in the Lord is born of God and becomes a child of God. Hence, as long as a man believes into the Lord Jesus, he is regenerated, he has God&#8217;s eternal life, and he will not perish forever (John 3:15-16); that is, he is saved.</p><h2 class="head1">Passing out of Death into Life</h2><p>When a person believes, he passes out of death into life. John 3:16 and 5:24 tell us that he who believes has eternal life, and he will not be judged nor will he perish; he has passed out of death into life. Hence, as long as we believe, we have eternal life, and we are no longer condemned or judged; we have passed out of death into life.</p><p>The above three points clearly prove that we need only to believe, and we are saved immediately.<sup>13</sup></p><h2 class="head1">The Assurance of Salvation</h2><p>If you recently have had the experience of receiving Christ, you may have had times when you doubted the reality of that experience; that is, you may have questioned whether you were really saved. Without the real assurance of salvation as a solid foundation, it is difficult for a new Christian to grow and experience the deeper things of the Christian life. Nevertheless, the Bible says it is possible to know absolutely, unreservedly, that you are a saved person. How can this be? Let us read 1 John 5:13: &#8220;I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God.&#8221;<sup>14</sup> Brothers! The Bible does not say, &#8220;I give these happy feelings to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God.&#8221; If the Bible were written in this way, one would not be saved if he did not feel anything. But the Bible says, &#8220;I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life&#8221; (1 John 5:13).<sup>15</sup> It is not, &#8220;that you may think,&#8221; not, &#8220;that you may hope,&#8221; but &#8220;that you may know.&#8221; We do not need to wait until we die to find out; this assurance is for us to enjoy today.<sup>16</sup></p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
