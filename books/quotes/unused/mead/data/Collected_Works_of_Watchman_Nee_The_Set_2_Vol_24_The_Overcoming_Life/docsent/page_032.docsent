   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR WEAKNESS BEING OUR BOAST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Corinthians 12:9 says, "And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This shows us that we should not only consider ourselves weak, powerless, and incapable, but also rejoice in our weakness, powerlessness, and incapability.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Does this verse say that we should weep for our weakness?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No, on the contrary, it says that we should rejoice over our weaknesses, and we should not just rejoice but also boast in our weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is boasting in one's weaknesses?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The whole world mourns for its weaknesses, but the overcomers boast in their weaknesses because they have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brothers and sisters, do you feel that you have some problems?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do you feel that you have some failures?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You have to realize that your problems and failures are a blessing to you; they are there to help you overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once in Chefoo I met a doctor who had been saved for three or four years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He had served in the army for over ten years, and his demeanor reflected that of a soldier; he was direct and forthright.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There was no question about his salvation; however, he had a habit of smoking cigarettes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Smoking did not pose a major problem to him when he was in Manchuria, but when he came to Chefoo, things became a little more difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There were seventy or eighty people in the church, and Chefoo was a small place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The only place he could smoke was at home.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But even at home, he dared not smoke in the open because his wife was a sister.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the hospital where he worked, there were a few nurses who were our sisters as well.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the one hand, he wanted to smoke, but on the other hand, he felt embarrassed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whenever he heard someone approaching while he was smoking, he had to hurriedly extinguish his cigarette.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When he smoked on the street, he had to first look in front and behind to see whether there were any familiar faces.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He could not quit smoking, yet it was painful for him to continue smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did not know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After one of my meetings, he came to me and made an appointment to see me the next morning at 9:00.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He told me that he had very important things to talk about.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The next morning when he came, he told me his whole story.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He said that he had been smoking for over ten years and could not quit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more he spoke, the more I turned my face towards the ceiling and laughed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He said, "Mr. Nee, this is a serious matter." I said that I knew it was a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He said that he could do nothing about it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I said, "It is wonderful that you can do nothing about it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nothing sounds better than hearing that you can do nothing about it."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He asked me why, and I said, "I rejoice because only the Lord can deal with this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I can do nothing about it, and you can do nothing about it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Your wife can do nothing about it, and the brothers and sisters can do nothing about it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>With such an ideal patient, the Lord Jesus will have good business for His clinic again."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He told me that it was not a light matter that he could do nothing about it for over ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I agreed, but said, "This is difficult for you, but there is nothing difficult with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He can turn the situation just like that."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I went on saying, "Dr. Shi, you are a good doctor, and I have good health.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, you do not need me, and I do not need you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you want to demonstrate your skill on me, I must first be sick, and not just sick of an ordinary illness, but of a serious illness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more serious my illness, the more your skill will be made manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today the Lord Jesus is here.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He can deal with what you, Dr. Shi, cannot deal with." He asked what I meant, and I quoted 2 Corinthians 12:9: "My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It was good that he wanted to quit smoking and wonderful that he could not quit smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But he still did not understand the words of 2 Corinthians 12:9.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It was wonderful that he could not quit smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It would not have been that wonderful if he did not have to smoke, because 2 Corinthians says that the power of Christ is perfected only in man's weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I said, "To you, it is bad to smoke.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But to God, your not being able to quit smoking is wonderful."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He was dumbfounded, and his eyes stared at me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I told him, "Never think that your smoking is lamentable or that it is unfortunate.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You have to tell the Lord, I thank and praise You that I smoke.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I thank and praise You that I cannot quit smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Yet Lord, I thank and praise You that You can make me quit smoking, and You can help me to stop smoking.'"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He asked doubtingly, "Can God really do it?"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I answered, "Indeed, He can."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then we prayed together.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>First I prayed a few words, and then he followed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He had the faith, and his prayer was in the tone of a typical soldier.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He spoke in an honest way, "God, I thank and praise You because I smoke.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Lord, I thank and praise You because I cannot quit smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Lord, I thank and praise You because You can quit smoking for me."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After he prayed and while his tears were still wet, he put on his hat and was ready to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I asked him, "Dr. Shi, will you still smoke?" He said, "I, Tsai-lin Shi, cannot quit smoking, but God can quit for me." I knew that he would be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the evening I was a little concerned about him and asked those in the hospital what had become of him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I found out that everything was proceeding smoothly.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The next morning I checked on him again, and the answer was the same.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Everything was all right with him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>That afternoon when I met him, he told me that he was debating with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>His wife had complained to him for over ten years about his smoking, but he had never been able to quit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>After he spoke with God, his cigarette smoking was gone within half an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He said, "I did not smoke yesterday, and I did not smoke today."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When I was about to leave, I asked again, "Do you think that you, Dr. Shi, can quit smoking?" He said no. I asked, "What then are you going to do?" He said, "The Lord will quit for me." At that word, I left in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Brothers and sisters, do not think that you will change.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Five years from now, you will still lose your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Victory is a matter of Christ living for you.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You can declare, "Thank and praise the Lord that I cannot make it, but Christ can."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I wish I could tell the whole world about this.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I am not afraid of a bad temper.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I am not afraid of quick dispositions.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I am not afraid of inordinate pride.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I am only afraid of those who do not see their own inability and do not see that Christ is able.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Brothers and sisters, it is good that you praise God for your victory.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But you must also praise God for your weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Your weaknesses work all the more to manifest Christ's power.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I thank God that Watchman Nee is corrupt beyond hope.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I thank Him that Christ's power is once more perfected through me.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I tell the Lord that I have no goodness, righteousness, holiness, patience, or calmness in me.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Thank and praise God that I do not have any of these things, and that I do not try to have them anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>"O Lord, from now on, I commit everything to You.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>From now on, it is Your Son who will overcome for me."</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If you will do this, you will immediately overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>You can overcome within a minute, even within a second.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>IMPOSSIBLE WITH MAN BUT POSSIBLE WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Luke 18 shows us a young man who could not make it, while Luke 19 shows us Zaccheus who made it.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>"Lord, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much" v. 8 . He made it right there.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Zaccheus did what the young man could not do.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Luke 18 shows us that with men it is impossible, while Luke 19 shows us that with God everything is possible.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The old man in Luke 19 was able to do what the young man in Luke 18 could not do.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>In Luke 18, the young man could not do what the Lord told him to do.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In Luke 19, the Lord did not say much to the old man, but he believed.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The young man did not make it, because he did not believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The old man and his household were the sons of Abraham; they had faith, and salvation came to that house.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>This was God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Brothers and sisters, we have to thank and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We cannot love.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We cannot endure.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We cannot be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We cannot be meek.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>But there is not one verse in the Bible, not one word from God, that tells us that we should live a life which we are capable of living or that we should do what we are capable of doing.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>God always tells us to do what we cannot do and to live a life which we cannot live.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Every morning, I wake up to thank and praise God, because it is another day for Him to perform His miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>In the evening, I thank and praise Him for the miracles He has performed that day.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Today God is enabling me to endure what I otherwise could not endure.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>He is enabling me to love what I otherwise could not love.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>He is enabling me to do what I otherwise could not do and act the way which I otherwise could not act.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Thank and praise Him!</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Every day we experience the words: "The things that are impossible with men are possible with God"!</S>
