   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>b Inventing Cattle-raising</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>for Making a Living</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Adah, Lamech's first wife, bore Jabal and Jubal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jabal was the father of cattle-raising 4:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He invented cattle-raising for the purpose of making a living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He became a nomad, wandering from place to place, because he had no land that would yield to him its strength.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No one in the United States is willing to be a nomad, because the land in this country is very fertile.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, there is no need for anyone here to be a nomad.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, Jabal found that the land would not yield its strength to him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This forced him to be a wanderer and to keep cattle that he might make a living.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The matter of making a living for one's self is a main aspect of man's culture.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The city was invented for man's existence, and cattle-raising was invented for man's living.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>c Inventing Music for Amusement</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jubal invented music 4:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He invented harps and pipes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In fact, the very name Jubal means "jubilee" or "a joyful sound" or "music."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What is music?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Music is a type of amusment which makes people joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why does man need such amusement?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because he has lost God as his joy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God is man's true enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A number of times in the past when my friends invited me to attend the movies with them, I said to them, "I don't need that.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have something much better than your movie."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I don't even need to watch television, for I have a heavenly television.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everything in the New Jerusalem has been televised to me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I can never forget an experience I had when visiting the city of Houston.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A friend was taking me on a tour of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, I told him, "As long as I have seen the New Jerusalem, I don't need to see any earthly city."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am not speaking nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I really mean it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One day, in the year 1937, I was preaching the gospel in the capital city of Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was a good time of preaching, and the gospel was prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After one of the meetings, a smart young lady, dressed in a very worldly and fashionable way, came to me and said, "Mr. Lee, I have been convinced by your preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I would even decide to believe in your Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But this decision depends upon one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am a lover of the theater.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Tell me, after becoming a Christian, will I still be allowed to attend the theater?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That question bothered me a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I realized that she was convinced and that she was willing to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, if I answered her question in a negative way, she would not decide for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nevertheless, as a gospel preacher, how could I answer her in the affirmative?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As I was considering the way to answer her, I looked to the Lord for a wise reply, and He gave me one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I said to this young lady, "You have your young son with you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose that one day he plays with a sharp knife, and you feel that it is dangerous for him to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How would you deal with him?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Would you force him to drop the knife, or would you grab the knife out of his hand?"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She said, "No, I would simply throw some candies or apples on the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I'm sure that he would drop the knife and pick up the candies and apples.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The knife would be gone because his hands would be filled with better things."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then I said, "It is exactly the same with you in attending the theater.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you will take Jesus, He will fill you up, and you will have no capacity for anything else."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>She said, "Marvelous, I will believe."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then I told her, "You must do it now."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>She replied, "Yes, I will do it now.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I believe in the Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>She was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Why do people attend the movies and go dancing?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because they are empty.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They do not have God as their joy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The reason I do not attend the movies is not because the church has a regulation against it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The church does not have a list of commandments against such things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, although there is no such prohibition, I would not attend a movie even if you paid me thousands of dollars to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I have something better.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I am filled with Christ and I have no capacity for anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Jubal invented music because, at that time, man was empty.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He was in vanity, and nothing could satisfy him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Since nothing could amuse him, he had to devise some amusement for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The principle is the same with every kind of entertainment today.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>People need entertainment because they do not have God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Some of you are familiar with the story of the Welsh Revival which occurred approximately seventy years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>During that time, in the whole island of Wales, all the theaters and amusement places were closed because all the people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They had something better than worldly entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They had Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Lamech fulfilled his lusts, and Adah adorned and beautified herself with ornaments.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Of these two parents Jubal, the inventor of music, was born.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Here we see a family composed of lust, adornment, and amusement.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What a family it was!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Many families today are the same: the fathers fulfill their lusts, the mothers care for their dress and adornment, and the children pursue amusement.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Is not this the modern family?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In Genesis 4 we can see two families in opposition to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Adam's family was a gospel-believing family.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The father cut the way of believing in the gospel, the mother paved the way, and the son, Abel, walked on this way.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But Lamech's family was a world-pursuing family.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The father fulfilled the lusts, the mother cared for adornment, and the son, Jubal, pursued amusement.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>What a contrast!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I do not like to be a member of Lamech's family.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Praise the Lord, we are members of the gospel-believing family!</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The seed sown in Genesis 4 will continue to develop until it becomes a harvest in the Great Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Revelation 18 enumerates many items of merchandise, all of which are for three things to fulfill lusts, to adorn people, and to amuse people.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If you remove these things from human society, all of the department stores will be closed.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>What do department stores sell?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They sell things for the gratification of man's lust, for the adornment of women, and for the amusement of young people.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is the reason that whenever I enter a department store I have the deep conviction that I am going into hell.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>My wife can testify that for over three years I have not gone into one department store.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Thus, modern society is an enlargement of the record in Genesis 4.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The principle of each item remains exactly the same.</S>
