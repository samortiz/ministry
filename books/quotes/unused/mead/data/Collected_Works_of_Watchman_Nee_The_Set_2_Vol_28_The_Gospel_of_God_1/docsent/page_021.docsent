   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Romans 7 explains this matter very clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us look at this chapter, beginning with verses 7 and 8, "What then shall we say?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Is the law sin?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Absolutely not!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But I did not know sin except through the law; for neither did I know coveting, except the law had said, You shall not covet.'</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, worked out in me coveting of every kind; for without the law sin is dead."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without the law, I do not feel that coveting is sin, even though there is coveting within me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, coveting within me is dead; that is, I am not conscious of it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, after the law comes, I resolve not to covet anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But I still covet, and the sin is made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 9 says, "And I was alive without the law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Friends, remember that God gave you the law for one reason only: to show you that you have always been full of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because you did not see your own sin, you acted proudly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The law came to try you out.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You may say that you do not covet.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However if you just try not to covet, what will be the eventual result?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more you try, the weaker you become and the more covetous you will be.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You purpose not to covet, but the moment you purpose this way, you find yourself coveting everything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You covet today, and you will covet tomorrow; you covet everywhere you turn.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now sin is alive, the law is alive, and you are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Originally sin was dead and you were fine, but now that the law has come you cannot avoid coveting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more you try not to covet, the more covetous you become.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The problem is that man's being is fleshly, and because man is fleshly, his will is weak, his conduct is rebellious, and his desires are filthy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 10 says, "And the commandment, which was unto life, this very commandment was found to me to be unto death."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If man can truly keep the law, he will live.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But I cannot keep it; hence, I die.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 11 says, "For sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the law had not told me that I should not do this or that, sin would go easy on me and would not be that active in me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But ever since the law came and told me that I should not covet, sin through the commandment has tempted me and put this matter of coveting in my mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The law tells me that I should not covet, and I purpose not to covet; but instead of not coveting, I covet even more.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For a period of time I felt that I had been lying.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I did not lie deliberately, but I would sometimes unintentionally say too much about something or too little about something else.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I realized this, I resolved that from then on with me yes would be yes and no would be no. Regardless of whom I spoke to, I resolved to speak accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before I resolved this, I really did not lie that much, but after I made the decision, it became so easy for me to lie.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I was actually getting worse.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The following Sunday I sent a note saying that I would not give a message that day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When I was asked for a reason, I said, "I have found out that my speaking is full of lies.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is quite serious.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am afraid that even my message will be all lies."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I did not pay attention to lying, lying seemed dead.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Of course, that does not mean that I did not lie.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, it was not until I started paying attention to lying, not until I was enlightened by the law to deal with my lies, that I felt that all my words were lies.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It seems that lies were standing right next to me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, I have found that originally the lies were dead, but now the lies have been made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everywhere I turn, the lies are there.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Sin has killed me through the law and I become helpless.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 12 continues, "So then the law is holy, and the commandment holy and righteous and good."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should never consider the law evil.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The law is always holy, righteous, and good.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"Did then that which is good become death to me?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Absolutely not!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But sin did" v. 13a . At the beginning, sin was dead and I was not conscious of it; but when the law came to check me out, I became dead.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"Did then that which is good become death to me?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Absolutely not!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But sin did, that it might be shown to be sin by working out death in me through that which is good, that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful" v. 13 . Initially, we did not sense that sin is that sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But when the law came and we tried to keep it, we realized where our sins are and how sinful and thoroughly evil they are.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You can see the function of God's law here.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The law is like a thermometer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A thermometer will not give you a fever. but if you have a fever, the thermometer will surely make it manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The law will not cause you to sin, but if you have sins, God's law will immediately show you that you are a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Originally, you did not know that you are a sinner, but now you do.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The law came to judge man's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The law was established because man has sin.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You never see God keeping the law because there is simply no possibility for God to transgress the law.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hence, no law is put upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God never told the Lord Jesus to love the Lord His God with all His heart, with all His soul, with all His strength, and with all His will, and to love His neighbor as Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord Jesus simply did not need it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He spontaneously loves the Lord His God with all His heart, with all His soul, with all His strength, and with all His will; He spontaneously loves His neighbor as Himself, even beyond Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, the law is useless to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>And God did not tell Adam not to covet and not to steal.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Why would Adam need to covet?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Why would Adam need to steal?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God had already given everything on the earth to him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Ten Commandments were not given to Adam because Adam had no need of them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Rather, the law was specifically given to the Israelites because it showed fleshly man his inward condition and his sin within.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If no Chinese had ever stolen, there would be no need for a clause in Chinese law concerning stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Because man steals, there is a clause in the law which says that one should not steal.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Hence, the law exists because of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When man sinned, the law came in.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Now let us come back to Galatians 3 and continue with verse 19: "Why then the law?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It was added because of the transgressions."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Now we are clear.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>God purposed before the times of the ages to give grace to man.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Later He gave Abraham a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In eternity it was merely His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>With Abraham, it was something spoken: He would deal with man in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Why then did God give man the law four hundred and thirty years after that?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It was added because of the transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In order for man's sins to become transgressions, the law was given to man.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In this way, man realized that he had sin and would wait "until the seed should come to whom the promise was made" v. 19 . It was not until the whole world saw that they were sinners and that they were really hopeless that they were willing to receive the Lord Jesus Christ whom God had promised.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Even if God had given man His salvation earlier, man would not have taken it.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Man does not want God's grace, but because man has transgressions and is hopeless, he will possibly receive God's grace.</S>
