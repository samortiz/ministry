   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ABSOLUTELY RIGHTEOUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This wonderful Person fulfilled all righteousness Matt 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is nothing wrong with Him in any aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we look at Him, we see that He is righteous in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In fact, righteousness is His very substance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His very name is, The Lord Our Righteousness Jer 23:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is our righteousness because He is so righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He absolutely fulfills all of God s divine, glorious, holy, and righteous requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is so righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our rightness is not absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may be righteous in one aspect, yet unrighteous in another.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But Jesus is absolutely righteous in every aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE SEED OF WOMAN TO BRUISE SATAN</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As the righteous One, He was tempted by Satan in the wilderness Matt 4:1-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But Satan s temptation was God s test.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God put this righteous One under Satan s temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God seemed to say, Satan, try this One.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You tried Adam, and Adam failed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now try this One.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Satan tried, but this time he failed!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Satan tempted Him to abandon His standing of being a man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He said, If thou be the Sonof God, command that these stones be made bread Matt 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you or I were the Lord, we would probably have answered his challenge, and turned the stones into bread.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But listen to how the Lord Jesus answered.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is written, Man shall not live....</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Matt 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It seems that the Lord was telling Satan, I am a man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yes, I am the Son of God, but I take the position of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Don t you remember what God said in Genesis 3:15?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He said the seed of the woman would bruise your head.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now I have come as the seed of woman.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Don t tempt Me to act as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am the Son of Man, and I have come to bruise you!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is Jesus, the seed of woman!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In His answer to Satan, He also told us how He lived by feeding on the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Matt 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The word that proceeded out of God s mouth was His nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was a man who lived by feeding on God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE ATTRACTING LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was such a man that eventually became the great light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The people which sat in darkness saw a great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up Matt 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before this man came, the whole situation was in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But He came as a great light, shining over all the darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then this great light attracted the disciples Matt 4:18-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When I was young I could not understand why Peter and Andrew, James and John left their fishing and mending works so quickly to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Jesus just asked them to follow Him, and immediately they came.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you or I were to say this, no one would follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But the disciples abandoned their works, gave up their father, and their boat, and followed Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It must have been some kind of attraction.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This man Jesus was really an attraction.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once Jesus appears, you will be attracted; you cannot escape.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is the great light, and by His shining so many were attracted.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>ONE WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Following this, we have Matthew 5 7, where Jesus gives the teaching on the mount.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When He came down He began to travel through the promised land.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In all those travelings He behaved in a marvelous way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the one hand He suffered persecution, but on the other hand He was approved by the religion that existed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, He was always one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There was no discrepancy between Him and God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When the circumstances were poor, He would still thank the Father Matt 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we are in good circumstances, it is easy to thank the Lord, but it is not so easy otherwise.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To build up the church, we need such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need a life that is one with God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need a life that has no discrepancy with God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our life is not this kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, we are not qualified for the church building.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is only one life that is qualified, the life of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Jesus is the life that is absolutely one with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There is no discrepancy between Him and the Father.</S>
