   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT THE GOAL OF WATCHMAN NEE'S MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Watchman Nee had a definite goal for his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His ministry focused on Christ and was expressed in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The goal of his ministry was to establish local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He preached the gospel with the intention of producing material for the building of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His Bible teaching, edifying the young believers, holding conferences, conducting trainings, and issuing publications were all with the goal and view of building a corporate testimony in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By reading his writings we can realize that he received a clear vision and a definite commission from the Lord concerning this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>HIS EMPHASIS ON THE GOAL</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the introduction of his book The Assembly Life, he stressed this goal emphatically:</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>...Before times eternal, God had a will and a foreordained plan of His own.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His goal is to have a group of people containing His life who are like His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The goal of God was to establish not just the individual Christ, but also the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This corporate Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From this we can know that it is the church which God pays attention to today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Unfortunately, it is not only the carnal believers who fail to emphasize what God stresses, but even the spiritual believers fail to emphasize it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They always replace the church of God with many works.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today what Satan causes man to do is substitute the church of God with various kinds of work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, we know that the purpose of God from beginning to end is to have a corporate Christ, which is the church, so that Christ might be the Head and the believers might be the members.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Satan is determined to destroy this plan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why he causes man to pursue various works in order to replace the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today some lay much stress on preaching the gospel, and by so doing they replace the church with gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are many today who can surely preach the gospel and save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And preaching the gospel is good, but if gospel preaching replaces the church and causes men never to think about the church, then we are definitely deceived by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What I have said is not too strong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's intention in gospel preaching is merely to collect stones for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If gospel preaching substitutes for the church, that is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There are some who establish missions, encourage foreign evangelism, zealously donate money, form national councils, set up organizations for foreign evangelism, and send missionaries to foreign lands for evangelistic work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But why do many people today know only missions and not the church?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The reason is because from eternity past God's emphasis was the church, but man's emphasis in this age is missions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many have forgotten the church!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Mr. Gordon has said, "God never sets up missions; He only establishes the church." However, men today set up mission boards, evangelistic organizations, schools, hospitals, humanistic societies, orphanages, charitable associations as the Methodist Episcopal Church does , and even Sunday schools to help others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Are these good or bad?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are good, but if man uses these to replace the church of God, God will never be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do you see Satan's craftiness?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Satan's subtle method is to utilize works used by God and substitute them for the church, which God in His eternal will intends to establish.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If your eyes are open, you will see that all these things should be dropped and that you should turn your attention to the church, because the church life, the life of the Body of Christ, is the goal of God.</S>
