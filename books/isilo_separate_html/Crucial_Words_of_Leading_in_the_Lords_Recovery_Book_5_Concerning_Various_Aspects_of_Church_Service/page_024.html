the Gospel in the Community, and<br />
the Gospel to the Children</h2>
<p>The second line of the gospel is the gospel in the schools. According to statistics, the city of Taipei has about one hundred ten thousand college students and two hundred sixty thousand students in junior high school and high school This is a total of three hundred seventy thousand students. We must work on these three hundred seventy thousand students. The third line of the gospel is the community gospel, and the fourth line is the children&rsquo;s work. We should not only preach the gospel to the children but also labor on the children with weekly children&rsquo;s meetings. Hence, there are four lines related to the gospel: the homes, the schools, the community, and the children.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE COMMUNITY GOSPEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Working Saints</h2>
<p>Two full-time co-workers are willing to promote the gospel in the community. In order to begin, we need statistics concerning the number of working saints. In the medical field there are forty-five medical doctors and eighty-two nurses. Fourteen saints are associated with the police force, thirty-four work either with the post office or the telephone and the telegram offices, four are lawyers, and eleven are engineers. Three saints are factory managers, fourteen are company presidents, and twenty-four are general managers. Eighteen saints own companies, and twenty-two are directors. Six saints are representatives in the National Assembly, and one is a legislator. These are general statistics of the employment situation of the brothers and sisters.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Working Saints Opening Their Homes<br />
to Invite Their Fellow Workers to Hear the Gospel</h2>
<p>In preaching the gospel in the community we should not go to a police station or a factory to preach the gospel; neither should we hold a gospel conference in a hospital. Instead, two responsible brothers, who take the lead in the community gospel, need to learn the skill of preaching the gospel. Then they should not preach the gospel directly but teach others to preach the gospel. Therefore, the two brothers need to contact the working saints. For example, the two co-workers need to contact the forty-five saints who are doctors, one by one. They can go to one brother&rsquo;s home to fellowship and pray with him and encourage him to open his home for the gospel to people in the medical field. The co-workers can encourage him to invite his doctor colleagues and their families to his home so that he can preach the gospel while the full-time brothers assist him. This is the way that we preach the gospel to people who work. The working saints should preach the gospel to their fellow workers, that is, to those in their occupation. Their colleagues may be more receptive to them because they have something in common.</p>
<p>In the past preachers gave sermons, but our present leading is completely different. The full-timers should prepare what the brothers and sisters need. If they need Bibles and gospel tracts, the full-timers should prepare them. If they need chairs to be arranged, the full-timers should arrive early to help arrange the chairs. Then the saints should preach the gospel themselves. If a saint does not know how to speak, the full-timers should teach him how to speak.</p>
<p>This way of leading is not a dream; it comes from our observation and personal experience. I studied the way believers preach the gospel in every country that I visited. When I was in Brazil, I spent quite some time observing the largest Christian group there. In America I even studied the method that the Mormons use. Mormonism is heretical because it teaches that the Lord Jesus is not God. However, in America no Christian group can surpass the Mormons in their work. This success confirms the leading we had thirty years ago concerning practicing the small groups. It is regrettable that we later neglected this practice. The success of the Mormons depends on their practice of small groups. The Mormons do not have great evangelists who concentrate on the small groups. Instead, in the small groups they study what should be done and make a plan to be carried out by the small groups. Their way is altogether practical, not theoretical. For this reason, they are more successful than many Christian groups.</p>
<p>In the international airport in Los Angeles, America, there are young Mormon men in teams of two, dressed in suits. They approach Chinese students arriving from China, and in fluent Chinese they offer to give the newcomers a ride to their destination. They can even sit down and engage in a long conversation on world politics in beautiful Chinese. Many new Chinese students who are not familiar with the surroundings are gained by the Mormons, because of their zealous help. This is the reason that many Chinese join the Mormons. The training that the Mormons receive is practical. They learn not only to greet others but also to converse about world politics, and they can speak in good Chinese. After observing them, I feel that our work has not been practical.</p>
<p>The leading in this fellowship is based on our observation and study of both others and ourselves. For example, after considering and studying various aspects of other groups, we discovered that their success depends on the use of small groups. This principle cannot be changed.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> </body></html>
