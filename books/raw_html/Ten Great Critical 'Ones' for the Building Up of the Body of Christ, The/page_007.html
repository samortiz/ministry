<p>Prayer: Father, we worship You for Your word. Lord Jesus, we love You because You are the Word of God. We love You, and we thank You for tonight’s meeting. Strengthen us in the speaking and anoint us in the listening. Grant us a real revelation in every word. Amen.<p>We have covered one Bible—one revelation—and one God—one economy. Now we come to the third “one,” one Christ—the unsearchable One. Through the years because of our testimony of the unsearchable riches of Christ, some Christians in the denominations have asked us, “What kind of Christ do you have? Is your Christ not the same as our Christ?” Millions of Christians have Christ, but to what extent have they experienced Christ? As we review the following items of Christ we should ask, “Have I experienced Christ in this item?” To what extent have we experienced Christ?<p>The apostle Paul experienced the same Christ as millions of Christians, but the extent of his enjoyment of Christ reached the top. Christ in Himself is the same in nature, in essence, and in His being unlimited, unsearchable, and all-inclusive; but in the experiences of His believers, there are many different extents. This should help us all to realize that our Christ is totally all-inclusive. He is the complete God and the perfect man. Even the reality of the food we eat is Christ. He is also the living water. According to the New Testament, Christ is everything to us.<h2 class=head1>THE ETERNAL CHRIST</h2><p>Christ is the eternal and only begotten Son of God, the Second of the Divine Trinity (John 1:1-2, 18; Matt. 28:19). He is self-existing, ever-existing, and coinhering with the Father and the Spirit in eternity. He is, with the Father and the Spirit, the only God (John 1:1; Rom. 9:5; Heb. 1:8). In other words, He as the Son with the Father and the Spirit is one God.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST IN CREATION</h2><p>He is the Creator (Heb. 1:10), and all things were created through Him (John 1:3; Col. 1:16a), cohere in Him (Col. 1:17), and will be an inheritance unto Him as the Heir (Col. 1:16b; Heb. 1:2; Rom. 11:34-36). On the one hand, Christ is the Creator, but on the other hand, He is the means through which all things were created. He is also the very center of creation because all things subsist, cohere, in Him. Eventually, all things will be an inheritance to Him as the Heir.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST’S INCARNATION</h2><p>In time He became a man through His incarnation, a God-man having both divinity and humanity as His nature (John 1:1, 14; Heb. 2:14). In eternity Christ was merely God, but in time He became a man. He is also the Firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15b). He is not only God and man but also the first item of the creation. As a man, He is a part of the creation, but how could He be the Firstborn? This is hard to answer. We need to see that with God there is only the fact without the time element. Christ was crucified about two thousand years ago, but the Bible says He was crucified from the foundation of the world (Rev. 13:8). From the time that the earth was founded, He was crucified because the earth needs His crucifixion. We must learn to present this to people.<p>Just as light is the effulgence of electricity, Christ is the effulgence of God’s glory. He is also the impress of God’s substance (Heb. 1:3a). God is a kind of substance, and Christ is the impress. We may illustrate this with a seal. The seal is a kind of substance. When we put the seal on a paper, we have the impress. Christ is the embodiment of God (Col. 2:9) and the image of the invisible God (Col. 1:15a). God is invisible and untouchable, but one day God embodied Himself in Christ. God became visible and touchable.
