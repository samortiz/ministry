   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Paul wrote 2 Timothy 1:6-7 according to his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He reminded Timothy to fan into flame the gift of God within him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then he said that God has not given us a spirit of cowardice.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead, God has given us a spirit in the center of our being surrounded by the three parts of the soul the will, the emotion, and the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The spirit given to us by God is of power, of love, and of sobermindedness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Power belongs to our will.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Love belongs to our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sobermindedness belongs to our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has given us a spirit of these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our will should be strong, full of power; our emotion should be loving, full of love; and our mind should be sober, full of sobermindedness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the divine revelation, God does not give us a spirit of cowardice, but a spirit of power.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That means your spirit is connected to your will, which is powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>So whenever you exercise your spirit, you have to realize that your will is involved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our spirit is surrounded not only by the powerful will but also by the loving emotion and by the sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That means your mind should not be cloudy or foggy, but very clear, very sober.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul had the revelation of this and also the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verses 6 and 7 of 2 Timothy 1 are marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These verses show us that we saved ones have the capital to live the Christian life and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This capital is the God-given spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This God-given spirit, according to God's ordination, is surrounded by the power of our will, by the love of our emotion, and by the sobermindedness of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These three helpers are surrounding our spirit, not to depress us, but rather to uplift us and help us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to exercise such a God-given spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The capital for a person to run in a race is his God-created legs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without God creating two legs for you, how could you run?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You have no capital to run.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In like manner, if God did not give us a spirit, we would not have the capital to run the Christian race.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But today we have a great account, a great deposit in the bank.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have a God-given spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As long as we have the God-given spirit, we have power, love, and a sober mind with a clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To say that we have the capital means that we have the capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can do things because we have the capacity of power.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not say that we do not love people, because we have the capacity of love.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not say that we are in darkness, because we have the capacity of sobermindedness with a clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should declare, "My sky is not cloudy; my sky is clear," because this is our capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Quite often we are cheated and deceived by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We say that we are weak and cloudy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But when we say we are weak, we are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we say we are cloudy, we are cloudy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the other hand, when we say we are strong, we are strong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we say we are clear, we are clear.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we say what we are, that is what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not say you are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you say you are weak, weakness is with you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if you say you are strong, strength is with you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can say we are strong because we have the capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have the capital.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God gave us, not a spirit of cowardice but a spirit of power, of love, and of sobermindedness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should declare this and claim this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then we will have it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is our legal, God-appointed lot, which has been allotted to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sometimes in the past, I felt down as I was preparing to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It seemed that I had nothing to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But at that juncture I prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In my prayer I realized that this was a cheating.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Actually, I was not weak and I did have something.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There were times when I stepped up to the podium to speak without knowing what I was going to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When I was asking the saints to open their Bibles to read some verses, I did not know what we would read until that very moment.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After we read these verses, the message came to me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Quite often such a message is more living, more powerful, and full of more impact and supply than other messages.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I am sharing this to point out that you should not listen to what you feel or what you think.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What you feel and what you think are altogether a lie, a falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christians should not believe that.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should always believe and declare and claim that we are strong.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are full of love.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We can love our enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are well able to love everybody.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Our sky is crystal clear.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You have to believe because you have this capital.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is your capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You should claim and declare, "I am strong!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I am loving!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I am clear!"</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You are blessed if you say this.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the way to exercise your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is to fan your spirit into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then you will pray.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The more you pray, the more you are fanning, and the more burning there will be within you.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Whenever there is the fanning, there is always a battle with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>While the fanning of a fire is going on, the fire department is fighting to quench the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is an illustration of Satan trying to quench the fire being fanned within us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Today there are many things that are like cold water, trying to quench our inner flame.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Sometimes a telephone call comes with bad news.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Then someone comes to you with more bad news.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Things will happen in our environment which can quench us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>At that time, we have to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We have to declare the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We have to fan our spirit into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Then we will be the highest persons, the super persons.</S>
