Not only has he become a new man individually; he is joined to all other Christians to become one corporate new man as well
Ephesians 2 speaks of Christ creating one new man out of two groups of people, but it does not tell us what the new man is like
According to Colossians 3:10-12, the new man is renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him
In the new man there is no Greek or Jew circumcision or uncircumcision barbarian or Scythian slave or free man but Christ is all and in all
The new man is not a matter of having or not having distinctions; it is a matter of either being the new man or being nothing
We can even venture to say that Christ is the church and the church is Christ, because everything in the new man the church is simply Christ
He is the grain of wheat that fell into the earth, died, and brought forth many grains the church in resurrection
Corinthians 12:12 refers to the second aspect when it says, 'All the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ'
During the bread-breaking meeting, the portion that we break off from the whole still signifies the Body of Christ, the church
All these differences are merely outward differences; they are not differences in the intrinsic reality of the church
In the New Testament, Paul was the only apostle who used the expression the Body of Christ to denote the church
Only those who have received revelation from God will see the Body of Christ, and only they will enter the reality of the Body
Romans 12 tells us that the church is the Body of Christ, but it does not explain how the church becomes the Body of Christ
The cross brings a man to a state of weakness and inability, one in which he totally loses hope in the old creation
When he is brought to this point, he is delivered in a real way from the old creation and brought into the new creation
If we resort to human methods, tactics, and skills to deal with the affairs of the church, the result will only be disastrous
As soon as a man passes through the experience in Romans 5 through 8, he can enter into the experience of Romans 12
They are living only in the superficiality of doctrines, which belongs to man's natural life and is part of man's oldness
We cannot manifest our personality through any one member of our body the ears, mouth, eyes, hands, or feet alone
Nothing that is of us can ever become part of the Body of Christ, because 'Christ is all and in all' in the Body
We do not need knowledge; rather, we need revelation to know the reality of the Body of Christ and to enter the realm of the Body
Only a revelation from God will usher us into the realm of the Body, and only then will the Body of Christ become our experience
In Acts 2 it seems as if Peter was preaching the gospel alone and that three thousand people were saved through him
In chapter three the ability to know the love of Christ and to apprehend the Lords breadth length height and depth is with all the saints
We should all be like bees, having the consciousness of the Body so that we can live together with other members in the Body of Christ
The whole body is dependent upon the eyes for sight, and no amount of prayer will give sight to the other members
Even if the young brother had nothing to say, it was still a help to him when the young brother sat in the room
In the years after 1930, many places in China experienced the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, especially around Shantung province
There was a brother in England who had the knowledge of victory in Christ, but he was unable to overcome a certain sin
In the Old Testament, being out of the fellowship was the most severe punishment that could be visited upon the children of Israel
If it were God's intention for us to live as individuals, we could progress perfectly well apart from one another
In the Body every member has its specialty, and all these specialties combined together form the whole armor of God
If a man as strong as Moses needed the help of his brothers, how much more do we need the help of our brothers?
The one who has seen the Body as a reality and has entered experientially into the realm of the Body has no possibility of forgetting
We should not allow ourselves to go our own way; rather, we should learn to be blended with other brothers and sisters
In 2 Corinthians 10:14 Paul said, 'For we are not extending ourselves beyond our bounds, as if we did not reach you'
The fellowship in the Body involves not only receiving help from other members but also giving help to other members
The Lord told the Pharisees that if His disciples did not rejoice and praise God with great shouting, the rocks would cry out
If a member fails to function, not only do the other members suffer loss, but the member himself is impoverished
She kept saying 'amen' to my speaking and responded with much expression on her face, indicating that she was taking in my words
The church is God's means of enlarging Christ, and this enlargement will go on until He fills the entire universe
If we seek to know the life of the Body, a question will immediately arise: Do we bow to the absolute authority of the Lord?
You cannot be the head, nor can anyone in the church be the head, because there can only be one Head in the Body; there cannot be two heads
Anyone who cannot submit, who always expresses his opinions and proposals, and who insists on being the head has never seen the Body
If we hold the Head, we cannot have a special relationship, feeling, or fellowship with any individual or group of individuals
Forming parties means that a few Christians have a direct relationship with one another and are detached from the authority of the Head
If we hold the Head, getting all our direction from Him and doing all as unto Him, we do not need to worry about the consequences
Differences arise when someone is not holding the Head, because He cannot possibly say one thing to one member and something else to another
If differences arise, we must not try to straighten them out by discussion; rather, we should just recognize Christ as the Head
In the church we all must hold the Head, whether it involves the understanding of the truth, the handling of business, or any other matter
The place of all the members is to hold the Head and to acknowledge Him as the unique and supreme authority in all things
If we let the cross deal with our natural life, we will find no difficulty in our relationship with the fellow members of the Body
The Bible shows us that God's anointing is only for the One who has totally satisfied God's heart His Son, Christ
Psalm 133 shows us that the fine oil was poured on Aaron's head and ran down upon his beard to the hem of his garments
It is impossible for us to be anointed in ourselves, because the Bible says, 'Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured'
Luke 4:18 says, 'The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to announce the gospel to the poor'
From these verses we see that the Lord was anointed with the Holy Spirit when He came out of the water of baptism at the Jordan River
The dove could not find any place to rest because the whole earth was filled with water, and it returned back to the ark
The function of the anointing is to maintain the link between the Head and the Body, as well as the link between all the members
The relationship between the Holy Spirit, Christ, and the church can be compared to the nerves in the human body
Believers can receive the anointing which flows from the Head to the Body only when they are directly under the Head
His work does not depend on words, biblical interpretations, reasons, judgments concerning right and wrong, etc
If we feel dead inside, then there is no anointing, and if we act without the anointing, we are acting without the authority of the Head
At another time, we may visit someone and feel as if we are under some kind of sweet anointing; everything is soothing and comfortable
The more we go along with this anointing, the stronger we will be, and the more there will be an 'amen' within
The teaching of the anointing of the Spirit has nothing to do with right or wrong what should or should not be done or what is true or false
Many people still work according to the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the tree from which Adam ate
Illiterate country folk would be doomed because they would not have the mental knowledge and would be unable to know God's will
Whether or not we have the mental knowledge and whether we are clever or slow, the teaching of the anointing still abides in us
As long as we walk according to the inner anointing of the Spirit, we will know God's will and be acquainted with God's work
Many people practice baptism, the laying on of hands, and head covering merely according to the instructions of the Bible
In order for us to live in the Body of Christ, we have to walk according to the Spirit's anointing, not according to the letter of the law
When we are in the Body and are diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit, we have the anointing of the Spirit
There is a condition to this: We have to allow the cross to deal with our flesh and our natural life in a thorough way
Corinthians 12:18 says, 'But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, even as He willed'
Many Christians have acquired only reeds --amounting to nothing but knowledge that they have heard and doctrines that they have studied
These are reed weapons; they are not the sword of the Spirit, and they will prove to be useless in time of need
One theologian despised his wife for not knowing the Bible, but when his son became ill, he could not remain calm
You have to know whether there is any overstepping in your speaking, and you have to know whether your speaking is too long
Many believers crave to be outstanding Christians and outstanding workers, but if some become overdeveloped, others will be underdeveloped
When we truly come under the authority of the Head, He sets us in our special place in the Body and appoints us to our special function
In a church that is a proper testimony of the Body, all the believers should submit to the representative authority
In the Old Testament, Moses did not argue when Korah and his company repudiated Moses' authority as God's prophet
It is much easier to bow to the direct authority of God than to the authority of His representatives in the Body
A prophet is one who knows and declares God's mind, whereas a person who predicts merely foretells future events
They have a secret history in tribulation, and the cross has wrought the things that they minister to the Body into them
Elders are manifested in a spontaneous way by the Holy Spirit; the only thing that man can do is identify and confirm
Elders are not elected through campaigns and elections; they are manifested in a spontaneous way through maturity in life
If a person is an elder, all that the church has to do is recognize what he is and allow him to function accordingly
Apostles and elders have no authority in themselves; they only have authority as they stand under the authority of the Lord
If the apostles and elders have the mind of God, then they have the authority of God, for He only upholds that for which He Himself stands
God cannot allow lawlessness to come into His church, because this makes the development of the Body impossible
He cannot allow any human head to raise itself, because this also hinders the development of the Body and denies the headship of Christ
Authority is ordained by the Lord; no one can be an authority in himself, and no one can elect others to be an authority
At that time the church in Jerusalem suffered great persecution, and except for the apostles, all the disciples were dispersed
Timothy 5:22 says, 'Lay hands quickly on no man,' lest, as Paul explained, we should 'participate in others' sins'
In the Old Testament, when kings or priests were appointed, there was the laying on of hands as well as the anointing upon the head
Once they were brought into the one Body and came under the one anointing, the Holy Spirit immediately fell upon them
If this had been the case, the saved ones in Samaria would have become separate from the saved ones in Jerusalem
If some had claimed Peter for Jerusalem and others had claimed Philip for Samaria, the principle of the Body would have been broken
The Body is one; therefore, the members need to recognize their dependence not only on the Head but also on one another
Baptism and the laying on of hands are two testimonies of the church that are essential for those who are to 'be brought on to maturity'
Henceforth, even if circumstances take us to a place of geographical isolation, we will not be alone, because the whole Body will be with us
Since the patient is brought under the anointing, we can safely infer that the patient's sickness was due to a departure from the anointing
The Word of God plainly declares that many are weak and sick, and many have even died, because of the failure to discern the Lord's Body
As soon as we take an individual line, we depart from the anointing and expose ourselves to sickness and death
If his sin was only a personal sin, he could have been forgiven by trusting in the blood and by confessing to others
Verse 15 says that he will be forgiven if he has sinned; however, the forgiveness is due to the elders' prayer
Since something has gone wrong in the Body of Christ, both the sick one and the elders have to take responsibility for it
Those who are outside of the Body should see the importance of turning back to the anointing and turning back to the Body
When the Lord appeared to Paul on the way to Damascus, He showed him that persecuting the believers was the same as persecuting Him
After this high revelation, the Lord charged him to go into the city, and there it would be told to him what he must do
May the Lord grant us the revelation of the Body so that we can submit to Christ the Head as well as to the representatives of the Body
The individual pieces of a crashed tumbler may hold a few drops of water, but it takes the whole tumbler to hold a full glass of water
In a lesser sense each individual believer is a temple of God, but only the corporate temple can contain all the riches of God
In chapter six we are told to put on 'the whole armor of God' that we may wage warfare against the hosts of darkness
The so-called church has not defeated the enemy's host, because Christians are living scattered lives instead of functioning in the Body
The blessing that is commanded whenever brothers are united under the anointing is 'life forever,' a full, free, unceasing stream of life
The entire company of believers in a locality, not just a section of the believers, constitutes the church in that locality
The Body of Christ is not something abstract or unfathomable; the Body of Christ is manifested in the local churches
He should fellowship with the local saints, be edified in the local church, and be built up together in mutuality
In the first instance, He referred to the universal church, and in the second instance, He referred to the local church
The leading of the Bible and the Spirit are individual in nature, but the leading of the local church is corporate in nature
Often the decision of a church in a rural area is proven to be better than the decision of a church in the city
Acts 12:5 says, 'So then Peter was kept in the prison; but prayer was being made fervently by the church to God concerning him'
Much revelation has been lost to the church because believers have sought light individually instead of seeking light in the sanctuary
When we are in the Body, we know God's will, have the authority of the Body, and experience the power of the Body
Everyone who belongs to the Lord has a special portion which he has received from Christ, and each portion has its characteristic feature
One does not serve others with the doctrine that he understands; he can only supply the Body with what he has received of Christ
Other organs may temporarily do what another member does, but they are not dedicated to that particular function
If you have acquired something special and have some special knowledge of the Lord, you can supply the Body with it
Every member should learn and know something specific before the Lord so that each one can have a specific ministry
What we minister to the Body is Christ, and what the Body receives is Christ, because Christ is all and in all in the Body
Specific ministry comes when we receive special experiences, particular dealings, and particular discipline from the Holy Spirit
We need to receive power from the Holy Spirit and serve the Christ we know to the church through the operation of this power
If we have a gift without first having a ministry, we will be led away by the gift and not be able to render help to the Body
What was wrought into him through the fires of affliction was eventually ministered by him to the whole Body for its enrichment
How did Martin Luther become competent to teach the church concerning the truth that 'the righteous one shall live by his faith' ?
The only way we can communicate to others in a living way is to communicate that which we have learned through experience
Discipline, suffering, and trials are the means for God to constitute the word into us so that we may have something to give to the Body
If we want to be ministers for the building up of the Body of Christ, we must not shrink from any trial, discipline, or dealing
The beginning of every section points out the main divisions, while the theme can be seen in the subject of that section
He met a sister there who had learned many lessons through her illnesses and who had subsequently rendered much help to many people
May the Lord show us the Body, and may we serve His Body with a ministry which is based on our knowledge of Christ
