   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TYPE OF THE HOLY ANOINTING OIL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Exodus 30:22-25, Moses was told to take four of the finest spices myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia and add them to a hin of olive oil to make a holy anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 25 and 26 say, It shall be an holy anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And thou shalt anoint the tent of meeting therewith Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the furnishings and utensils in the tabernacle were to be anointed with this holy anointing oil vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>26-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whoever touched these anointed furnishings and utensils would be made holy v. 29 . Furthermore, Moses was told to anoint Aaron and his sons so that they might minister to the Lord as priests v. 30 . In this chapter is the source of the word anointing used by John.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This anointing oil is a compound of five elements.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The basic element is the olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All Bible scholars agree that, in typology, olive oil signifies the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the original olive oil there were no spices; it was purely oil with nothing compounded into it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that the Spirit of God was merely, purely, and singly the Spirit of God and that nothing yet had been added to it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But Moses was told to add four spices to the olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that some things have been added into the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After the Spirit of God had been thus compounded, it was no longer merely or singly the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Four elements, represented by the four spices, have been added into the unique Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that something of God s creature signified by the number four has been added into the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Something of God s creature has been compounded into God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Four items were compounded into the one olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The number one always denotes the unique God, and the number four symbolizes God s creature.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, this oil compound signifies that humanity, God s creature, has been compounded into God to make the number five.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The number five signifies responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Consider the four fingers and thumb on your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why do you have four fingers and a thumb?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You have them for bearing responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The four fingers signify humanity, and the thumb signifies the unique God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The four fingers need the thumb, and the thumb needs the four fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Likewise, we need God and God needs us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may tell Him, O Lord God, without us, You are lacking something.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And, of course, without Him, we are lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How we creatures need God!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we have Him, we have four plus one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The amount of myrrh was five hundred shekels v. 23 . The number five hundred is composed of one hundred times five.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Both the cinnamon and the calamus, however, are two hundred and fifty shekels in amount, and cassia, like myrrh, is five hundred shekels.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The cinnamon and the calamus, each being only half a unit, together make a complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, these four spices are actually three units.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Biblical numbers, three signifies the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Among the Triune God, the second was split on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here we have three times a hundred multiplied by five.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This indicates intensified responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Bible, myrrh signifies the sweetness of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is a symbol of the precious, lovable death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Unlike the death of any other human being, the death of the Lord Jesus is lovable and sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But, as the myrrh signifies, the sweetness of His death comes out of His suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What does cinnamon signify?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Cinnamon is a spice that gives a sweet savor to cooked food.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, cinnamon is the sweet flavor of the effectiveness of the Lord s death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Myrrh is the sweet death, and cinnamon is the death used as a spice.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Cinnamon is added to our cooking, that is, to our life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If in our daily life and walk we do not have the Lord s death added in, it will be bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There will be no flavor to our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the flavor of the Lord s death is not added to our living, our conversation with our wives or with the brothers and sisters will be bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need cinnamon, the flavor of the Lord s death.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Calamus is a reed that sprouts out of the mud into the air.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Undoubtedly, this signifies the Lord s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, we have the sweetness of the Lord s death and the flavor of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In whatever we do and say in our daily living, we must have the flavor of the Lord s death and the sweetness of His resurrection added to it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Cassia signifies the flavor of the power of the Lord s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The power of the Lord s resurrection is also added into the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All these four elements have been compounded with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, the Holy Spirit today is not the mere single Spirit; He is now a compound of divinity and other elements compounded together as one unit.</S>
