   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Son of Abraham</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ is also the son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This book of generation says only that Christ is the son of David and the son of Abraham, not the son of anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Old Testament there was a clear prophecy that Christ would be the son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Isaac was a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With Isaac as a type of Christ there were also three main aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, Isaac brought the blessing to all nations, both Jews and Gentiles Gen 22:18a; Gal 3:16, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second, he was offered to God unto death and was resurrected Gen 22:1-12; Heb 11:17, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Third, he received the bride Gen 24:67 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a type of Christ as the promised One who brought the blessing to all nations, who was also offered to death, who was resurrected, and who, after His resurrection, will receive His Bride John 3:29; Rev 19:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One day the Holy Spirit, typified by Abraham's servant, will bring the spiritual, divine, heavenly Rebekah to her heavenly Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The son of Abraham received the bride, and the son of David built up the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>With Christ, the Bride is the temple, and the temple is the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why it says that Christ is the son of Abraham and the son of David.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He offered Himself unto death and was resurrected, now He is building God's temple, and in the future He will receive the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ also spoke wisdom and brought God's blessing to all nations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is the One to fulfill all of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the four Gospels we can find each of these six aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Gospels reveal that Christ came to inherit the kingdom, that He offered Himself unto death and He was resurrected, that He spoke the word of wisdom, that He brought blessing to all people, that He is building up God's house, and that He will come to receive the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is surely the real Isaac and the real Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the son of David, Jesus was a great blessing to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But as the son of Abraham, He brings blessing to all the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As the son of David, He is for the Jews; as the son of Abraham, He is for us all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If Jesus were only the son of David, He would have nothing to do with me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Praise the Lord that He is also the son of Abraham!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All nations are blessed in Abraham's seed, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This blessing is the participation in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The blessing which God promised to Abraham was the Spirit Gal 3:14 , and the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By Christ as the son of Abraham, we have the Spirit, and we share in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hallelujah!</S>
