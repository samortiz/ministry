The Manifestation of the Outward Filling of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>1)Speaking in tongues (Acts 2:4; 10:44-46; 19:6). Three groups of people-the disciples at Pentecost, the people in the house of Cornelius, and the disciples in Ephesus-spoke in tongues when they were filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly. Thus, tongue-speaking is a manifestation of the outward filling with the Holy Spirit.<p><B>2)Prophesying (Acts 19:6). While being filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly, the believers in Ephesus not only spoke in tongues, but they also prophesied. Therefore, prophesying is also a manifestation of being filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly.</B><p>Of the many cases of the outward filling with the Holy Spirit recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, only three cases involving the three groups of people mentioned above had the speaking in tongues. In the other cases, the Bible does not mention tongue-speaking at all. This proves that speaking in tongues is not a necessary manifestation of the outward filling with the Holy Spirit.<p><B>3)Having boldness and power-&#8220;And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness&#8221; (Acts 4:31); &#8220;Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them...&#8221; (Acts 4:8). To speak for God with boldness and power is also a strong manifestation of the outward filling with the Holy Spirit. The outward filling with the Holy Spirit is mainly for men to speak for God with boldness and power.</B><p><B>4)Having authority-&#8220;Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him and said, O son of the Devil, full of all deceit and all villainy, enemy of all righteousness...perverting the straight ways of the Lord...And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a time. And instantly a mist and a darkness fell upon him&#8221; (Acts 13:9-11). This word shows us that when the Apostle Paul was outwardly filled with the Holy Spirit, he had the authority to deal with the evil person utilized by the Devil. This kind of authority is also a manifestation of the outward filling of the Holy Spirit.</B><h2 class=head2>D. The Way to Be Filled with the Holy Spirit Outwardly</h2><p>1)Repenting and dealing with sins-&#8220;Repent...for the forgiveness of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit&#8221; (Acts 2:38). Repentance for the forgiveness of sins will cause us to receive the Holy Spirit. Hence, to be filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly, there is the need for thorough repentance and dealing with all sins.<p><B>2)Believing-Believing that at the moment a person believes into the Lord, he is baptized in the Holy Spirit. After we have fully dealt with our sins, we have to believe that since the baptism in the Spirit is a fact accomplished by the Lord on the church and that since we are a part of the church, the outward filling with the Holy Spirit from the baptism in the Spirit is now our portion.</B><p><B>3)Obeying-&#8220;The Holy Spirit also, whom God has given to those who obey Him&#8221; (Acts 5:32). The Holy Spirit is given by God to those who are obedient. Therefore, to receive the outward filling of the Holy Spirit, we must obey God.</B><p><B>4)Praying with one accord-&#8220;These [who were to be filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit at Pentecost] all were persevering with one accord in prayer&#8221; (Acts 1:14). In order to receive the outward filling of the Holy Spirit, there is the need for much individual prayer as well as prayer in one accord with those who pursue the Lord together. This is what the first group of people who received the outward filling with the Holy Spirit did at Pentecost.</B><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
