   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE FLESH HAVING NO SHARE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE HOLY ANOINTING OIL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Exodus 30:31 and 32 the Lord charged Moses not to anoint any flesh with the holy anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The holy anointing oil, the compound ointment, signifies the consummated and compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates clearly that the compound Spirit is absolutely not for the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we are living and acting in the flesh, we are through with the compound Spirit, the all-inclusive, consummated, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because the Spirit has nothing to do with our flesh, we have to be in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually, the ultimate consummation of the Triune God is the consummated, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we are through with Him, we are through with God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, we must condemn the flesh to the uttermost because it has no share in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THINGS BELONGING TO THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we want to see thirteen things belonging to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A. Vainglory</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Galatians 5:26 Paul said, "Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everything that is considered as a glory today, such as having a position or a name, is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not seek for man's glory today.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The real glory is the coming glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whatever is considered as a glory today is vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>B. Outward Show</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Galatians 6:12 Paul spoke of those who desire to make a good show, an outward show, in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>People like to make a show of whatever they are, whatever they have, and whatever they can do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such an outward show belongs to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever you like to make a show, you have to condemn it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To say this is easy, but in our natural being we make an outward show all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whenever we want to make an outward show, that is fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Of course, this has much to do with vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>C. Ambition for Leadership</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is also absolutely fleshly to be ambitious for leadership Matt 20:20-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>D. Self-confidence</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is very difficult not to have self-confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we did not have self-confidence, our will might be weak.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But we have to realize that self-confidence is fleshly.</S>
