<P>By 1943, the church in that place had a great revival. We then felt that it was not enough to fellowship once a week, but that we must hold meetings every evening and gather for fellowship each afternoon. At those fellowship meetings we always discussed such things as the direction of the flow of the Holy Spirit, the manner in which different ones had a spiritual turn, the meeting the night before, the feeling for the meeting that evening, and the persons we must look for and contact. That fellowship was truly living. Up to a certain point, a brother would suggest that we contact a certain brother again. Another one might feel that the time was not yet ripe, and that we should wait. After such a fellowship, when we went out to visit again, we truly saw the Lord's blessing. All these things came from the fellowship. If the elders can fellowship continually, there is no way for the church in that place to fail to be revived. There is no need to ask for the apostles' or the workers' help any longer. As long as the elders would fellowship from morning till evening, and from evening till morning for thirty days in a row, the church will surely be revived. Please pardon me for saying what I am saying. I know what I am talking about. Wherever such fellowship is lacking, it will be difficult for the Holy Spirit to do His work.</P><P>For this reason, I hope that the brothers would not discuss business as the first thing, but would open themselves up first for fellowship. It is one thing to discuss, and it is another thing to fellowship. When the elders come together to discuss matters, I do know that sometimes everyone is closed. In the end, although there is a conclusion, there is no fellowship among the brothers. Strictly speaking, all the decisions should come out of fellowship.</P><P>There is very much to the matter of fellowship. When the brothers come together for fellowship, the Holy Spirit will operate among us apart from our consciousness, and everyone will see his own failure, weakness, or shortcomings. Each one will see his unfaithfulness towards the church, and his shortage in learning the lessons before the Lord. If everyone would fellowship his condition before everyone else, let me repeat, some gifts will come out in this way. Through this kind of fellowship, some will receive the ministry of the Word. Others will receive the gift of healing. I surely know that through this kind of fellowship, the minds of some people are turned around. From that day on, they become an opened person; they become wise, and everything presented to them is judged in a wise way. This wisdom, according to 1 Corinthians 12, comes out of fellowship.</P><P>Therefore, I would like the brothers to go to try this. In order for the responsibility of the elders to be strengthened in your place, not only do you have to fellowship with God individually, and not only do you have to bring the corporate matters before the Lord and fellowship thoroughly over them, but more important than these things, the elders themselves have to fellowship one with another. The few of you have to be like lumps of clay that are mingled as one lump; there should be no way for you to be separated from one another any longer. When a few brothers fellowship together and are mingled as one, the guidance will come, and so will the light, the burden, the revelation, the authority, the power, and the wisdom. This is truly the case.</P>
