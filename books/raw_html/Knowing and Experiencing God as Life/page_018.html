        <h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTION OF GOD AS LIFE<br />
BEING TO SHINE IN US</h2>
<p>The Triune God enters into us in order to be our life. The first function of His being life in us is to shine in us, to enlighten us (John 1:4). When we use our spirit to contact the Spirit, He shines in us. His shining causes us to feel that we are wrong or that we are defiled in different matters. Such feelings are the result of the Spirit&rsquo;s shining in us. These feelings, given to us by the Spirit as life, manifest the function of light. Hence, the manifestation of our touching the Spirit as life is that our inner being is bright, keen, and full of feeling. We might feel that we are wrong before our parents, that we are wrong in our attitude, or that we did not speak in a proper way. We will also sense that we have a motive in our love to God, that we have a preference in our work, and that our heart is not pure but is a mixture. Such is the issue of our touching the Spirit as life.</p>
<p>We can also say that such feelings are the result of the Spirit&rsquo;s shining. However, we must not forget that the shining of the Spirit is the manifestation of His being life in us. The more life we have, the more feelings we will have. In contrast, a lack of feeling indicates a lack of life. Our physical life is an example. When our physical body is healthy, our senses are keen and full of feeling. If someone touches us lightly, we will feel it. However, a dead person has no feeling because he does not have life.</p>
<p>A person who does not believe in the Lord has no feeling of shame when he sins or does evil or corrupt things, because there is no life in him. When he receives the gospel, the Spirit touches his heart and enlivens his spirit. Then he confesses his sins one by one according to his spirit, according to his conscience. This shows that his spirit is living. When his spirit moves, the Spirit is also moving in him as his life. The first function is to shine, to enlighten. The operation of the Spirit enlightens man and gives him many feelings.</p>
<p>Sometimes we do not draw near to the Lord for several days, nor do we exercise our spirit. Although the Spirit is in us, our spirit does not fellowship with Him, and as a result, we do not have much light or feeling. In such a condition we will not feel that something is wrong when we criticize or despise a brother, and we will defend ourselves when we mistreat others. Such situations indicate that we are short of taking the Spirit as our life. But when we exercise our spirit and confess our desolation, failure, and backsliding, the Spirit will operate in us, and our inner being will become bright. Then we will have a feeling before words of criticism leave our mouth, and we will be bothered within when we mistreat a brother, because the Spirit is operating in us as our life. When the Spirit operates, we are enlivened by His shining, and our inner being becomes bright.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING GOD AS OUR LIFE<br />
IN OUR LIVING AND OUR WORK</h2>
<p>In Romans 8:2 the Spirit of God in us is called the Spirit of life. The Spirit is in us to be our life, not to do something. The purpose of His moving in us is not merely for us to do things but for Him to live out of us. Hence, those who know God as life do not pay attention to outward things; they focus on the Spirit living in them. When they give a message, their feeling is not that they are working but that the Spirit is moving, living, and being their life, which is manifested in their speaking. They do not feel that loving others is an outward activity. They love others because the Spirit is their life. They let the Spirit live in them and enable them to love others. From the human viewpoint, their loving others is a good behavior, but they know that the Lord is living in them and that they will feel bothered if they do not love others. Even their labor is the living out of Christ as life in them. For this reason, Brother Nee said, &ldquo;Genuine work is the overflow of life.&rdquo; This can be compared to a fruit tree. We might say that the tree is bearing much fruit, but the tree would say that bearing fruit is the issue of its growing and the expression of its inner life.</p>
<p>The Triune God is in us to be our life; He does not have any other purpose. When we take Him as our life, the first thing He does is to shine, thereby showing us the things that are not right in us. The second thing He does is to supply us in everything that we do. He is our living and our work. He not only moves us and empowers us, but He also lives in us to gain our cooperation, thereby living out of us. He is expressed in our conduct, our living, and our work. Outwardly, we have good conduct, but our conduct and our work are the issue of taking the Spirit as life.</p>
<p>Our being enlightened when we read the Bible is not merely a shining but the Spirit living in us. If we do not allow the Spirit to live in us in the morning, we will not receive light when we read the Bible at noon. Sometimes God has mercy on us, and light shines into us as soon as we open the Bible. However, that is not the normal situation. In a normal situation we should live in the Spirit and let the Spirit live in us all day. Then our reading of the Bible will be the result of the Spirit living in us and being our life. Furthermore, the shining function of the Spirit will be spontaneously manifested, and it will enable us to know the Bible.</p>
<p>We must see that the Lord is in us to be our life. If we let Him live in us freely, we will have many experiences of His growing and being expressed in us. These experiences include His shining, His supplying, and His leading. He supplies us with what we need. This is the secret of our joy, growth, overcoming, and spirituality.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
