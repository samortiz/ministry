 <h2 class="head2">The Oneness to Which All the Believers<br />
in Christ Need to Go On and at Which<br />
All the Believers Need to Arrive</h2>
<p>The believers in Christ need to go on until they all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God (Eph. 4:13a). When we say that Christ is all-inclusive, we mean that He is not only the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;but also the Man; that within Him is His marvelous death and His powerful resurrection; and that He is all that we need&mdash;salvation, peace, hope, our spiritual food, our spiritual drink, and our spiritual home. Some people argue with us and try to discourage us from speaking in such a way. Because I teach that Christ is our food (John 6:57), our drink (John 7:37-39), our clothing (Gal. 3:27), and our dwelling place (John 15:4a), some have misunderstood my teaching concerning the all-inclusiveness of Christ and have even accused me of teaching pantheism. They believe in their kind of Christ, and I believe in Christ according to the full revelation of the Bible. Because of such differences in the knowing of Christ, there is a lack of oneness. Thus, there is the need for us to go on to arrive at the full knowledge of the Son of God.</p>
<p>Christians disagree and argue over many small matters. For example, some argue over whether a person should be baptized by sprinkling or by immersion, and others have disagreed over the number of times and in what direction, forward or backward, a person should be immersed. Disputing over small matters such as these causes division. Those who are preoccupied with such things may be genuine believers, but they have not arrived at the oneness of the proper faith or at the full knowledge of Christ. They are like small children who are preoccupied with certain toys. Therefore, we all need to advance; we all need to grow. The more we advance in the growth of life, the more we will drop all the &ldquo;toys,&rdquo; and the more we will arrive at the genuine oneness in practicality.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Oneness That Needs<br />
the Full Growth of the New Man<br />
and the Measure of the Stature<br />
of the Fullness (the Body) of Christ</h2>
<p>This oneness in practicality needs the full growth of the new man and needs also the measure of the stature of the fullness (the Body) of Christ (Eph. 4:13c). This means that we need to grow. A child who is only four feet tall is not full-grown; he needs to grow further until he arrives at the measure of six feet, the measure of the stature of a full-grown man. In a similar way, we need to grow in the divine life until we arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness, the Body, of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">No Longer Babes Tossed by Waves and<br />
Carried About by Every Wind of Teaching<br />
in the Sleight of Men, in Craftiness<br />
with a View to a System of Error</h2>
<p>When we are full-grown, that is, mature, we will no longer be babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error (Eph. 4:14). The problems among us today are due to the immaturity of many of the saints. A number of saints have been damaged by the negative speaking of the divisive ones because they lack the full growth, which means that they are short of the adequate knowledge of Christ and the proper understanding of the faith. Because of this they listened to and believed the negative talk.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:14 speaks of the winds of teaching. Every wind of teaching comes in the sleight of men, that is, in a cheating way, and in craftiness. In this verse <em>sleight</em> and <em>craftiness</em> are used in apposition, meaning that they refer to the same thing. Sleight implies cheating, and craftiness implies deceiving. To deceive people is to cheat them. The winds of teaching in sleight and in craftiness are related to the system of error. The word <em>system</em> indicates that the system of error must be of Satan; it must be a satanic system of error designed to systematize people into a division. The winds of teaching may have the appearance of truth, but in such teaching the truth may be applied for the purpose of causing division. Anything that divides the believers is a wind of teaching.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:12, some of the Corinthian believers said, &ldquo;I am of Paul,&rdquo; some said, &ldquo;I am of Apollos,&rdquo; and some said, &ldquo;I am of Cephas.&rdquo; Surely we all would condemn this kind of speaking as divisive. However, some of the Corinthians said, &ldquo;I am of Christ.&rdquo; This does not seem to be divisive; rather, it seems very spiritual. Nevertheless, even such a &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; saying was divisive; it was a wind of teaching. We all must be of Christ, but to say that we are of Christ so as to designate ourselves as different from other believers is divisive. To designate ourselves by saying either &ldquo;I am of Paul,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am of Cephas,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am of Christ&rdquo; is divisive. To say &ldquo;I am of Christ,&rdquo; in itself, may be right, but as long as it is divisive, it is a wind of teaching that carries the believers away from the genuine oneness. It is not a matter of whether a certain kind of speaking is right or wrong; it is a matter of whether or not it is divisive.</p>
<p>Satan is subtle. It is difficult to seduce people by using something that is obviously wrong. However, anything that is good and right can easily be used to attract people. Whether a certain thing is divisive or not does not depend on whether that thing is right or wrong; it depends on whether that thing divides or does not divide. In recent days some have declared that they have come back to the enjoyment of Christ. This kind of speaking seems very good, because to enjoy Christ is a wonderful thing. However, if we use this wonderful thing to designate ourselves, to separate ourselves from others, this is divisive.</p>
<h2 class="head3">All Growing Up into the Head, Christ,<br />
in All Things by Holding the Truth in Love<br />
and Being Built Up in the Organic Body<br />
of Christ by Each One Part Functioning<br />
in Its Measure</h2>
<p>We all need to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things by holding the truth in love and being built up in the organic Body of Christ by each one part, that is, each member, functioning in its measure (Eph. 4:15-16). When we grow in life and function as members of the Body, we will spontaneously grow up into Christ. This growing up into Christ, the Head, equals the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Oneness to Fulfill<br />
the Aspiration and Prayer of the Lord</h2>
<p>The oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God fulfills the aspiration and prayer of the Lord in John 17. The first kind of oneness is the oneness in the Lord&rsquo;s aspiration and prayer. Then, in the second kind of oneness, the oneness of the Spirit, that aspiration and prayer was accomplished but was not yet fulfilled. Finally, in the third kind of oneness, the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, the oneness in the Lord&rsquo;s aspiration and prayer is fulfilled. This third kind of oneness is the practical oneness for us to live in the church life.</p>
