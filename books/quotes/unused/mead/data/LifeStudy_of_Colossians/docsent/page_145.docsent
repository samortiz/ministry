   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FORTY-EIGHT THE RECEIVING OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 2:1-6; John 1:1-4, 11-18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:6 Paul says, As therefore you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Walking in Christ is based on receiving Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Walking in Him comes out of receiving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many Christians think that to receive Christ is simply to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Receiving Christ, however, is not as simple as this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to understand what is the proper, genuine, and adequate receiving of Christ, we need to know the Christ whom we are to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to our concept and according to traditional doctrine, Christ is rather simple.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many believers only realize that Christ, the Son of God, is the Savior who loved us and died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we believe in Christ, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, the receiving of Christ in a book such as Colossians involves a great deal more than this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have pointed out that Colossians affords us an extensive revelation of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This Christ is more vast than the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to Ephesians 3, Christ is the breadth, length, height, and depth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Christ whom we have received is immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is universally vast.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although we have received Christ, our receiving of Him goes beyond an initial receiving of Him once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the contrary, we shall continue to receive Him eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Receiving Christ can be compared to breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Just as breathing is a continual process, so our receiving of Christ should take place continually.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Regrettably, however, a great many Christians have had only the initial receiving of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They do not receive Him continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many believers can tell you that at a certain time in the past they received Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But they have not continued to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not receive Christ continually, we shall not enjoy the full benefit of the Christ we have received initially.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many Christians have not continued to receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, we must realize that our receiving of Him must be consistent and continual.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE MYSTERY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Christ we have received according to 2:1-6 is the mystery of God spoken of in 2:2.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The fact that Christ is the mystery of God indicates that He is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, He is immeasurable and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be sure, God is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is unlimited, infinite, eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How, then, could Christ, the mystery of God, be simple?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the mystery of God, Christ is the immeasurable, infinite, and eternal God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although God is eternal, He also has a history.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Of course, to say that God has a history is to speak in human terms for our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the beginning, in eternity past, God had a good pleasure, the desire of His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more living a person is, the greater is his desire for pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, as the most living One, God has the greatest desire.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God is living, aggressive, and energetic.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As such a living One, He has a good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Based upon this good pleasure, which is the desire of His heart, God made a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The biblical term for this plan is purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God is purposeful; He has an eternal purpose based on His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This purpose is to have a group of living beings to be His corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>MAN CREATED WITH A RECEIVER</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order for such a group of beings to come into existence, God created the heavens, the earth, and billions of items.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The center of God s creation is man, who was created with a receiver, the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Just as a radio receiver has the capacity to receive radio waves, so our spirit has the capacity to receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suppose a person from a primitive part of the world is shown a transistor radio for the first time and is told that it can give forth sounds transmitted through the air.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the radio is properly tuned, that person would be amazed at the sounds.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But if the receiver does not function, he may argue that there are in fact no radio waves in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A transistor radio may have a beautiful casing, but if the receiver does not work, the radio is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Millions of people today are like broken transistor radios.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Outwardly they appear very good, but their spirit has been damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The receiver within them does not function properly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the reason that atheists proclaim there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Because their receiver does not function to substantiate God, they say God does not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If a broken radio receiver is repaired, the radio will work once again.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In like manner, when our damaged receiver, our human spirit, is regenerated, it can function to substantiate God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>According to Zechariah 12:1, God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In this verse the spirit of man is ranked with the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This shows the crucial significance of the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The spirit of man was created purposely and specifically to be a receiver to take God in. In order for man to exist with a spirit to receive God, there was the need of the earth and of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man, with his spirit, his receiver, is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Through His work of creation, God produced the environment necessary for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
