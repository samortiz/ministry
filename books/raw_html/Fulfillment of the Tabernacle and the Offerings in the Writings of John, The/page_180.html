<p>Luke 16 indicates that in Hades there is a pleasant section, known as Paradise, where believers go when they die. According to this chapter, a sinful rich man died and went to a place of torment. A poor man named Lazarus also died and was taken by angels to Abraham’s bosom. Between these two regions of Hades there was a great gulf, and no one could go from one section to the other (Luke 16:26). One section was a place of torment, and the other was a place of comfort. We believe that Abraham is still in this pleasant place. According to the New Testament, the pleasant section of Hades is called Paradise.<p>Using 2 Corinthians 12:2-4, some have argued that Paul was caught away to Paradise when he was caught away to the third heaven. But 2 Corinthians 12:2-4 does not prove that Paradise is in the third heaven; rather, it proves the opposite. The word “and” at the beginning of verse 3 proves that Paul’s being caught away to the third heaven and his being caught away into Paradise mentioned in verses 3 and 4 are two different things. (The King James Version’s rendering “caught up” in verses 2 and 4 should simply be “caught” according to the Greek.) On the one hand, Paul was living on earth; on the other hand, he was “caught” to the third heavens and into Paradise. In this way, Paul received a full vision of the entire universe. As far as mankind is concerned, the universe is of three sections: the heavens, the earth, and the section under the earth (see Phil. 2:10). Paul came to know the things on earth, the things in heaven, and the things in Paradise. He had the greatest revelation of the universe as it is related to man.<p>When believers die, they become “naked” in the sense that they no longer have a body. For a human being not to have a body means that he is unclothed, in a condition that is not normal. No one can be in the presence of God in the third heaven in this naked, abnormal condition. Hence, the dead saints must be kept in a pleasant place until the time of their resurrection, when God will clothe them with a resurrected body, and they will be a complete person in a normal condition.<p>Some Bible students believe that Paradise, the pleasant section of Hades, was transferred to the third heaven at the time of Christ’s ascension. The original Scofield Reference Bible has a note on Luke 16:23 which indicates that Paradise was under the earth before Christ’s resurrection, but that by and with His resurrection and ascension it was transferred from under the earth to the third heaven. This note speaks of Hades before and after the ascension of Christ. According to this note, “Hades was formerly in two divisions, the abodes respectively of the saved and of the lost. The former was called ‘paradise’ and ‘Abraham’s bosom.’” This note also says that the believing dead were with Abraham and that the believing thief was to be with Christ in Paradise on the very day Christ was crucified. Thus far, the note is almost accurate according to the Scriptures, and in essence we agree with it. However, the note goes on to say that a “change has taken place which affects paradise” and that Paradise is “now in the immediate presence of God.” This note uses 2 Corinthians 12:1-4 as a supposed proof that Paradise has been removed from Hades to the third heaven, the time of which change is presumed to be indicated by Ephesians 4:8-10.<p>It is a serious mistake to teach that Paradise has been removed from Hades to the third heaven. According to this mistaken understanding, when Christ resurrected and ascended, He took all the Old Testament saints, who were held captives in Hades, and transferred them to the third heaven. Therefore, according to this note in the old Scofield Reference Bible, Paradise, and all the Old Testament saints, have been transferred from Hades to the third heaven.<p>However, it is not accurate to say that these saints who have died are now in heaven. On the day of Pentecost, fifty days after the Lord’s resurrection, Peter said, “David is not ascended into the heavens” (Acts 2:34). This indicates that even at the time of the day of Pentecost, David was still not in heaven. Concerning this, G. H. Lang, a teacher among the Brethren, says that “the Scripture nowhere declares” that after Christ’s ascension Paradise was transferred from under the earth to the third heaven, “but is wholly against” such a concept. He also points out the verse in Acts 2 where Peter said that David was not in heaven. No, Paradise has not been removed from Hades to the third heaven. Paradise is still a pleasant section in Hades, a section of comfort, where believers go when they die.<p>When a believer dies, his loved ones may be comforted with the truth that this one is now in Paradise. We should not cheat the believers by telling them that at death a Christian goes to a heavenly mansion. According to the truth of the Word of God, when a believer dies, he goes to Paradise, a place of comfort. On the one hand, we do not agree with the concept of a heavenly mansion and of going to heaven when we die; on the other hand, according to the Bible, we present the truth concerning Paradise.<p>Today’s church life eventually will consummate in the New Jerusalem. We may say that the church life today is a miniature of the New Jerusalem. Some Christians dream of going to a heavenly mansion, but God’s desire is to be with us in the New Jerusalem. Instead of waiting to go to a so-called heavenly mansion when we die, we have the blessing of dwelling in the church life today. We may say that today’s church life is the best dwelling place, a real mansion, for it is God’s dwelling place on earth. In the church, which is a miniature of the New Jerusalem, we have the golden street, the pearl gates, and the jasper wall. As we have seen, gold signifies God’s nature; pearl, Christ’s death and resurrection; and precious stone (jasper), the Spirit’s transformation. Praise the Lord that in the church life we have a golden street, pearl gates, and a wall of precious stone! We are happy, and God is also happy, to enjoy such a church life, such a dwelling place today.
