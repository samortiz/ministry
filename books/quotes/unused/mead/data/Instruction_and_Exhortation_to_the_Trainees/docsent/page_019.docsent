   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Cherishing and Nourishing the New Believers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is difficult to find an adequate definition for the word cherishing, even in the dictionary.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The best definition of cherishing is to make someone comfortable and happy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To cherish our children is to make them comfortable and happy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A wife may serve her husband good food, while neither her face, attitude, spirit, nor utterance is cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She is nourishing, but not cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As a result her husband will not feel comfortable and be happy, but hesitate to eat the food.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must learn to go back to the newly baptized ones with a smiling face, rather than with a stern face.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we command them to come together to have a meeting and demand to know where the other members of the family are, our "nourishing" will make everyone unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to learn to cherish people to make them happy 1 Thes 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then we can nourish them John 21:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sometimes children are naughty and refuse to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But some mothers are very good at cherishing them to get them to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Teaching and Perfecting the Saints, by Informal Group Meetings, to Build Up the Body</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Teaching is easier than perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The best way to teach and perfect the saints is to have group meetings with them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The group meetings should consist of no more than fifteen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The best number is eight to ten.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the large meetings we can only do a general work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The group meeting should not be a formal meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the past when we proposed having the group meetings, most of the time the elders came in to divide the saints according to where they lived.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is altogether too formal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some groups were good because they contained a number of experienced and gifted brothers who were leaders and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, these gifted brothers did everything, and the whole group eventually depended on them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This kind of formal group meeting is not good for fellowship, mutual care, mutual shepherding, and mutual teaching and perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The group meetings should be informal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They should spontaneously and automatically come into existence through those who preach the gospel to save the sinners and who then feed and nourish them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must each get two or three saved and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After this we should care for them by cherishing and nourishing them so that they may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After three or four of us have two or three like this under our care, we can then group them together.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then ten to fifteen of us can come together spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We do not need to sing a hymn, offer a prayer, or read a portion of the Word in a religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a formality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Maybe one will come in singing and another comes in praising.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After they sit down, the first one may start to tell what happened to him on that day and ask the other one to pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even though there are only two present, there is prayer for this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the start of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then, the second brother may tell the other about a certain brother's sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then they pray for the sick brother.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is an illustration of the proper way for a group meeting to begin.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then while these two are praying, two other brothers may come in and begin to share something.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The ten or twelve eventually get to know each other thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They know each other's up-to-date situation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Through this kind of fellowship, spontaneous intercession will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We do not need to wait until the church prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can pray and intercede at once in the group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this way we may find out that there is a financial need.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then we can take care of it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This also generates an atmosphere of shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As a result, all of the new ones are taken care of by the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Following the fellowship, we should use quite a time for mutual questions and mutual answers concerning spiritual life and scriptural truth that all could be taught and perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the meantime, we should also bring them to the church meetings.</S>
