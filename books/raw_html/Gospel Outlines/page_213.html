 <h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Thirteen</h2>
<h1 class="title">THE DEEDS OF MAN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Rom. 3:10-18</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Man&rsquo;s deeds express his nature
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>What man does is a result of what he is; what he is is based upon his human nature. Since man&rsquo;s nature is evil, so his deeds also are evil.</li>
	<li>Being in such a condition, man needs to realize that he is a sinner.<br />
	In speaking of man&rsquo;s evil deeds, focus upon the sins mentioned in Romans, plus some others. By this, you should touch people&rsquo;s feeling and cause them to realize that they are sinners. Pick out a few sins such as lying, stealing, and adultery, discussing them thoroughly and severely. First talk about the principle, then illustrate by examples. Do not touch the deeds of man superficially, but rather dig out the sins that are within him. Depict man&rsquo;s condition when he commits sins; do this in such a way that the audience may have the feeling of sin and be convicted.</li>

<h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Fourteen</h2>
<h1 class="title">THE NEED OF MAN</h2>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: John 3:3; Jer. 13:23; Heb. 9:22</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Man&rsquo;s need is based upon his condition<br />
<span class="normal">Because man&rsquo;s nature is evil and his behavior is corrupted, there is the need to deal with his evil nature and evil deeds.</span></li>
<li>Man&rsquo;s self-improvement and good behavior
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Sages and human philosophers throughout the generations have discovered the corrupt situation of man and have often tried their best to help it. The result is that man either tries to correct himself or to do good.</li>
	<li>To try to improve oneself is an attempt to make up for the lack in one&rsquo;s nature. To do good is to try to make up for the failure in one&rsquo;s deeds.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Man&rsquo;s self-improvement and good behavior are both useless
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Self-improvement cannot change the evil nature of man, just as the leopard cannot change his spots and the Ethiopian cannot change his skin.</li>
	<li>The principle of man&rsquo;s living by good behavior is basically wrong. Because to do good is a fundamental duty or responsibility of a human being, it cannot be regarded as an accomplishment even if a man were to succeed in doing good. Moreover, neither could good behavior hide the sins which may have been committed previously. For example, it is futile if by doing good a man attempts to erase his sin of having murdered somebody.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Man needs a saving way which includes two aspects
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man&rsquo;s evil deeds need to be erased. Man needs a salvation whereby his sins may be taken away and the record of them may be erased.</li>
	<li>Man&rsquo;s evil nature must be replaced. Because his evil nature cannot be corrected or improved, it must be replaced.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s way of salvation
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord Jesus shed His blood for us and ransomed us from sin. Thus, God&rsquo;s salvation takes care of man&rsquo;s evil deeds.</li>
	<li>Through this salvation we are regenerated and receive a new life, God&rsquo;s life, which replaces the original evil nature. Such a salvation also takes care of man&rsquo;s evil nature.</li>
	</ol></li>
