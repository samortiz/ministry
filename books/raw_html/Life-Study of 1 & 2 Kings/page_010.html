<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. CEASING IN HIS LIFE ON EARTH</H2><P>First Kings 2:10-11 speaks of David's ceasing in his life on earth. He was buried in the city of David (v. 10), after reigning over Israel for forty years: seven years in Hebron over Judah and thirty-three years in Jerusalem over the entire people of Israel (v. 11).</P><P>According to what David had done for Israel, the people should have taken action, at the time of his death, to remember him. However, contrary to what we might expect, the Bible does not give us a vivid record telling us that at his death the people expressed their appreciation of him. Rather, the record of the end of David's life on earth is dim and gloomy. This indicates that the indulgence of David's lust spoiled his splendid life. Moreover, the sins committed by Solomon and the thirty-eight kings after him can be traced to David's indulgence. His one indulgence resulted in the loss of the God-given good land by his descendants and in the spoiling of God's chosen people.</P><P>Although the ending of David's life was sad, God's sovereignty nevertheless overcame Satan's subtlety. God still carried out the return from captivity in order to preserve fourteen generations of Christ's genealogy. By the return from captivity the good land was recovered. God still carried out His intention to bring Himself in His Trinity into humanity and to set up His spiritual kingdom.</P>
