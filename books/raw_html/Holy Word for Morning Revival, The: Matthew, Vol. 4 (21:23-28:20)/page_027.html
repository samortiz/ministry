<p class="bold">WEEK 19 — DAY 5</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 26:49-54, 62-64</h2><p>49 &nbsp;And immediately he [Judas] came to Jesus and said, <sup>1</sup>Rejoice, Rabbi, and kissed Him affectionately.</p> <p>50 &nbsp;But Jesus said to him, Friend, <sup>1</sup>what are you here for? Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him.</p><p>51 &nbsp;And behold, <sup>1</sup>one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and took off his ear.</p> <p>52 &nbsp;Then Jesus said to him, Return your sword to its place, for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.</p><p>53 &nbsp;Or do you think that I cannot beseech My Father, and He will provide Me at once with more than twelve legions of angels?</p><p>54 &nbsp;How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled which say that it must happen <sup>1</sup>this way?</p><p class="bold">62 &nbsp;And the high priest stood up and said to Him, Do You answer <sup>1</sup>nothing? What is it that these testify against You?</p><p class="bold">63 &nbsp;But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to Him, I charge You to swear by the living God to tell us <sup>1</sup>if You are the Christ, the Son of God.</p> <p class="bold">64 &nbsp;Jesus said to him, You have said rightly. Nevertheless I say to you, From now on you will see the <sup>1</sup>Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>49<sup>1</sup> A word of greeting, here and in 27:29. Both greetings were false (cf. 28:9).</p><p>50<sup>1</sup> This word is equivalent to: “What are you doing here? You are betraying Me!” This word was spoken to expose Judas’s evil intention to betray the Lord.</p><p>51<sup>1</sup> This was Peter (John 18:10, 26).</p><p>54<sup>1</sup> This way refers to His death on the cross, which was prophesied in the Scriptures. These prophecies had to be fulfilled.</p><p>62<sup>1</sup> The Lord, standing before the Sanhedrin like a sheep before its shearers, would not say a word to vindicate Himself, fulfilling Isa. 53:7.</p><p>63<sup>1</sup> This is the same question that the devil asked in tempting the Lord before He began His ministry (4:3, 6).</p><p>64<sup>1</sup> The high priest asked the Lord if He was the Son of God, but He answered with the “Son of Man.” In His temptation He had answered the devil in the same way (4:4 and note 2). The Lord was the Son of Man on the earth before His crucifixion, has been the Son of Man in the heavens at the right hand of God since His resurrection (Acts 7:56), and will be the Son of Man even at His coming back on the clouds. To accomplish God’s purpose and to establish the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord had to be a man. Without man, God’s purpose could not be carried out on earth, nor could the kingdom of the heavens be constituted on earth.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>Judas kissed the Lord Jesus affectionately as a sign that He was the one to be seized. If it had been a stranger who had led the crowd to the Lord, it would not have been so painful to Him. But the one who led the crowd in arresting Him was one who had been so close to Him for three and a half years. Humanly speaking, this hurt the Lord Jesus.</p><p>Once again we see here [vv. 51-54] a contrast between two persons in the light of the kingdom. Peter resisted the Lord’s arrest, but the Lord was willing to accept it for the fulfillment of the Scriptures.…Our life simply cannot withstand the events and environment related to the kingdom. We all must come to realize this. If we did not have this record of Peter’s failure, defeat, and denial, we might think that our natural life could succeed in being for the kingdom, and we would want to be bold like Peter. However, our natural life is not adequate. Here in chapter twenty-six we see a natural Peter, but in Acts 2, 3, and 4 we see a resurrected Peter. Following the Lord Jesus on the pathway for the kingdom can only be done in the life of resurrection.
