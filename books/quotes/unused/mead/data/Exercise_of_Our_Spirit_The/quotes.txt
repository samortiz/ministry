[1]  The previous verse says, If I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth v. 15 . In principle, the church is both the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth, and the mystery of godliness the manifestation of God in the flesh.
[2]  By all of the preceding points, we can be clear that godliness is God manifested in the flesh.
[3]  Therefore, to exercise ourselves unto godliness is to exercise so that God may be manifested in us.
[4]  It is because the soul that surrounds our spirit is of three parts the mind, the emotion, and the will Prov 2:10; Psa 139:14; Lam 3:20; S. S. 1:7a; 2 Sam 5:8; Psa 86:4; Job 6:7; 7:15; 1 Chron 22:19a . These three parts must be related to our spirit in a proper way.
[5]  When our will is subdued by and submissive to our spirit, it becomes strong, and our spirit becomes a spirit of power.
[6]  Whenever we are rebellious to the Lord, our spirit is weakened and even deadened, but when we are submissive and obedient to the Lord, our spirit rises up and becomes powerful.
[7]  To exercise our spirit so that God may be manifested in us requires that we have a spirit with a submissive will, a loving emotion, and a fine, sober, clear, and proper mind.
[8]  A spirit of power is a spirit with a proper will, a spirit of love is a spirit with a proper emotion, and a spirit of sobermindedness is a spirit with a clear, sober, and sound mind.
[9]  The central thought of these two books is that whether we are elders, deacons, or anyone else in the service of the church, we need to exercise our spirit so that God in Christ as the Spirit may be manifested in us.
[10]  The conscience is the leading part of the spirit.
[11]  When our conscience condemns us, we are unable to exercise our spirit properly.
[12]  AND TO DEAL WITH THE WORD OF GOD Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 2:1-3, 8-14; 2 Tim 2:22; 1 Tim 1:3-4; 4:6-7; 2 Tim 4:4; 3:16; 1 Tim 1:10; 4:6; 6:3; 2 Tim 1:13; 4:3; Titus 1:9; 2:1 EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT IN EVERY KIND OF PRAYER
[13]  The two Epistles to Timothy speak in a particular way concerning praying and dealing with the word of God for the exercise of our spirit.
[14]  In order to pray with every kind of prayer, intercession, petition, and thanksgiving on behalf of all men, to pray in every place by raising holy hands, and to pray without wrath in our emotion or reasoning in our mind, we need to exercise our spirit.
[15]  We need to exercise our spirit to apprehend the word, because the word is spiritual breath, the very breath of God.
[16]  As we saw in the previous messages, in order to exercise our spirit we first need to deal with all our inward parts our mind, emotion, will, heart, and conscience.
[17]  Whether we read a spiritual book, listen to a message, or come to contact the word of God directly, we must learn to exercise our spirit to receive something healthy for our spirit.
[18]  THE SENSE OF THE ANOINTING Scripture Reading: Heb 9:14; 10:19-22; 1 John 1:7; 2:27; 1 Thes 5:16-22; 1 Tim 2:8; Eph 6:18 APPLYING THE CLEANSING OF THE BLOOD OF CHRIST FOR THE EXERCISE OF OUR SPIRIT Being Exposed in the Fellowship
[19]  For the exercise of our spirit we need the cleansing of the blood of Christ.
[20]  To exercise our spirit is to have fellowship with the Lord and also with the saints in the presence of the Lord.
[21]  The more we exercise our spirit, the more we enter into fellowship, are under the light, and sense how much we need the blood to cleanse us.
[22]  If we are careless with God and our fellowship with Him, we may not sense that we are sinful, but if we care for our fellowship with the Lord and desire to enter into the Holy of Holies, we will immediately sense a condemnation within.
[23]  First John 2:27 says, As for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him.
[24]  In order to exercise our spirit, we must not only apply the blood of Christ but also take care of this anointing.
[25]  However, when we go to the Lord, deep within our spirit there may be a feeling, consciousness, or sense, through the moving of the Holy Spirit within us, that we should pray for something else.
[26]  If at this time we continue to pray according to our memory, we will exercise only our mind in our prayer.
[27]  If we pray in the spirit and with the spirit, we will be able to pray wherever we are and at any time.
[28]  It is easy to open to the Lord when we pray by ourselves, but it is not as easy to open ourselves to others.
[29]  In order to exercise our spirit we need to practice until our spirit is strong enough that we have no fear before anyone or in any situation.
[30]  CHAPTER FIVE OUR REGENERATED SPIRIT AS OUR PERSON WITH OUR SOUL AS ITS ORGAN Scripture Reading: Rom 7:8, 11, 17, 20, 23; Matt 16:21-26; Eph 2:1, 5; Col 2:13; 1 Cor 2:14-15; 2 Cor 4:16; Eph 3:16; 4:22-24; Col 3:9-10; Rom 6:6; Gal 5:24; Heb 2:14
[31]  In the Bible, the word soul may be understood in several ways.
[32]  God formed a body for man from the dust of the ground, but the breath of life that God breathed into man s body became the spirit of man, the human spirit Job 32:8; Prov 20:27 .
[33]  When we live in the soul, we are living in the self and are involved with Satan, sin, and the flesh, but when we deny the soul, telling it that it has no more right or ground within us, we are delivered from Satan, sin, the flesh, and the self.
[34]  Romans 8:4 says, That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit.
[35]  Different translations of the Bible render spirit in Romans 8 either with an upper case S to designate the Holy Spirit or in lower case to designate our human spirit.
[36]  According to the usage in the New Testament, the word spirit in verse 4 denotes our regenerated human spirit indwelt by and mingled with the Spirit.
[37]  This again is the mingled spirit, our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God.
[38]  Of course, if we exercise our spirit, we may not become angry, but if we are angry, we must be able to say that we are angry in the spirit.
[39]  The proper way for Christians to live is to consider not whether something is good or bad but whether we are doing it by our self, in the soul, or by the Lord as the life-giving Spirit mingled with our spirit in a subjective way.
[40]  Whatever we do or speak, whoever we contact, and wherever we go, we must do it in the spirit.
[41]  If we cannot exercise our spirit in other matters, we will not be able to exercise our spirit in prayer.
[42]  When we are outside of the spirit, we may do many things foolishly, but if we are in the spirit, we will do things with wisdom.
