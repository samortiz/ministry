   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OUR BEING IN THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Matthew 28:19, the Lord commanded His disciples to baptize new believers into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>So when we were baptized through believing in the Lord, not only did the Triune God come into us, but we were also put into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord prayed in John 17:21, "That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First John 2:24 says, "You will abide both in the Son and in the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These verses clearly show us that not only the Father and the Son are coinhering; even we the believers are coinhering with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Specifically, the Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians 1:30 that we are in Christ: "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Also, Romans 6:3 tells us that when we are baptized we are put into Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First Corinthians 12:13 says, "In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body..and were all given to drink one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Corinthians 12:3 says, "No one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You see, the Bible reveals to us that we are in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By calling on His name "Lord Jesus Christ," we receive the Triune God and we are put into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is so wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God can be in us, and we can be in God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are coinhering with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are no more pitiful sinners destined to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Neither are we Christians going to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are free of God's condemnation of eternal death, but much more, we are now one with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He lives in us and we live in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hallelujah!</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>LIVING IN THIS COINHERENCE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>So when you are tempted by your friends to go to some improper places like movie theaters, or to do some evil things, be reminded that you are not alone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you think that God would like to go to those places or do those things?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you go, you will bring Him there.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Wherever you go and whatever you do, you are always coinhering with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He will never leave you, nor can you ever leave Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At such times, call on the Lord to activate the Triune God within you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then walk away from such temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When you are with your friends, you can speak God into them by telling them about this wonderful Triune God, His full salvation, and your coinherence with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then Satan cannot touch you, the world cannot influence you, the whole creation will be under you, and your friends will thank you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And God will be happy in you.</S>
