   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A characteristic of Paul was God's ability to use him and God's willingness to entrust him.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If God cannot use a person, He cannot entrust His word to him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If God entrusts His word to you and charges you to speak, how are you going to speak?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You have to speak according to what you are.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When God lets you speak His word, your mind will frustrate God's word if it is not working properly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If your emotion is improper, your emotion will contaminate God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If your motive is not proper, your motive will damage God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If your opinion is not proper, your opinion will contaminate God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If your spirit is not proper, you will give others the impression of an improper spirit even though all of your words may be correct.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fundamental problem today is that God's word has suffered much in the hands of man!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His word has suffered much loss in the hands of man!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why God cannot entrust His word to man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more we are dealt with by the Lord and the deeper His dealing touches our being, the closer we are to having a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When a man's emotion, mind, will, and spirit are all dealt with, the Holy Spirit puts His word in that person's mouth, and his utterance is an inspiration, a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The inspiration that the Bible refers to occurs when human elements are kept under the control of the Holy Spirit and are barred from going off on their own tangents.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the word is put into the mouth of such a person, the resulting ministry of the word is a revelation, an inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is why we say that the more dealings we receive, the more inspiration we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our mind, emotion, and will all have to pass through God's dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even our memory has to pass through God's dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, our understanding is very much related to God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, our understanding must pass through God's dealings as well.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our hearts need to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our motives also need to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God has to work on our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to remember that a minister of the word cannot be constituted without paying a price.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not think that constitution can occur without the paying of a price.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Can a man become a minister of the word simply because he has a quick mentality?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No. We should never have the mistaken thought that human wisdom, knowledge, or eloquence can add anything to God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to be smitten, pressed, and dismantled.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All of those who know the Lord realize that His hand is very heavy upon those whom He uses.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The purpose of His hand is to make a person a useful vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord has to break and dismantle us before we can become a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Being a minister of God's word does not come without the paying of a price.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some people have gone through years of dealings, perhaps ten, twenty, or even thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>During all those years, the Lord's hand has been upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He has dealt with them again and again and has worked on them over and over again.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Are we so dull?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Are we so sleepy?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is impossible for us to remain as we are and hope to participate in the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to prostrate ourselves before the Lord and say, "I am a useless vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I have to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have to be smitten and broken to the point where I can become useful in Your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Otherwise, I have no way to accomplish anything for You."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once we reach this point, the Lord's word will be released through us freely.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In summary, the Holy Spirit puts God's word into us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is His responsibility to tell us what we should speak.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But He leaves the decision of how and when we should speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God entrusts us and believes in us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His charge is that the spirits of prophets be subject to prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How grave is the responsibility of the prophets!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The way of the ministry of the word is the way of releasing God's word through man's mind and man's word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If our contribution is not up to the proper standard, God's word is no longer His word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This brings in serious consequences!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is easy for God to speak from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is easy for Him to speak through the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But He loves us and has chosen us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is indeed unfortunate if we become an obstacle to Him everywhere and in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are often proven to be useless vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In order for God to secure ministers of the word, we have to beg for mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to say to the Lord, "I will not let You go unless I receive mercy from You."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we do not receive mercy from Him, His word will stop with us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today the entire responsibility rests upon our shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have preached the word for more than ten or twenty years, but how much of what we have preached has been the utterance of God's word?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We claim that we are preaching God's word, but how much of God's word truly has been preached?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The basic principle of the ministry of the word is the principle of incarnation, the word becoming flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The word cannot skip the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Where there are ministers, there is God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Where there are no ministers, God's word is not found.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we do not find the ministers, we do not find God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There must be ministers before there can be God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>How great is the responsibility of the ministers before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we are ministers, we have to realize that the responsibility is on our shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God must secure ministers before He can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Without ministers, God cannot speak.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Today God does not speak directly to man, the heavens do not speak directly to man, and the angels do not speak directly to man.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If man does not open up his mouth, no one will hear God's word, and His word will be locked up.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>During the past two thousand years, God's word was released whenever He found some men.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Sometimes He would find one man, and His word would be released in a mighty way.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If God finds some ministers today, His word will be released in a mighty way once again.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If the church will stand on new ground and if it will satisfy God to become His vessel, God's word will once again be released in a mighty way.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But if we stand still, God will have no way to go forward on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Let me repeat: It is the ministers who bring in God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Without the ministers there is no word.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We must be uplifted to Paul's standard.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When we speak God's word, we should have the feeling that both we and the Lord are speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Then we will see the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>God's word is indeed rich.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>May He be merciful to us and grant us the word.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>May we see many ministers of the word being raised up.</S>
