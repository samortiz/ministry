   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ETERNAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eventually, the feeding with Christ's resurrection life and overcoming life results in eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the reason the Lord speaks in this chapter concerning eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 6:27 He says, "Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides to eternal life, which the Son of Man shall give you."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 40 He goes on to say, "For this is the will of My Father, that every one who sees the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 47 the Lord says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me has eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, eternal life definitely is emphasized in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to John 6:10, the number of men who were fed by the loaves and fishes was about five thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the women and children are also counted, the total number could well have been ten thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the people who were fed failed to realize the significance of the Lord's feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead, they were glad to have been fed by the Lord Jesus in such a marvelous way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That was the reason the next day a crowd gathered for the purpose of seeking Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They wanted to experience the same thing again.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the Lord Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek Me not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the bread and were satisfied" v. 26 . This indicates that they did not see the significance of the sign.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord went on to tell them not to work for the food which perishes, but to work for the food which abides to eternal life v. 27 . Here the Lord Jesus seems to be saying, "Do not seek for food that perishes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead, you should seek for eternal food, for food that abides forever."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What is this eternal food, or who is this food?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The eternal food is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He came from the heavens not only to be our Savior He also came to be our food.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that He came to be the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What we need is Christ as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not realize to the fullest extent how much we need the Lord Jesus to be our daily food.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yes, we may talk somewhat about life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, we do not know how much we need Christ as our food.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE BREAD OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Chapter six of the Gospel of John is unique in giving many details concerning the Lord Jesus as the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord clearly says, "I am the bread of life" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>35, 48 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the bread of life, He is the bread that came down out of heaven vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>41,50, 51, and 58 , He is the bread of God v. 33 , He is the living bread v. 51 , and He is the true bread v. 32 . Here we have five characteristics of the Lord as our bread: heavenly bread, the bread of God, the bread of life, the living bread, and the true bread.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As the bread that came down out of heaven, He is the heavenly bread.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As the bread of God, He is of God, He was sent by God, and He was with God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As the bread of life, He is the bread with eternal life, with zoe.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the living bread, He is living.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The bread of life refers to the nature of the bread, which is life; the living bread refers to the condition of the bread, which is living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As the true bread, Christ is the bread of truth or reality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is true, real.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is the true food, and all other kinds of food are merely shadows of Him as the real food.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The physical food we take in every day is a shadow of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The reality of the food we eat daily is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ is the true bread of life sent by God to bring us eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all need Christ to be the bread of life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even though you may hear many messages on life, you still may not be deeply impressed that you need Christ as your daily life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the reason we have been studying the Bible together in the way of life and giving messages that are called Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The burden in these messages is to point out that the Bible is not merely for teaching the Bible is for life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not come to the Bible merely to seek teachings concerning commandments and regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because the Bible is for life and life supply, we should come to it for food.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The food we enjoy through the Word is the Lord Jesus Himself as the bread of life.</S>
