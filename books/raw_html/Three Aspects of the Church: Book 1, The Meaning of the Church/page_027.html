	 <h2 class="head4">The Hindrance from the Relatives</h2>
<p>After the servant finished the sealing, testifying, and pledging, Rebekah should have immediately followed him. Her mother and brother, however, were reluctant to let her go and requested that she stay for at least ten days (Gen. 24:55). In typology, ten is the number of completion, and in this context it is used in the sense of hindering. When the Holy Spirit calls someone, his relatives often try to hinder him. Some may say, &ldquo;It is okay for you to believe in Jesus, but wait until you graduate from college.&rdquo; Or they may say, &ldquo;You must first go to work, and you can believe in Him later.&rdquo; These are examples of hindrance from the relatives. Some parents hinder their children, some children hinder their parents, some wives hinder their husbands, and some husbands hinder their wives. If we recall the story of our salvation, nearly every one of us experienced some hindrance from our relatives.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Willingness of the Church</h2>
<p>Even though there is hindrance from the relatives, there is still the willingness of the church. Rebekah not only typifies the church but also individual saints. On the one hand, there is the willingness of the church, but on the other hand, there is the willingness of the individual saints. When the servant and Rebekah&rsquo;s relatives discussed whether she should go or stay, they were not able to come to a decision, so they called Rebekah and asked about her preference. When they asked her, she said, &ldquo;I will go&rdquo; (v. 58). Her reply indicates her willingness.</p>
<p>Rebekah was truly brave. Transportation in those days was inconvenient. It was not easy for a young girl to marry someone in a foreign country far away from her hometown. However, when the Holy Spirit works in us, no matter how difficult the future may seem, we called ones spontaneously say, &ldquo;I will go.&rdquo; From the experience of our salvation, we can testify that when we said, &ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; our inner being was strong and buoyant. Although we thought of the difficulty of our future, there was a power within us, strengthening and supporting us to say, &ldquo;I will go.&rdquo; This declaration is a determination to leave the world. From that day, our whole life was moved out of the world. At this point, our calling is complete.</p>
<p>I recall the story of my salvation. At that time I was pursuing the knowledge of the world and seeking to have a future in the world. Then one day I heard the preaching of a young sister. At that moment the Holy Spirit met me and put a ring upon my nose. Later when I was walking home, the Holy Spirit operated in me in a strong way, and I said, &ldquo;I do not want the world anymore. I decide to follow the Lord.&rdquo; I experienced what happened to Rebekah. Although at the time, I did not know that there was such a record in the Bible, much less understand the type, my inner being was saying, &ldquo;I will go.&rdquo; My inner being kept saying, &ldquo;I do not want the world. I want only God. Let my parents, relatives, and classmates be satisfied with the world. I must move away from here. I do not belong to this place. I have been betrothed to Him. Wherever He is, I must be also. My entire life has been moved out of the world.&rdquo; On the day the Holy Spirit met and called us, we said strongly and buoyantly, &ldquo;I will go.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Journey</h2>
<p>Eve as a type of the church speaks of the producing of the church and the nature of the church. Rebekah as a type of the church speaks of the church being chosen from the world and of the journey of the church. After Rebekah was chosen, the servant took her to the land of Canaan on a camel (vv. 61-64). After the church was chosen, set apart, and called by God, the church must take a long journey.</p>
<p>After a person is called, he is destined to travel a long distance. No one who is called may stop and not continue forward. Some people count every day, calculating when Christ will come. They do not realize that Christ&rsquo;s coming has everything to do with our journeying. When the church finishes her journey, she will meet Christ. Rebekah did not wait for Isaac in Paddan-aram. Rather, she traveled a long distance from Paddan-aram, until one day toward evening, Isaac came to welcome her. There are two journeys in this account: a long journey and a short journey. The church takes a long journey, and Christ takes a short journey. When the church finishes her journey, Christ will come to welcome her. Hence, the church should not sit and wait for Christ&rsquo;s coming. Christ&rsquo;s coming requires us to journey. Some people spend all of their time speaking of how the church will be raptured and of the timing of the reaping of the harvest. However, only after the harvest has ripened will the Lord of the harvest come to reap the harvest. Hence, we should not consider the matter of rapture merely in terms of a prophecy; rather, we must consider it in terms of a journey. The church should not merely study the ways of being raptured but take the way of a journey. Only when the church has finished her course will she be raptured to marry Christ.</p>
<p>Rebekah took a long journey, and Isaac took a short one. In regard to direction, Rebekah traveled upward over a long distance, and Isaac came downward for only a short way. In regard to the time traveled, Rebekah must have traveled for a few weeks, whereas Isaac came out in the evening and walked for only a short period of time. Christ will come down from the heavens when the church is about to finish her journey. Hence, we should not simply study and wait for the rapture; instead, we should finish our journey.</p>
<p>On the evening of Rebekah&rsquo;s arrival, Isaac went out from the tent to the field (v. 63). In the New Testament the field refers to the world. This means that at the end of this age, Christ will come back to the earth to meet the counterpart whom He has called throughout the ages&mdash;the church. However, Isaac did not marry Rebekah in the field but in his mother&rsquo;s tent (v. 67). The tent typifies the New Jerusalem, the tabernacle of God with men (Rev. 21:3). At this time the church, which He called throughout the generations, will be completely one with Him.</p>
<p>The servant took Rebekah on a camel and passed through the wilderness. The camel is a means of transportation used in a dry place such as the desert. Rebekah traveled a way that was long and desolate from Paddan-aram through the deserts to the land of Canaan. This signifies that the way that the church takes on earth is a path full of suffering and sorrow; it is rugged, difficult, and dangerous. According to the record in Leviticus 11, the camel is unclean (v. 4). This signifies that while the church is journeying on the earth, the Holy Spirit arranges certain people, matters, and things as tools to deal with the church so that the church can proceed onward. The Holy Spirit always raises up certain people, matters, and things to help the church advance. These persons, matters, and things are not considered by God as clean; rather, they are unclean camels. There are oxen and lambs in God&rsquo;s tabernacle but never camels; however, on the path through the wilderness there are camels.</p>
<p>After we were saved, our family, classmates, and colleagues may have persecuted us. However, this kind of difficulty and persecution often carried us for a distance. At other times we may have experienced another kind of suffering that forced us to draw nearer to the Lord. These difficulties and sufferings are camels that carry us onward. All the environments that the Holy Spirit uses to deal with us are actually camels. The church not only journeys upon a desolate path that passes through deserts but is also carried along on camels, which are unclean in the eyes of God.</p>
<p>The servant was Rebekah&rsquo;s guide, and the camels were her means of transportation. The servant as the guide typifies the Holy Spirit as the guide of the church, and the unclean people, matters, and things raised up by the Holy Spirit typify the means of transportation that carry the church along its way. As the Holy Spirit leads a saint onward with the Lord, he may not be willing to follow; thus, the Holy Spirit must raise up a difficult environment to force him onward. This environment is similar to a large camel. Once the camel comes, it will bring him onward.</p>
<p>Our experience of salvation testifies that this picture is real. Romans 8:28 says, &ldquo;All things work together for good to those who love God.&rdquo; The path taken by the church on the earth throughout the past two thousand years has been long, hard, and rugged. In 1900 thousands of Christians were killed in the Boxer Rebellion. From the human perspective, the church suffered a great deal. But from God&rsquo;s perspective, the church in China was able to travel a long distance in a glorious way. The Boxer Rebellion can be compared to a large camel that was unclean in the eyes of God, yet it functioned as a means of transportation for the church.</p>
<p>The reason the churches in China are in their present condition is due to the persecution of Christians in the Boxer Rebellion. Since that time there has been the continual increase of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony in China. On a large scale, international wars often serve as camels to bring God&rsquo;s church onward. On a smaller scale, husbands who persecute their wives, wives who make things difficult for their husbands, unsaved children, and parents who are not clear regarding salvation are also camels used by God to bring the saints onward. The &ldquo;all things&rdquo; spoken of in Romans 8:28 and 32 are the means that God uses to take His church onward in her journey on the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Result&mdash;Marriage</h2>
<p>In the end Isaac married Rebekah. This is a type of the marriage of the Lamb in Revelation (19:7; 21:2). The timing of this marriage is determined by the distance. When the church reaches the end of her course, she will meet Christ. From the viewpoint of the church, it will not be morning but close to the end of time. From Christ&rsquo;s viewpoint, it will be the morning, close to the dawning of the day. When the church finishes her journey, Christ will come to meet her.</p>
<p>Once Rebekah saw Isaac, she took her veil and covered herself (Gen. 24:65). Spiritually, this signifies that from that point onward Rebekah gave herself entirely to Isaac. Formerly, she lived her own life, but from that point onward, she lived her life under Isaac. She and Isaac were no longer two persons but one. She covered her head, indicating that she was finished, taken away, and given entirely to Isaac. She lived under Isaac, in Isaac, and mingled with Isaac. Rebekah&rsquo;s head covering indicates not only that she came under an authority but also that she hid and covered herself and ceased to exist. Hence, the result of the marriage is that the two became one flesh. This is also typified by Adam and Eve.</p>
<p>As types, the ultimate issue of both Eve and Rebekah is that the two became one flesh with their husbands. Rebekah was with the one to whom she belonged, and Isaac was comforted. This signifies that the church is with the One to whom she belongs and that Christ is satisfied. The type of Rebekah makes up for a lack in the type of Eve. In the type of Eve, there is a union and two becoming one flesh, but we do not see the result of two becoming one flesh. In the type of Rebekah, however, we see that the result of two becoming one flesh is love and comfort. &ldquo;It is not good for the man to be alone&rdquo; (2:18). The issue of the union of Christ and the church is that the church is with Christ, enjoys Christ&rsquo;s love, and Christ is satisfied.</p>
