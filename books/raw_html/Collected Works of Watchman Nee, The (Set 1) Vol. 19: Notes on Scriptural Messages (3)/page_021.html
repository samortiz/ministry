<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Concerning Prayer</H2><P>Psalm 39:12 says, "Hear my prayer, O Jehovah;/And hearken to my cry;/Do not hold Your peace at my tears./ For I am a stranger with You,/A sojourner, as all my fathers were." The best way to receive God's answer to our prayer is to pray with tears before Him. If our prayers are seasoned with tears, they will be answered much sooner. Many prayers are heartless prayers because there are no tears in them. A person can only have tears when his heart is there. We can tell the Lord that we are not here for long, that we are only sojourners and strangers, and that we have suffered long enough on this earth. Based on this, we can ask Him to hear our prayers. God will answer our prayers this way. Although the tears themselves score no merit, they nevertheless show what is in our heart; they show that we have an earnest heart. May we have more tears in our prayers, so that God would answer us.</P><P>Second Kings 20:5-6 says, "Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold,...I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake." How wonderful it is that God sees our tears. Hezekiah prayed for his longevity with tears, and God answered. This means that God is pleased with our tearful prayers. Our tearful prayers can move God's heart. Anything that does not move our heart to tears will surely not move God's heart. It does not hurt if we shed more tears before God. Shedding tears before man is a sign of weakness and speaks of our lack of manliness. But being unable to shed tears before God is an indication that we have become just a piece of stone and wood, and that we are insensitive. I treasure very much the words of 2 Kings 20:5: "I have seen thy tears." Every time we encounter difficulties, sufferings, and pressure, and every time we come to the end of ourselves, we can lift up our heads and shed our tears before Him. God sees our tears. However, if the tears are not before Him, they are useless. There are many people who weep in this world. Men's tears only show their own sorrows and sufferings; they do not affect anything. Tears must be accompanied by prayers. Every time we weep, suffer, and feel sorrowful, we should also pray. We can tell God our sufferings and sorrows through our prayer. The Bible not only shows us that Hezekiah prayed this way, but our Lord also petitioned and supplicated with strong crying and tears (Heb. 5:7).</P><P>Many times it is useless for two persons to cry to each other. But it is useful to cry to God, because God sees our tears and will answer our prayers. Indeed, God counts every drop of our tears. Psalm 56:8 says, "You have counted my wanderings./Put my tears into Your bottle./Are they not in Your book?" Please remember the benefit of shedding tears before God. Sorrowful men! If we are embittered by human life and are pressed beyond measure, if we have lost our taste for life, if we are weary of struggling and cannot get through with all of our problems, simply go to God and cry. Be assured that it will not be in vain. God records every tear that we shed and puts them in a bottle. This means that God preserves all our experiences of sufferings like keeping tears in a bottle. Thank the Lord that our tears have not fallen to the ground and been lost in the dust; they are preserved in God's bottle. "Are they not in Your book?" This shows that God does not forget. He preserves and remembers.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, do you know what kind of crying is most enjoyable and refreshing? When does a child cry most loudly and vigorously? It is not when he is chastised, nor when he is hungry, but when he is bullied by others outside the house and has suffered injustice or frustration. When he returns home and cries to his dear mother, the crying is very unrestricted; he can surely have a good cry before her. The crying that is done before one's loved one is the most releasing kind of crying. It is not very meaningful to cry before other men, and the tears do not count for much. Where then should we go to cry and when should we cry? We cry before God, the One who loves us and cares for us the most. With God we can cry until our heart is fully relieved because He cares for us. Our crying to God is most enjoyable because God listens carefully to us. Another reason that we can cry unreservedly is that He will do according to what we ask of Him. Indeed, if we will do this before God, we will see some most wonderful results.</P><P>Let us read the story of a father and his son, and we will understand immediately the profit of praying with tears before God. Mark 9:24 says, "Immediately, crying out, the father of the child said, I believe; help my unbelief!" At that time, it was too painful for him. He hated the fact that he could not believe, or that his faith was not enough. On one hand, he saw his child in pain and could not make him better in spite of all that he had done. On the other hand, he sought for the help of the Lord's disciples, and they were unable to do anything. He was indeed frustrated. Under such anxiety and pain, he could not contain himself; he had to cry and call on the Lord. What was the result? The Lord heard his prayer, and the child was healed. There is a reason for many prayers not being answered. It is because there are no tears.</P><P>Second Timothy 1:3-4 says, "Unceasingly I have remembrance concerning you in my petitions night and day, longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy." Why did Paul want to see Timothy? It was because of Timothy's tears. All the workers of the Lord in the Bible are men of tears. We believe that no proper worker of the Lord can be without tears. It seems that tears are the one necessary thing that a worker must have. All proper prayers should be with tears. This will cause God to remember us and answer us.</P>
