   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GOAL OF SPREADING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In every place where the spread is going on, there are about forty to fifty newly baptized believers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The four full-timers need to work on these new ones until they are stable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The full-timers should persistently work on them step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After that the full-timers can knock on doors and gain more new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The number of new ones should increase steadily over time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We hope that after four months there will be about forty saints in each locality who are regular and steady in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can then move two of the full-timers to another place, and two can remain in the new locality for the long term.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We hope that in every locality some saints would be produced as responsible ones and that several suitable homes would be available for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These new saints will be able to bear the local burden with the serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we said earlier, accommodations in the twelve new bases are ready for the second wave of full-timers; hence, the second wave can set out immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Twelve teams with six members each will labor in these twelve places for four months.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other words, a total of seventy-two persons will labor in twelve bases for four months.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that after four months we will have spread to a total of twenty-seven new places on the island of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are four full-timers stationed in each of the initial fifteen places, and the twelve new places will have six full-timers each.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Each of the first fifteen places had two people laboring in them for two months, and they will have four people laboring in them for another four months.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this way the manpower is balanced and evenly distributed in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the situation of the twenty-seven new places for the spread.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we continue spreading according to this pattern, in 1991 we will conclude this stage in the work of evangelizing Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There will be one hundred newly established churches and two full-time serving ones in every church for a total of two hundred full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We began with one hundred full-timers and an additional thirty full-timers joined them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to continue adding more full-timers until there are two hundred full-timers laboring in the new churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should send the full-timers out in waves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 1991 there will be one hundred new churches with two serving ones stationed in every church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This will bring us to the end of the first stage of evangelizing Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>SPREADING THE GOSPEL OVERSEAS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By the end of 1991 there will be two hundred trained young brothers and sisters in one hundred new churches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Depending on our need and the situation, we will then decide whether we should continue the spread.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are presently laboring mainly in larger townships that have a population of over thirty thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Later we will labor in the towns that have a population of over ten thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In most of these smaller towns people tend to be scattered instead of living in clusters; hence, we feel that it may not be effective to establish bases for the work in these towns.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our future direction will be to use the one hundred churches as bases and spread out from them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This will be the second stage of evangelizing Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thereafter, the full-timers who graduate from the full-time training will most likely stay in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We hope that they will form teams of six to labor in the various communities in Taipei, just like the full-timers who are laboring in the towns and villages.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The labor of the full-timers in Taipei to gain enough fruit for a district meeting will be equivalent to establishing a church in one of the towns.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, the newly trained graduates can also replace those who have labored six months or longer in the towns and villages.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This will release some from the first wave of full-timers to go overseas.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The United States will be the first place that they will go to labor overseas.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the full-timers should be prepared to learn either English or Spanish.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then after the full-timers have labored in America for a few years, perhaps some can go to the Spanish-speaking countries where there is a vast field for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are many colleges and universities in Taiwan, and people on this small island live in a clustered environment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This makes it easy to spread the gospel and to gain college graduates who can receive the full-time training.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This spontaneously makes Taiwan a place that can produce full-time workers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I believe that in six or seven years there will be three to five hundred full-timers going out from Taiwan; some will go to North America, others to Central and South America, and still others to Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this way we will be able to evangelize not only Taiwan but also the Americas and even all of Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is a good prospect, and we should all endeavor toward this prospect.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In particular, those who are laboring on the campuses in Taiwan need to gain college students with this in view.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We hope that the full-time training will produce at least sixty full-timers every year.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After five or six years three to five hundred saints will have gone through the training.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These saints should go to various places for the spread of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The apprentices can be produced in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After these apprentices receive the training, they will go to the towns and villages to labor for six months to one year, and then they will go to labor overseas.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every new group of apprentices who are raised up will follow in the footsteps of those who have gone before them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This will be a blessing to the island of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We hope that in relation to this spread all the churches will be in coordination and that all the co-workers will understand that this is our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then the churches in Taiwan can enter into an atmosphere of propagation and increase for God s pleasure and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Furthermore, through this process some saints will mature in their experience and growth in life, and their human experience will reach a certain measure of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The trainees who mature can be sent overseas to evangelize Latin America and Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>May the Lord fulfill this plan.</S>
