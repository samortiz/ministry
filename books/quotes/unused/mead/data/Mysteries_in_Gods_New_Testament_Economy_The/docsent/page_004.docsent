   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REACTION TO THIS TURMOIL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I personally passed through these few turmoils and took the lead in taking care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For this reason, I have many thoughts and realizations and have even seen many things concerning these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am saying all this to let everyone know the cause and direction of our meeting at this time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Except for this reason, I have no desire to mention anything concerning the past.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we come together this time, the primary thing is to return to the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I believe a lot of you here, after hearing about the things that have happened in the last three to five years, would all feel that we have heard too much.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The same words and the same things have been repeated again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It has really been meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>May the Lord cover me with the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>During this entire time of turmoil, I did not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Up until last November, I had been silent.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I spent most of my time here in Taipei to bear the Lord's commission for three things: 1 to conduct the training for the gospelization work of Taiwan; 2 to bring in the new way beginning from the church in Taipei; and 3 to work with the translation and editing of the Chinese New Testament Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, most of my time was spent on the New Testament Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>During this period I was silent for another reason: I wanted to see what the Lord's hand was doing and what the mind of the Lord was.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I had indeed heard enough, but I did not think that I should express any opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That was why I was silent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I only released some messages to the church here according to the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The supply on this side has never stopped, but I did not do anything to deal with the problem that had arisen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was not until November of last year when we had the international conference on Thanksgiving Day in Anaheim that I received the clear direction from the Lord, had a clear understanding of all the situations, and began to speak officially.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I spoke twice to all the elders and co-workers from different countries, once after the Thanksgiving conference and another time after the winter training.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Based on the messages and fellowship in these two times, I compiled the two books The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion and The Present Situation of the Churches in the Recovery throughout the World.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These two books are my clarifying and concluding word to the saints in the Lord's recovery throughout the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I also prepared this clarifying and concluding word for the sake of history.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The book The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion includes my spoken messages, but its content was edited afterwards by me personally.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have carefully checked all the facts and have tried my best to be accurate, to be without any mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In addition to an account of the beginning and development of the whole period of the rebellion, the content of that book includes personal testimonies from over thirty brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, concerning this storm, I have spoken the clarifying and concluding word that I needed to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have absolutely no more interest in talking about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This matter now stops here.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I hope that you brothers who have come to attend this conference will not mention it anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It does not deserve any more mentioning.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In these four days we will go on.</S>
