   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE FEELING OF THE SPIRIT BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE FEELING OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The feeling of the spirit is the feeling of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This life is not our natural life, but the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because the spirit is life and life is the spirit, the feeling of the spirit is the feeling of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With all kinds of life, there is the feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A higher life has a higher feeling, and a lower life has a lower feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A strong life has a strong feeling, and a weak life has a weak feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The life of God within us is the Spirit, and this Spirit is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This life is the highest life and therefore surely has the most feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As saved ones we should be filled with all kinds of spiritual feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not be void of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE FEELING OF THE SPIRIT COMING</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>FROM THE OPERATING OF THE LAW OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The feeling of the spirit stems from the moving of the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This moving is like the anointing of an ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When you put a face cream on your face, your face feels it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our feeling of the spirit likewise stems from the moving of the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is what is spoken of in Philippians 2:13 when it says that God is operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moreover, His operation is a law; it is the operation of the law of life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This law belongs to the life and is a natural function of the life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As long as conditions meet the requirements of the law, the law automatically operates.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When this law of life operates within us, it gives us the feeling of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The feeling of the spirit is liveliest, keenest, and strongest when we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is like our blood circulation, which accelerates when we run.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we pray and have fellowship with the Lord, the operation of the Spirit within increases so that the feeling of the spirit within becomes keener.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE FEELING OF THE SPIRIT BEING</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>DELICATE, MEEK, AND CALM</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The feeling of the spirit is delicate, meek, and calm.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we want to sense the spirit s feeling, we have to learn to be calm.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you are of a quick temper, you will not be able to sense the feeling of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more delicate, meek, and calm you are, the clearer your feeling of the spirit becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE FEELING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>BEING LIFE AND PEACE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>AS OPPOSED TO DEATH AND UNEASINESS</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The feeling of the spirit is life and peace as opposed to death and uneasiness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Life includes satisfaction, fulfillment, strength, livingness, and freshness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These are all phenomena of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Death includes emptiness, dissatisfaction, weakness, depression, and oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The general phenomenon of life is peace, and the general phenomenon of death is uneasiness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you are satisfied, full, strong, living, and fresh, you will surely feel at ease and peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you are dissatisfied, weak, depressed, and old, you will certainly feel uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These phenomena within us produce a feeling which lets us know whether or not we are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are in the spirit, we will have life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are not in the spirit, but in the flesh, we will have death and uneasiness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>V. THE FEELING OF THE SPIRIT NEEDING</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A STRONG AND SOBER MIND</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The feeling of the spirit needs to be matched by a strong, sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you want to be strong in your spirit, you must have a strong will.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And if you want to have a sober spirit, you must have a sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When your will is strong and your mind is sober, your spirit will be calm.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you are an indecisive person, like a ship without a rudder drifting without direction according to the wind, your feeling of the spirit will not be accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you wander all the time in your imagination, your mind will not be sober and your feeling of the spirit will not be keen.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You will be like a piece of glass which, though it should be transparent, has lost its transparency because all kinds of paint have been put upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, the feeling of the spirit needs a strong and sober mind.</S>
