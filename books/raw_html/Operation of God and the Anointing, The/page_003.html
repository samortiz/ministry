        <h2 class="head1">GRACE</h2>
<p>Grace is God entering into man and being joined to man so that man may have His life and nature. Grace is God being enjoyed by man to be man&rsquo;s inner blessing. Grace is God entering into man to be man&rsquo;s life and everything so that God can accomplish His goal in man.</p>
<p>It is possible for man to receive many outward blessings from God without receiving grace. It is also possible for man to enjoy many outward things without receiving God&rsquo;s life. Adam enjoyed everything that God created, but he did not have the life of God. Although he did not lack any material thing, he lacked the life of God. Although he received many items from God, he did not receive the life of God. Adam&rsquo;s relationship with God was based on his being created; he did not have a life relationship with God. Therefore, after God created him, God placed him in front of the tree of life (Gen. 2:8-9) so that he might receive the divine life, that is, receive God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>What Adam enjoyed in the garden of Eden was in his environment and was outward. Those blessings enabled him to exist and afforded him an opportunity to receive the life of God. Grace, which is related to life, is spiritual and inward. If a man enjoys only outward blessings without receiving God as grace, he will feel unsatisfied and empty. This is the reason that people sense the vanity of human life. Even if a person were to enjoy material blessings as Solomon did, as long as he does not have God, his human life will be empty. For this reason, Solomon exhorted people to remember their Creator in the days of their youth, before the evil days come (Eccl. 12:1). Enjoying material blessings cannot satisfy man&rsquo;s inner need. The only thing that can satisfy man&rsquo;s inner need is the Lord Jesus. A man who enjoys outward blessings without enjoying the Lord will feel empty.</p>
<p>A person who enjoys outward things but does not receive God as life is a pitiful human being. Although he may be able to enjoy everything God created, this does not mean that he enjoys the Lord who is the Creator of all things. He has received outward blessings, not grace. Only when God enters into him to be his life can he receive grace. Grace is God as life entering into man; that is, grace is God Himself. We often focus on outward things but neglect grace; we receive the outward things but lose grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN IMPROPER FOCUS</h2>
<p>It is worrisome that many believers focus on outward blessings. They ask to be healed of sickness, for a lack to be supplied, for a place to live, for food and clothing, for their home to be in a convenient location, and for safe and peaceful travel. These are matters related to the environment. Believers often focus on obtaining these outward blessings rather than obtaining God.</p>
<p>After the fall, man was far away from God and separated from God&rsquo;s care. As a result, man fell into various hardships. Some hardships are material, such as a lack of food or clothing, whereas other hardships are psychological, such as sorrows and sufferings. Man faces such hardships because he has lost God and His care. When man repents, he seeks God for solutions to these problems. Hence, saints often testify of how God cares for them, answers their prayers, solves their problems, meets their need, or comforts them. These testimonies are in the realm of outward blessings. It seems as though the grace that God gives us is related to outward things, such as solving problems, alleviating sufferings, supplying a lack, and answering prayers for material things.</p>
<p>Believers regard God&rsquo;s grace in this way because they are influenced by their background. If we are willing to come out of our background, forget about our hardships and sufferings, and stand in an objective position, we will see that God&rsquo;s desire is not related to outward physical things or peace. God does not merely desire to give us outward physical things; He desires to give us spiritual grace. Outward things are but a procedure; spiritual grace is the goal. The procedure is for the goal. God desires to put His life in us so that we can receive and enjoy Him.</p>
<p>A brother who was sick prayed and was healed. Another brother who lost his job prayed and found another job. A sister who had a problem with her housing prayed, and the problem was resolved. A brother who lacked a means of livelihood prayed, and he received provision. Although these are examples of God&rsquo;s care, they are outward. Only God and His life are grace.</p>
<p>The provisions that God gives us are related to things and matters, which enable us to exist so that we may achieve His goal, that is, so that we may receive Him and His life. God&rsquo;s provisions are to achieve His goal. The outward things that we receive from God enable us to receive grace.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
