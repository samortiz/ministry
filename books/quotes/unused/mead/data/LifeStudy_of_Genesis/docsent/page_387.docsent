   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 Securing a Choice Bride</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that Isaac enjoyed all the wells.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Wherever he went there was a well for his enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This reveals that whether we are right or wrong in our standing there is a well for our satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In addition to enjoying the wells, Isaac secured a choice bride 24:61-67 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He gained her without doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As he was meditating in the field, she came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Isaac was not a doing person; he was an enjoying person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His father and his servant did everything to secure a bride for him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Isaac did not even go to Rebekah; Rebekah came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In all of history I have never heard of another case in which the bride came to the groom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All Christian natural doings are just a type of supplanting, a type of heel holding.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Never supplant or hold the heel of others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rebekah is your portion and she will come.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before the foundation of the world, it was destined that Rebekah would be yours.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do you believe this?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do you dare to claim it?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Isaac received his Rebekah simply by meditating in the field, not by doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3 Gaining Twin Sons</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After twenty years without having a child, Isaac gained twin sons 25:20-21, 26b .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Did God not say in His promise that Isaac, the only seed of Abraham, would be the one in whom all the nations of the earth would be blessed?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose Isaac never had a son.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How then could this promise be fulfilled?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And if this promise were not fulfilled, how could God's purpose be accomplished?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, it was not only Isaac who needed a son, but also God who needed a seed out of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because Isaac did not realize this for twenty years, God did not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God had a need and intended to do something about it, but He required the cooperation from the human side.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For twenty years Isaac was only enjoying, not caring about his need for a son.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But after twenty years, he realized that he had such a need and that his need corresponded to God's need.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once he realized this, he prayed and God answered his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The same is true with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we realize that our need corresponds to God's need and then pray accordingly, God will answer our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Actually, His answer to our prayer is the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our need must be God's need, and the prayer for our need should also be the prayer for God's need.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When our need corresponds with God's and when we then pray for our need, God's need will be met also.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When Isaac prayed for a child, whose need was greater Isaac's or God's?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Surely God's need was greater.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nevertheless, the greater need of God could only be fulfilled in the smaller need of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only when man realizes his need and prays for it does God have the way to come in to fulfill His need.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God has a purpose, and we have a need which corresponds to God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But God cannot do anything until we realize our need and pray about it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then God will answer our prayer to meet our need for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, Isaac had a son, Jacob, who not only fulfilled Isaac's need but also fulfilled God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Out of Jacob came Christ, who brings in the church, the kingdom, and the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All these eternal things came about through the meeting of Isaac's need, a need which corresponded with God's need.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Enjoyment is our destiny, and wherever we go there will be a well.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But in the enjoyment of God's grace, we must render Him our human coordination that He may fulfill His eternal purpose through us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that our enjoyment of grace will never be in vain, for the enjoyment of grace on our side eventually becomes the fulfillment of God's purpose on His side.</S>
