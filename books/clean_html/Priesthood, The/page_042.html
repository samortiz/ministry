<h2 class="head1">THE INCENSE OF CHRIST<br />
AND THE PRAYERS OF THE PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>Revelation 5:8 tells us that the prayers of the saints are the bowls which contain the incense of Christ. In our prayers, which are the bowls, are the various precious aspects of Christ, which are like the incense. The rich, sweet, precious aspects of Christ are just like the incense added to the prayers of the saints. Then the following verses say that all the saints are priests. To be priests we must offer prayers, and when we do, something of Christ will be added to our prayers. Revelation 8 also says that the rich sweetness and preciousness of Christ are ready to be added to the prayers of the saints.</p>
<p>If we would pray, we would partake of the preciousness and sweetness of Christ. When we pray in the spirit, the riches of Christ are added to our prayer. In Revelation, the saints are praying as priests. While they are praying, the sweetness, the preciousness, and the riches of Christ are added to their prayer. This means that while we are praying in the spirit, we will realize the richness and sweetness of Christ. We will enjoy all the different aspects of Christ by praying.</p>
<p>It is here, praying in the spirit, that we will obtain mercy and find grace to meet our timely need. This is the flow from the throne of grace, but we only touch it by praying. We must come into the Holy of Holies and unto the throne of grace by exercising our spirit to pray. When we pray in this way, we realize the mercy and grace, and the living water flowing from within. Then we are watered, nourished, and strengthened. We will sense in our spirit the sweetness and richness of Christ added to our prayer. It is here, praying in the spirit, that we will realize the priesthood and enjoy Christ.</p>
<p>Whenever we have a thought, immediately we must turn that thought into prayer in the spirit. Whenever we start to argue with others, we must immediately turn that argument into prayer. If we do, I can assure you that after a certain period of time we will realize it is pointless to argue. Our concept will be changed. If we talk too much, we must learn to turn our talk into prayer. Even the reading of the Word must be turned into prayer. This is because in reading, we are in the mind; so we must pray-read to bring ourselves into the spirit.</p>
<p>Whenever we have some trouble with others, we must turn that trouble into prayer, because that trouble will keep us in the soul. The more we are in the soul, the more trouble we will have. As long as we are in the soul, our problem will never be solved. It is important to turn the problem into prayer. This means to turn ourselves from the soul to the spirit. It is not just a matter of solving our problems, but of turning ourselves from the soul to the spirit.</p>
<p>As long as we are in the spirit, we are in the priesthood, and as long as we are in the priesthood, we have the enjoyment of Christ and are in the building up of the Body. Then we are in the church life. There is no other way. It is only in the priesthood that we enjoy Christ in order to have the proper and genuine church life. So we see that the building up of the church is dependent upon the priesthood.</p>
