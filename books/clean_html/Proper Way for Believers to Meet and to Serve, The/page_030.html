<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE NEED<br />
TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM</h2>
<p>My burden for this conference is our changing the system and taking a new way. We need a change in three matters. First, our former way of preaching the gospel by inviting people to come is wrong. The Bible says that when we preach the gospel, we need to go; that is, we need to go to people&rsquo;s homes and deliver the gospel to them. Our inviting people to come did not have much result, and if we had some fruit, very few remained. We must change this practice.</p>
<p>Second, after someone is baptized, we should continue to visit him and have home meetings with him. This is the way to keep the new believers and make them remaining fruit. In the past we compelled people to come and listen to the gospel, to believe in the Lord, and to be baptized. But when we asked them to come to the church meetings, they would stop attending after a few times. Over time we also would lose interest in them and give up. As a result, they died a premature death. How can babies grow without being fed? Preaching the gospel by inviting people to come is a mistake, and not meeting with a new one in his home in order to feed him after he is saved and baptized is also a mistake. We should deliver the gospel to people in their homes and also send the meetings to their homes. We should not only lead people to salvation; we must also nourish them.</p>
<p>Third, our former way of practicing the church meetings with one person speaking and the rest listening is also wrong. Even if two or three speak, it is still wrong. A new believer is burning in spirit and has a strong desire to testify, but he is not given the opportunity to testify. Our former way of meeting makes it easy for people not to speak. When a person is saved, he wants to speak, but because only one or two function while everyone else is silent, he does not dare to speak.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRADITIONAL WAY<br />
OF ONE PERSON SPEAKING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Advantages</h2>
<p>The practice of one person speaking and the rest listening is a traditional way that has advantages and disadvantages. The first advantage is that it maintains a pleasant facade. I used to invite people to come and listen to the gospel. If someone came, I expected the gospel meeting to have a particular facade. The meeting hall should look nice, the seats should be arranged neatly, there should be at least several hundred attendees, the singing should be pleasant, and the brother who gives the message must be eloquent so that he can capture everyone&rsquo;s attention. I was happy to sit with my friend in such a situation. Everyone likes such an impressive front.</p>
<p>If I invite people to my home to listen to the gospel, people might be disappointed without something impressive. A large meeting with a great facade has the power to move people. The first time I went to America, I stayed in San Francisco. Some brothers took me to a gospel campaign by Billy Graham. It was my first time to attend such a campaign, and the environment was inspiring. There were thousands of people in attendance. The environment was so compelling that everyone was moved to tears when the piano began playing the hymn. Nevertheless, the church cannot depend on a great facade.</p>
<p>The second advantage of one person speaking and the rest listening is that the believers receive some nourishment. A new believer does not know the truth concerning God, Christ, incarnation, redemption, crucifixion, or resurrection. He needs to listen to messages concerning these matters in order for him to be nourished and edified. We cannot deny that the meetings with one person speaking and the rest listening can meet such a need.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Disadvantages</h2>
<p>The disadvantages to one person speaking and the rest listening outweigh the advantages. I admire Billy Graham. His presentation and application of the gospel are appropriate, and his utterance is excellent. However, he has noticed that depending on evangelistic campaigns is not effective. He found out that many people are moved by the gospel, but when they are sent to different denominations, they eventually &ldquo;enter into a refrigerator&rdquo; and become &ldquo;frozen.&rdquo; Therefore, he proposed that the believers should have small prayer meetings and small Bible-study meetings in their homes. These small meetings were very popular in Southern California. However, they did not have a way to continue, because there was no content; the spirit of prayer was weak, and the living Bible was dead.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Annulling the Spiritual Functions<br />
of the Believers</h2>
<p>The first disadvantage to one person speaking and the rest listening is that it annuls the spiritual function, the organic function, of the believers. It is not easy to understand spiritual things; therefore, the Bible often uses physical things as an illustration. The Bible says that after we are saved, we need to grow until we are full-grown (Eph. 4:13). This verse uses the growth of our physical body as an illustration of a spiritual matter. There is a saying: &ldquo;A sparrow may be small, but it has all the vital organs.&rdquo; A child may be very small at birth, but he is still complete. He has the sense of hearing, the sense of sight, and the sense of smell. He also has the ability to eat, to speak, and to walk. However, a newborn child does not know anything and cannot function; he cannot see distinctly nor hear clearly. He needs to grow for the development of his organic functions.</p>
<p>Every mother longs for her child to say Mama because she does not want her child to be dumb. When a child begins to grow, his mother teaches him to say Mama. If after nine months the child cannot say Mama, his mother begins to worry that the child may be dumb. The longer it takes for a child to speak, the greater a trial it is to the mother. When the child finally opens his mouth and says Mama, his mother is very happy. Before the child had sufficient growth, he could not speak, because his ability to speak was not adequately developed. If a person covers his eyes for five years, he will become blind. If a person lies in bed for five years, he will lose his ability to walk. Children need their eyes and legs to develop properly. When I contracted tuberculosis, I was confined to complete bed rest for a full year. A year later when I got up, I was not able to stand, let alone walk. My legs were so withered that I needed an extended period of time to learn to stand and more time to learn to walk again. I was over forty years of age, but I had lost the function of my legs in only one year. This shows the importance of the development of our organic functions.</p>
<p>If in all the meetings of the church only one person speaks and the rest listen, after five years no one will be able to speak; they will become dumb. This is our situation. When I returned to Taipei in 1984, I noticed that many of those in the meeting had listened to my speaking for over thirty years. Some of them had been listening to me before they were married. I saw them get married and raise their children. Some of their sons are serving as elders in the churches. If these saints were asked to speak, they would say that they are unable to speak. For thirty years these saints were &ldquo;ruined,&rdquo; for they were not told to &ldquo;walk,&rdquo; or to speak. Therefore, they are not able to function. This is our situation.</p>
<p>The saints who have been saved for more than twenty years would say that it is Brother Lee&rsquo;s responsibility to explain the truth of sanctification and other such fundamental truths. If they have been listening to messages for twenty years but cannot give a message on sanctification, why should we still care for such a system? Our practice has annulled the organic functions of the believers.</p>
