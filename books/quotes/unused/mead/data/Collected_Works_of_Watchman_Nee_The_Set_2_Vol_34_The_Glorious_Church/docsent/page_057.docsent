   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"In the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man" indicates that the Lord's presence is with His church Rev 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>His presence is precious.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yet His presence is not altogether for blessing, but for searching as well.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we are faithful and have Him in our midst, we need not fear.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But if we are not faithful and He searches in our midst, how can we escape judgment?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This One who is "like the Son of Man" is our Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Daniel also mentioned seeing one "like a Son of Man" Dan 7:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Gospels, our Lord often called Himself the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why does it say that He is "like the Son of Man"?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This speaks of His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although He is the Son of Man, He is also the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When He was on earth, He was the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now He has risen from the dead, and He is no longer just the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, He is "like the Son of Man."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God created man with the purpose that man would rule over the earth Gen 1:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Unfortunately, the first man failed and did not reach this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the Son of God came to earth and became a man to fulfill God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God put on a human body and became the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was the beginning of the Lord as the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, the Son of Man is the title given to God when He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During the thirty or more years that the Lord spent on earth, He was the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before He was born, He was "like a Son of Man"; this was the One Daniel spoke of.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the Lord resurrected from the dead, He still had flesh and bones Luke 24:39 ; however, now He is no longer merely the Son of Man, but the Lord who is "like the Son of Man."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This Christ who is like the Son of Man is in the midst of the lampstands, and He is the Lord who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands Rev 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This shows that the Lord is face to face with the churches; He is examining our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is not sitting down and enjoying the church's worship; He is judging the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should fear the Lord, because "it is time for the judgment to begin from the house of God" 1 Pet 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Revelation 1:13 says that He is "clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The priests wore long garments.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus is also wearing a long garment, signifying that He is the Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The lamp in the Holy Place was not allowed to go out; its light had to shine day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, there was the constant need for the priests to trim the lamp and replenish the oil in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus as the Priest is walking in the midst of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He sees the lamps that are shining and the lamps that are not shining.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those that are not shining are trimmed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Trimming means judging.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is walking in the midst of the churches executing His judgment, and this judgment has eternity in view.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the past, we knew of Him as the Lord of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now we see Him as the Lord of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, the present judgment is the judgment of the priest; it is a kind of trimming.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On that day, it will be the judgment of the king; He will give rewards and mete out punishments.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One day every child of God will meet the fearsome holiness of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At that point, reasons will not suffice.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When light comes, it removes all reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Light not only shines; it also kills.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Light exposes the true nature of everything; it removes everything that is not compatible with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every time God shines, the light kills man's natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Man can reason, but under the Lord's shining, the reasons disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The further a man is from the Lord, the more He tries to justify himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, no one can withstand the Lord's light.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church should fear the Lord and accept His trimming so that its light will not go out to the extent that its lampstand is removed and its testimony is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is "girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the Old Testament there were many priests because death prevented them from continuing Heb 7:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Their girdles were only embroidered with gold Exo 28:4-5 , and they were not eternal in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our Lord abides forever, and His priesthood is unalterable Heb 7:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The golden girdle at His breasts is made of pure gold; it constantly shines and abides forever.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Usually, girdles are girded around the waist to facilitate one's work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But the Lord is girded about at the breasts.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This speaks of His love and power.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The "girdle" speaks of the power of movement, while the "breasts" speak of love.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The High Priest who is walking in the midst of the lampstands is full of power and love.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We can only prostrate ourselves before Him in fear and trembling as well as with gratitude and thanksgiving.</S>
