   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Here I must mention a story.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Last year in Shanghai a Western missionary working for a mission came to me and told me of a person sent by the mission board to work at a school.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The man had been in Shanghai for six years already, and no teacher or student in the school could get along with him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He had a terrible temper.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No one in the school could do anything about him; neither could the mission board do anything about him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It intended to send him back to America by the first of November.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the Western missionary came to me for help, he said, "This man is very peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He never laughs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every time he sees others, he gives them a terrible face.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He has a hot temper throughout the day, and everyone is afraid of him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When he shows up, others run away.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He has been this way for six years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No one can get along with him in the school, and all four hundred students in the school are afraid of him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No matter where he goes, he gets into arguments with others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am afraid that he is possessed by some kind of demon.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Mr. Nee, you are familiar with the teaching on overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What can you do to help him?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I heard this, I rejoiced in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here was another hopeless case.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once man becomes hopeless, God has His way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God heals terminal patients.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I promised the missionary that I would go and visit the man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After two days, I was in another person's home.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That particular man also came.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After introductions, everyone left.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I looked at the man, I almost fainted.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I had never seen another man like him in my entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His eyes, nose, mouth, and every feature on his face seemed to be designed specifically to express anger.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I could not have agreed more with the one who spoke with me two days ago.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I saw the man, I froze.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Perhaps he was indeed possessed by demons!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But when he saw me, he began to cry.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Tears rolled down his cheeks, and he said to me, "They do not want me anymore."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was hard to tell if he was sad or angry.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But his face became even uglier.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I asked him, "How do you feel about yourself?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He said, "I have often bought gifts for others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I preach the gospel to others, and I pray for others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When others are sick, I pray for them, and they become well.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But I admit that I have somewhat of a bad temper."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I said, "Only somewhat bad?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He said, "Frankly speaking, it is terribly bad!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I have a temper like a beast."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I then asked him, "Were you like this from the time you were a child, or did you become this way later?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He said, "If I remember right, I have had a bad temper since I was four years old.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When I was thirteen years old, my mother died, and my temper grew worse.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today I cannot do anything about my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Not only am I not glorifying the Lord, I am actually sinning all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I feel that I am the most pitiful man in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No one will nod at me or speak to me."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>While he was speaking, he was crying.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I began to laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He said, "Do not laugh at my bad temper," and I said, "I am not laughing at your bad temper.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I am laughing for joy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am happy that you cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When you cannot make it, God will have a way."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I then said, "A person like you should not have any problem at all.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is not hard for you to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You can overcome in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The question is not whether you are good or able.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The question is whether or not God is able.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Victory has nothing to do with yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Victory depends on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is Christ in you who overcomes for you.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Victory does not come by trusting in yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Victory fully depends on Christ and on Him overcoming for you within you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Victory can only be found in Christ, not in you."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He said, "What should I do to stop my temper?"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I said, "You do not have to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Just let Christ do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Let Him live for you within you.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Your eyes should not be set on yourself, but only on God's Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He alone can give you the victory."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We talked for four hours, but the light still could not penetrate his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Later we prayed together, and he prayed, "God, I am too evil.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I have lost hope in myself; I can do nothing about myself.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>From now on, I do not trust in myself.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I cannot overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God, if You do not overcome for me, I will never make it by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>From now on, I will not be responsible for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You must take responsibility for me!"</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After he prayed in such an honest way, he asked, "What should I do after I go home?"</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I said, "You should do nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He began to smile.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He took a few steps and then turned back and said, "Is there really nothing that I need to do?"</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I said, "Indeed, you do not need to move at all.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If Satan comes to tempt you to exercise your patience, you should say, I cannot be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I will let Christ be my patience!'"</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He said, "That is right.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>That is right."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He began to speak to himself, "I do not need to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If I am ever saved from my temper, it is God's work and not my work."</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>After a few days, I asked others about his condition.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>One man answered, "It is amazing.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Truly amazing!</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The whole school has never been so quiet as it has been in the last few days.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We have never seen him so quiet during the past six years as he has been in the past few days.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>There has been no noise at all.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>God has demonstrated His miracle and power in this man."</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Brothers and sisters, if that man could overcome, anyone can overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>After a few days, he came to our meeting and began to smile.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Later his colleagues and students testified that he had changed.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Even the mission board that intended to send him home decided not to send him back because of his change.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Do not think that praying and reading the Word alone will give us the power to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>I am not saying that we should not pray or read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>There is a place for prayer and a place for reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>But prayer and the reading of the Word alone cannot enable a person to overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Matthew 5 through 7 says that we are the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>It does not say that we have to be sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If it were up to us to be sons of God, we could never make it.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Matthew 5:16 says, "So that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If a man has good works, the glory goes to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>This proves that the good works are done by God through man.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>This is why the glory goes to God and not to man.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If Brother Chi delivers a good message, no one should praise Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If we have good works, why should others give glory to God?</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>The only reason they give glory to God is that these good works are from God; they are done by God.</S>
