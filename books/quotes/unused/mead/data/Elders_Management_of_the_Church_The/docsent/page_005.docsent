   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. God Desires Those Who Are Part of This Body</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Become Churches in the Different Localities</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In God's plan, He desires to have a Body for His Son in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Yet in a practical way, God desires those who are part of this Body to become churches in the different localities.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God desires that each one of these churches be a miniature and a representation, in the different localities, of the mystical Body of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This kind of understanding is very much lacking among Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even some who are very much for the pursuit of spirituality neglect this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the first point, we talked about the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the second point, we are talking about the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>An elder must have this twofold knowledge concerning God's plan for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He must know the universal Church, and he must also know the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, he must know the Church in its universal aspect, and he must know the church in its local aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Never consider the universal Church to be one kind of church, and the local church to be another kind of church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is only one Church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Collectively speaking, it is the universal church, and locally speaking, it is the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Strictly speaking, the local churches are the universal Church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The universal Church is simply the sum total of the local churches, and the local churches are simply the local manifestations of the universal Church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without the local churches, there cannot be the universal Church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the elders are managing the local churches, they are managing the universal Church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's plan is to have a Church in the universe as the Body of His Son for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, to carry out this plan, He has to set up local churches in the different localities.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If He does not set up churches in the different localities, God's universal plan for the church will be only an empty ideal with no way to be carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to carry out this plan, God has to set up churches in the different localities.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you grasp hold of these two points, you will be clear when you read the New Testament again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is a great vision in the New Testament that tells how the Church as the Body of Christ is the expression of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This concerns God's plan in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the other hand, the New Testament shows us that the Church appears in the localities.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is in the different localities that God's plan is realized.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every elder should have a clear knowledge concerning all these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the elders' knowledge concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Of course, there are a number of matters connected with this subject, such as the question of denominations, the question of the ground, and the nature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We will not go into these other things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here we only emphasize the Church as the Body of Christ in God's plan for the expression of Christ and the church practiced on earth in the different localities.</S>
