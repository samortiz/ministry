   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE NATURE OF THE TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the end of this section, we need to consider the nature of the testimony of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the nature of the testimony of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to biblical revelation, the nature of the testimony of the church consists of at least six important items.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I. BEING OF REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, the nature of the testimony of the church is of revelation; it is not natural nor idealistic nor of human thought.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is clearly declared by the Lord in Matthew 16:17, where He used the word revealed .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The testimony of the church is altogether related to revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After a person is saved and begins to love and be zealous for the Lord, he does not have much revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead, he thinks that he only needs to improve himself a little, to be a little more zealous and a little more spiritual, and to preach the gospel and work for the Lord a little more.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All of these thoughts are natural.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One day, however, the Spirit of God will open his eyes and give him a revelation, showing him that God does not want his zeal nor his labor nor his spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, he will see that God wants to do a building work in him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God wants to build him; God wants to obtain the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God wants to have a testimony of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God wants the believers to be broken, dealt with, and built up so that they become coordinated as one Body to be one church, one testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a matter of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>BEING OF RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second, according to Ephesians 2:6, the nature of the testimony of the church is also of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everything natural must be put off; everything must enter into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This requires us to be tested and to pass through death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many tests eventually lead to death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, a brother who really loves the Lord and is very talented, full of zeal and of vigor, may desire to serve the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But his natural talent, zeal, and vigor cannot be brought into the testimony of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sooner or later this brother must pass through a test and through death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His talent, zeal, and power all need to be tested by being put into death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then whatever comes out of death will be in resurrection, and only what is in resurrection can be built and be in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In our natural being we cannot be in coordination with others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only what is in resurrection can be coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Consequently, only that which is of resurrection is the Body, only that which is of resurrection is the church, and only that which is of resurrection is the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>BEING OF THE NEW CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Third, Ephesians 2:15 shows us that the nature of the testimony of the church is of the new creation, not of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This also requires stripping and breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our natural being is of the old creation, and only that which is in resurrection is of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All that is of the old creation belongs to Adam; only that which is of the new creation belongs to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, that which is of the old creation is Adam, and that which is of the new creation is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church does not belong to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not in Adam, and it is not Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, the church belongs to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is in Christ, and it is even Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, in the testimony of the church there is nothing of the old creation of Adam; there are only the things of the new creation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the testimony of the church, the things of the old creation must pass through the process of death and resurrection so that all the things of Adam can become the things of Christ, because only that which is of resurrection and of Christ is the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>BEING SPIRITUAL</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Fourth, the nature of the testimony of the church is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is seen in Ephesians 2:18.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church is constituted with the Holy Spirit in the spirit of the believers; thus, there is no element of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, the testimony of the church is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No element of the flesh can be mixed with it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once there is an element of the flesh, the testimony of the church is damaged and will be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The testimony of the church must be absolutely spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever we live in the spirit, we have the testimony of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whenever we live according to the flesh, we lose the testimony of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>V. BEING HEAVENLY</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Fifth, Ephesians 2:6 shows that the nature of the testimony of the church is heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the proper position.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Although the church is on the earth, it is something heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The nature of the church is heavenly because her source is not on earth but in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The church does not come out of the earth but out of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Her foundation is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whenever the church becomes earthly and has an earthly condition, the nature of the church is changed, and the testimony of the church is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is because the church is altogether heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>BEING ETERNAL</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Sixth, the nature of the testimony of the church is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Ephesians 3:11 says that God s purpose for the church is an eternal purpose, a purpose made in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, we know that the church is something eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Anything temporary is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Anything that is here one day and gone the next day is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Anything that can be removed, altered, wiped out, or voided is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Since the nature of the church is eternal, whatever is of the church cannot be altered, removed, or wiped out; it remains forever.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Only what is eternal can be the church, and only what is eternal can be the testimony of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, like the church itself, the testimony of the church is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>These six items show the nature of the church, and they are also the nature of the testimony of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>These six items are a severe test to the church and to the testimony of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Whatever fails to pass the test of these six items is not the church nor the testimony of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Anything that can be counted as the church and as the testimony of the church must be of revelation, of resurrection, of the new creation and spiritual, heavenly, and eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>These six items are linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Whatever is of revelation is surely of resurrection; whatever is of resurrection is of the new creation; whatever is of the new creation is spiritual; whatever is spiritual is heavenly; and whatever is heavenly is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>All these items require that we receive the breaking of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Our natural man and our flesh must be dealt with; our whole being must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When the cross has done its sufficient work, spiritual revelation will come, the things of resurrection will come forth, the things of the new creation will be manifested, and there will be a spiritual, heavenly, and eternal element.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is the church; this is also the testimony of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Therefore, this is the nature of the testimony of the church.</S>
