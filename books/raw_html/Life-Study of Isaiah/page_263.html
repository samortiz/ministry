<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Having No Attracting Form nor Majesty<br>that Men Should Look upon Him</H2><P>Second, the Lord Jesus had no attracting form nor majesty that men should look upon Him, nor beautiful appearance that men should desire Him (53:2b). If Jesus had been very handsome and attractive, very majestic and powerful, everyone would have been attracted to Him. But Jesus had neither an attracting form nor majesty, nor did He have a beautiful appearance. Instead of majesty, He had poverty, and instead of a beautiful appearance, He had a visage and form that were disfigured (52:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Being Despised and Forsaken of Men,<br>like One from Whom Men Hide Their Faces<br>and Whom Men Do Not Esteem</H2><P>Third, Christ was despised and forsaken of men, like one from whom men hide their faces and whom men do not esteem (53:3). Often when the Jews saw Him, they hid their faces. When He was hanging on the cross, many hid their faces from Him. Furthermore, they did not regard or respect Him. This was Christ's human living.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Living as a Man of Sorrows<br>and Acquainted with Grief</H2><P>Fourth, Christ lived as a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief (53:3a). As a man in His human living, Christ did not have riches; rather, He had sorrows. Moreover, He was acquainted with grief. He knew nothing but sorrow and grief. This was not for redemption; rather, this was part of Christ's qualifications for accomplishing redemption.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Fully Qualified to Be the Savior to Save<br>Fallen Men from Satan, Sin, Death, and Self</H2><P>Christ's being such a man and living such a lowly and sorrowful human life fully qualified Him to be the Savior to save fallen men from four things: Satan, sin, death, and self (Heb. 2:14-18; Matt. 1:21). All the foregoing items have nothing to do directly with redemption or salvation. These are only the qualifications that qualified Christ to be our Redeemer and our Savior.</P>
