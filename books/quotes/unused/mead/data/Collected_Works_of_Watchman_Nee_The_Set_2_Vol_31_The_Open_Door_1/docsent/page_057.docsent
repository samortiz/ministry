   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Co-workers' Meeting in Lan-Si</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Peace to my brother in the Lord, Mr. Nee:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I received both the money which you wired to me through the Bank of China on the twenty-fourth and your letter of the twenty-fifth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I passed on X dollars to Brother Chen Meng-jao and distributed the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thank the Lord, and thank you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We still meet and work as usual.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The children of God are all at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the brothers and sisters who fled to Lan-Si have moved into the countryside.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am still in the city for the meetings and for attending to practical matters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We had a meeting from January 31 to February 4.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ten people attended elders and co-workers to consider the kind of work and way God would have us take.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Praise God, He has already given us new light, new work, and a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From now on, the assembly and the workers, the work and the church, will be separate but will cooperate.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the past the assemblies rallied around the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In other words, the workers became the leaders in the church, and the church and the work were mixed up.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we know that this is not the pattern left by the early apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, we hope to have a conference with the entire congregation to explain these matters to them more fully.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are eight local churches in this area Lan-Si , one city, two northern townships, and five southern townships.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although there are responsible brothers in each locality who take care of the practical matters in the house of God, very few of the gifts spoken of in Ephesians 4:11 visit to edify the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>May the Lord raise up some for His name's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Please pray for us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have lived in Lan-Si for twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Throughout these years I have been working for the Lord on the one hand, and practicing medicine on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, in the past two or three years, I have gone out to work more and more, and my medical practice has dwindled.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have a feeling in my heart to serve God full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have prayed about this for almost two years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Recently, the environment seems to indicate that God is moving in this direction.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have been more desperate during the past two months as I waited.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do you have any opinion that you can give me?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I know you are busy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am asking because I want to walk according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I hope to speak to you about the rest face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>May the Lord give you more of His word and commission that you may help and serve us and, by doing so, help and serve the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>May power, honor, and glory be to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ma Chuan-foo</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Address omitted</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Women's Work</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>in the Refugee Camps in Shanghai One</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I go to the refugee camps every morning and return at noon.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every week I speak three times in the first camp to about two hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am also responsible for the preaching every day in the second camp.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Mrs. Lee and Mrs. Lu also go along to help.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sometimes there are more than four hundred people listening, sometimes a little less.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although we have come short in the Lord's work because of our foolishness and unfaithfulness, the Lord still works beyond what we can do.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He manifests His glory through the sisters' prayer behind us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One sister bears the responsibility of prayer in the background.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thank the Lord for raising up a supplicating one.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He really heard her prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although she never leaves her house, her work is more precious than that of many who run around.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Praise the Lord!</S>

   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We cannot say that God did not bless the work, but we fear that we were not faithful enough.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thank God, we saw His hand in the beginning and end of this work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>May we fully trust in Jehovah day by day, and may we rely on His grace rather than on our own wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We thank and praise God all the more for His glory, His faithfulness, and His acts!</S>
