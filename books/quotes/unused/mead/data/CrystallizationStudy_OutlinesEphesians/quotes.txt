[1]  2 We need to present ourselves to God to be saturated by God with the element of His holy nature Rom 6:19 unto the eternal life v. 22 to be renewed by the Spirit for our transformation into the image of Christ Titus 3:5b; Rom 12:2b; 2 Cor 3:18 . We were predestinated by God the Father unto sonship Eph 1:5: This is to have God the Father s life John 3:16 , being made God s children, the same as God in life by being born of God after God s kind through regeneration 1:12-13; 1 Pet 1:3 . This is for our being sonized with God the Father s life in our entire tripartite being 1 John 5:11-12; Rom 8:10, 6, 11; 1 John 3:2.
[2]  Message Two The Economy of the Fullness of the Times
[3]  Rev 21:1-2, 23-25; 22:1-2a God s eternal intention is to head up all things in Christ, who has been appointed to be the universal Head Eph 1:10, 22: It is God s eternal purpose that in the economy of the fullness of the times, He might head up all things in Christ v. 10.
[4]  His Eternal Economy Scripture Reading: Eph 3:3-5, 8-11; 1 Cor 1:30 God s eternal purpose is His eternal economy, His administrative plan, to distribute Himself into His chosen people to make them the same as He is in life and nature but not in the Godhead for His enlarged and expanded expression Eph 3:2, 8-11: The forty-two chapters of the book of Job leave us with a twofold question concerning the purpose of God in creating man and the purpose of God in dealing with His chosen people 1:1; 10:13; 13:3-4: The great answer to this great question is the eternal economy of God, which is God s eternal intention with His heart s desire to dispense Himself in His Divine Trinity as the Father in the Son by the Spirit into His chosen people to be their life and nature that they may become the same as He is for His fullness, His expression Eph 3:9; Gen 1:26; 1 Tim 1:3-4; Eph 1:22-23; 3:19.
[5]  God s intention in His creation of all things, including man, was that man would be mingled with God to produce the church as the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem for His glorious expression Zech 12:1; Rev 4:11; 19:7; 21:2: The church as the mystery of Christ was hidden in God, who created all things, throughout the ages Eph 3:4, 9; Col 2:2; 1:27; 1 Tim 3:16.
[6]  By the dispensing of Christ, as wisdom to us from God, into our entire tripartite being, we become constituted with Him to be the church as the wise exhibition of all that Christ is 1 Cor 1:24, 30; Eph 3:10: Christ became wisdom to us from God as three vital things in our salvation: Christ is our righteousness for our past , by which we have been justified by God, that we might be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life Rom 5:18; 8:10.
[7]  Message Six Christ Making His Home in Our Hearts Scripture Reading: Eph 3:14-21 God s eternal purpose is to work Himself into us as our life and our everything so that we may take Him as our person, live Him, and express Him; this is the desire of God s heart and the focal point of the Bible Eph 1:9; 3:11; Phil 1:20-21a: God s economy according to His heart s desire is to build Himself into man and to build man into Himself 2 Sam 7:12-14a; Eph 3:17a.
[8]  the Genuine Oneness of the Body of Christ Scripture Reading: Eph 4:1-6 Ephesians 4:4-6 reveals the intrinsic constitution of the Body of Christ: The intrinsic constitution of the Body of Christ is the union, mingling, and incorporation of the processed and consummated Triune God with a group of tripartite men whom He has redeemed judicially and saved organically vv.
[9]  of the Organic Body of Christ Scripture Reading: Eph 4:7-16 The intrinsic building up of the organic Body of Christ is by the giving, the dispensing, of the divine grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ Eph 4:7: Every member of the Body of Christ is an indispensable gift to the Body 1 Cor 12:14-22; Rom 12:4-5.
[10]  Message Ten The Great Mystery of Christ and the Church Scripture Reading: Gen 2:18-25; Eph 5:23-32 Christ and the church are a great mystery Eph 5:32; cf.
[11]  1 Tim 3:15-16a: God is a mystery, and Christ, as the embodiment of God to express Him, is the mystery of God Col 2:2.
[12]  Message Eleven The Corporate Warrior Scripture Reading: Eph 6:10-20 Ephesians 6:10-20 reveals that the church as the new man is a corporate warrior fighting against the enemy of God for God s kingdom: The church as the one new man is the corporate man in God s intention, and this new man will fulfill the twofold purpose of expressing God and dealing with God s enemy Gen 1:26.
[13]  Message Twelve The Divine Trinity and the Divine Dispensing Scripture Reading: Eph 1:3-14; 2:18; 3:16-19;
[14]  4:4-6; 5:19-20; 6:10-11, 17 The revelation concerning the Triune God in the holy Word is not for doctrinal understanding but for the dispensing of God in His Divine Trinity into His chosen and redeemed people for their experience and enjoyment 2 Cor 13:14: It is impossible for us to know the Triune God merely by doctrine; however, we can know Him by experiencing and enjoying Him 1 Pet 1:2; Rev 1:4-5.
[15]  The revelation in Ephesians concerning the producing, existing, growing, building up, and fighting of the church as the Body of Christ is composed of the divine economy, the dispensing of the Triune God into the members of the Body of Christ; thus, the crucial focus of Ephesians is the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity into the believers: Chapter one unveils how God the Father chose and predestinated the members in eternity, God the Son redeemed them, and God the Spirit sealed them as a pledge, thus imparting Himself into His believers for the formation of the church, which is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all vv.
