   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Second, we have to hear and understand what others are not saying.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to discern before the Lord what others have refrained from saying.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have to know what a person has not said, that is, the things he should tell us but which have been kept back.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Naturally, it is more difficult to get a clear perception of unspoken words than of spoken ones.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After the first kind of words are spoken, we still have to listen to the second kind, the kind that are not spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When people come to talk with a worker about their affairs, it is not unusual for them to tell half of a story and to refrain from divulging the other half.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This tests the worker's competence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>An incompetent worker will not be able to discern what is not spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He may even project thoughts which were never in the heart of the speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This problem arises in his own mind, not in the mind of the speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some preexisting concepts may be in his mind, and he may project these concepts into others, even though they have never spoken of such a thing, either from their heart or from their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to exercise clear discernment before the Lord to know what a person has said and not said.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Often a man utters things that are off the subject while omitting things that are crucial to the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How is it possible to know whether crucial words are being left out?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We will only know if we have passed through sufficient dealings with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When a brother comes and says something to us, we must not only be clear about what he is saying, but also about what he is not saying.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must know what is roughly being referred to when he keeps something back in his words.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then we will have confidence before God, and we will know how to help, exhort, or rebuke the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we are not sure of anything within ourselves and cannot hear what others are saying, always waiting instead for a chance to speak, we will only be burdened to say what we have to say.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We will not know what others are talking about and have no way to render proper help to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is a fact that poor listeners are often less useful workers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a serious problem among many people; they simply cannot listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They cannot discern what others have kept within themselves because they are too insensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is impossible to expect such ones to "give...food at the proper time" Matt 24:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Third, we must be able to detect what others are saying in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Beyond hearing the words a person may utter and the words he may deliberately refrain from uttering, we have to hear what we have referred to as the words that his spirit is speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a person opens his mouth and speaks, his spirit also speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The fact that he is willing to talk gives us an opportunity to touch his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If his lips are sealed, his spirit is bound, and it is difficult to know what his spirit is speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But his spirit will find some measure of release in the opening of his mouth, however much he may try to contain himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our ability to discern what his spirit is saying depends on the measure of our exercise in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are exercised, we will be able to discern the words he has uttered, the words he has refrained from uttering, and even the words in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As he speaks, we will know which words are from his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We will be able to discern the intellectual difficulty as well as the spiritual difficulty he is facing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We also will have the assurance to offer a specific remedy for his case.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we are not that exercised, we may listen to a brother's problems for half an hour without realizing his real ailment and the remedy for it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is indeed a desperate need of those who are engaged in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is unfortunate that very few Christians are good listeners.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some can spend a full hour talking to a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, at the end the believer may still be quite hazy about what has been said.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our hearing ability is too poor.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we cannot hear what people are saying, how can we hear what God is saying?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When a man sits in front of us, his words should be clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if we cannot understand what is being said, I seriously question our ability to understand God's speaking within us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we cannot understand the audible words from man, how can we understand the words that God speaks to us in our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we are unable to diagnose the ailment, condition, or problem of a brother who is in trouble, what word can we give to him?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Brothers and sisters, let us not consider this as a trifling matter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do not deal with this matter and learn to listen, we will be unable to help a brother in need even if we become great Bible readers, great Bible teachers, or powerful workers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must not only be preachers who talk; we also should be those who can solve others' problems.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But how can this ever happen if we cannot hear what others are saying?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to realize the seriousness of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Brothers and sisters, how much time have you spent learning to listen to others?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Have you spent enough time to learn this lesson?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have to spend time to learn to listen to others, to hear what they have said, what they have not said, and what is in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The words out of a man's mouth may not match his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many people say something with their mouth, but their spirit testifies to something else.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Eventually, the mouth cannot cover up the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Sooner or later the spirit will be revealed, and when it is revealed, you will know a person's real condition.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Without such discernment, it will be difficult to render proper help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A joke is told of an elderly doctor whose entire stock of medicine consisted of two things: castor oil and quinine.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>No matter what his patients complained of, he invariably prescribed one medicine or the other.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He applied these two medicines to every kind of ailment.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many brothers treat their "patients" the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They only have one or two pet prescriptions, and however varied the ailment of those who seek them out, they talk according to these one or two special lines.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Such workers cannot be of any real help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Everyone who bears God's trust and commission possesses one common ability he knows what others are saying as soon as they open their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Without such an ability, a person cannot deal with others' illnesses.</S>
