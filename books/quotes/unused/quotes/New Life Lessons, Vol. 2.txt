One of the most important and practical things in the life of a Christian is to live in fellowship with the Lord
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
In this way the broken fellowship will be recovered, and we will have a conscience without offense to enjoy Him without interruption
While you are fellowshipping with the Lord, do not try to recall all the things that you should pray for while neglecting to contact God
After you have confessed your sins thoroughly, often you will want to express praise and thanksgiving to the Lord
Whether at home in the meeting hall at school in the office on the road in the car or in any place we can have fellowship with the Lord
If we have good fellowship with the Lord, there will not be a single time in which there is no dealing on the negative side
The more we enter into fellowship with the Lord the more we enjoy Him as our portion from God and the more we are filled and occupied by Him
The divine light increases the need for the blood of Jesus, which causes us to receive more of the divine life
After a person is saved, if he desires to grow in life and to allow God to do a thorough work on him, he must consecrate himself to God
The love which Christ exhibited in His substitutionary death is our motivating power; it constrains us to live to Him
In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the church the multifarious wisdom of God'
The priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord'
After a saved person has consecrated himself, he should learn to live in the spirit and walk according to the spirit
May your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ'
In order to accomplish this divine economy, Christ passed through four major steps: incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection
The holy ointment in Exodus 30:23-25, as a compound of pure olive oil and four kinds of spices, is a full type of the compound Spirit of God
It was after His resurrection that the compound Spirit was completed and entered into the believers to become one spirit with them
As such a Spirit, He comes with all His riches into our regenerated spirit to join Himself to us to be our life and everything
It is only when we speak, walk, and behave according to the Spirit that we can live out all these virtues of Christ
Since living in the spirit is so crucial to our Christian experience, how then should we practice this in our daily life?
That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit'
Christ resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit to enter into the believers' spirit to become their life and to transform them
As the ascended and glorified Lord Christ is objective but as the indwelling Spirit within us He is subjective experiential and enjoyable
The immoral: An immoral woman, at the moment when she was most thirsty, met the Savior, and experienced life's satisfying
The dying: By the word of life the Lord healed the dying son of a royal official; thus he received life's healing
Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink
Those under the bondage of sin: The Lord as the light of the world rescued a woman in sin; thus she received life's setting free
The above nine cases not only represent the conditions of various kinds of people; they describe the need of every man
In the previous lesson we saw that after Christ passed through the process of glorification, He became the compound, life-giving Spirit
With all His rich and bountiful elements He is like an all-inclusive drink which is sufficient to meet all our needs
If we drink of the Spirit by calling on His name and pray-reading His Word often, we will receive a continual supply to experience Christ
If we daily pray His word and sing His word, and let His word dwell in us richly, we will be nourished and strengthened to experience Christ
If we continually experience Christ and receive Him as our life and everything, we will become the expression of Christ
To live Christ means that we take Him as life in any kind of circumstance so that our living is just Christ lived out
When these two words are put together, they mean a congregation of called out ones, or a gathering of the called ones
From the meaning of the word itself, the church is a group of people called out of the world by God to gather together
Having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will'
In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the church the multifarious wisdom of God'
From this we can see that our God is one, the nature of the church is one, and her expression on earth is also one
The epistles to the seven cities were to the seven churches, which shows that there was only one church in one city
Then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his father'
