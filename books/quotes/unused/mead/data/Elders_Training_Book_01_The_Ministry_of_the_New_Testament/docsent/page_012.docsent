   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the Gospel of Luke</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>While this slave was serving to take care of God s household in this way, according to the Gospel of Luke, He was a genuine, perfect, and entire Man to seek and to save the lost sinners in the way of the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is very strange that certain cases are recorded only in Luke and not in the other Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Luke 7 there is the case of the son of the widow in Nain who was dead and being carried in a coffin on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus came in to raise him up.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Following this, there is the case of a sinful woman weeping and washing the feet of the Lord Jesus Luke 7:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In chapter ten there is the good Samaritan, and in chapter nineteen, Zaccheus, a chief tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All of these cases are found only in Luke, not in the other Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you consider these cases, you could realize that Jesus is presented here as a perfect Man who was carrying out His saving work in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, the word morality is not adequate to describe His standard.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The standard was something more excellent than morality, but we are short of words to describe it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nevertheless, if you take this concept and go back to read the story of the good Samaritan, you could see something there that is not merely His saving, but His saving in a way that is indescribable.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was against a very black background that the good Samaritan came to the wounded one in Luke 10.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Jews themselves called the Lord Jesus a Samaritan in John chapter eight v. 48 . Luke describes how a priest came to the place where the wounded one was, and he passed by on the opposite side of the road without doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Likewise, a Levite passed by and did not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then this good Samaritan, the despised One, came in a way that is beyond human words to describe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was not asked or begged to do something to rescue the fallen one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He did everything out of Himself on His own initiative.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here is a story which shows us in what kind of standard and way, Jesus, the perfect Man, carried out His saving.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This case does not emphasize His power.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To call Lazarus out of the tomb shows His mighty divine power.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, this case shows us something of the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Gospel of Matthew</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then in Matthew this One lived a life that is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While He came as a Slave to serve God s household and as a Man to save the lost sinners in the highest standard of something that is beyond our utterance, this One lived a kingly life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many Christian teachers talk about the kingdom in Matthew, but they have failed to see that the kingdom was portrayed by a kingly life which we do not have words to describe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This life portrays the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you want to know what the kingdom of the heavens is, you need to look at this life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Matthew this life is the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Gospel of John</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, this matchless One who came as such a Slave, taking care of God s household, as such a perfect Man saving in that high standard, and as such a One who lived a life which was the kingdom of the heavens, also expressed God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God lived through Him, God was expressed through Him, He lived by God, and He lived as God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Gospel of John we see such a life as God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What indescribable life is this?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must confess that we are utterly short of a proper vocabulary to describe such a fourfold life in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This life was the ministry of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You need to look at this ministry and also look at His person.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Consider what kind of person He was and consider His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>AN ALL-INCLUSIVE DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After He had completed such a life as the very New Testament ministry, the Lord Jesus went to the cross to die a death as the last Adam 1 Cor 15:45 to terminate the old man with the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The death He died was also a death as the Lamb of God John 1:29 to take away sin and its result sins.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In addition, He died a death as the brass serpent John 3:14 to destroy Satan and his kingdom, the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Moreover, we need to realize also that the Lord Jesus died to abolish the ordinances Eph 2:14-15 which include human culture, habits, and customs which divided the very mankind created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The death that He died to abolish all of these things may be designated the death of the Peacemaker.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In addition, as a grain of wheat John 12:24 , He died a death which released the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Bible tells us that He died at least a fivefold death, a death as the last Adam, as the Lamb of God, as the brass serpent, as the Peacemaker, and as a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When He was dying there on the cross, in the eyes of God He was at least a fivefold person, a person in at least five aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord Jesus as such a person terminated everything through such a death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That termination means that He accomplished the real baptism, as He said, I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Luke 12:50 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He had already been baptized, but He still had to go through a real baptism, a baptism that was the death on the cross, signified by the death water used by John the Baptist.</S>
