<P>The Son is our life supply as manna, even the hidden manna (John 6:32-33, 48-51, 57b; 1 Cor. 10:3). In John 6 the Lord compared Himself to the heavenly manna that was given to the children of Israel in ancient times. In the seven epistles in Revelation written by the Lord Jesus to His seven churches, Jesus is revealed as the hidden manna (2:17). He is the real manna for our life supply.</P><P>The Son is also our life supply as the tree of life with its fruit (Rev. 2:7; 22:2). The tree of life is seen in both Genesis and Revelation. In Revelation 2:7 the tree of life is promised as a reward to the overcomers. In Revelation 22:2, 14, and 19, it is a complete fulfillment of God's intention in Genesis. In eternity future, we will be in the New Jerusalem enjoying Christ as our life supply, as the fruit of the tree of life.</P><P>Eating results in the mingling of divinity with humanity. In the early church, there was a heretical teaching concerning the mingling which said that the mingling of divinity and humanity produces a third nature. Because of this heresy, nearly everyone avoided the truth concerning mingling. But in the Bible there is a strong revelation concerning the mingling of the divine nature with the human nature. This is typified by the meal offering in the Old Testament, composed of fine flour mingled with oil (Lev. 2:4-5). The fine flour signifies humanity, and the oil signifies the Holy Spirit with His divinity. Oil mingled with fine flour signifies that divinity is mingled with humanity. There is a third entity produced but not a third nature. This third entity is not merely oil or fine flour, but a cake made of oil mingled with fine flour, signifying the mingling of divinity with humanity. After this mingling these two natures remain distinguishable. They remain two natures without a third nature being produced. Thus, there is a third entity, but not a third nature.</P><P>Whatever we eat, digest, and assimilate is mingled with us and even becomes us. This is why dieticians say that we are what we eat. A little boy becomes big and strong by being mingled with what he eats. What we eat is assimilated into us and eventually becomes our very fiber and tissue. In John 6:57 the Lord said that he who eats Him would live because of Him. God in Christ is good for food. His being food is for the dispensing of Himself into our being.</P><P>The dispensing of the Son is also seen in Ephesians 3:8, which reveals that the unsearchable riches of Christ [the Son] are for the New Testament ministry in the divine dispensing. Many people claim that they have a ministry, which is a service, but what is the content of their service? Do we minister Christ as the food supply to His believers? If we do not, we do not have a real, genuine, adequate ministry. The real, genuine, adequate ministry in the New Testament is the divine stewardship which ministers the Triune God in Christ to people as their life and life supply. In all the messages I have given throughout the years, my unique burden has been to minister Christ to God's people as their life and life supply. This truth is expressed in Hymns, #509, the chorus of which says:</P><P CLASS=HBODY>God is in Christ to be my supply,<br>God as the Spirit nourisheth me;<br>If upon Christ in spirit I feed,<br>Filled with His life I'll be.</P>
