<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GROWING IN LIFE BY EATING JESUS</H2><P>I have been a genuine, seeking Christian since 1925. I loved the Lord and the Bible so much, but for many years I never heard a message telling me that I have to grow in life. I heard message after message telling me that I had to do certain things or behave in a certain way. But no one told me that I need to grow, not to improve. No school can help you to grow. Every school is doing its best to help you to improve.</P><P>The main thing that good mothers do is to feed their children. In our homes the dining table is much more important than the desk. Every Lord's Day we do not have a desk in front of us but a dining table, that is, the Lord's table. I have traveled to many places and have been a guest in many homes. The first thing the host would care for is my eating. In many homes I did not have a desk, but in every home I had a dining table. This is because eating is more important than studying, writing, and reading.</P><P>If God had asked us to write the Bible, we would have written it in a different way. First Corinthians 11 tells us that in the night in which the Lord was betrayed, He took bread and said, "This is My body, which is given for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me" (v. 24). Then He took the cup and said, "This cup is the new covenant established in My blood; this do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me" (v. 25). Why does the Lord tell us to remember Him in this way? One day the Lord opened my eyes to see what the real remembrance of Him is. The real remembrance of the Lord is not the outward form of giving a prayer, singing a hymn, praising Him, or kneeling down. The real remembrance of Him is to eat Him. The more that you eat Him, the more you remember Him. This is because the remembrance of the Lord is a declaration of the way we live. We live by eating and drinking Christ day by day.</P><P>The Bible is filled with the thought of eating. Immediately after God created man, He took care of man's eating. He did not charge Adam to love Eve, and He did not charge Eve to submit to Adam. He did not charge them or give them instructions about how to be good parents. After God created man, God only told him to be careful to eat the right tree. If you eat the right tree, you will have life. If you eat the wrong tree, you will die.</P><P>Later, in Exodus we see that the children of Israel kept the Passover (12:15-20). They were charged to strike the blood and eat the lamb. Then they entered into the wilderness where they ate manna for forty years (16:35). Those wanderers in the wilderness were an eating people. They had no jobs, no businesses, no stores, and no schools. Day after day they simply ate the heavenly manna. When they entered into the good land, they ate of its rich produce (Josh. 5:12).</P><P>In the New Testament time, the Lord Jesus came. People considered Him as a prophet, a great teacher, and some even wanted to make Him a king. When they tried to make Him a king, He withdrew from them (John 6:15). The next day He told the people that He was the bread of life (v. 35). He did not want to be their king, but He wanted to be eaten by them. In John 6:57 He said, "He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me." It was as if the Lord were saying, "Don't make Me your king. Take Me as your food."</P>
