It covers the importance of this type of training, the main points to take care of, and some practical suggestions
For the past nineteen centuries, the church has been like candles; when one candle burns out, it is continued by another one
Brothers and sisters, do you want your light to continue, or do you want to see it end when your candle is extinguished?
In this way the second, the third, the hundredth, the thousandth, and even the ten thousandth candle will carry on the light
John 4:14 tells us what witnessing is: 'We have beheld and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world'
It means that you should witness to your friends, relatives, and acquaintances of what you have seen and heard, and bring them to the Lord
Only by drinking the Lord's water will we not thirst again, because there is a spring that will flow out of us and satisfy us continuously
Perhaps the people in the city knew something about her, but there were probably many things which they did not know
It was something that happened on the same day, not something that happened a few years later when she returned from a revival meeting
After you are saved, the Lord wants you to tell your family, neighbors, relatives, friends, and colleagues that you are now a saved person
You should tell them not only that you have believed in Jesus but also what great things the Lord has done for you
After a few days he immediately went into the synagogues to proclaim that Jesus is the Son of God and to witness to others
He had secured a letter from the high priest and was on his way to bind the believers of the Lord and to bring them before the high priest
After Paul received his sight, he went at the first opportunity to testify that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God
One day light and revelation came to you; the eyes of your heart were enlightened, and you discovered something
When a person receives the Lord Jesus as his Savior and confesses Him as the Son of God, he is doing a great thing, a tremendous thing
Among the billions of men throughout history, he has suddenly found out that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God
How can a person sit still and act as if nothing has happened when he has believed in the Lord Jesus and is saved?
Is something great, marvelous, extraordinary, special, beyond all imagination-Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God
Every believer who has seen the same should go to the synagogues and shout, 'Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God'!
Every time we consider how Jesus of Nazareth can be the Son of God, we feel that this is the greatest discovery in the whole world
Philip and Nathanael were friends; Philip first believed in the Lord and later led his friend to receive the Lord
In the course of their conversation, the young man found out that the gospel could not prevail in that place because a certain Mr
Even though he has beaten up so many people, we do not want to take him to court because we want to maintain a proper gospel testimony
The joy of leading another person to the Lord for the first time may be greater than the joy experienced on the day of his own salvation
Many Christians do not have much joy because they have never spoken anything for the Lord; they have never led a person to the Lord
Those who have no desire or interest in leading others to repentance unto the Lord are probably in need of repentance themselves
Those who are silent for the Lord in front of others probably need to listen again to the voice of God's gospel
When you become a little more advanced in the spiritual life, others may tell you, 'You have to be a channel of living water
He once made up his mind to preach the gospel to at least one person a day, whether or not he was giving a message on that day
If all of us preach the gospel and lead people to the Lord this way, our spiritual life will advance quickly in a few years
We can group them into two categories: First, going to God on man's behalf, and second, going to man on God's behalf
A man may have great interest in people, but if he has no burden to pray before the Lord, his work of saving souls will be ineffectual
The first thing that we must do is ask God for people, asking Him to give men to the Lord Jesus and to add them to the church
We have to present these people one by one to the Lord and pray for them fervently before we can effectively lead them to Christ
In writing these names down, the most important thing to remember is to take the names that the Lord has put in your heart
Out of all your family members, friends, colleagues, schoolmates, and those whom you know, a few names will spontaneously come to your mind
A record book should have the following columns The first column should be a number the second column the date and the third column the name
As you intercede continuously before the Lord, you may find one or two persons saved after a few days or half a month
Isaiah 59:1-2 says, 'Behold, Jehovah's hand is not so short that it cannot save; / Nor is His ear so heavy that it cannot hear
But your iniquities have become a separation Between you and your God And your sins have hidden His face From you so that He does not hear
Unconfessed sins, sins which are never dealt with by the blood, are a big obstacle before God; they are the cause of unanswered prayer
Timothy 119 says Holding faith and a good conscience concerning which some thrusting these away have become shipwrecked regarding the faith
If one deals with sin properly before the Lord, he will be able to offer proper prayers, and others will be brought to the Lord through him
If the conscience is blameless, it is easy for faith to be strong, and if faith is strong, spontaneously our prayers will be answered
When we believe Gods word abiding in faith rather than in doubt we will see how real Gods words are and we will find answers to our prayers
If you have prayed for a long time and there is still no answer, you should realize that there must be some hindrance
Although he did not like this in the beginning, the power of prayer overcame him, and in the end he accepted the Lord
On the first day during the after-dinner conversation, each sister sat at one end, praying for the guests one by one
Try to avoid arguing with the ones you are trying to save because arguments often drive people away instead of bringing them in
You have to show them that they do not have your kind of peace and joy and that they should therefore believe in the Lord
When they came out of the church, the little granddaughter looked at her grandfather and felt that he did not look like a believer
After walking a few steps, she said to her grandfather again, 'You do not look as if you have believed in Jesus'
The old man, who was otherwise wild and hard to deal with, became soft after his little granddaughter's probing questions
A person may preach the right doctrines, and crowds of people may come for his messages, but the same crowds may walk away unsaved
Each time you lead someone to the Lord, you have to do a detailed analysis, just like a doctor who studies each patient's case in detail
Some brothers and sisters are good at bringing people to the Lord because they have studied the ones whom they brought to the Lord
We always have to find the reason that the Spirit is working, and we also have to find the reason that the Spirit is not working
If you meet a certain type of person, you will need only to speak certain words to him, and he will receive the Lord
You can handle those whose names are in your record book, and you can handle those whom you come across by accident
We can give them out to people who are walking on the streets, who are cooking in their kitchens, or who are working in their offices
A newly saved brother always should have tracts ready in his pockets, and he should pass them out when he is free
If a newly saved person sees this from the very beginning, he will be spared many headaches, and he will gain much benefit for himself
Whether or not the church will continue with its second generation depends on whether our children belong to the Lord
And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the houses, wherein they shall eat it'
Numbers 18:1 says, 'And Jehovah said to Aaron, You and your sons and your father's house with you shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary'
Only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all who are with her in her house, because she hid the messengers we sent'
All who were in the house which had the scarlet thread were spared, while the rest of the inhabitants of Jericho were killed
Both the promise in chapter two and the execution in chapter six show us that Rahab's whole household was saved
God's children, especially those who are the head of their house, should realize that God deals with man according to households
God promised the Israelites that they would eat, drink, and rejoice before God on that day household by household
John 453 says Then the father knew that it was in that hour in which Jesus said to him Your son lives and he believed he and his whole house
While Peter was speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were in Cornelius's house, and all of them received salvation
God's Word does not say that if you believe on the Lord Jesus, you and your household shall receive eternal life
Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household'-this is not something difficult to achieve
If this was the case, we would have to wait a few days after a person was saved, teach him something, and hope that he would understand
You need to see this: The salvation of a household is no different and certainly no more difficult than the salvation of one person
If God gains a person, He should gain his whole family as well, regardless of how many persons there are in that family
Those who are the head of a family have the ground to bring their whole household to the Lord, and they should help their families be saved
In the Bible there are individuals who believed in the Lord and there are households which believed in the Lord
Acts 2:39 says, 'For to you is the promise and to your children, and to all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God calls to Himself'
The Lord says that when a person sets out to preach the gospel, he should say as he enters into a house, 'Peace to this house'
These numerous cases provide ample proof in both the Old Testament and the New Testament that God deals with man by households
God's judgment comes through one man to the entire household, just as God's blessing comes through one man to the entire household
Genesis 12:17 says, 'The Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues, because of Sarai, Abram's wife'
Genesis 20:18 says, 'For the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife'
Kings 13:34 says, 'This matter became a sin to the house of Jeroboam, so as even to cut it off and destroy it from the face of the earth'
Jeroboam was the one who set up the idols, but God judged his house and destroyed it from the face of the earth
Kings 14:14 says, 'Jehovah will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who will cut off the house of Jeroboam this day and even now'
When Dathan and Abiram sinned, God opened the earth and swallowed not only Dathan and Abiram, but also their households
Brothers, we need to take care of how we live before God, because what we do individually can affect our whole household
The head of a family has the special responsibility before God for bringing his whole household to the Lord and to His service
If you declare this with faith, and if you exercise your authority to take the lead, your children will go along
When you take this stand, everyone who is under you will come to the Lord; they will have no other way to take
Every one of his sons daughtersinlaw grandsons granddaughters nephews nieces greatgrandchildren old or young male or female were saved
George Cutting himself believed in the word: 'Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household'
Once you are saved, you should gather your family members together and declare to them, 'From this day forward, my household belongs to God'
If those who are saved through us are saved household by household instead of one by one, what a difference it will make!
As long as a person is born into Catholicism, he is dragged into the religion whether or not he eventually becomes a true believer
John 5 records the incident of the Lord Jesus healing one who had been sick for thirty-eight years near the pool in Bethesda
Since a Christian should not sin and should not continue in sins, is it then possible for a Christian not to sin?
Paul said, 'To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord'
If a Christian sins and does not deal with it properly in this age, he will have to deal with it in the coming age
Besides these two terrible consequences, there is another immediate result of sin-the breaking down of fellowship with God
Formerly, he treasured the church meetings very much; when he missed one meeting, he felt that he had suffered a great loss
On the day we believed in the Lord, under God's light we only saw the sins that we had committed before we had believed
A man can only be conscious of the sins which God shines His light upon; he cannot feel the sins which he has not yet committed
In saying that the Lord had taken your sins away, you meant that the Lord had dealt with your one thousand sins
If you were saved at sixty-four years of age, you would have said the same thing: 'O Lord, You have borne all my sins'
The criminal on the cross did not believe in the Lord until just before he died, but the Lord took away all his sins
Male signifies everything related to the testimony of the truth, while female signifies everything related to the experience of life
Throughout the Bible the church is symbolized by females, because the church is subjective, being related to the Lord's work in man
A heifer is used here instead of a bull because it represents another aspect of the Lord's work-His work toward man
It was slaughtered, and its blood was taken and sprinkled seven times directly in front of the tent of meeting
The heifer's blood was sprinkled seven times in front of the tent of meeting, signifying that it was for God and for the redemption of sin
The sins for which man feels the need of forgiveness, as well as the sins for which man does not feel the need of forgiveness, were there
After the cedar wood, the hyssop, and the scarlet were burned with the heifer, the ashes were gathered up and kept in a clean place
When an Israelite brought a bull or a lamb to the Lord and offered it up as a sin offering, he did it because of some known sin
The burning of the red heifer was not for known sins which had been committed in the past, but for future uncleanness
Whenever a man becomes unclean or has touched some unclean things, he does not need to kill another red heifer and offer it to God
He only needs to take the ashes of the red heifer that was offered once and mix them with water and sprinkle them on the body
If a Christian touches something unclean by accident and there is uncleanness in him, he does not have to ask the Lord to die for him again
In other words, the ashes of the red heifer tell us that the past work of the cross is applicable for our use today
John 1:9 says, 'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
Proverbs 28:13 says, 'He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: / but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy'
Only those who walk in the light and who have deep feelings and a repulsion for sin can have genuine confession
If we confess our sins this way, God 'is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
When we sin and when we know our sin and acknowledge it as sin, God will forgive us our sin and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
He is also 'righteous,' which means He must be satisfied with His Son's redemptive work on the cross and must recognize it
When He says every sin, He means every sin, not just every sin committed before we believed or every sin committed in the past
Now we have an Advocate with the Father, who is Jesus Christ the Righteous; 'He Himself is the propitiation for our sins'
Through the Lord Jesus' death and by His becoming the propitiation for our sins, He has become our Advocate with the Father
If we confess our sins, God is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
When a child of God sins and does not confess his sin but instead remains in his sin, he loses his fellowship with God
When a child who has done something wrong comes home, he will feel that something is not right because his father will not speak to him
Once we confess this way, we will immediately recover our fellowship with God, and the joy and peace that were lost will come back
Once the conscience becomes hardened, a serious and fundamental problem develops: It becomes difficult for God's light to shine into a man
A person must build up a habit of confessing and making recompense so that he can maintain a sensitive and keen conscience before the Lord
There was once a worker of the Lord who used to ask others, 'When was the last time you confessed to someone'?
If it has been a long time since a person's last confession to another person, there has to be some problem with this person's conscience
The length of time since your last confession is an indication of whether or not there is a problem between you and God
How should a person apologize to another person or recompense another person when he offends him or comes short in his dealings with him?
Chapter five tells us that we should confess to God and offer up sacrifices for forgiveness of our miscellaneous sins
Chapter six says that if we have offended anyone in material things, we should take care of the matter with men
A person who has offended anyone or transgressed against anyone in material things has to settle it with men before he can be forgiven
Extorting from one's fellowman: It is a sin to take advantage of anyone through the influence of one's own position and power
To turn something into nothing, to reduce much to little, or to exchange what is bad for what is good is the same as lying
Others have lost something, and you take advantage of them, extorting some gain and benefit out of them; this is sin
Concerning any of the things a man may do to sin thereby'-this refers to transgressions against men in terms of material things
God's children should learn and always remember this lesson-they should not make the possessions of others their own
The trespass offering in Leviticus 5 deals with sins that do not involve material transgressions against people
He shall make restitution for it in full and add to it one-fifth more; he shall give it to whom it belongs on the day he is found guilty'
If the object in question remains in our house, it proves that we are still wrong; we have to return it in full
If we have taken money or things from others, God wants us to add one-fifth to the full amount when we return it
An apology that is in the way of settling accounts is not the kind of confession that God's children should have
If you are concerned about how much each party owes the other when you apologize, you are not behaving like a Christian
When a new believer offends others, he should realize that he will suffer loss eventually, even though he may gain something temporarily
In whatever matter they have transgressed against others, they should return these things to them and ask God for forgiveness
The Lord says, 'Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you'
When you remember something or are reminded of something, do not put the thought aside and think that it is merely a thought
If we have done something wrong or if we have offended or hurt someone, the offended party need not accuse us before God
If we give him or her a reason to sigh, we will lose all our spiritual prospects and all our gifts to God will be annulled
You must 'leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift'
If we offend a brother or a sister, we immediately fall under God's judgment, and it is not easy to be recovered
In verse 25 the Lord emphasized, 'Be well disposed quickly toward your opponent at law, while you are with him on the way'
Brothers have often regretted that they lost their opportunity to confess to each other; the offended party is no longer on the way
The Lord is not speaking of a future judgment or of being thrown into and being released from an actual prison
His concern is that we would be reconciled today, that we would pay every quadrans today, not putting the matter off until later
Sometimes you have offended one individual, but because you want to testify to the brothers and sisters, you tell them about it
There are of course times when we have to exercise due care in the way we confess we have to take care of the interest and benefit of others
According to this principle, if the recipient of your recompense is no longer available, the recompense should go to his relatives
The verses in Luke say that we have to forgive a brother who sins against us seven times a day, repents, and turns to us seven times
Suppose the same person does the same thing to you seven times a day, and suppose he says that he has sinned against you seven times a day
It was unthinkable to them that a brother could offend someone seven times in a day and then turn around to repent seven times
Once a child of God arrives at a proper evaluation of his debt to God, he will generously forgive what his brother owes him
In these verses, however, we see a slave who, even if he were to sell all that he had, would not have had enough to repay
As soon as a man hopes a little and opens his mouth to say, 'Lord, be gracious to me,' the Lord pours out His grace to him
When he was a long way off from home and before he met his father, he was prepared to go back home to serve as a servant
From these verses we see again that God does not accomplish His salvation according to a sinner's thought but according to His own thought
The master had forgiven his debt of ten thousand talents, but he would not forgive his fellow slave's debt of a hundred denarii
He also clearly shows us that if a believer does not forgive his brother, he is not dealing with others according to grace
The Lord has forgiven our debts according to mercy, and He expects us to forgive others' debts according to mercy as well
He expects us to do the same thing to others according to a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over
Nothing is uglier than refusing to forgive when one has been forgiven or refusing to be merciful when one has obtained mercy
A person should not receive grace for himself on the one hand and refuse to share grace with others on the other hand
Verse 34 continues, 'His master became angry and delivered him to the torturers until he would repay all that was owed'
Verse 35 says, 'So also shall My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts'
Do not tell the brothers and sisters or the elders of the church about it or make it the subject of your conversation
A problem often arises when a brother offends another brother and then the offended brother goes around publicizing it
The Lord did not say that we should deal with it in writing, but rather by going to our brother and speaking to him face-to-face
Just as it is wrong to speak about a matter behind someone's back, it is equally wrong to speak about it in front of many people
In other words, individual sins should be dealt with by the individuals alone; no third party should be involved at all
We should never say anything behind the back of the brother who has offended us, and we should not speak to him in front of many people
While this is, in fact, quite troublesome, you cannot be afraid of trouble if you want to walk according to God's Word
If you feel that your brother's offense against you is too small to be bothered with, you may feel no need to speak to him
If some offenses will indeed stumble your brother, you must point out his fault to him while he and you are alone together
Since it is not a small thing to offend someone, we have the responsibility to tell the one who has offended us for his sake
The purpose of exhortation is not to ask for recompense or to justify our own feelings; it is for the purpose of restoring our brother
Next, the words we speak, the way we speak them, including our attitude, countenance, voice, and tone, must all be right
One must forget about himself completely before he can be humble, meek, free from pride, and willing to help those who are at fault
You should realize that the Lord allows a brother to offend you because He has shown favor to you and has chosen you
If a brother offends you in a small matter and you forgive him, the matter is settled; there is no need to do anything further
If a brother offends you to such an extent that it becomes an issue, you cannot close your eyes and say that there is no problem
The life of the Body is drained through these burdens, and the work of the ministers is wasted through these burdens
If a problem arises between two of God's children and if both of them go to the Lord and deal with it, everything will be solved easily
If dirt gets into a wound, not only does the level of pain increase, but the dirt makes it harder for the wound to heal
The purpose of telling others is not to multiply the gossip but to invite others to exhort, help, and fellowship together
The 'one or two more' here should be experienced persons in the Lord; they should be those who are weighty in their spiritual measure
The mature ones should pray and consider the matter before the Lord and then arbitrate according to their spiritual discernment
If they feel that the fault lies with the offending brother, they should go to that brother and say, 'You are wrong in this matter
Talkative ones can never convince people; instead, invite those who are trustworthy, honest, spiritual, and experienced before the Lord
If the offending brother is one who walks before God, he should lay aside his own view and accept the witness of two or three
Verse 17 continues, 'If he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you just like the Gentile and the tax collector'
In other words, if he refuses to hear the church, all the brothers and sisters in the church should no longer communicate with him
When a matter is brought up to two or three people and then to the whole church, the Father in heaven will acknowledge such a decision
Even those who are for the law can stand up and speak their mind, even though their opinion is altogether wrong
After the elders have listened to all of them, they should speak their feelings before God and make a final judgment on the matter
To him who wishes to sue you and take your tunic, yield to him your cloak also; and whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two'
It is wrong to go on living as a Christian for eight to ten years without knowing what Christian reactions are
If our reactions are not proper, we are not acting according to God's nature or life within us, and we are not meeting God's standard
Or you may greet a person when you have nothing against him but turn away from him when there is something against him
If more than half our life is occupied with reactions and if our reactions are Christian-like, we can expect God to be pleased with us
They argue about everything, and they talk about the law, about their rights, and about what others should or should not do
If someone strikes your right cheek today and you are full of reasonings, you may say, 'How could he have done that?
The Lord tells us to turn our left cheek when others strike our right cheek and to give others our cloak when they want our tunic
There are many records which show that many of the Roman slaves would rather have been killed by their masters than struck on the cheek
If striking the cheek has to do with humiliation, taking away the tunic has to do with one's most essential possessions
If you fall into reasoning, you have already lost your Christian standing; you are no longer standing on Christian ground
A Christian is one who soars when persecution comes, when all escapes have been blocked and there is only a wall before him
When he died, many brothers commented, 'In order to know the strength of his love, one needed to be his greatest enemy
When others want to borrow some of our money, we may spare our money if we turn them down, but we will also spare our joy
If the demand for the first garment is unreasonable, the demand for the second garment is even more unreasonable
Some who are ignorant of the Bible think that the teachings on the mountain in Matthew 5-7 have to do with the law
Those who strike are not acting like Christians, and those who endure others' striking are not acting like Christians either
Only those who take the striking willingly and who turn their left cheek to their strikers saying Please do more are acting like Christians
If we have no intention to live this kind of life or have this kind of reaction, nothing more needs to be said
If you take advantage of something or someone once, you will not be able to lift up your head for a whole month before the Lord
It is a very painful experience for a person to be continually troubled by sin after he has believed in the Lord
Others think that sin has made them a captive and that they must strive hard to free themselves from its bondage
The common understanding of a law is that it is something that remains the same all the time, something that allows no exceptions
Whenever he willed to obey God's law, a different law rose up in his members, subjecting him to the law of sin
After sinning repeatedly, not voluntarily but involuntarily by a potent force in his body, Paul discovered that sin is a law
Those who have sinned a hundred or a thousand times will say that sin is a law; it is something that continually drives them on
You may prevail for an hour, but after two hours you will feel tired, and after another hour your hand will no longer obey you
When temptation comes again, we make a stronger resolution because we think that our last failure was caused by a faulty resolution
Afterwards, you may feel that as a Christian you should not have lost your temper, and you may resolve to control your temper the next time
The day will come when you will prostrate yourself before God and acknowledge that you can do nothing and henceforth will do nothing
The problem is not whether you understand the doctrine in Romans 8 but whether or not you have emerged from Romans 7
It takes many years for some Christians to realize that sin and death are a law in them and that the Holy Spirit is another law in them
When the Lord opens their eyes, they will see that sin and death are a law and that the Holy Spirit is a law as well
Man's will cannot overcome the law of sin, but the law of the Spirit of life has freed us from the law of sin and of death
In the same way, no effort is involved when we deal with the law of sin and of death by the law of the Spirit of life
Indeed, all victories are unconscious victories because the law of the Holy Spirit is operating and upholding us, not our own will
Once you experience this, you will realize that only the indwelling Spirit can keep you from sin; you do not have to will not to sin
The former law is indeed potent in bringing us to sin, but the present law is more absolute in saving us from condemnation
When the law of the Spirit of life is expressed through us, its power is far greater than that of the law of sin and of death
Brothers and sisters, do not think that the Holy Spirit within us only expresses His life through us occasionally
Once the Lord opens our eyes, we will see that the treasure within is not just the Holy Spirit or a life, but a law as well
They think that the Lord set up a good pattern for us while He was on earth and that we should imitate this pattern
To some people this means that they can do all things when He empowers them and that they can do nothing when He does not empower them
We must first understand, see, and grasp the secret of Christ our life before we can imitate Him or ask Him for strength
They feel that the Christian life is like climbing a hill with a heavy burden on their back; they can never reach the top
If you live the Christian life by yourself, endurance will be a suffering to you, as will love, humility, and bearing the cross
For a proud person to try to live in God's presence and act humbly every day is a very wearisome and tiring task
Being a Christian is not an exercise akin to putting a carnal man in heaven and subjecting him to slavery there
Otherwise, as soon as he entered it, he would run away quickly; he would not be able to stand even one day there
In order for our crucifixion with Christ to become experiential, there is the need of cooperation from two sides
It is impossible to experience this crucifixion if there is cooperation on only one side; cooperation on both sides is essential
Just as our sins were settled more than nineteen hundred years ago, our person was also dealt with at the same time
If you take a piece of paper, write a few letters on it, and then tear the paper apart, you tear the letters apart as well
If you are looking at your own 'self' every day, hoping that it will improve, this self will become more alive; it will not die by itself
If we constantly frustrate Him by trying to do good and be patient and humble, the work of Christ will have no effect on us
The Lord Jesus has already given up on them, but they are still struggling and trying to come up with ways to live
On that day they will see that as God considered them hopeless, they should consider themselves hopeless as well
Brothers and sisters, we must remember that failure comes not because we do too little, but because we do too much
In the same way, as long as man is occupied with his own work, trying to do everything by himself, Christ's life will not be manifested
If we are working and operating, instead of the cross working in us and the life of Christ operating in us, this speaking will be in vain
After we are saved, the more we walk according to our own will, the more suffering and the less joy we will have
The more we walk according to the new life and the more we obey God's will, the more peace and joy we will have
We should have the assurance that not only do we want to obey God's will, but God Himself also wants us to obey His will
These three things are: arrangements in the environment, the leading of the Holy Spirit, and the teachings of the Scripture
When the testimonies of these three things are in agreement with one another, we can be assured that we know God's will
No one knows how many hairs he has, and no one can count his own hairs, but God has counted and numbered our hairs
If God takes care of a seemingly worthless creature such as a sparrow, how much more will He take care of His children!
A new believer may not be that experienced in the leading of the Spirit, and he may not know that much of the teaching of the Scripture
God not only guides us through the environment but also speaks to us and guides us from within through His Spirit
My Spirit' refers to the Spirit of God, whereas 'a new spirit' refers to our spirit at the time of our regeneration
If we did not have a new spirit within us, God would not have given us His Spirit, and the Holy Spirit could not have dwelt within us
Man has to receive a new spirit through regeneration before he can be in the position to receive Gods Spirit and before God can dwell in him
Not only is he able to discern God's provision in the environment, but he also now possesses an inward knowledge and inward assurance
We should learn to trust not only in God's sovereignty in the environment but also in the leading of the Holy Spirit within
Whenever we sense any unrest, we should realize that the Holy Spirit within is displeased with what we are doing; He is grieved
If he has enough light, everything will be clear to him spontaneously, and he will not need to waste his energy on such analysis
His will is revealed through the various experiences of men of the past, and all these things were recorded in the Bible
We need the Spirit's enlightenment to understand biblical principles, and we need the Spirit's leading to receive biblical promises
Whether or not it is God's will for you to go to a certain place to preach the gospel depends on the leading of the Spirit
When the Holy Spirit puts a certain phrase or verse within you in a powerful, fresh, and living way, you have a promise from the Spirit
Sometimes, the arrangement of the environment comes first, followed by the leading of the Spirit and the teachings of the Bible
Sometimes, the Spirit's leading and the teachings of the Bible come first, and afterward, the confirmation in the environment
If your inward feeling is different from the testimony of the Bible, it proves that your inward feeling is not reliable
If it is God's will, what you see outwardly will surely line up with what you see inwardly and what you see from the Bible
If your inward sense, the teaching of the Bible, and the environment are all clear, then God's will for you will also be clear
These ones know God's Word more, their flesh has been dealt with somewhat, and they are under the direction of the Spirit
They will consider your condition in the church, and they will sense whether or not they can say amen to what you have seen
An individuals personal feeling understanding of the Scripture and knowledge of the environment may be wrong they may not be that accurate
If the other members of the church think that the 'guidance' you have is not reliable, you should not insist on your opinion
If a brother sins against another brother, the offended one should speak to the offending one while they are alone with each other
Because the church is God's habitation and the beacon of God's light, we need to believe that God's will is revealed in the church
The church can render an accurate and divine confirmation because it has become the mouthpiece of the Holy Spirit
The church must be spiritual, and it must allow the Spirit to preside over it before it can be used by the Spirit to be God's mouthpiece
The confirmation of the church does not mean a discussion among all the brothers and sisters in the church together
Only then can there be accurate judgment, and only then will the Spirit give accurate confirmation through them
They think that it is sufficient for them to be clear by themselves and that there is no need to fellowship with the church
Because we are the party involved, we are clouded by our own interests and subjectivity when we seek God's will
The confirmation of the church should not be regarded in the same way as one regards the words of the prophets
In seeking God's will, we must not fall into an abnormal state where the mind is blank and the will is passive
Hebrews 5:14 speaks of those 'who because of practice have their faculties exercised for discriminating between both good and evil'
In Romans 12:2 Paul told us to 'be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is'
In the New Testament there are also visions and dreams, but God does not use them as an essential means of guidance
We need to point out once again that when these three things are in line with one another we can have the confidence that we have Gods will
Many times my heart aches over the fact that many people are looking for methods to know Gods will but they have no desire to obey Gods will
If you have an intense and absolute desire to do Gods will God will make known His will to you even when you know nothing about the methods
Since God has humbled Himself to make His will known to man, we must seek to know His will, and we must worship, treasure, and do His will
After a person has sold everything, he will still receive income; money will still find its way back to his hand
Even after a person has offered up all of his money, we should not think that money will no longer have an influence on him
After you have forsaken all of your possessions to follow the Lord, you should walk according to God's principle
If they do not learn to manage their wealth, they should expect nothing except hardship in the way ahead of them
Those who trust in the Lord may not have much in the way of savings, but the Lord will not leave them in difficulties
Everyone who falls into deprivation falls because he has a problem in himself; he has not managed his wealth according to God's way
The Bible shows us a fundamental principle-one must give to become rich and one becomes poor by accumulating riches
Since we are willing to share our surplus with others, others will also be happy to share their surplus with us in the future
Those who crave money and cling to it can never receive God's money; they will never receive any supply from God
We should all look to the Lord for our needs, but God will supply the needs of only one type of people-those who give
If we are shrewd and exact in giving to others, God will only touch others to give to us in a shrewd and exact way
After looking down the list of brothers and sisters who were poor, he decided to give every one of them a piece
The old couple cut the carton of butter into small pieces, wrapped them up, and sent them to these brothers and sisters
They then knelt down and prayed, 'Lord, may we remind You of what You have said: 'Give, and it will be given to you'
Among those who had received the butter, there was a very poor sister who had been paralyzed and bed-ridden for years
A co-worker once told me, 'During the past twenty years, every time money has remained in my hand, there has always been a problem'
It says, 'He who sows sparingly shall also sparingly reap; and he who sows with blessings shall also with blessings reap'
The Corinthians gave to those in Jerusalem, remembering their needs, and Paul said that it was a kind of sowing, not a kind of throwing away
Keeping things in one's hand is the very cause for poverty, while offering things to God is the very cause for blessing
Now read Proverbs 1124 There is that scattereth and yet increaseth and there is that withholdeth more than is meet but it tendeth to poverty
There was a drought, and it was so dry that even the king and his chamberlains had to go out to search for water
The problem of many people is that they hold on tightly to what they have and yet expect God to answer their prayers
If new believers are not delivered from the power and grip of money, the church will never be able to run a straight course
He told the Philippians, 'My God will fill your every need according to His riches, in glory, in Christ Jesus'
Adam and Eve's occupation in the beginning was that of a gardener; they guarded and kept the garden of Eden which God had created
The Lord Jesus' parables in the Gospel of Matthew show us that farming is a basic occupation in the New Testament age
We must completely differentiate between the two: Making money and increasing the abundance are two different things altogether
Bear in mind that commerce always makes money for oneself at the expense of others and at the expense of decreasing the riches of the world
The principle of commerce is to increase the money in one's pocket by decreasing the money in another's pocket
Once the idea of making money comes into a person's mind, the result is very simple-one will get more money while another will have less
God rebuked him, saying, 'By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence'
If you labor on something and then sell what you have labored on, this is something that can be blessed by God
No brother engaging in pure commerce can be a responsible brother, for such a person can never be fully delivered from money
The second highest is the occupation that works with skills and that receives rewards by contributing intellectual or physical strength
We hope that ten or twenty years from now, it will be a tradition among us that no one goes into pure commerce
Hopefully, in the future all the brothers and sisters among us will build up the habit of shunning pure commerce
If there is one basic issue that is not settled, whether it be the family or one's occupation, problems will eventually come back
As long as there is one unresolved issue, a Christian will not be able to take a straight path before the Lord
We need to be clear that human beings have an awareness of sex in the same way that they have an awareness of hunger
Just as the consciousness of hunger is a natural demand of the body, the consciousness of sex is also a natural demand of the body
They were unnecessarily condemned in their conscience because they were ignorant of God's ordination as well as God's Word
In 1 Timothy 4:1-3 Paul said that in later times, there would be the teachings of demons, one of which is the forbidding of marriage
It is not a question of the presence of this consciousness; the presence of this consciousness is natural and is not sin
On the sixth day, God did not say that 'it was good'; in fact, He even said that something was not good after He created man
In considering Genesis 2:18, many Bible readers think that when God created man, He created a male plus a female
It was as if God created half of a man in the beginning and then the other half after seeing that this man was only one-half
In the New Testament, Paul said that marriage not only is allowed but also is a necessity because of the presence of sin
He began by saying that a wife does not have authority over her own body, and a husband does not have authority over his own body
Except for the purpose of devoting themselves to the service of the Lord, the husband and the wife should not be separated
When a person is married, the affliction in the flesh increases, and it is hard for him to serve the Lord with a single heart
In Matthew 13 the Lord indicates that these cares are like thorns which can easily choke the growth of the seed
Paul did not command these ones to keep their virginity, but his words show his inclination toward this choice
Marriage also brings a person into family problems, entanglements, afflictions, and the anxieties of this world
The first condition for keeping one's virginity is that a person have only sex consciousness but no sex compulsion
If a person has the intention and the inclination to remain single, and if he is firm in his heart to keep his virginity, he can keep it
We have to acknowledge that 'there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens'
The Lord tells us here that there are some who made themselves eunuchs, who keep their virginity for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens
We will find one day that virgins have a clear advantage in entering the kingdom of the heavens and in being raptured
Concerning the matter of marriage, God has laid down definite guidelines on whom one can marry and whom one cannot marry
The Bible shows us clearly that the marriages of God's people should be restricted to those among themselves only
In other words, if one is to be married, his spouse must be sought from among God's own people, not from other people
There are sufficient commandments in the Old Testament to show us that we should not marry anyone outside of God's people
God clearly shows through the Old Testament that one should look for a marriage partner among the Lord's people
The greatest problem with going after unbelievers is that the other person may turn one away from the Lord to serve other gods
Nehemiah charged them in 13:23-27 to sever all ties with the Gentile women and not to have any dealings with them
In the Old Testament, an ox and a horse could not be yoked together, and an ass could not be equally yoked with a horse
When a believer and an unbeliever share the responsibility of a family together, the result will be nothing but problems
Here is a problem: Suppose a brother is already married to an unbeliever, or a sister is already married to an unbelieving husband
Please bear in mind that many such families today complain little, simply because the believers in these families are not absolute enough
There are cases of 'three against two and two against three,' as in Luke 12:52, because some family members have become believers
If a husband wants to separate because the wife has believed in the Lord, or vice versa, the word is, 'Let him separate'
If he does not care and wants to continue living with you, Paul said that you should be at peace with him and should not leave
It may not be that easy for the Lord to save others, but it would surely be easy for the Lord to save one who is already yours
Because a marriage agreement exists, the other party may not easily let go just because you have believed in the Lord
After the Israelites entered the land of Canaan, the Gibeonites deceived them with dry, moldy bread, old patched shoes, and worn garments
You should not move into the other party's house with a false disguise; you should move in with an open banner
According to this principle, we can say that the best thing for a brother to do is to marry a sister in the Lord
A husband or wife who becomes a believer after being married may encounter hardship, but many times the Lord will bring him through
If a person marries an unbeliever, we must warn him of another thing: He should be careful not to be carried away
Of course those who are married or engaged have to be careful as well but those who are considering marriage should exercise even more care
In other words, they need special protection, preservation, and prayer, so that they will not be carried away by the other party
A brother who has a higher social status does not want to marry a sister with a lower status, and the reverse is also true
If the concubine cannot be sent away, man's thought is for the husband to discontinue sexual relationships with her
Please bear in mind that the sin of fornication and that of taking a concubine are two completely different things
Others would commit fornication with his wives in the sight of the sun, and the sword would never depart from his house
Exodus 21:9-11 specifies that if a master betroths a maid to his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters
If it is mentioned three or more times we need to integrate the different portions before we can arrive at a conclusion about Gods teaching
There is only one portion in the New Testament-1 Timothy-that only indirectly refers to the matter of concubines
The New Testament does not say that such a one should send his concubine away or abstain from fulfilling her duty of marriage
If a concubine is saved and has no compulsion for continued sexual relationships, it is good if she is willing to separate from the husband
It is quite obvious that a person who takes a concubine will suffer more affliction in the body than one who upholds monogamy
In Matthew 19 and Luke 16 the Lord Jesus shows us clearly that divorce is permitted only if adultery is involved
If you commit sexual acts with someone other than your wife or your husband, you have committed adultery and have violated that oneness
If a sister finds her husband committing adultery or taking another woman, she can divorce her husband, and the church cannot stop her
A person can leave his or her spouse only where adultery is involved, because adultery has destroyed the oneness
Matthew 19 and Luke 16 are two clear passages concerning this subject, and we have to pay much attention to them
A divorce has already occurred when one party commits adultery; it does not begin with the divorce proceedings
Marriage begins with the declaration of oneness, and divorce is a declaration that such a oneness no longer exists
The two may quarrel bitterly, they may not get along with each other, and they may threaten to divorce each other
If we are not yet dead to the law or if we are Seventh-day Adventists, yet we are married to Christ, all of us are adulteresses
Matthew 5 says that everyone who looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart
The Old Testament speaks only of the sin of those who are married; it does not speak of those who are not married
Fornication, which happens to those who are not married and which seemingly does not destroy oneness is also sin
We hope that the young brothers and sisters will open up their hearts before the Lord concerning the matter of marriage
We mention this so that they will see that the older brothers in the Lord recognize this fact and acknowledge its legitimacy
The delight and enjoyment of one's company must not be something that is temporary; it must be a permanent sentiment
There are only two possible scenarios for a married person who is handicapped in some way and who is being cared for by the other party
When a person is very self-conscious, he will feel guilty about his spouse's constant service and sacrifice for him
Although physical weakness is not an insurmountable problem, it will become a big issue in the family sooner or later
Physical weakness may not be a problem at the time of marriage, but it will certainly be a problem after marriage
He will also show loving-kindness to the thousandth generation of those who love Him and keep His commandments
Many live dissipated and lawless lives in their youth because their fathers or grandfathers before them sowed to whirlwinds
They will transmit their evil seed to the next generations, but they cannot transmit their regeneration to them
They can only sow the seed of sin but not the life of God; they cannot pass their regeneration on to their children
Once a person marries another person, the whole family of the other side comes along, because a person is more or less a part of his family
All you need to do is to see if the other side's family has a high standard of morality or a lofty set of values
He may not be satisfied with his family, but after he is married, his family's traits and ways will unconsciously surface in his new family
Although the traits may not surface all at once, the other party's family will gradually creep into your own family
If a father is very strict with his children, the sons and daughters of that family will not be too affectionate
If a family is warm and the parents are full of love, the children from this family will spontaneously be gentle and easygoing
If both the father and the mother in a family are strict, the children from that family will be introspective and inward
By looking at the way the mother treats the father, you will know how the daughter will treat her husband in the future
Before you decide to marry someone, you should study the other party's family, and decide whether you like it or not
In a marriage, the man should generally be five, six, or even seven to eight years older than the woman, as far as physical age is concerned
For a marriage to be healthy, there must be not only natural attraction but also compatibility or agreement in personality
A new believer must realize that natural attraction is temporary, but compatibility of character is something that lasts
Among unbelievers, the kind of love described in their romance novels is always a matter of natural attraction
If the other party is cold and frigid toward people, he will pull in one direction while you pull in the other direction
The candid one feels that the other person is too slow, while the cautious one feels that the other person moves too fast
If a thoughtful person marries an impulsive wife, it will create quite a problem because each one will be pulling in the opposite direction
To be fair, if every word had to be so accurate, perhaps no more than twenty sentences a day would be spoken in the world
He cannot stand going from place to place with his wife all the time, yet he feels imprisoned at home if he does not follow her
Again, this is not a matter of morality but of personality; it is something that was overlooked at the time of their marriage
If that brother had married a quiet sister or that sister had married an active brother, everything would have been fine
When an energetic sister marries a quiet husband or a quiet brother marries an active wife, trouble certainly will arise in the family
Children from such families will certainly be affected also, because they will not know which side to take when the parents are on a see-saw
If you try to discover the other person's weaknesses after marriage, you are too late, because you are already living together every day
It is useless to find faults then; this will only damage the family, because no one can change those weaknesses
One must take note and consider well before he enters into a marriage whether or not he is able to live with the other party's weaknesses
Many people think that those with different weaknesses cannot get along with one another, and that those with similar weaknesses can
When both the husband and the wife are believers, any weakness in one party will be consciously felt by both parties
Young brothers and sisters should realize that some weaknesses can be tolerated even when found in both parties
Of course, sometimes even couples with similar weaknesses can get along with each other; there is no rigid rule concerning this
At other times we see wives who are very calculating; they will do things that are profitable only to themselves, and nothing more
Marriage means a living together, and it is a big question whether or not a person can live together with others
If a brother is at odds with his father, mother, brothers, and sisters, you can only expect an unhappy marriage if you marry him
In choosing a spouse, you must make sure that the other party has the basic human factors necessary for a marriage
Many times the wife argues with the husband, not because she is right or he is wrong, but because she wants to save her 'face'
Before you consider marrying someone or entering into an engagement, you should jot down all his attributes one by one
You must observe privately how he treats people, friends, family members, younger brothers and sisters, children, and parents
The mature ones who oversee the young ones must also write down every point concerning the two persons and make a comparison
After a person is married, he or she has to learn to behave in a way that avoids causing problems to the family or the church
Please remember that many difficulties arise between the husband and the wife because neither has undergone any preparation
The husbands need to go back to learn how to be husbands, and the wives need to go back to learn how to be wives
The truth, however, is that many people are far more careless toward their family than they are toward their jobs
If we behave carelessly and do not consider being a husband or a wife a serious occupation, our family will end up with nothing but failure
Those who are careless about their marriage and have no intention of making it a success will never have a successful marriage
The purpose of a marriage is not to discover the weaknesses in the other party; it is not to discover the other party's flaws
Each side will have all the opportunities he or she wants to find out the weaknesses of the other party during those fifty years
When God puts two persons together as husband and wife, His intention is that there be submission and love between the two
Even if one sees many problems, he should still try to move away from his own position to the other party's position
If one person likes to be quiet and the other person lowers his voice for this ones sake both have gone halfway and there is accommodation
Accommodation is needed not only in a few things or a dozen things but even in hundreds and thousands of things
If a husband does not know how to appreciate his wife or vice versa, he or she opens up a big gap in the family
We also know of cases involving the opposite circumstance in which everyone says that a certain sister is very good but her husband does not
In order to have a good family, the husband must know how to appreciate the wife, and the wife must know how to appreciate the husband
When you appreciate your husband or your wife, your family will become more united, and your relationship more solid
When two persons are together and manners are lacking, friction will arise and uncomfortable feelings will breed
In the family not only must our words be proper and polite, but even the way we dress has to be proper and tidy
If a husband and wife are polite to each other at home, they will at least be able to maintain a peaceful family
If you spoke in the office with the tone of voice you have at home, you would be chased out of your office in two days
Any tone of voice that is selfpitying selfloving or that gives the impression of a selfpronounced martyr must not be found in the family
Another point which needs much attention: Every married person should find out the things that the other person is most afraid of
If you do something which the other party cannot stand, yet have no feeling about it, you will end up having problems in your family
When these so-called small matters happen with such frequency that it exhausts a person's patience, major problems occur in the family
All of them replied that they were able to have a happy family life because they took his advice about not being selfish
She may think that everyone is for her happiness, and that when she found a husband, she actually found a slave
You may be a husband or a wife, but bear in mind one thing: Anybody in the world can be loved except one type of person-a jailer
For them to expect their wives to love them is like expecting a prisoner to love the prison warden; nothing can be more impossible than this
The husband does not have to give up all his freedom to the wife, nor does the wife have to give up all her freedom to her husband
If you expect your wife to give up all her freedom to you, this is the same as saying that you want her to fear or hate you
The tree of the knowledge of good and evil was not surrounded by the fiery sword of the cherubim from the beginning
For this reason, every husband should leave room for the wife, and every wife also should leave room for the husband
If you take away all freedom and make all the decisions, it is only natural that the other party will fear you
The husband must learn to give the wife some freedom, and the wife must learn to give the husband some freedom
Since both are adults and are children of God, they must learn to know what the other person's problem is, and where they differ
You must realize that when small matters are blown up, they are not blown up because of the matters themselves but because of history
The explosion may be ignited by small matters, but the underlying cause may have been an accumulation of grudges over the years
Problems surface today because they were not dealt with in a fair way in the first place, and patience ran out in the meantime
Let the wife tell her own husband about their own affairs, and let the husband tell his own wife about their affairs
Everyone else knows what they are thinking about, but they themselves do not know what each other is thinking about
Allow both to have the opportunity to speak to each other, and each should wait for the other to finish before he or she speaks
If they can follow this advice, the problem will be more or less settled by the time they pray together a second time
During the first few years of a marriage life, a family should have this type of meeting two or three times a year
The husband must seek the consent of the wife and vice versa before they can bring their dispute to the church
The two persons must have exhausted their means of handling the situation, and they now want the church to step in to help them
In order to settle family problems and to have a good family life, there is also the need of positive influence
Apart from the book of Proverbs, the Old Testament does not seem to give us much teaching concerning parenting
The Lord could do many things, but He did not do them because He did not want the disciples to misunderstand or be stumbled
Even after you have left this world, they will not forget what they have seen in you; the things you do will remain inside of them
You must set a standard for yourself in morality, in conduct at home, and in all moral judgments regarding right and wrong
You must set a high standard for what is ideal, and you must also set a standard for yourself in spiritual matters
Every parent must remember that his actions will be repeated in his children; his actions will not stop with him
When you do not have children, you can do whatever you like when you are happy and give up and forget about everything when you are unhappy
From that time forward, the Lord has committed a human being, with his entire spirit, soul, life, and future, into their hands
If we do not exercise self-control and give up our freedom, we will have a difficult time answering to our God in the future
Parents must not only realize their responsibility and sanctify themselves for the sake of their children; they must also walk with God
If the Lord Jesus sanctified Himself merely for the sake of His disciples, but was not holy in Himself, He would have been a total failure
In the same way, parents must sanctify themselves for their children, but they themselves must also walk with God
No matter how much zeal you show in your children's presence, they can easily see through you if you are not genuinely zealous
You must not only sanctify yourself before them for their sake but you must also be genuinely holy in yourself walking with God as Enoch did
Enoch begat not only Methuselah but also many other children; nevertheless, he walked with God for three hundred years
His responsibility as a parent did not hinder him from walking with God; rather, it caused him to walk with God
We must see that in order for us to bring our children to the Lord in a genuine way, we need to be a person who walks with God
Honestly speaking, the child's real mistake was only a deficiency in his technique of lying; he was caught lying
They play until the pastor is almost through with his sermon, and then they sneak into the building to hear a verse or two
They must be of one mind in sacrificing their own freedom for God's sake and in raising up a strict moral standard
Their children would ask the mother about things she agreed with, and they would ask the father about things he agreed with
If the mother came home and asked the children about their behavior, they would say, 'We have checked with Father'
If the father came home and asked the children about their behavior, they would say, 'We have checked with Mother'
As a result, their children had complete freedom by manipulating their way through their parents' inconsistencies
Today all of their sons have graduated from college, and some have gone overseas for further study, but none have believed in the Lord
If both are believers and they pull their children in different directions, they can expect nothing but trouble down the road
If you are the wife and your children ask for something, you first should answer, 'Have you checked with your father?
We should not pick up pagan concepts, and we should not assume that we have unlimited authority over our children
We are courteous and reasonable with our colleagues and are even more courteous and respectful to our superiors
Their superiors will fire them if they lose their temper with them, and their friends will despise them if they lose their temper with them
They think that there is only one place where they can lose their temper without suffering punishment-with their children
The problem with some parents is that they consider their children to be the rightful means for venting their anger
Since the children depend on him for their living, he overpowers them with his money by threatening to withdraw his support
He was forced to read the Bible when he was growing up at home, and he was forced to read the Bible when he went to a parochial school
On the day that he received his high school diploma, he took his three copies of the Bible and burned them in the backyard
If you have nothing for them except punishment and rebuke, they will become disheartened, according to Paul's word in Colossians 3:21
Since she felt that her mother did not approve of her, she decided that she would work especially hard one day to try to please her
The whole world speaks of the mistakes that children make, but the Lord spoke of the mistakes that parents make
The Bible tells us parents can indeed provoke their children to anger and dishearten them through their insensitivity
You should show your children that once you say something, they must carry it out whether or not you remember it
You have to show your children that your words are not uttered lightly and that once they are uttered, they have to be carried out
You must find an opportunity to tell your children that you exaggerated your words on that particular occasion
Sometimes you see only two cows but you say that there are three, or you see five birds but say that there are eight
If you love the world, your children will probably want to be the president, a millionaire, or a great academic
Show them that it is an honorable thing to die for the Lord, that it is a precious thing to be a martyr for the Lord
Many parents cultivate their children's pride and encourage them to go after vainglory by heaping praises upon them in front of other people
We do not want our children to become disheartened, but neither do we want them to be proud or to think that they are somebody
It is all right for them to be competitive; they want to win at ball games, track meets, and in their school work
We should train our children to acknowledge achievement in others, while they are still living at home with us
We must give them the opportunity to take care of their personal belongings, to manage their own shoes, socks, and other affairs
Paul's generation could be saved directly from the world, but the generation after Paul, men like Timothy, came in through their families
After the church preaches the gospel and saves men, it has to deal with all kinds of family problems associated with these men
Some families fail in their prayer and Bible-reading time because their family meetings are too long and too deep
If a child does not receive any loving nurturing as he grows up, he will become stubborn, individualistic, and rebellious
Many people cannot get along with others in their adult life because they did not experience love in the family as a child
Because they feel inferior in their heart, they try to boost their self-image by considering themselves better than others
Be happy to help them so that they will tell you when they encounter problems and seek your counsel when they are weak
We should be there whenever they need help, and we should be able to sit down with them and discuss problems with them
How dear and near your children are to you depends on how you treat them the first twenty years of their lives
If they are not near to you the first twenty years of their lives, they will not be near to you when they are thirty or forty years old
You must work to such an extent that your children will come and seek your advice first when they have problems
One can be forgiven for beating his own parents, yet he will not be easily forgiven for beating his own children
You must learn to be afraid of beating your own children and must consider it as serious as beating your own parents
Proverbs 13:24 says, 'He that spareth his rod hateth his son: / but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes'
When your children do something wrong and you beat them in your anger you should realize that you also should be beaten
While you are holding the cane in your hand you should ask the childs brother to fetch a pail of warm water and his sister to fetch a towel
It is true that we can save men from the world, but there is a greater need for raising up people from among Christian families
Being a friend to someone means loving and communicating with that one; this is the only relationship that counts in a friendship
Most persons can have between three and five blood relationships; those who have eight and ten such relationships are considered unusual
A new believer must be very clear that as soon as he becomes a Christian, he has to replace all of his friends
We do not have to treat the world as our enemy, but our deep friendship and our devotion to fellowship with it must be terminated
He knew that God wanted him to invite Peter, and he invited his relatives and intimate friends as well to listen to the gospel
A person becomes a friend by first becoming acquainted with another, then by loving him, and finally by socializing with him
These questions show us that believers and unbelievers are not compatible with one another and cannot be similarly yoked
Many brothers and sisters are pulled down by their friends because they have not dealt with the problem of friendships
After one becomes a Christian, he cannot develop strong friendship with unbelievers, because he is incompatible with them
