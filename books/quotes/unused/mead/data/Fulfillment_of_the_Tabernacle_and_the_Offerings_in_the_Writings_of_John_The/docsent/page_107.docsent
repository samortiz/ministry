   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE BASIC PROBLEMS OF FALLEN MANKIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter eight we have a case involving immorality; in chapter nine, the case of the blind man; in chapter ten, a further definition of the case in chapter nine; and in chapter eleven, the case of the death of Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these three cases we have the matters of sin, blindness, and death, the three main characteristics of fallen human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sin</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sin is one of the basic problems of fallen mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In chapter eight we have an instance of a particular act of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, in this chapter the Lord Jesus goes on to speak regarding the sin that dwells in our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 8:34 He says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This chapter reveals that the Son of God can set us free from the bondage of sin v. 36 . This bondage is not merely related to outward sins, to sins in our conduct, but it is related especially to inward sin, to the sin that dwells in our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul speaks very clearly about this indwelling sin in Romans chapter seven: "But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwells in me" v. 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Philippians 3:6 Paul could say of himself that "as to the righteousness which is in the law" he had "become blameless."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But in Romans 7:7 and 8a we see that Paul could not overcome the inward sin of coveting: "What shall we say then?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Is the law sin?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But I had not known sin except through the law; for I had not known coveting except the law had said, You shall not covet.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But sin, taking occasion through the commandment, wrought in me coveting of every kind."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul may have succeeded in keeping the first nine of the Ten Commandments, but he had no way to keep the last one, the commandment concerning coveting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul came to realize that within his fallen nature there is something called "sin."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Romans 7 he could say that this sin deceived him and killed him v. 11 , and that he himself was "sold under sin" v. 14 . Therefore, Paul could say, "For what I do, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>So now it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>15, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In chapter eight of the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus is actually dealing with indwelling sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some may claim that they do not commit sins outwardly, but who is without sin inwardly?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Apparently, in your outward behavior, you may not commit sins.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nevertheless, you have sin dwelling in your nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indwelling sin brings us into bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to be set free, delivered, from this bondage not by our own efforts but by the life-giving Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What we need is another life, a life that can overcome sin and also carry out God's purpose and do His will.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This life, the divine life, is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we need Christ to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we have Christ inwardly as our life, then we shall be set free from the bondage of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The revelation in John 8 is that the Lord sets us free from the bondage of sin through being life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Blindness</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Another basic problem of fallen mankind is blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Blindness issues in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we are blind, everything is in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The case of the blind man in John 9 is the case of a man blind from birth v. 1 , not the case of someone who became blind due to illness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Death</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As fallen people, from birth we all are sinful and blind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that we were born sinful and blind.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moreover, we were born dead.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From birth we have these three basic problems sin, blindness, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The gospel is preached not only to sinners who commit sins, but also to sinners who are sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In ourselves we are sin, for we were born sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We were born sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As we have seen, we were also born blind and dead; that is, we were born in darkness and in death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For this reason, in Ephesians 2:5 Paul says that God made us alive together with Christ, even when we were dead in offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because we were born sinful, blind, and dead, we need a gospel that can solve these problems.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need a gospel that can set us free from the bondage of sin and can give us sight.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By receiving sight through the gospel, we also receive marvelous light to see the things concerning God and our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We also need a gospel that can resurrect us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need not only to be healed we need to be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A salvation that frees us from sin, gives us sight and light, and resurrects us will usher us into God's dwelling place and bring us into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Eventually, in the Gospel of John we are brought into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are brought into the dwelling place of God.</S>
