[1]  CHAPTER ONE CHRIST BEING BOTH GOD AND MAN Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 3; 20:28; Rom 9:5; Titus 2:13; John 1:14; 19:5; Acts 7:56; 1 Tim 2:5; John 1:51 CHRIST BEING WONDERFUL AND RICH
[2]  Nevertheless, Christ, who is the effulgence of God s glory and the impress of God s substance, upholds all things by the word of His power Heb 1:3 .
[3]  The lower form of life is the plant life, a life without consciousness; a higher form of life is the animal life, a life with consciousness; and the highest form of life is the human life, a life with the highest consciousness and perception.
[4]  GOD BECOMING A MAN AND SHEDDING HIS BLOOD THROUGH DEATH TO BE OUR REDEEMER
[5]  According to the requirement of God s righteous law, man should perish.
[6]  In order to redeem man God Himself became a man to be our Redeemer.
[7]  He stood in the position of a sinner and died on the cross as our Substitute to suffer God s righteous judgment and be punished on our behalf by suffering the pain of death.
[8]  From these three verses we can see that the Lord Jesus was God, yet He became a man to shed human blood for us; He was the Lamb of God to take away our sin.
[9]  These antichrists were the Docetists, who denied that the Lord Jesus was God who became flesh to be a real man and who considered the body of the Lord Jesus to be not a real body of flesh and blood but a mere phantasm.
[10]  The Lord Jesus was crucified and suffered on the cross for six hours, from 9:00 A.M. to 3:00 P.M. In the first three hours He was persecuted and humiliated by men for doing God s will; in the last three hours after the noon hour, He was judged and punished by God to accomplish our redemption.
[11]  Christ s death is a matter of redemption, whereas Christ s life is a matter of salvation.
[12]  In order to save us in His life Christ must be the Spirit so that He can enter into us to be our life and everything.
[13]  The Bible tells us that this word which the Lord Jesus spoke was concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive, but at that time the Spirit was not yet, because the Lord Jesus had not yet been glorified v. 39 . After He entered into glory in His resurrection Luke 24:26 , He became the Spirit.
[14]  The Spirit is Christ who became the life-giving Spirit to come into us as our resurrection life to save us from the sinful nature within us.
[15]  Here it does not say the Spirit of God or the Holy Spirit; rather, it says the Spirit of Jesus Christ, referring to the Spirit of the incarnated and resurrected One, the life-giving Spirit.
[16]  God s full salvation includes the aspect of redemption through the precious blood and the aspect of salvation by the Spirit of life.
[17]  He shed His blood on the cross to deal with our outward sinful position before God, but He still needed to become the Spirit, even the life-giving Spirit, so that He could come into us to be our life and everything in order to save us daily from our fallen nature and the power of sin within.
[18]  The Lord Jesus said, The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life John 6:63 .
[19]  Of all the wonderful items of what the Lord is, the most wonderful one is that He is the life-giving Spirit who has come into us to be our life and to carry out salvation in us.
[20]  He has become the life-giving Spirit to come into us as the indwelling Christ.
[21]  However, after he believes in the Lord, even without hearing any message concerning God living in him or having anyone tell him about this, he realizes from his experience that at the time he confessed, repented, called upon the Lord Jesus, and received Him with his heart as his Savior, the Lord Jesus came into him and is living in him.
[22]  To be sure, when we repented, confessed, believed in the Lord Jesus, and called upon His name, we received the life-giving Spirit, who is God Himself living in us.
[23]  CHAPTER FOUR CHRIST BEING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Rom 8:9-10; Phil 1:19b; 2 Tim 4:22; Gal 5:25; Rom 8:4; John 7:38-39 THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT ENTERING INTO MAN
[24]  The Bible reveals to us first that God is both the eternal God and the God who created the universe and all the things therein.
[25]  Second, it shows us that this God who created everything became flesh; He was a perfect man.
[26]  Then in the New Testament, in the Gospels the Lord Jesus said that He is the bread of life, the manna that came down out of heaven, for us to eat.
[27]  In the Epistles it is still a matter of eating, and yet again in Revelation the Lord said, To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God....To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna Rev 2:7, 17 .
[28]  After Christ died on the cross and was buried, as a seed whose shell was broken, He released the divine life that was within Him, and He was changed into another form the Spirit, the life-giving Spirit.
[29]  John 1 says that in the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, the Word became flesh, and He was the Lamb of God on earth to be our Redeemer.
[30]  TO THE CHURCH AS THE NEW MAN Scripture Reading: Col 1:18; 3:4; 1 Cor 12:13; Col 3:9-11; Eph 4:12b-13 THE WONDERFUL BEING OF CHRIST
[31]  Christ is God who became a man and was crucified on the cross to die and shed His blood for us to be our Redeemer.
[32]  When He enters into us, we are regenerated with the life of God to become the children of God.
[33]  It is through God s becoming flesh, dying on the cross to shed His blood for the redemption of our sins, and entering into resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit to enter into us.
[34]  In order to produce the church, God in Christ passed through a long process.
[35]  This life-giving Spirit is the processed Triune God.
[36]  He is now waiting to enter into those who would believe in Him, for Him to be their life and everything that they, as a group of people with His life, may become the church, which is the Body of Christ to be the expression of God s fullness.
[37]  All who have been regenerated are placed on the line of the Spirit, the line of life.
[38]  We truly need to live our spiritual life by following the sense of the Spirit of life within because the answers to all our problems are in this Spirit.
[39]  When we turn to our spirit and stay on this line of life, not only will we not criticize, but rather we will pray for the elders and other brothers and sisters, and we will remember those members who are in need.
[40]  Our Christ is both God and man; He is the Redeemer and the Savior; He is life and resurrection; He is the life-giving Spirit; He is the Head of the church and the life to the church; and He is everything to the church as the new man.
