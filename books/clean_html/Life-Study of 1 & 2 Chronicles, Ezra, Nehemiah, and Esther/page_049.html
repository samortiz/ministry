THE REBUILDING OF THE WALL OF THE CITY<br />

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Neh. 1&mdash;7</h1>
<p>With this message we begin the life-study of Nehemiah.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. AN INTRODUCTORY WORD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Book of Nehemiah<br />
Being a History of the Rebuilding of the Wall<br />
of the City of Jerusalem</h2>
<p>The book of Ezra is a history of the return of Israel&rsquo;s captivity and the rebuilding of the house of God as the initiation of God&rsquo;s recovery among His elect for His testimony on the earth according to His economy. The book of Nehemiah is a history of the rebuilding of the wall of the city of Jerusalem as a continual recovery among His elect for His testimony for the accomplishment of His economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Writer</h2>
<p>The writer of this book was Nehemiah, whose name means &ldquo;comfort of Jehovah.&rdquo; He was the cupbearer to the king (1:11b). The whole book is a record of Nehemiah&rsquo;s trust in God for his comfort in the trials and attacks of his enemies.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Time</h2>
<p>The contents of this book cover a period of about twelve years, from 446-434 B.C.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Contents</h2>
<p>The contents of this book are the rebuilding of the wall of the city of Jerusalem, which was destroyed by the enemies of Israel, and the further recovery of Israel&rsquo;s services and worship to God. In these messages I will use the word <em>constitution</em> to include the two matters of services and worship. The services plus worship equal constitution.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Crucial Point</h2>
<p>The crucial point of the book of Nehemiah is that the city of Jerusalem was a safeguard and protection for the house of God, which was in the city. This signifies that the house of God as His dwelling and home on the earth needs His kingdom to be established as a realm to safeguard His interest on the earth for His administration, to carry out His economy. The rebuilding of the house of God typifies God&rsquo;s recovery of the degraded church, and the rebuilding of the wall of the city of Jerusalem typifies God&rsquo;s recovery of His kingdom. God&rsquo;s building of His house and His building of His kingdom go together (Matt 16:18-19). The house of God on the earth needs His kingdom to safeguard the house and to carry out His eternal economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Sections</h2>
<p>The book of Nehemiah has two sections: the rebuilding of the wall of the city of Jerusalem under Nehemiah (chs. 1&mdash;7) and the reconstitution of the nation of God&rsquo;s elect (chs. 8&mdash;13).</p>
