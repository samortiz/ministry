   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verses 25-34: The main subject is on not being anxious concerning food, drink, or clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The serving of mammon probably starts with the anxiety for food, drink, or clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Is not the life more than food, and the body than clothing?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This shows that believers should have noble thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Can God...?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is man's unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Anyone who asks "Can God...?" expresses his unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we have no faith in God, it will be very difficult for us to live our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All anxieties can be taken away only by believing in God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the Lord wants us to consider, He often uses questions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God created the heavens and the earth in the first five days, and then on the sixth day He created man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God had first prepared everything that man needed, yet man still thinks as though he was created on the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 27: "Who among you by being anxious can add one cubit to his stature?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the third question that the Lord raised.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In other words, since anxiety is useless, then why be anxious?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If there is a remedy, there is no need to be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If there is no remedy, it is useless to be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verses 26 and 27 cover the matter of food and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We easily see the birds if we lift up our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, the Lord said, "Look...."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verses 28-30 speak about the matter of clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Lilies are not common.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, the Lord said, "Consider well...."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Oh, how careful the Lord was!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The lilies mentioned here are probably colorful.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From the phrase "you of little faith" we can see that this was spoken to the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Mr. George M ller's whole life of trusting God was based on these two great promises concerning the birds and the lilies.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His exercise of faith is a characteristic needed for this age.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 31: "Therefore do not be anxious."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"Therefore" is used here once more.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a summary.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The reason the Lord used the illustrations of the birds and of the lilies is to forbid us from being anxious and not to forbid us from working.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the Lord said to behold the birds and to consider the lilies, He was not asking us to imitate them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord said through Paul, "If anyone does not want to work, neither should he eat" 2 Thes 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To "sow" and to "reap" v. 26 is the work of men, whereas to "toil" and "spin thread" v. 28 is the work of women.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 32: "For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"Your heavenly Father knows" indicates that this is spoken to believers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God provides us only what we need.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God will not provide us what we demand or what we ourselves would like to have.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 33: "But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What is the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On one hand, the kingdom refers to a spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, the Bible says, "The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit" Rom 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the other hand, the kingdom refers to the ruling in the millennium Luke 19:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One is the present spiritual living, and the other is the future reward.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The present spiritual condition of the believers enables them to reign in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The emphasis of the " kingdom" here is the future.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The "righteousness" here can only be obtained by seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus we see that this is neither the justification by faith nor the righteousness of God mentioned in Romans 3.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Rather, this is the righteousness in Matthew 5 7, the righteousness that surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, the righteousness mentioned in 6:1.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Righteousness specifically refers to the conduct described in Matthew 5 7.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The phrase "seek...His kingdom" emphasizes not only the present spiritual condition but even more the future reward.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"Added" means that you already have something, and other things are added to what you already have.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Since you seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness, you obtain the kingdom of God and His righteousness; in addition, you have food, drink, and clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To one who has nothing, something is "given"; to one who already has something, more things are "added."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Verse 34: "Therefore do not be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself; sufficient for the day is its own evil."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This shows that the Lord did not ordain believers to have a life of ease and comfort.</S>
