<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages released by Witness Lee in August 1953 in service meetings in Taipei. The book consists of twenty-three chapters: Chapters 1 through 7 emphasize the matter of knowing life; chapters 8 through 14 emphasize knowing the church; chapters 15 through 20 emphasize basic knowledge of the service; and chapters 21 through 23 are words of leading in relation to work and service in all the churches. The messages have been translated from the original Chinese.</p>
