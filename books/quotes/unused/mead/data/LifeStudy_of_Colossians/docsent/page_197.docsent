   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST AS ALL THINGS AND IN ALL MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 3:11 Paul goes on to say, Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to this verse, in the renewing of the new man there is no room for any natural man no room for Greek or Jew, for religious or unreligious, for cultured or uncultured.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the renewing of the new man, Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Greek the first all is neuter gender and denotes things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the second all is masculine gender and denotes persons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, in the renewing of the new man, Christ is all things, and He is in all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This indicates that in the renewing of the new man, Christ truly is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the one hand, He is in all the persons, the members of the new man; on the other hand, He is all things in the renewing of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Perhaps you are wondering what are all the things in the renewing of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At least, all things must include all virtues and attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Love, patience, and humility are all excellent virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All these virtues are Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the renewing of the new man, Christ is all the wonderful virtues, all the good things, and all the positive attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>REALIZING THE LIFE OF THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How can we, the New Testament believers, realize the life of the universal new man in a practical way?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Among those Christians who set their mind on the things on earth, there is no renewing of the new man and no possibility of having the life of the new man in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But when we set our mind on the things above, spontaneously the new man grows and is renewed within us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This causes our whole being to be renewed and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then wherever we may be, we can have the practice of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Recently I heard of a young brother in the Navy who visited a number of churches in the Far East.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He enjoyed good fellowship with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be sure, this brother experienced the life of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although he was from the United States, he could be merged in the spirit of fellowship with so many saints from the Orient.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are not willing to set our minds on the things above and thus do not open the way for the new man to increase within us, it will be very difficult for us to experience the life of the new man in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if we set our mind on the things above, the new man will spread from our spirit into our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then no matter where we may be with the saints, we shall realize the life of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Colossians is definitely a book on the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, in this book Paul also speaks of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The practical life of the new man comes out of the revelation of Christ and the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we have the revelation of Christ with the adequate experience of Christ, the new man will appear among us in a practical way, and we shall realize the life of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God s goal is to have this one new man, which ultimately will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, the New Jerusalem will be the final consummation of the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we are in the New Jerusalem, we shall enjoy the life of the universal one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today we may have a foretaste of this enjoyment by setting our mind on the things above and giving a free way for the new man in our spirit to spread into our whole being.</S>
