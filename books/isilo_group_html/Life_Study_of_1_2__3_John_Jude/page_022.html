We walk in the light, but God is in the light because He is light. &ldquo;The light is the element in which God dwells (cf. 1 Tim. 6:16)....this walking in the light, as He is in the light, is no mere imitation of God,...but is an identity in the essential element of our daily walk with the essential element of God&rsquo;s eternal being: not imitation, but coincidence and identity of the very atmosphere of life&rdquo; (Alford).</p><p>When we walk and live in the light of God, we have jointly the co-enjoyment of the Triune God and the co-participation in His divine purpose. The fellowship of the divine life brings us the divine light, and the divine light keeps us in the fellowship, that is, in the joint enjoyment of God and joint participation in His purpose.</p><p>In verse 6 John speaks of walking in darkness. To walk habitually in the darkness is to live, behave, and have one&rsquo;s being in the nature of Satan&rsquo;s evil works. According to 2:11, to walk in the darkness equals to practice sin (3:4, 8).</p><p>To walk in the divine light is not merely to dwell in this light; it is to live, move, act, do things, and have our being in the divine light, the light which is actually God Himself. When we dwell, live, and have our being in God, we walk in the divine light, which is the expression of God.</p><p>When the divine light shines, we see all the different truths, and these truths are realities. But when we do not have the divine light but are rather in darkness, we have the sense that everything is vanity and emptiness. I would ask you to consider your experience. When you are in the divine light, you can see the truth, the reality. For example, when you are in the light, God is a reality to you, and the divine life is also a reality. Furthermore, God&rsquo;s holiness, love, and grace are all realities to you. When we walk in the light, we see one reality after another. However, when we are in darkness, nothing is real to us. On the contrary, everything is empty, vain. When we are in darkness, we do not have any reality because we do not see anything. Instead of the sense of reality, we have the sense of emptiness and vanity.</p><p>When we dwell in God, we are in the fellowship. When we are in this fellowship, we are in light. Then as we walk in the light, Christ, the Spirit, the church, the Body, and the members of the Body are all real to us. We may testify and say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord that I see Christ, the Spirit, the church, the Body, and the ground of the church! How wonderful! All this is real to me.&rdquo;</p><p>However, suppose a sister is offended by an elder. Although the elder had no intention of offending her, nonetheless something he said offended her because she is sensitive. Perhaps the elder said that all the sisters, no matter what their background may be, are fragile. This word offended the sister, and she said to herself, &ldquo;I love the Lord very much, and I also love the church and am for the church. Why does this elder say that the sisters are fragile?&rdquo; Because she is offended, the &ldquo;switch&rdquo; is turned off, and immediately she is in darkness. As a result, instead of enjoying the church life, she begins to be unhappy with the church. The church is no longer real to her, and she no longer cares about the church ground. She may say, &ldquo;What is the church anyway? And what is the church ground? I don&rsquo;t care about the ground of the church.&rdquo; If she stays in darkness, she will eventually find that Christ, the Spirit, and the divine life are no longer real to her in her experience. She may say, &ldquo;What is Christ? He is far away in the heavens. What is eternal life? This life doesn&rsquo;t mean much to me.&rdquo; This is an illustration of the fact that whenever we are in darkness, all the divine things become vain and empty to us.</p><p>Suppose after a period of time the sister who has been offended and is in darkness repents. The Lord is merciful and for no apparent reason, she turns to the Lord and says, &ldquo;O Lord, forgive me.&rdquo; Immediately, the &ldquo;switch&rdquo; is turned on, and the light begins to shine again. Then this sister will experience the cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood, and the divine things will become real once more.</p><p>Has this not been your experience? I can testify that I have experienced this a number of times. I know what it is to suffer from the &ldquo;disease&rdquo; of being in darkness and of being recovered to the fellowship in the divine life. From experience I know that when we are in the light, the divine things are real to us, but when we are in darkness, these things are not real to us.</p><p>If we would be in the divine fellowship, we need to abide in God as light, and we need to walk in the divine light. The divine light is versus the satanic darkness. The real issue here is not a question of right or wrong; it is a question of light or darkness. You do not need to consider whether what an elder says is right or wrong, but consider whether you are in light or in darkness. If you are in darkness, this indicates that you are out of the divine fellowship.</p><p>Light is the expression of God, and darkness is the expression of Satan. If we say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for the church, and Christ is far away in the heavens&mdash;He is not in me,&rdquo; we are speaking lies, and these lies are the expression of satanic darkness. In order to have the broken fellowship recovered, we must condemn darkness. We may think that we are right. But if we are in darkness, we need to confess and say, &ldquo;Lord, why am I in darkness? There must be something wrong with me. Lord, even though I don&rsquo;t realize in what way I am wrong, I know that I am wrong because I am in darkness. Lord, I ask You to forgive me and cleanse me.&rdquo; If we do this, light will come to us. I speak of this from my own experience. A number of times I realized that I was in darkness, although I did not know in what way I was wrong. Therefore, I went to the Lord and told Him that I was in darkness. As a result, the light began to shine again.</p><p>Darkness may be compared to a stop sign on a street corner. Darkness is a sign that we are wrong in some way. Even if we do not know what is wrong, because we have the sign of darkness within us, we need to confess our situation to the Lord and say, &ldquo;Lord, please forgive me. Although I do not know where I am wrong, I still ask You to forgive me. Lord, I sense darkness within me. I am completely surrounded with darkness, and I cannot bear it. Lord, because I am in darkness, I ask You to forgive me and cleanse me with Your precious blood.&rdquo; If you confess to the Lord in this way, light will come. Then the light will show you in what matter you are wrong. If you confess that matter to the Lord, you will receive more light. This is the way to keep ourselves in God. This is also the way to recover and restore the broken fellowship. If we take this way, we shall maintain a proper fellowship in the divine light.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1, 2, & 3 John, Jude &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
