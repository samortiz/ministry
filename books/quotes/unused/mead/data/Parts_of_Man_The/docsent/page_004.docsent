   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE THREE WORLDS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because man is of three different parts, he is able to contact three different worlds.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First of all, there is the physical world with so many material things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We contact the physical world by our physical body through the five senses of hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then there is the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Is it possible for us to contact the spiritual world by the five senses of the body?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Of course not.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The spiritual world can only be contacted by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In our spirit we have a spiritual sense by which we can sense God and spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is also a psychological world which is neither physical nor spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Suppose someone gives you a gift and you are very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Does this happiness belong to the physical or to the spiritual world?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Neither.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Experiences such as happiness, joy, and even sorrow, belong to the psychological world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The English word "psychological" comes from the root of the Greek word that means "soul."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, the psychological world is of the soul, in which are the things pertaining to the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Man has been created in three parts in order to contact the three different worlds: the physical, the spiritual, and the psychological.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>CONTACTING THE SPIRIT BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As man was made by God in three parts to contact the three different worlds respectively, so we must use the corresponding part of our being to contact each one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To contact the things of the physical world, we must use the body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To contact the things of the psychological world, we must use the soul, the psychological part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we would contact the things of the spiritual world, we must use our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can only touch the things of a certain world with a certain organ of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The substance of everything requires the proper organ to substantiate it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you would substantiate sound, you must exercise your ears, the hearing organ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For color, you need your eyes, the seeing organ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you exercise your ears to listen to color, you cannot substantiate it, for you are using the wrong organ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To taste food, you must use your tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Each substance must be substantiated with the proper organ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What kind of substance is God?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John 4:24 tells us that God is Spirit ASV, margin .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Can we contact God by our physical body?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the wrong organ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Can we contact God by the psychological organ, the soul?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is also the wrong organ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can only contact God by our spirit, because God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John 4:24 not only tells us that "God is Spirit," but also that "they that worship Him must worship in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a very important verse, in which are covered two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first is the divine Spirit, God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The second is our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since God is Spirit, we must worship Him in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We cannot worship Him in our body or in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since God is Spirit, we must worship Him, contact Him, and fellowship with Him in our spirit and by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE TWO SPIRITS MINGLED AS ONE</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>John 3:6 says, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The two spirits are here mentioned again.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are related to our being born again.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To be born again is to have our spirit regenerated by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That which is born of the Spirit, the Spirit of God, is spirit, our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are not born again in our body or in our soul, but in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Spirit of God comes into our spirit and regenerates us in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then He dwells in our spirit and mingles Himself with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Romans 8:16 says, "The Spirit the Spirit of God Himself beareth witness with our spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Here are the two spirits again the Holy Spirit of God bearing witness with our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This proves that God's Spirit is in our spirit, and these two spirits are working together.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, "He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These two spirits are mingled together as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are one with the Lord in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is why it is difficult to distinguish in many New Testament verses whether the Holy Spirit of God or our human spirit is referred to.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>These two spirits are mingled together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is exceedingly vital.</S>
