   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-TWO WATCH AND BE SOBER Scripture Reading: Matt 22:23-29; 1 Thes 5:6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Sadducees who did not believe in resurrection came to the Lord Jesus one day and asked, "Teacher, Moses said, If anyone dies and does not have children, his brother as next of kin shall marry his wife and raise up seed to his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now there were seven brothers with us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And the first married and died, and having no seed, he left his wife to his brother; likewise also the second and the third until the seventh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And last of all the woman died.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be of the seven?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For they all had her" Matt 22:24-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we had been confronted with such a problem, we would surely have thought that this was a rare and strange question.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There were seven brothers who married the same woman and had no children, and they all died one after the other.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a very hypothetical question.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Sadducees were trying to catch Jesus with this question and disprove resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the Bible shows us that even if there had been such a case, it would not have put Jesus into a corner.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our Lord Jesus struck them with His opening remark: "You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Jesus said that they erred!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Sadducees erred!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They erred in their view!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They erred in their question!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why would they even think of such a strange thing and come up with such an absurd question through their own cleverness?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why would they not believe in resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why had they erred?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus pointed out clearly that they erred because they did not know the Scriptures nor the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brothers and sisters, we are not focusing on the interpretation of this passage.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, we want to extract an important principle from this portion of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although this passage is on the error of the Sadducees, it also points out the proper attitude of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although a Christian has believed in the Lord, it is still possible for him to err.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He can still err, and worse still, he can err without realizing it because he does not know the Scriptures and does not know the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brothers and sisters, in order to go on properly in the spiritual pathway, serve well in the Lord's work, and satisfy God's heart in the way we handle our affairs in the church, in expounding the Bible, or in our daily life, and in order to keep from falling into error, we must know the Scriptures and the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second Timothy 3:16-17 tells us, "All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We cannot find a good Christian who has a desire to please the Lord but who does not know God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's speaking to man today is based on what He has spoken in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible has clearly unveiled God's will, desire, pleasure, and displeasure to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Psalm 119:105 says, "Your word is a lamp to my feet/And a light for my path."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In order to avoid getting lost and stumbling on the spiritual pathway, we need light.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word of God is a lamp to our feet and a light for our path.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we want to go on in the spiritual pathway and not fall into error, we have to follow the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Another verse in the same psalm says, "In my heart I have treasured up Your word/That I might not sin against You" v. 11 . If we want to be one who does not sin against the Lord, we have to let His word dwell in our heart richly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If God's children would spend time to study the Bible, taking it as their unique guidepost and fearing the word of God, they would not fall into grave errors.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today we have not only the Holy Bible but also the Holy Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the New Testament age, God has put His law within us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This law is the law of the Spirit of life in Romans 8:2; it is also the anointing in 1 John 2:27.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This anointing teaches us all things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we do not quench the Spirit and if we learn to obey the teaching of the anointing within us, we will not fall into error.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's children err in the spiritual pathway because they do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the past, some have emphasized the matter of miracles and works of wonders exclusively.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They publicize these miracles and works of wonders, and many people are attracted by these things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are others who always talk about visions and dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They relate their visions and dreams to others, teaching others these things and assuming the role of a great prophet or great apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sometimes they may even have supernatural powers and point out the hidden things in man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They may attract many immature believers who follow them and inquire of them like great prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Still others pray in a strange way, repeating one sentence over and over again, and praying this way hundreds of times.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some even claim that the Lord Jesus has come the second time already or that He will come on a certain date of a certain year.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Brothers and sisters, if we search the Scriptures carefully, we will learn the questionable nature of these practices.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the following sections we will consider these practices.</S>
