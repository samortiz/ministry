   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All of the full-time trainees are being killed every day.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To eat food and stay in dormitories against their choice is a killing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Under God's divine and sovereign arrangement, our entire environment is a killing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the things in our environment are like knives to kill us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The wives, the husbands, the children, the brothers, and everything in our environment are used by the Lord as knives to kill us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is difficult to say whether we are enjoying the Lord or suffering in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes we are in the "day" enjoying the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At other times, our spiritual day is unclear with very little shining.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then there are times when it seems that we are suffering in the night.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But we need to realize that the earth cannot exist without night.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The earth can only exist with days and nights.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the Bible, there is first the evening and then the morning Gen 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible starts from the night, but we start from the day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may think that the Christian life is always a pleasant, happy life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But this happy life does not exist by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the Christian life were merely a happy life, the apostle Paul would not have needed to charge us to rejoice Phil 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>While we are suffering and wiping away our tears, we should rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to weep, we do not need any kind of encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul does not charge us to weep in the Lord, but he does charge us to rejoice in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not exercise our spirit to rejoice in the midst of our killing environment, we cannot have any joy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God in His sovereignty is putting us all the time under the killing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The apostle Paul was under the killing of the cross, and so are we.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not experience as much suffering and persecution as he did, but we are still under this killing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is God's divine arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In marriage life, both the husband and the wife experience being killed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I encourage all the young people to get married.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To frustrate people from being married is a teaching of demons 1 Tim 4:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Marriage life, however, is a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A sister can be a very good wife, yet she is also a killing factor to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The husbands are also the killing factors to the wives.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When a person is single, he is still somewhat free, but when a person gets married, he enters into a cage.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In marriage life, our freedom is taken away, and we suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The killing of the cross, the killing of Christ's death, ushers in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we are willing to suffer and be killed, we live Christ, we magnify Christ, and Christ is manifested in us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we are transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We enjoy Christ under the killing of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I see many of the saints smiling, and their smiling is the manifestation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are smiling while they are under the killing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the other hand, we Christians, at least to a certain extent, are hypocrites.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A hypocrite is an actor with a false appearance, and this false appearance is a mask.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may wear a mask before others, but that mask is not the real person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many times we are not so genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead, we are pretending.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we are under the killing of Christ's death, Christ as the genuine One needs to be manifested in us.</S>
