<h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL PROGRESS HAVING NOTHING<br />TO DO WITH FLESHLY POWER AND WISDOM</h2><p>Some have asked: "Why is it that some advance so quickly while others advance so slowly? Why is it that some even do not advance at all?" The difference does not lie in their background or in what each one originally had. The difference lies in whether or not a man has exercised faith to receive Christ. The more a man believes, the more he advances. The less a man believes, the less he advances. This is the same as saying that a man will have eternal life if he believes, and that he will perish if he does not believe. There is no difference between being "good" material or "bad" material. A man who is evil by nature is the same kind of material after he is saved as any other person. His degree of advancement depends strictly on the amount of his faith, consecration, and obedience. Everything depends on Christ, not on our natural goodness or shortcomings. Natural goodness and shortcomings do not hinder us or help us in any way. Hallelujah! Before the Lord, everything that is from ourselves is useless. May the Lord break us and show us that everything that originates from the self is useless.</p><h2 class="head1">"APART FROM ME YOU CAN DO NOTHING"</h2><p>I love John 15:5 which says, "Apart from Me you can do nothing." Prior to 1927, I did not believe this verse. I had read the Gospel of John over one hundred times, and I had read chapter fifteen perhaps over two hundred times. Every time I came to the words "apart from Me you can do nothing," I could not believe it. I thought that I could still do so many things apart from the Lord, and I even experienced His blessings in doing these things. How could I say that apart from Him I could do nothing? When I read this in 1926, I prayed, "Lord, I cannot believe this verse, because I can still do many things without You." At that time I was very good at preaching and drew considerable attention to myself; many people were saved. I could say, "Apart from You I can do a lot!" One day the Lord showed me that apart from Him everything I did was sin. To be able to do nothing apart from Him means that I cannot do what the Lord wants me to do. I may be able to do something apart from Him, but what I can do is not what He wants.</p><p>On that day the scales fell off from my eyes. I saw that we can only trust in the Lord for the accomplishment of spiritual works and all that He wants us to do. Apart from Him, we can only do things that we want to do, not the things that God wants us to do. They are not God's work. From that day forward, I began to learn to trust in the Lord in everything. Although I still trust in myself many times, I feel ashamed whenever I do. That was a big turning point in my life. I saw that all of God's work is in Christ, and that apart from Him, anything that I did was sin. Apart from Christ, all works are sin. Anything that originates from the flesh is empowered and energized by the flesh, and God hates the power of the flesh.</p><p>Those who are serving the Lord and working for Him must ask what it is that we judge and condemn today. Do we only judge and condemn common sins? Have we judged our wisdom and power? Have we judged the good part of our flesh? All those who have judged their flesh will no longer be proud of themselves. A man who has judged his flesh will feel ashamed when he is proud. Once our flesh is judged, all the glory will go to God and not to us. It will not be related to us any longer. This is the way to serve the Lord.</p>
