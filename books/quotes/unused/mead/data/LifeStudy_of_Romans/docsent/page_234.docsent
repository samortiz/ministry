   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WALKING ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must believe God s word and not consider our situation or look at ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 8:4 says fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we read these words, we may say, Most of the time I walk according to flesh, not according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If someone asked you if you are walking according to spirit or according to flesh, you probably would not have the boldness to say that you walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In your realization, you do not have sufficient ground to say with confidence, I walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Instead, after hesitating you would probably reply, Sometimes I walk according to spirit, but most of the time I walk according to flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With respect to the matter of walking according to spirit, we need to remember that there are two worlds, two realms, the physical realm and the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the spiritual realm God does everything by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once God speaks a certain thing, the matter is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 4:17 we are told that God calls things not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that by speaking He calls things into being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, according to Genesis 1:3, God said, Let there be light, and there was light.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>SPEAKING IN FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As children of God, we need to realize that when we speak something out of a sincere heart, our situation will be according to our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose someone asks you if you have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You should answer definitely, Yes, I am saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You should not hesitate and say, Let me think about this for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to certain evidences, maybe I am saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you say that you may be saved, then perhaps you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But if you say that signs indicate that you may not be saved, then perhaps there may be some question.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now that we are children of God, we should be careful of our speaking, for we are what we say we are.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In a previous message I pointed out that we are what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now I wish to point out that we are what we say.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible refers to the believers as saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Are you a saint?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you consider this question and say, Well, I m not a saint like Theresa or Francis.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I really don t think I m very holy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How can I say that I am a saint?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you talk like this, your condition is still that of a pitiful sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if you answer by declaring, Yes, I am a saint! then you are truly a saint.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must learn to speak not in our natural sincerity, but in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul tells us that we speak because we have a spirit of faith: And having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, therefore I spoke; we also believe, therefore also we speak 2 Cor 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We Christians are good at hesitating, doubting, considering, and thinking matters over again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Suppose someone asks you if you love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You may be very slow to give an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You may ponder the question, not wanting to say anything that is not according to what you really are.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You may think that you are being careful and humble.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually you are being deceived by the enemy and cheated by him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In faith, we need to declare with boldness that we love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Concerning being in the spirit and receiving the Spirit, many of us have been wrongly educated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some teach that in order for a Christian to receive the Spirit, he must repent, confess his sins, and pray with fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then, after a period of time, he will suddenly receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because of the influence from our religious background, we may hesitate to answer when someone asks us if we have received the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we have been properly instructed in spiritual things, we shall be able to respond immediately, Yes, I have received the Holy Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THREE QUESTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At this point I would like to ask three questions.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First, do you walk according to spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Second, are you according to spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Third, are you in spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To walk according to spirit is to do things according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But to be according to spirit means that our being is according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In addition to walking according to the spirit and being according to the spirit, we need to be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do you have the confidence to say that you walk according to spirit, that you are according to spirit, and that you are in spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do you not sometimes lose your temper?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How, then, can you say that you are in spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How can you claim to walk according to spirit and to be according to spirit when you are still troubled by your temper?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The way to answer such questions is to say, Yes, I am in the spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, when I lost my temper, I made a temporary mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But immediately I repented and received God s forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, I still have the boldness to declare that I am in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In 8:4 Paul speaks of walking according to spirit, and in verse 5, of being according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In order to walk according to spirit, we must first be according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This means that walking according to spirit issues from being according to spirit, for what we do always comes out of what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In verse 9 Paul speaks of being in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A person who is according to spirit is a person who is in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Being according to spirit is a result of being in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, walking according to spirit comes out of being according to spirit, and being according to spirit comes out of being in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This indicates that our basic need is to be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we are not in spirit, we cannot be according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Furthermore, if we are not according to spirit, we cannot walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Once we are in spirit, we shall be according to spirit, and once we are according to spirit, we shall walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>My burden in this message is not on walking according to spirit or simply on being according to spirit; it is on being in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The little word in is very meaningful and significant.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To repeat, we walk according to spirit because we are according to spirit, and we are according to spirit because we are in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We all should be able to testify, I walk according to spirit because I am according to spirit, and I am according to spirit because I am in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Wherever we are and whatever we do, we should be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we remain in the spirit, we shall not lose our temper, and we certainly shall not lie.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Oh, it is a great matter to be in the spirit!</S>
