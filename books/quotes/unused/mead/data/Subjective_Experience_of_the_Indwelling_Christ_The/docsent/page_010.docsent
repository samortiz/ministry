   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You are the all-sufficient Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>May You give us a sentence, or even just a few words, to meet each one's need.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE LORD JESUS AS THE COMFORTER OUTSIDE HIS DISCIPLES WHILE HE WAS ON EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In John 14:16 the Lord Jesus said, "I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Greek word for Comforter is difficult to translate because it is a very particular word; its anglicized form is paraclete.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The word refers to one who is called to your side to wait on you, to take care of you, and to bear all your responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you are sick, he is both the doctor and the nurse to take care of you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you have a legal case, he is the lawyer to help you handle the case and go to court to represent you in the lawsuit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moreover, if you encounter any problem in your daily life, he is your counselor.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He can solve your problem, and you can pour out your heart to him and enjoy his kind protection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This Greek word implies a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First John 2:1 says, "We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This Advocate is our Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Greek word for Advocate is the same as that for Comforter; the two titles refer to the same One.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Originally, the Lord Jesus was God over all and the Creator of the universe Rom 9:5; John 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One day He humbled Himself to become a man by being conceived and born of a virgin in a manger.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He lived in the despised city of Nazareth and grew up in a poor carpenter's home.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When He was thirty years old, He went out to preach the word, heal the sick, cast out demons, perform signs and wonders, and teach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was with His disciples for three and a half years and was very thoughtful of them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He knew their problems and was able to meet all their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Parents love their children, yet often they are unable to render any help to their children when their children have problems.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord Jesus, however, was not only kind and thoughtful but also omniscient and omnipotent.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He lived, walked, ate, and drank with His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He solved all their problems and ministered to all their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was not only their Doctor and Nurse but also their Lawyer and Counselor.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was truly their Comforter.</S>
