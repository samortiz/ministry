   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BRINGING THE CHURCH INTO THE PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE BIBLICAL WAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To try to bring the church into the practice of the biblical way too quickly will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I spent three years in Taipei to help the church there make the transition into the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>During this time they maintained the Lord's Day morning message meeting because the saints had to be adequately prepared to meet in another way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Time was needed to bring them up to the proper standard.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I used the illustration of some people who need to be brought down from the fifth floor of a building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You cannot ask them to jump down.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If they do, they will die.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You have to do something to help them walk down from the fifth floor to the first floor.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to gradually and positively bring the saints into the God-ordained way of meeting, with all speaking in mutuality, for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brother Nee spoke twice concerning the church meetings in mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One portion is in The Normal Christian Church Life see chapter nine, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>191-218 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The messages in this book were first given in 1937.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The other portion concerning the God-ordained way to meet is in Church Affairs see chapter four, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>67-90 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The messages in this book were given in 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Church Affairs there are three crucial points concerning the Lord's Day morning message meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first is that the Lord's Day morning message meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening is according to "the customs of the nations."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is referred to in the Old Testament and includes idol worship 2 Kings 17:8 NASB .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second, Brother Nee said that this kind of meeting was altogether a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Third, he said that such a meeting was not worthwhile to maintain.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brother Nee saw this many years ago, and I was there when he released this word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He told us that this way of meeting was a very strong habit which was hard to remove.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He said that we all had to push together until this unscriptural way was pushed aside.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He pointed out, though, that it is difficult to get something to replace the Lord's Day morning message meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This may be likened to endeavoring to change from an old way of cooking to a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If no one knows how to cook in the new way, the old way of cooking cannot be stopped suddenly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then everyone will starve.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this reason, I did not agree that we would completely stop the Lord's Day morning message meeting in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We did this when the saints were prepared for it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am sharing this to help us realize that we should not take the God-ordained way so easily and so fast.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we mean business with the Lord for His recovery, we have to remember that the God-ordained way to meet is a crucial item which has not yet been recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Corinthians 14:26 says, "What then, brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Let all things be done for building up."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Where can we see that this verse has been fulfilled?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even with the Brethren, a century ago, this was not fully recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Where can we see the fulfillment of Hebrews 10:25, which says, "Not abandoning our own assembling together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more as you see the day drawing near"?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These two verses are the Lord's words in His holy revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Matthew 24:35 the Lord said, "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whatever the Lord has spoken, sooner or later, will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have the full assurance that the Lord's words in 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25 will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If He does not do it in our time, He will do it in the future.</S>
