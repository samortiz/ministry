In the places where you will spread the work, as soon as you contact people and open your mouth, Christ will come out

Most Christians not only confuse the heart with the spirit, but also make no distinction between the spirit and the soul
It is clearly spoken in Hebrews 4:12 that the word of God is living, piercing even to the dividing of the soul and the spirit
Our spirit today is not only the highest part of man, but it is also that part which the Spirit of God has enlivened
The Spirit of God is the heavenly electric current, conducted through us and remaining in us, even becoming one spirit with our spirit

The shepherding in the small group meetings does not necessarily follow the sequence of the Life Lessons or the Truth Lessons
Rather, it is according to our experience after salvation in how we meet the Lord and how in everything we are led by the Lord
