   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE LOSING THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nearly all Christian teachers have isolated Matthew 16:21-28 from verses 16 through 19 of the same chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They have regarded verses 16 through 19 as a section concerning Christ, the church, and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To my knowledge, no one has connected these verses to the following verses.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because of this, many have been veiled from seeing the fact that verses 21 through 28 disclose the way to build the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Years ago we saw the revelation concerning Christ and the church and the prophecy that Christ would build His church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, until recently, we did not see the way to build the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verses 21 through 26 we have the keys to realize the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The practical and definite way for the church to be built up among us is found in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE THREE KEYS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In these verses we have not only the death and resurrection of Christ, but also three keys that we need to exercise: the denial of the self, the bearing of the cross, and the losing of the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we use these three keys, we are immediately and spontaneously on the way to the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the past we did not have the definite and practical way to build the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But now we have seen the three keys.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to deny the self, take up the cross, and lose the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As we have pointed out, to take up the cross is not a matter of suffering, but of accepting the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is to accept the church and every believer as God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every believer in Christ is God s will for you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, the church is the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, both the church and all the believers are a cross to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to take up this cross and bear it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the foregoing messages we have considered the first two keys.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this message we shall consider the third key.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE SOUL AND THE SOUL-LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 25 says, For whoever desires to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This verse begins with the word For, indicating that it is an explanation of the previous verses.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Greek word rendered soul-life or life KJV is psuche, the word for soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although it is correct to render this word as soul-life, it can also be rendered soul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, this translation is preferable here.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rendered this way, verse 25 speaks of the saving and the losing of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is a difference between the soul and the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The soul is our natural being, whereas the soul-life is our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These two are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE SOUL AND THE SELF</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Luke 9:25 says, For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This verse does not speak of the soul or the soul-life, but the self.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When this verse is compared with Matthew 16:26, we see that the soul is the self and that the self is the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, there is still a difference between the soul and the self.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to the context of Matthew 16, the self in verse 24 is the embodiment and expression of the soul in verse 25.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moreover, the expression of the self is mainly through the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For this reason, verse 23 speaks of setting the mind on the things of men, not on the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, in verses 23, 24, and 25 respectively we have the mind, the self, and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The soul is embodied in the self, and the self is expressed through the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In verse 25 the word soul indicates enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you consider the context of verses 25 through 27, you will see that the Lord is speaking about the enjoyment of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To save the soul is to allow the soul to have its enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, the self is the expression of the soul, and the soul itself is the enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To lose the soul means to lose the enjoyment of the soul, and to gain the soul means to have the enjoyment of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>SOULISH ENJOYMENT</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As tripartite men, we have three kinds of enjoyment: physical enjoyment, spiritual enjoyment, and psychological enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Physical enjoyment includes the enjoyment of fine food and of a pleasant place to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Spiritual enjoyment includes the enjoyment of God s presence, God s blessing, God s speaking, and God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Between the physical enjoyment and the spiritual enjoyment there is the psychological enjoyment, which includes things such as the enjoyment of sweet music, the satisfaction of being praised by others, and the pleasure of being with our intimate friends.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Which of these three types of enjoyment do you think is the highest?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to the New Testament, both the physical enjoyment and the spiritual enjoyment are for the soulish enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The reason for this is that God did not create man as a body or as a spirit, but as a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Matthew 11:29 the Lord Jesus said that if we would take His yoke upon us and learn of Him, we would find rest to our souls.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This kind of rest, however, needs to be supported by the rest of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If our spirit does not rest in the Lord, our soul cannot be at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Soulish rest needs to be supported by spiritual rest.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Those who attend nightclubs may be satisfied in a fleshly, soulish way, but they do not have the support of spiritual satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Because they lack this support, their fleshly and sinful satisfaction is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, the rest we enjoy in our soul is lasting because it has the support of the rest in the spirit, the support of spiritual satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The highest enjoyment is neither the physical nor the spiritual, but the soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The physical enjoyment is for the soulish enjoyment, and the spiritual enjoyment supports the soulish enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As human beings, we all seek enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There is no one on earth who does not seek it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even children desire enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The children s enjoyment is mainly in their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Soulish enjoyment dominates their actions and behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The behavior of children is genuine because with them there is no performing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But as we grow up, our behavior ceases to be genuine because we learn to perform.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Genuine enjoyment is soulish enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, what the Lord was talking about in Matthew 16 was the soulish enjoyment.</S>
