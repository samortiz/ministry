   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OTHER CONDITIONS DURING THE JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Woe to you, Chorazin!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Woe to you, Bethsaida!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For if the works of power which took place in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But I say to you, It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And you, Capernaum, who have been exalted to heaven, to Hades you will be brought down.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For if the works of power which took place in you had taken place in Sodom, it would have remained until today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you" Matt 11:21-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Friends, please listen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The more you hear the gospel the better it is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before the judgment seat in the future, you will have that much less to say.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If today you still commit sins, live for the world, seek your own pleasures, and consider sinning as your career, I beg you to consider the question of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You will not live forever, and you will not be exempted from judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Judgment is as sure and definite as death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I told the people in Shanghai that they would become like Tyre and Sidon in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Tyre and Sidon were once very flourishing, but today they are just places for laying nets.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because they were filled with sins and evil, God sent fire and brimstone to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah completely.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Two years ago, an American archaeologist went to Sodom to search for historical evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He saw that the whole land was filled with traces of sulphur.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>O Shanghai, what Tyre and Sidon went through was easier than what Shanghai will have to go through during the judgment days.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What Sodom experienced was easier than what Shanghai will have to face.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before the Lord was born, God's Son had not died to bear our sins, and man did not know about sin and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They could still have an excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But you have heard that God's Son has died for you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you do not resolve the problem of your sins today, I would shed all my tears for you!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we who preach the gospel had enough tears, we would shed them all for you!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The future judgment will be extremely serious.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The world will pass away, and you will pass away; all the worldly pleasures will also pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the judgment will not pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>HOW TO ESCAPE JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have to say something regarding the way for man to escape judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To escape judgment, we must first ask why we will be judged in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because every man has sinned, every man must be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you can escape sins, you can also escape judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"Judgment" in the original text is the same word as "righteousness" and "condemnation."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we come across "judgment," we can change it to "condemnation."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For instance, to read "after this comes judgment" Heb 9:27 is the same as "after this comes condemnation."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sin is a matter that no one can escape.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If man had not sinned, we could tear down this meeting hall because we would not need it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I could also change my job.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am not preaching here because I have no other way to support my living.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I could give up being a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I could burn up this Bible, and I could have the boldness to do all kinds of things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But sin is real, and it is a solid fact that we need a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I know that there is a Son of God who bore my sins, and I know that there is a Son of God who shed His blood to redeem me from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I know that once the problem of sin is solved, the problem of judgment will also be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is a way, and there is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What way did God use to save us from sins?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have sins, and sins deserve judgment and hell.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, God's Word tells us that God's Son has died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God's Son has died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"God's Son"!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This term is sweet to my mouth, finer than music to my ears, and poetic to my inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God's Son has come and died for me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God's Son has borne my sins and received the punishment for sins on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, I am saved, and I am now free.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>My purpose is not to bring you tidings of woe by telling you that you will die and receive judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I have shown you judgment first to make you aware of your need; you need a sin-bearing Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Let me tell you a story: during the Civil War in the United States of America, there were two brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>One lived in the North, and the other lived in the South.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They both were drafted into the army.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The South lost, and many soldiers were taken as prisoners by the North.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The one who guarded the captives was the older brother.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He found out that his younger brother was among the prisoners.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He dared not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At night, he took off his clothes and let his younger brother wear them to escape for his life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>At that time the prisoners were to be executed the following morning.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He put on his younger brother's clothes and became a prisoner for him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The next morning, the older brother was executed by a firing squad.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Later someone discovered that the dead one was not the right person.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They still could try to catch the younger brother.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But according to the law, they had to let the younger brother go because his brother had died for him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>No person can die twice.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Oh!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is but a very small example of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Please do not misunderstand my words.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Do not think that the Lord Jesus came to serve society, preach universal love and equality, and become a model for mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I have read through the New Testament at least one hundred times and have never found such a teaching in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is not the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>These are tidings of woe that come from the devil and hell.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Bible tells us that Jesus came in order to be judged for us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We deserved death, but Jesus died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Lord Jesus said on the cross, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Matt 27:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God had no choice but to leave Him there because He bore our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He came from the heavens to make a way for us to go to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He departed from God and came to this world so that we could draw nigh to God.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He suffered poverty so that we could become rich.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He came to this earth so that we could be free from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He came to bear sins so that we could be free from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He was judged for us so that every one of us who believes in Him could be exempted from judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Friends, when you hear the gospel, you always hear about the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The word cross means nothing other than the fact that the Lord Jesus has borne our judgment and suffered punishment for us.</S>
