   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ACCEPTING GOD'S VALUATION CONCERNING US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why did God crucify Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>My intention is not to give a sermon this afternoon but to have a talk with you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is something that concerns all of us; it is not just something for me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every one of us should consider this carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why did God want to crucify us with the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I can illustrate this point with a story.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A robber was found guilty before a judge.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since the crime was not too serious, he was sentenced to only ten years of imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Another robber was also found guilty and was told by the judge that he would be executed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why was one executed while the other was only imprisoned for ten years?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There was still hope for the one who was to be imprisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The judge still had hope in him, and the nation still had hope in him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There was still the possibility that this man would become a good citizen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After he was imprisoned for ten years, he would be released.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the nation had no hope in the other robber; he had committed too serious a crime.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The nation had no need of such a person, and the only way to deal with him was to execute him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How does God see us today?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God has crucified us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why did He do this?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This may not be a complimentary word, but it is the truth: God has no further hope in us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He has lost all of His hope in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God considers us as being hopeless and impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The flesh is corrupt to the uttermost, and there is no other way for it except death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The work of the Lord Jesus does not change our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's power cannot change our flesh, and the Holy Spirit cannot change our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Reading the Bible and prayer cannot change our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is no hope, and the flesh can never change.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God considers death as the rightful destiny of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God has lost hope in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, He included us in the crucifixion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no hope with us; the only solution is death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As a consequence, the first thing that God requires from a Christian after he is saved is baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Baptism is a declaration that God has given up hope in a person and has crucified him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is also our declaration that we deserve to die and that we ask others to move us out of the way and bury us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Have we seen that baptism is God's declaration and our acknowledgement of our death?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is saying "amen" to God's valuation of us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God says that we deserve to die, and we take a further step by burying ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have lost hope in myself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is absolutely no hope in me any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I deserve only to die, and I am standing on the ground of death today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many Christians have forgotten what they did at the time of baptism, and many have forgotten God's valuation of us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What is God's valuation?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His valuation is that we should die.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We only deserve to die.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no other way to take.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is useless to try to repair or mend.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is no possibility of progress, and we cannot change ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are completely useless, and there is nothing we can do except die.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Consequently, God included us in the death of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>His putting us on the cross is an indication of His valuation of us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Please remember that the cross is God's appraisal of us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God has shown us that we only deserve to die and that there is no hope with us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But do we accept this fact?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Human beings are often self-contradicting, and they often have contradicting thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the one hand, we have been saying for years that we are crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But on the other hand, we are still full of hope for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the one hand, we feel that we are not able, yet on the other hand, we hope that we can become able.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We keep stumbling and failing, yet we still hope to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I once saw a picture of a woman who put the coffin of her dead husband in front of her door for thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>She would not allow anyone to bury her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>She said that her husband was only sleeping, and she was waiting for him to resurrect.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have the same hope concerning ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the one hand, we believe that we deserve only to die and that we are dead in transgressions already.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But on the other hand, we think that as long as there is a breath in our mouth, we can still be of some use.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We think that we have failed because we have not been strong enough in our determination and that we will overcome if we do better the next time.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We think that we have failed because we are not watchful and that we will be able to stand up to temptation if we are watchful the next time.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We think that we have failed because we have not rejected temptation and that we will overcome if we reject the temptation the next time.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We think that we have failed this time because we have not prayed enough and that we will overcome if we pray enough the next time.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Have we seen what we are doing?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God has crucified us on the cross and told us that we are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But we have not seen that we are dead; we have not acknowledged that we are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We keep hoping that the flame that has been extinguished will flicker again if we give it enough fanning.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is why we are still fanning all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>What does it mean to be crucified with Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In order to experience this truth, there is one necessary condition which we must fulfill on our part.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We must say to God, "You have lost hope in me, and I also have lost hope in myself.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You consider me as being hopeless, and I also consider myself as being hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You think that I deserve to die, and I also think that I deserve to die.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You consider me as being powerless, and I also consider myself as being powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You consider me as being useless in doing anything, and I also consider myself as being useless in doing anything."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We have to stand on this ground all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is the meaning of being crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>What God has done can never be overturned; they are accomplished facts.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But on our side, we have a responsibility that we must fulfill, which is accepting God's valuation of us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>God has lost hope in us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We also have to lose hope in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Whenever we lose hope in ourselves, we will see that "it is no longer I."</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The trouble today is that most Christians have refused to open their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>They have not seen that God has lost hope in them and given up all demands on them.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He considers us as being absolutely useless.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I am not afraid of offending Brother Lu here.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I can declare this in front of everyone: "Brother Lu is an absolutely useless person."</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is putting it in a polite way.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Putting it in a less polite way, I would say, "Brother Lu, you are corrupt to the core; you are utterly wicked."</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But thank the Lord, I can say this not only about Brother Lu but also about myself.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We are all corrupt to the core.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We are absolutely useless.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We are not useful for anything except death.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The only way for us to take is to die.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We can never change, and there is no hope in us.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We are utterly wicked, and we deserve only to die.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This is God's valuation, and we should not have any other kind of valuation before God.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We have many concepts about ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We are full of hope for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Therefore, we have to see in this message how we can appropriate the reality of the fact that we have been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>God has given up hope in us, but what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We should tell God that we also have given up hope in ourselves, and we have to go one step further.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>For now we will put aside Galatians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Let us now look at Luke 18:18-27.</S>
