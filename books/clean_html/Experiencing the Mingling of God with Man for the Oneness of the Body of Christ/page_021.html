<h2 class="head1">BEING TRANSFORMED<br />
BY THE RENEWING OF THE MIND</h2>
<p>We need to be transformed by the renewing of our mind (Rom. 12:2). Christ is now in our spirit, but He may not have much ground, room, or place in the other parts of our being, especially our mind. Our mind is the most important part of our inward being, because our daily life and our entire being are under the control of our mind. Sometimes it may seem that we are under the direction of our emotions, but it is actually our mind that directs our lives and our being. Thus, we must be transformed by the renewing of our mind so that we may be conformed to the image of Christ.</p>
<p>How can we be renewed in our mind? The Lord told us that anyone who wants to follow Him must deny himself (Matt. 16:24). The self is the natural life, and the most important aspect of the natural life, the self, is the mind (v. 23). Thus, to deny the self is primarily to deny the mind. If we are going to follow the Lord, we must deny our mind and the way we think. We may illustrate this matter in the following way. Recently I was traveling with an American brother who had an American mentality. After some time I began to think that, according to my traditional Chinese mentality, this brother was too modern. We went through some difficult times together, but eventually we realized that we should follow the Lord not by the modern American mind or the traditional Chinese mind but in and according to the spirit. If we are in our mind, we will not get along with one another, because in our natural mind we are individualistic and absolutely different from one another. However, there is no obligation for us to be subject to our mind. We can deny the soul-life and reject the natural mind by standing on the ground that we have been crucified on the cross (Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20). At the same time, we should exercise our regenerated spirit. If we deal with every situation in the spirit, the Lord will have the ground to subdue our natural mind, take control of our whole being, and fill our mind with Himself. In this way, our mind will be renewed.</p>
<p>One day I was very unhappy with a brother. The more I thought about him, the more I was displeased with him. However, at that moment I turned from my mind to my spirit and contacted the Lord in my spirit, saying, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me for my thoughts about that brother.&rdquo; I denied my natural mind, gave up all my thoughts regarding that brother, and followed the Lord in my spirit. As a result, the Lord refreshed and strengthened me, and we were able to be together in the spirit. In this way the Lord occupied more of my mind. If we want to please the Lord and take Him as our life, we must learn the lesson of denying our mind in our daily life. Instead of being Christians who live in and according to the mind, we should turn from the mind to the spirit. We should not give any ground in our mind to the enemy; instead, we should let the Lord take over our mind and all the inward parts of our being. This is the only way for our mind to be renewed. By the renewing of the mind, our whole being will be transformed into the image of Christ.</p>
<p>In order for our mind to be renewed, we must also turn our heart away from everything else to the Lord. When we were regenerated, we received not only a new spirit with which to contact the Lord but also a new heart with which we can love God. Because of this, every Christian, whether he is newly saved or has been a believer for many years, has a longing to love the Lord. We must daily renew our love for the Lord. The enemy will often accuse us by injecting thoughts into our mind, saying, &ldquo;How can a person like you love the Lord? You are too young and too weak!&rdquo; We must deny and reject these thoughts, turn our heart to the Lord, and exercise our spirit to contact Him. Then the Lord will have the ground to expand Himself into all the parts of our being. This is the way to have our mind renewed and be transformed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUTTING OFF THE OLD MAN<br />
AND PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>We need to realize that the Lord is the Spirit, that we have a spirit, that this spirit was renewed at the time of our regeneration, and that the Lord Spirit is now living within our renewed spirit (2 Cor. 3:17; Job 32:8; Ezek. 36:26; 2 Tim. 4:22). We need to learn to deny the self and to turn from our mind to our spirit, from the outer man to the inner man. This is the reality of the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man in Ephesians 4:22-24. The way to put off the old man is by denying the self, and the way to put on the new man is by exercising the spirit. This is the way for our mind to be renewed and for our whole being to be transformed. In this way we are delivered from our old manner of living and transferred into the new man. When we are in the spirit, we are truly mingled with the Lord and are in the new man in a practical way. In the entire universe there is only one new man, and we are parts and members of that new man (Eph. 2:15; Col. 3:10-11). When we are in the new man, we are in the Body and have the oneness.</p>
<p>The way to realize the mingling of God with man and the oneness of the Body is first by regeneration and then by transformation. We have been regenerated, but we are still in the process of transformation. If we have been stopped or frustrated in this process, we must deal with all the frustrations and be transformed by the renewing of our mind so that the Lord may be formed in us and so that we may be conformed to the image of the Lord. Then we will be transferred from the old man into the new man and will be practically in the Body.</p>
