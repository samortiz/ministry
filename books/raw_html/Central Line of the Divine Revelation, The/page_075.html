<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>W. As the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus,<br>Directing the Move of the Ministers<br>of Christ through the Inward Guidance<br>by the Divine Dispensing</H2><P>The all-inclusive Spirit as the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus directs the move of the ministers of Christ through the inward guidance by the divine dispensing (Acts 16:6-10). In Acts 16 Paul and his co-workers were traveling in Asia Minor. They wanted to turn toward Asia, but they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit (v. 6); then they attempted to go to Bithynia, but they were prohibited by the Spirit of Jesus (v. 7). Eventually, they stopped, and in the night Paul had a vision concerning a Macedonian man who entreated the brothers to come over to help them. Paul and his co-workers concluded that God had called them to bring the good news into Macedonia (vv. 9-10). They crossed the Aegean Sea and entered into eastern Europe and into the major city of that region, Philippi (vv. 11-12).</P><P>Paul and his co-workers had both the outward guidance and the inward guidance. The dream in which the Macedonian man said, "Come over into Macedonia and help us" was the outward guidance. The inward guidance came as they considered the dream and concluded that God had called them to announce the good news to the Macedonians. This inward guidance was through the Spirit by the divine dispensing. Through the leading of the Spirit, Paul and his co-workers received some amount of dispensing. This was their inward guidance.</P><P>Today we must take this as our pattern. Often the co-workers come to me and say, "Brother Lee, I have received an invitation to go to a certain place. Should I go or not?" Usually, I do not say whether or not they should go. I simply tell them to pray. When I say this, my consideration is that they should receive a "Macedonian call." Once they receive the call, following Paul's pattern, they need to consider. This consideration is inward in the human spirit with the divine Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>X. As the Renewing Spirit,<br>Transforming Us with All the Attributes<br>of Christ into the Glorious Image<br>of the Resurrected and Glorified Christ</H2><P>As the renewing Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit transforms us with the attributes of Christ into the glorious image of the resurrected and glorified Christ that we may bear His image for His glory (2 Cor. 3:17-18; Rom. 12:2a). The attributes of Christ include many items, such as His humility, His patience, and His kindness. When they are expressed outwardly, these items are Christ's virtues, but within Christ, they are His attributes.</P>
