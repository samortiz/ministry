   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE ELEVEN THE MINISTERS OF THE NEW COVENANT 4 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:16-18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to the last three verses of chapter four, verses 16 through 18.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These verses are still related to the living of a crucified life for the manifestation of the resurrection life by the excellent power of the treasure in the earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapters three and four we see that first the apostles were constituted of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That constitution was everything in relation to their life and behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every aspect of their living and behavior was based on this constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, this constitution afforded them the life supply with the power, strength, riches, wisdom, and even the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They ministered with what had been constituted into them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The apostles did not preach something which they had merely heard or had been taught.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What they ministered was not something that had only been revealed in a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What they preached, taught, and ministered was altogether what had been constituted into them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The apostles were constituted in a certain way, having become constituted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, what they ministered was their constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They ministered what they were, what they had become.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that their reconstituted being became their ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul s writings are very different from today s Christian writings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul s writings are a record of his constitution, whereas today s writings are mainly concerned with theology, doctrines, teachings, expositions, and interpretations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Among the fourteen Epistles written by Paul, chapters three and four of 2 Corinthians are the richest as far as his personal experience of Christ is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In these chapters we have an accurate and precious record of Paul s spiritual constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we would know what kind of person Paul was as a minister of the new covenant, we need to spend much time in these two chapters, chapters which reveal Paul s spiritual constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because ministry requires constitution, Brother Nee told us that we could receive a gift immediately, but we could never have a ministry in a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It takes years to become constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This involves growth into maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everything related to this constitution is organic and of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This life is by the Spirit, the ultimate consummation of the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul was a person constituted of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not sufficient to speak of him as a God-man, for he was actually a person constituted of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, Paul s ministry was his being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What he preached and taught was what he was.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He ministered his very being to others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As Paul ministered in this way, Christ was imparted into others, for Paul and Christ had become one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul was one with Christ and had been constituted of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His ministry was a ministry of the Christ who had been constituted into his being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without this kind of ministry, there is no way to have the church adequately built up or to have the bride properly adorned.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible indicates that what God initiated at the beginning will be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moreover, God is a God of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the God of resurrection, His purpose cannot fail, and He Himself cannot be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, all frustrations and distractions prove His unchangeableness, prove that He is the unchanging God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What He has determined, He will accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What He set out to do at the beginning, He will fulfill at the end. In the New Testament God began with a group of ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul was among them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At the end God will also have a group of the same kind of ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here and there around the world, He must have ministers of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>My burden is that many among us will become ministers of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I hope that these messages on the ministry and the ministers of the new covenant will remain with you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I hope especially that the leading ones, the co-workers, and all those who have a heart for the Lord s recovery will aspire to be today s new covenant ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to have a heart not only to love the Lord in a general way, but also to become ministers of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we have such a heart, we must be serious with the Lord and dwell on these two chapters of 2 Corinthians, praying over them, having fellowship concerning them, and telling the Lord that we are willing to open ourselves for His working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to tell Him that we are willing to be broken, ground, and constituted; that we are willing to live a crucified life; that we are willing to renounce ourselves and deny ourselves and be constituted daily with the elements of the processed Triune God; that we are willing to be today s Paul, not a great person or a famous believer, but a small man, a crucified man, even a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Jesus of Nazareth did not seek to be great or famous.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the contrary, He was a grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this way Jesus became the first minister of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to follow Him also to become ministers of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Concerning this, we must look to the Lord and pray desperately to Him.</S>
