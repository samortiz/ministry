   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Using the Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Recovery Version and</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>to Study the New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since life in the United States is simpler and there is more time, we can have meetings every day.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But how should we have meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How should we use our time?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is my point.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I encourage you all to labor in the most holy faith to prepare yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You need to spend time to research the book of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At present we have already expounded the whole New Testament book by book.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This exposition is a collection of the church s biblical knowledge over the past two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have collected all the gems, and we have printed them in simple language.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you want to understand the book of Matthew and desire to know what is contained in this book, I encourage you to buy a copy of the Recovery Version of Matthew and read it every day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I also encourage you to read the footnotes and the Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In a relatively short time you can finish the reading, and you can grasp the main points.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By digesting these main points, you will be able to study the entire book of Matthew within three months.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I once encouraged those among us who just graduated from college not to pursue their careers immediately but to spend the first two years full-time in the church life and to get into the study of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At present, there is already such a group of full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There may be nearly one hundred of them in Taipei alone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For four hours every morning they study the New Testament with the footnotes and the Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I told them that if they would continue for four years, they would finish the whole New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not think that four years is a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Four years is just the twinkling of an eye.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Of course, I do not expect all of you to do this, but in principle, you all need to accept this exhortation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you cannot finish in four years, you can do it in twelve years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not think that you need to study the whole New Testament consecutively from the first book to the last.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You may first study these seven books: Romans, John, Hebrews, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As long as you are persistent and do not stop, you can finish these books in one year.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Gospel of John concerns the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The book of Romans is an outline of the Christian life and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians are the heart of the New Testament truths.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The book of Hebrews points us to the present Christ who is in the heavens and who is our daily salvation and moment by moment supply.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you study these seven books thoroughly, you will then have something in you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After this, I recommend the first book of the New Testament, Matthew, the last book, Revelation, and one in between, the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This makes a total of ten books.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you thoroughly study these ten books, I assure you that you will have something to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You will definitely have something to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You cannot help but speak.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If I ask you to speak the Lord s word, it may be difficult for you now because within you there is a shortage of vocabulary and utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But after you have thoroughly studied these ten books, you will be full of words and you will speak.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this way the problem of your speechlessness will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In addition, you must get into the truths of the Bible topic by topic.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For example, what is repentance, faith, remission of sins, justification, reconciliation, sanctification, transformation, and conformation?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These are all truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Two years ago I suggested that the brothers arrange all the biblical truths topic by topic into lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Last year many local churches began to have junior and senior high school truth trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Two weeks ago I went to Berkeley, California for a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I stayed at the home of a brother who has a thirteen year-old son.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On Saturday his son went to the University of California at Berkeley and contacted eleven people who were all adults.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He said that out of the eleven, seven refused but four received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He told us what he was preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He said, I told them that man is created by God as a vessel to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After hearing this, I felt that he was excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, another brother s daughter who is sixteen years old also went to the college campus to speak to others, saying, Man is created by God as a vessel, and God wants to put Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I was amazed at the younger generation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Later I found out that they had just finished this lesson in the church s truth training summer school this year.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Since they had just graduated, they all spoke on this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Two years ago I mentioned in Texas that it is not adequate merely to concentrate on the inspiration of the Spirit, to create an atmosphere, and to give a message during the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This has no educational value.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our meetings and our messages must be educational.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To be educational is to follow an educational system to teach the students.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All the things that must be learned in an educational system should be compiled into lesson books.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Beginning with kindergarten, and then advancing to first grade, second grade, and so forth, the children should be taught grade by grade.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After the sixth grade, they will graduate, and then they will attend junior and senior high school.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After six more years, they will graduate again and will be qualified for college.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this way, what they have learned will be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Without a consistent educational system, it is not possible to properly educate the students merely by teaching them a little this year and a little next year.</S>
