   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN DOES GOD EXIST?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading: Rom 1:19-20</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christianity occupies an important position in human history because of its great impact and many adherents.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Consequently, it is worthwhile to study the matters of the Christian faith related to believing in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are several important matters in the Christian faith, such as God, man, and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we are clear about these matters, we will have a basic understanding of the Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is a pity that many people lack a proper understanding of these important matters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>GOD</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first matter related to the Christian faith is God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some say that there is a God, and others say that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is even a Chinese gospel hymn entitled, You Say There Is No God, but I Say There Is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who have God are joyful, but those who do not have God are miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who say that God exists are strengthened when they speak of His existence, but those who say that God does not exist feel empty when they deny His existence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Another hymn entitled There Is a God says, Listen to the voice of your conscience; / If you say there is no God, / You go against your conscience!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>/ Listen to the voice of your conscience; / How can there be no God?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The last stanza firmly declares, There is a God!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is a God!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yes, there is a God!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the most important matter related to believing in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>People may say that it is useless to speak of God in the twentieth century with so many advances in science.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, the first great matter related to believing in Christ involves the question of the existence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no way to understand the Christian faith if this point is overlooked.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>IS THERE A GOD?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When people ask about the existence of God, some strongly say that God exists, and others strongly say that there is no such thing as God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather than answering yes or no so assertively, others lack a willingness to say yes but are equally unwilling to say no. Those who fall into this in-between category are afraid to say no because God may exist; however, they also are reluctant to say yes because they do not want to waste their time if He does not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, they sit on the fence, unable to make a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even though many people are not clear about the existence of God, this matter has a great impact on our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who believe that God exists live a certain kind of human life, whereas those who assume that there is no God live a different kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As human beings, we need to be clear about this question in order to be clear about our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The number of people who believe that there is a God is about equal to the number of people who believe that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those who think that there is no God often despise those who believe in His existence, regarding them as superstitious and overly assertive in their beliefs.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, those who deny the existence of God are just as superstitious and are overly assertive because they have no way to prove their denial.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who do not believe in God always ask those who believe to give them some proof of His existence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since believing in God is not a matter of superstition, we can certainly provide some arguments for His existence.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, before we offer any argument for the existence of God, we should ask those who do not believe about their proof that He does not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should ask, What is your basis for saying that there is no God?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You should provide evidence for your belief that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Often their strongest proof is nothing more than a declaration that God does not exist because no one has ever seen God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They regard their inability to see God as some kind of scientific proof.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But basing one s belief on only what can be seen is truly a matter of superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we regard everything that cannot be seen as being non-existent, there are many things whose existence we would have to deny.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For example, the universe is so big that we cannot fully observe, describe, and understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Likewise, should we deny the existence of microorganisms or oxygen simply because we cannot see these things?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Is it logical for a blind person to say that there is no such thing as color in this world?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Should a deaf person say there is no such thing as sound in the universe?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is not reasonable to deny the existence of something that cannot be seen or heard.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>ARGUMENTS FOR GOD S EXISTENCE The Vastness of the Universe</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The surface area of the earth is nearly 200,000,000 square miles, whereas human beings are only around six feet tall.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Man is tiny compared to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even the distance between the earth and the sun is slight in comparison to the distance between our solar system and other stars.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The distance between stars in the universe is measured in terms of light-years.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Light travels at approximately 186,000 miles per second.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we multiply 186,000 miles by the number of seconds in one year, then the distance associated with one light-year is slightly less than 5,865,700,000,000 miles.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The shortest distance between the sun in our solar system and another star in the sky is approximately 4.24 light-years.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If this is the shortest distance, the distance to faraway stars is almost incomprehensible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If it is difficult to understand the vastness of the universe, one should not quickly assume that his determination of the non-existence of God is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The mystery of God is much greater than the vastness of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Consequently, it is amazing that people would dare to conclude that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Their denial of God s existence is too bold.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even though the universe is vast and we see so little, some people are willing to boldly assert that there is no God merely based on what they see.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is not reasonable.</S>
