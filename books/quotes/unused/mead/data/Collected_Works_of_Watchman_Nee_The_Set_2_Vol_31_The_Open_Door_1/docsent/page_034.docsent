   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Greetings to my beloved Brother X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Please forgive me in the Lord for my sin of laziness in not communicating with you for so long.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since the beginning of the war, the heart of the people in Shaohsing has been fearful, and the inhabitants of the city have fled.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the brothers and sisters in the Lord have been preserved by the Lord Himself and are at peace without concern.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some have fled to the countryside, while others are still in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord's Day meeting continues as usual.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Siao-Shan had several hundred shots fired at it, and at least two hundred people are dead or wounded.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, the Lord's children are preserved and not hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These are perilous days, but I deeply believe that He will preserve His own beloved children and bring us safely through.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At that time we heard that Da-Chang had been lost and that Jia-Shing was in trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We were afraid that the Nanking-Hangchow Rail would be closed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The brothers hurriedly went back to San-Chiao-Bu, and I have not heard from them since.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I am really concerned about them!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do you have any news about where they are?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I still have one of Brother Chou's suitcases in my home, with two letters to him from Brother Chang of Chungking and Brother Hsu of Wu-Yi.</S>
