   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Mindful of these two aspects, let us consider once again the scene in chapter twenty of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that, according to chapter fourteen, Christ is the first Comforter and the Spirit is another Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But according to chapter twenty, this second Comforter is actually the breath of the first Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 22 says that the Lord breathed into His disciples and told them to receive the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He did not breathe on them and say, "Receive another Comforter."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here the breath is not called another Comforter; rather, the Lord's breath is called the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, in John 20 the Holy Spirit is the breath of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since a person's breath is not another person, how, then, can the Holy Spirit, as the breath of Christ, be another person, a person different from Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This kind of question poses a problem to traditional theology.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some who read this word concerning the Spirit as another Comforter and the Spirit as Christ's breath may ask, "Don't you believe that Christ and the Spirit are distinct?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Don't you believe that Christ and the Spirit are two?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yes, I believe that, as viewed from one aspect, the outward, objective aspect, Christ and the Spirit are two.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, as viewed from another aspect, the inward, subjective aspect, the Spirit, the second Comforter, is the breath of Christ, the first Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, from the perspective of the inward aspect, Christ and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now we need to go on to see that if we have only the outward aspect of the Spirit, the aspect of the Spirit as another Comforter revealed in chapter fourteen, but not the inward aspect, the Spirit as Christ's breath revealed in chapter twenty, we shall not be able to experience the Spirit as another Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, we shall know the Spirit as another Comforter merely in doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What we have in chapter fourteen is the doctrine concerning another Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In that chapter we do not yet have the experience of this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to experience the Spirit as another Comforter, as the Spirit of reality, we need the inward aspect of the Spirit, the aspect of the Spirit as the breath of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we have the Spirit as Christ's breath, then we can experience the Spirit as another Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some may say, "Praise the Lord, the Holy Spirit is the second Comforter!"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, they may have only a doctrine, not any enjoyment or experience of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, breathing Him in as the life-giving Spirit, we enjoy the holy breath, and this breath is actually the Spirit as another Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How we are comforted when we call, "O Lord Jesus"!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How much we enjoy this Comforter by calling on the Lord's name!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we call on the Lord, the second Comforter becomes the breath for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord breathed out this Comforter, and we breathe Him in. This is spiritual breathing, spiritual exhaling and inhaling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through the Lord's exhaling and our inhaling we enjoy His breath, and this breath is the second Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>OUTWARD FACTS AND INWARD EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we do not enjoy the Lord's invisible presence, we shall not be ready to enjoy His visible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Likewise, if we do not have inward experience, we shall not be able to share in the outward facts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This principle applies not only to the truth concerning the Spirit, but applies to all biblical truths.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Of course, we must first have the outward fact.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we must turn this fact into inward experience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the outward turns to the inward, it will become practical, experiential, and enjoyable.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although the inward aspect is invisible, it is very real.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Applying this to the Spirit, in chapter fourteen we have the fact, the doctrine, of the second Comforter, and in chapter twenty we have the enjoyment, the experience, of this Comforter as Christ's breath.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In chapter twenty-one we have something even more than simply the experience and enjoyment of the Comforter: we have the practical living by the Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do you know who this Comforter is in actuality?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Comforter is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In chapter twenty-one, the Lord who manifested Himself to the disciples is the real Comforter as the breath who dwells in the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, it was necessary for the disciples to learn how to live by this indwelling Comforter in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our experience today should be the same as that of the disciples in chapters twenty and twenty-one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We not only have an outward Christ, but we also have an inward Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have the pneumatic Christ dwelling within us for our practical, daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Just as the disciples were trained in John 21, we also need to learn how to live by this indwelling pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May we all be helped by the view presented in chapter twenty-one of the Gospel of John to have a practical Christian living by this wonderful pneumatic Christ.</S>
