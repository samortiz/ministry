   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Paul made this very clear in 1 Corinthians 7:1-9: "Now concerning the things of which you wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But because of fornication, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let the husband render to his wife that which is due, and likewise also the wife to the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; and likewise the husband also does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do not deprive each other, except by agreement for a time that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and then be together again, that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But this I say by way of concession, not by way of command.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yet I wish all men to be even as I am myself; but each has his own gift from God, one in this way, the other in that.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, It is good for them if they remain even as I am.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn with desire."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This passage shows us that one reason for marriage is to prevent fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the same time, it points out that God has given some the special gift of remaining single.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But it is better for those who have not received this gift to marry in order to avoid falling into fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not go at length into the subject of virginity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We know that Paul was a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet he told Timothy that in later times teachings of deceiving spirits would come and forbid marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He said that this is a teaching of demons 1 Tim 4:1, 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the one hand, we believe that it is a good thing to remain single.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the other hand, we have to maintain the balance in God's Word; we cannot say that marriage is something unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must be clear that marriage is holy; it is something that God has ordained in His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The forbidding of marriage is a teaching of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a worker of the Lord is married, he should do his best to settle his family matters in such a way that he will have the least distraction.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way he will be able to better give himself to the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But he must take note of the clear separating line between his work and his family.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He should never allow members of his family to touch his work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Of course, if some of them are also co-workers, that is a different story.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He should never bring home the things pertaining to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A worker cannot be influenced by his family members concerning the work that he is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A brother once said that he went to a certain place to work because his wife had promised that he would go.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is astounding!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How can a wife promise something for her husband, and how can the husband go because of the wife's promise?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We cannot act on our family members' promise, and actually, we cannot even act on our co-workers' promise.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our family must be clearly separated from our work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A worker of the Lord cannot lightly pass on the spiritual problems of other brothers and sisters to his family.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If his family members want to know anything, they should find out the same way that all the other brothers and sisters find out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many problems in the work arise through the loose talk of workers within their family.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Another point we should take note of is to maintain a proper relationship in our contact between the brothers and the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a brother has a preference to work among the sisters, he should be kept away from the work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Likewise, if a young sister has a preference to work among the brothers, she should also be kept away from the work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to be very strict with this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Under ordinary circumstances, brothers should work mostly with brothers and sisters with sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Son of God left us such a pattern when He worked on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>John 3 4 shows us a clear separating line in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In chapter three the Lord received Nicodemus at night, while in chapter four He met the Samaritan woman during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In chapter three the Lord received Nicodemus in a house, and in chapter four He met the woman at the public well.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the settings of chapters three and four were switched, we would have very inappropriate settings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is clear that the Lord spoke with Nicodemus under very different circumstances than those under which He spoke to the Samaritan woman.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This leaves us with a good pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are not saying that brothers and sisters should not contact each other or have fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are saying that a brother or a sister who has a preference and desire to be among the opposite sex should be discouraged from making such contact.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Of course, in Christ there is no difference between male and female, and there is no separating wall between the brothers and the sisters among God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Between the two there should be good fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if a brother has a habit or preference to talk to sisters, or vice versa, we should deal with this situation immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I hope that the brothers and sisters will exercise a spontaneous restriction and limitation when they contact each other.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If anyone goes beyond the proper boundary and engages in abnormal fellowship, we should deal with the situation in a strict way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>May the Lord be gracious to us so that we will maintain a good testimony in this matter.</S>
