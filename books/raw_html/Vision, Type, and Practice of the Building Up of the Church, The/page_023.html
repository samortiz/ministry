        <h2 class="head1">NEVER BRINGING THE DISTINCTION OF LANGUAGES INTO THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In the fallen old creation a language is almost representative of a race. If the distinction of languages is eliminated, the distinction of races will also be eliminated. God wants to build up the church, but in the church there are not only Jews but also Gentiles, consisting of all nations, peoples, and tongues. In Acts 2 more than ten different tongues are mentioned (vv. 9-11). When the Holy Spirit was poured upon the disciples, the difference of languages, the curse brought in at Babel, was eliminated. If the distinction of languages had not been eliminated, it would have become a great problem to the building up of the church. If the distinction of races had remained in the church, the building up of the church would have been frustrated. On the day of Pentecost, however, the Holy Spirit resolved this problem.</p>
<p>This problem, which is attached to the flesh in the old creation, arose again in Acts 6. The disciples were multiplying in number, but there occurred a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Jews who spoke Hebrew (v. 1). This was the curse of Babel hindering the building up of the church. We need to see that the building up of the church is altogether in Christ; it is a matter of the new creation. We must be thoroughly delivered from the old creation by putting off the old man and putting on the new man so that the church may be built up. Thus, in the new man there cannot be Greek and Jew; in the new man there is only Christ (Col. 3:9-11).</p>
<p>I have no intention of encouraging everyone to speak the same language, but I hope that we would understand this principle in the Bible. The distinction of languages represents the fallen old creation. For example, the Chinese always feel that other languages are somewhat inferior in matters related to poetry or the description of scenery and sentiments. We must admit that such an appreciation of the Chinese language belongs to the old creation. The distinction of languages represents the fallen old creation and, hence, cannot be brought into the Body of Christ, which is the church. Although a built-up person will not despise his own tongue, he must not bring his tongue into the church by giving it any place in the church. Whoever brings the tongue that he treasures into the church by giving it a place is bringing the greatest hindrance into the church. To bring a tongue into the church is not according to the principle of the day of Pentecost. Rather, it is the situation of Babel. The distinction of languages is not a blessing in the Holy Spirit but a curse under God&rsquo;s judgment. We should never bring the curse of Babel into the church. To do so is to damage the building up of the church.</p>
<p>Every person has a language that he feels comfortable speaking. A person born in a Chinese family feels comfortable speaking Chinese, just as a person born in a British family feels comfortable speaking English. In the church, however, we must not allow any language to have a particular place. We use a language only for convenience at a certain time or location. In the church we cannot consider any language to be higher than other languages. If we think that a language is more important than other languages, we will damage the building up of the church. There is nothing wrong with having a Taiwanese-speaking meeting for the convenience of communicating. But it is wrong for the brothers to have the intention of forming a Taiwanese church. Doing so does not build up the church but rather tears it down. Such an action is not according to the principle of the day of Pentecost but according to the principle of Babel, and it brings the things that are judged and cursed by God into the building of God.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should never have the concept of building up an assembly based on a particular language. In China we should speak in Mandarin, because it is commonly spoken in that country. In the United States we should speak in English, because it is spoken by the vast majority of people locally. The church in New York City has a Chinese-speaking meeting because there are some Chinese who are unable to understand the messages in English. All the fellowship, prayers, and testimonies in this meeting are in Chinese. However, the brothers in New York City have no intention of building up a Chinese church. There should not be any emphasis on a certain language in the church. Whatever language is commonly used in a place is the language that we should use. We should never build up a church based on a particular language.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUTTING OFF THE OLD MAN<br />
AND PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>For the church life we need to put off the old man and put on the new man (vv. 9-10). Even in the matter of language we should completely put off the old man and not give him any place. In the church of God everything of the old creation should be completely put off. Although the matter of language is often neglected, it is the strongest dividing factor in the old creation. It is easy for us to say that a brother with a bad temper has not yet put off the old creation. But we might never consider that the preference for a certain language is also a strong indication that the old creation is not yet put off. We must remember that the strongest manifestation of the old creation is human languages. If we are saved in this matter, we will eagerly desire all the saints to utter such universal expressions as <em>Hallelujah.</em></p>
<p>Someone once asked what language we will speak when we go to be with the Lord. I believe that we will use words like <em>Hallelujah. Hallelujah</em> is a word that everyone understands in the Lord. On that day, when we meet brothers from Denmark, we will be able to fellowship with them both in spirit and verbally. Likewise, when we meet saints from South America, we will be able to fellowship with them both in spirit and verbally. We will be able to fellowship both in spirit and verbally with saints from any part of the earth. May we be those who put off the curse brought in by Babel.</p>
<p>We should not treasure our own language. When we realize that the origin of differing tongues is Babel, we will no longer treasure our language. The curse from Babel is a great hindrance to our fellowship with the brothers and sisters. Sometimes we can fellowship only with hand motions. Suppose I go to fellowship with the brothers in Denmark, but there are brothers of different nationalities among them. Some may be from Switzerland, some from Sweden, some from Norway, and others from England. I can fellowship with those who understand English, but with those who cannot understand English I can only communicate with hand gestures. What a blessing it would be to be freed from differing languages! Only when we are in situations in which we cannot communicate do we realize that language is something of the old creation. Therefore, we should not consider language as something wonderful. Rather, we need to be saved and completely put off the old creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING EVERYTHING IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>If the church is to be built up among people of so many different languages, every saved person must put off the distinction of languages in the old creation. We must put off the old man and put on the new man. In the new man there is no distinction of races, such as the distinction between Greek and Jew; no distinction of religious backgrounds, such as the distinction between circumcision and uncircumcision; no distinction of cultures, such as the distinction between barbarian and Scythian; and no distinction of social classes, such as the distinction between slave and free man. If we still have feelings toward any kind of distinction, we are at best a pious, spiritual Christian but not a Christian who is built up in the church. In order to be built up in the church, all the distinctions in the old creation must be shut outside the church. No one should say that a brother who is a business owner or university professor cannot fellowship with a brother who does hard labor or is uneducated. No distinction must be brought into the church; hence, even the distinction of social classes has no place in the church. In the church there is only Christ. Only Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:11).</p>
<p>For this reason, the brothers with a higher social standing or rank should have much fellowship with the brothers who have a lesser standing or rank in society. We desire to contact all the brothers and sisters, but in order to turn the traditional, degraded situation in Christianity around, we try not to focus on those with social standing or treat them preferentially. We would rather distance ourselves from those with social standing and have more contact with those who do not have any standing. This does not mean, however, that we despise the saints with social standing. Our love for all the brothers and sisters is the same; they are all dear to us. From the human perspective, we respect those with social standing. But we need to see that the church is the one new man. Everything of the old creation must be put off, and all the distinctions of the old creation must be kept outside the church. In the church there is only Christ. There is no Greek or Jew, no circumcision or uncircumcision, no barbarian or Scythian, no slave or free man. There is only Christ who is all and in all.</p>
<p>Even though we are all different, may we truly see that there is no distinction in the new man, and by the grace of God may we learn to put aside all the distinctions of the old creation so that God may build us up into the church, His dwelling place.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
