   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Helping by Interceding with Groaning and</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thought-carrying</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 8:26 and 27 say, And in like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness; for we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered; but He who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because He intercedes for the saints according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many times we do not know how to pray because we are so weak.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the Spirit joins in, comes in, to help us in our weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He helps us by interceding for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we have a real burden to pray yet we do not know how to utter it, spontaneously we just groan with that burden without any utterable word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This groaning apparently is our groaning, but in our groaning is the groaning of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This becomes the best prayer within which the Spirit intercedes for us by groaning together with us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 27 speaks of the mind of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The mind of the Spirit is His thought.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The searching God knows the mind of the interceding Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we are burdened to pray but do not know how to pray, this shows our weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At that juncture the interceding Spirit who indwells us joins in to pray for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is because we do not know what to utter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The groaning of the Spirit carries His thought, His mind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Gradually, after much of this interceding, we may begin to understand the situation for which we are praying.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Actually, the purpose of the Spirit s groaning is that we may be fully molded and conformed to the image of God s firstborn Son Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Being the Reality of the Kingdom of God</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>in Righteousness, Peace, and Joy</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit is the reality of the kingdom of God in righteousness, peace, and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God s kingdom is a life of righteousness with ourselves, peace with others, and joy with God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be righteous with ourselves, we must be strict in dealing with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We also must have a peaceful situation with others and remain in a rejoicing joy with God all day.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the proper kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>None of us in ourselves can live a life of righteousness, peace, and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why we need the Spirit as the reality of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Spirit of God is the reality of righteousness, peace, and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we have the Spirit, we have this reality, and we are really living the life of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Empowering to Abound in Hope,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Resulting in Joy and Peace through Faith</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Spirit empowers us so that we can abound in hope, resulting in joy and peace through faith Rom 15:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our human life is not full of hope.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>People commit suicide because they do not have any hope.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since they have no hope, they feel that there is no need for them to live.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ephesians 2 says that before we were saved, we had no hope v. 12 . Romans 15:13 says, however, that as believers we need to abound in hope.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I can testify that I am full of hope that the God-ordained way of meeting and serving for the building up of the Body of Christ will be flourishing and prevailing on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sanctifying</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Romans 15:16 speaks of the sanctification in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is not the objective, positional sanctification but the subjective, dispositional sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God has given His Spirit to us to sanctify us, to separate us unto God for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, the Holy Spirit is moving, working, and acting within us constantly to sanctify us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Empowering for Gospel Preaching</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Romans 15:19 says that Paul fully preached the gospel of Christ in the power of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This shows that the Spirit has the function of empowering us for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Loving</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Romans 15:30 refers to the love of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As Christians we should love others, but not by our natural, human love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should love by the divine love, the love of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our natural, human love is not universal.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, the Spirit works in us to give us a love for all the different members of the Lord s Body Col 1:4, 8 .</S>
