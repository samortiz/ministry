   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MYSTERY OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church also is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Are we the church?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How can we be the church when we are sometimes as bad as Satan?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How can we be the church when we argue with our husbands or wives?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church is holy, pure, righteous, spiritual, and heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church has rejected the soul-life to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How can we who are full of self say that we are the church?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, the church has nothing to do with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>So how can we, who are still so worldly, claim to be the church?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Regarding the church, there are a number of questions we need to ask: Who is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Where is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As you endeavor to answer these questions, it may seem that there is no church at all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you say that you are the church, I will say that you are not, but if you say that you are not the church, I will say that you are.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may be the church to a certain degree.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, some may be fifty-five percent the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the case because the church is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No one can measure the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Like the air, the church is mysterious and immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE MYSTERY OF THE FUTURE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now we come to the last mystery, the mystery of the future.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Both the origin of the universe and the future of the universe are a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>None of the scientists knows what the future of the universe will be.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They do not even know what the next day or the next hour will bring.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hallelujah, we know the mystery of the future!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This mystery is the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although no scientist or scholar understands this, we know it because the Bible reveals it to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Bible opens with the words, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the book of Revelation, the last book of the Bible, says, "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away" Rev 21:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the new heaven and the new earth, the New Jerusalem will be God's tabernacle among men.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the future.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The New Jerusalem is an eternal reflection of the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you want to see what the church is, look at this eternal reflection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The New Testament does not give us a full definition of the church, but we do see a complete picture of the church in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you want to know the church, look at this eternal reflection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What we are doing in the church today is reflected there.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These seven mysteries cover the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The span of these mysteries is vast, extending from eternity past to eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the coming messages we shall consider these mysteries in detail, especially the mysteries of man, Christ, the Spirit, and the church.</S>
