   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Preaching Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Actually, 4:6 is an explanation of verse 5, where Paul says, For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus sake.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The apostles preached Christ as Lord and themselves as the believers slaves because the very God who commanded light to shine out of darkness had shined in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His shining in the universe produced the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now His shining in their hearts has made them a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, they are able to exalt Christ as the Lord in their preaching and conduct themselves as slaves to the believers in their service.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What they do for Christ and what they are to the believers are the issue of God s shining.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God s shining produces the new covenant ministers and their ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>GOD S SHINING AND HIS DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God s shining into our hearts is His dispensing of Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As an illustration, we may use the example of an iron bar that glows after it has been placed in fire.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may say that the fire dispenses itself into the iron so that the iron becomes permeated by and with the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the result of this dispensing and permeating, the iron bar shines.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The illumination in 4:6 may be compared to fire.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I believe that Paul s thought here is that God s shining, His illuminating, was like a fire burning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As God shines in our heart, we are saturated with the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just as we could say that fire saturates an iron bar, we are saturated with the essence of God through His illuminating, through His shining in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I can testify of this from my own experience with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I stay with the Lord in prayer, often I sense an inner burning, an inner illumination.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Using today s term, I would call this an experience of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The burning and illuminating I experience when I stay with the Lord is actually the illumination of the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This illumination is His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through such a dispensing, we are filled, saturated, and permeated with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a result, we have the intense desire to minister the word of God to others so that they also may experience the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>METAPHORS THAT DESCRIBE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we have pointed out, Paul uses other metaphors in chapters two and three to describe the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 3:3 he says, Being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A letter of Christ is one composed of Christ as the content to convey Christ and express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As Paul was writing a living letter of Christ, Christ was every letter, word, phrase, sentence, and paragraph.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The ink used in this writing was the Spirit of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>While Paul was teaching the Word or preaching the gospel, he was inscribing Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today we all should be those who compose living letters of Christ by inscribing Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we speak, we should inscribe Christ into others with the ink of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As ink saturates paper, so we need to cause others to be saturated with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This saturation is, once again, a matter of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 2:14-16a Paul uses the metaphor of incense-bearers: But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and manifests through us the savor of the knowledge of Him in every place; for we are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing: to the one a savor from death unto death, to the other a savor from life unto life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because the apostles were permeated with Christ, they became a fragrance of Christ to God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may say that they were permeated with Christ as the divine perfume.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Wherever they went, God could manifest through them a sweet fragrance of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In chapter two we have the fragrance; in chapter three, the divine ink; and in chapter four, the light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to have the fragrance permeating us, the Spirit saturating us, and the light burning in us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This light dispenses God as a divine fire into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As the result of this dispensing, we become permeated and saturated with incense, the Spirit, and light.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then what issues out from us in our speaking becomes our ministry, a ministry of dispensing the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever we speak in preaching the gospel or teaching the Word, we dispense the Triune God into others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>EXPERIENCING THE TRIUNE GOD IN HIS DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to be deeply impressed with what is revealed in the books of 1 and 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In these Epistles we have a revelation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Here we have the Triune God as our enjoyment; the Triune God as our power; the Triune God as our wisdom; the Triune God as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; the Triune God as the gifts for our functioning; and the Triune God as the ointment to anoint us, as the fragrance to permeate us, as the Spirit to saturate us, and as the light to burn in us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This experience of the Triune God in His dispensing is altogether different from religion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is also different from mere doctrine and teaching and from efforts to improve ourselves or adjust ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What is revealed in these books is the transfusing, the dispensing, the permeating, the saturating, of the Triune God in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the real enjoyment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As we shall see in the next message, the last word uttered by Paul in 2 Corinthians concerns this divine dispensing, the dispensing of the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.</S>
