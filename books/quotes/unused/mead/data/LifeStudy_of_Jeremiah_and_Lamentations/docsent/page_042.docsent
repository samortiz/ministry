   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Go to and fro in the streets of Jerusalem, / And look now and know, / And seek in her open squares / If you can find a man, / If there is anyone who executes justice, / Who seeks faithfulness; / And I will pardon her" Jer 5:1 .</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>/ But together they both have broken the yoke; / They have torn off the bonds" v. 5 . In the law there are not only the Ten Commandments but also many ordinances, regulations of God's just and righteous law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Israel knew these ordinances but would not follow them.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that the people were adulterous, utterly sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The visitors to the house of harlots were like a troop, like an army.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>E. Not Trembling before Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Israel did not tremble before Jehovah, who has set the sand as a boundary for the sea v. 22 . Rather, they had a stubborn and rebellious heart, and they turned aside and went away v. 23 .</S>
