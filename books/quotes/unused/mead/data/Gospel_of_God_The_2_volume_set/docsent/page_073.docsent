   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Many of us have had experience working in business.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Suppose you have a secretary who has proposed a plan to you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After you look at the plan you may write "OK" on it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that the work is approved; it is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now it can be carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord has died for us and the work has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The resurrection of the Lord is God's signing of an "OK" on the work and death of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that this death is now approved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man's problem of sin is now solved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since the Lord has resurrected, the problem of our sins is fully solved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the Lord had not resurrected, though the redemption would have been accomplished, our hearts would be held in suspense.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There would still be a certain uneasiness within us, for though we would know that redemption had been accomplished, we would not know whether it had been accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We realize that we are fully redeemed from our sins when we see that the Lord Jesus has resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Resurrection is the proof.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It shows us that the cross was right and the redemption was approved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Resurrection is the proof that the work of the cross has been accepted and received by God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let us consider an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose I owe a certain person a sum of money.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I may owe him so much that there is no way for me to repay my debt.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This, of course, is not a very good illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But we will use it here for the sake of clarifying one aspect of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It should not be applied to all aspects of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us say that I go to a brother and say to him, "You know that person to whom I owe the money very well.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You two are good friends.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Please plead for me a little.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have no way to pay back what I owe, even if I pawn everything at a pawn shop.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have a problem even in taking care of my own living today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Please do me this favor by all means."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>My creditor does not live here in Shanghai; he lives in Soochow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At my request, the brother makes a special trip to Soochow and tells the man, "Mr. Nee is really poor.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He cannot even take care of his own living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This little sum of money is nothing to you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why don't you let it go and write off his debt?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose my creditor is very generous.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He says, "Since you come to plead for Mr. Nee's debt, I will forget about it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He does not have to return it to me anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Take this promissory note back to him."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then he goes on and says to this brother, "We have not met each other for years.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since we are good friends and since you are here in Soochow, you should take a trip to Tiger Hill and the Winter Mountain Shrine.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why don't you stay here for a few days."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He invites him to stay in Soochow and lavishly hosts him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Suppose this brother left on May 10 and settled the business on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, by May 20 he is still not back in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>While he is feasting in Soochow, I am worrying in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I do not know whether or not this brother has finished the business.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Perhaps he has not come back because of some difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He did not come back on the night train on May 10.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Perhaps the business has not yet been settled.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He did not come back on May 11.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Neither did he come back on May 19 or 20.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As long as he has not come back to Shanghai, my heart cannot have peace because I do not know if the business has been settled.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The business was settled on May 10, but I have not yet received news on May 20.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As long as he has not come back, my business is not finished.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I still consider myself a debtor, and my heart is still ill at ease.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When will the business be transacted?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only when he returns to Shanghai will I know that the matter is cleared up.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Friends, this illustrates the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When He died for us, He solved the problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As soon as He died, the fact of sin was taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But if He had not resurrected from the dead, and if He had not come back, then our hearts would have been held in suspense; we would not know what had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord Jesus went through death for us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He went through the punishment of the law and the wrath of God for us Gal 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But if the Lord Jesus had not come back, we would not know if the work was finished.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We would not know if God had accepted the work of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For this reason, the Lord Jesus must come back.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He must resurrect.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then we will know that the work is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The work is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If the work had not been settled, the Lord would not have come out and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>His resurrection proves that our sins have fully been cleared up.</S>
