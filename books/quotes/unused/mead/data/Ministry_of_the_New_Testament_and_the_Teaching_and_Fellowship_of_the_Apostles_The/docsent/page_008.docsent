   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Teachings of the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Epistles from Romans to Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The teaching of the apostles also includes the teachings of the apostles in the Epistles, from Romans through Revelation John 16:12-15; Col 1:25-28; Rev 22:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Revelation should be considered not merely as a book but actually as a long epistle, within which are seven epistles 2:1 3:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The New Testament has twenty-seven books.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first five are the four Gospels and the Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The remainder of the books of the New Testament are the twenty-two Epistles from Romans through Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All these Epistles are the apostles' writings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are the divine speaking concerning God's mysteries in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In John 16:12, after the Lord had spoken to His disciples up to a certain point, He said to them, "I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here the Lord meant that the disciples could not then enter into what He wanted to tell them, because they had not yet received the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They needed to wait until the Spirit of reality came.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verses 13-15 the Lord continued, "But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here the Lord told His disciples that when the Spirit of reality came, He would unveil to them all the things that the Lord would attain to and obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord was going to attain to and obtain many things, but He could not tell the disciples, because they could not enter into these things; that is, they could not bear them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They needed to wait until the Spirit of reality came.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This word in John 16 was spoken by the Lord on the night of His betrayal.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Immediately after that, He was arrested, judged, and crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After three days He resurrected, and in the evening of the third day He came back to the disciples in the form of the Spirit 20:19-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At that time He was the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was then that He breathed Himself into His disciples v. 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After forty days the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens openly and officially Acts 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Prior to that time Peter had often spoken quickly and foolishly Matt 16:21-23; 17:24-27; 26:31-35 , but immediately after the Lord's ascension, Peter's speaking changed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Acts 1 2 Peter could expound the Psalms concerning Christ 2:25-31 and concerning Judas 1:15-20 , and his interpretation was wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before Christ's resurrection Peter was merely Peter, without the Spirit of reality, but after Christ's ascension, Peter became another person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He became an excellent teacher of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Later, Paul was raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Peter wrote only two Epistles, and these were written late.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul, however, wrote fourteen Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first few Galatians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and Romans were written considerably earlier than Peter's. In Colossians, one of Paul's later Epistles, Paul told us clearly that he had received a commission from God to complete the word of God's revelation concerning God's mystery in His economy 1:25-26 . That mystery, which is "Christ in you, the hope of glory" v. 27 , is centered on Christ's indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Finally, at the end of Revelation, John the apostle said, "I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues which are written in this scroll; and if anyone takes away from the words of the scroll of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city, which are written in this scroll" 22:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to John's word here, after the writing of Revelation no one can add anything to or subtract anything from the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, according to Paul's word in Colossians 1:25 and John's word in Revelation 22:18-19, we know that after these two writers the entire divine revelation was complete; no one can add anything or take away anything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, it is very logical to conclude that all the Epistles written by the apostles are also God's speaking in the person of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, we need to consider all the words in the entire New Testament, from the first word of Matthew to the last word of Revelation, as God's speaking through the different mouths and different hands of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the apostles' teaching.</S>
