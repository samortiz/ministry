   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. For the Faith Once for All</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Delivered to the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jude 3 says that we should contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this verse, as in 1 Timothy 6:12 and 2 Timothy 4:7, the faith refers not to our subjective believing but to our objective belief, that is, to what we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The faith denotes the contents of the New Testament as our faith Acts 6:7; 1 Tim 1:19; 3:9; 4:1; 5:8; 6:10, 21; 2 Tim 3:8; Titus 1:13 , in which we believe for our common salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This faith, not any doctrine, has been delivered once for all to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this faith we should contend.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The faith our belief is constituted of certain basic truths.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, we believe that God is one yet triune the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Second, we believe that our God became incarnated in the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Third, we believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was incarnated as a man, lived on earth, and died on the cross for our sins to secure our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the third day He was resurrected from the dead both physically and spiritually to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today He is our Savior, our Lord in resurrection, and our life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because we believe in Him, our sins have been forgiven, He has come into us as our life, and we have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, the Lord Jesus will come back to receive all His believers to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These are basic truths, basic doctrines, that constitute the faith for which we should contend.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because every sound, genuine believer holds these basic truths, these truths are called the common faith Titus 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The faith in the objective sense is equal to the contents of God s will given to us in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This will includes even the Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, the contents of this will do not include such matters as head covering, foot-washing, or methods of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nevertheless, some believers contend for such things, thinking that they are contending for the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But this is not the correct understanding of what Jude means by contending for the faith once for all delivered to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Jude contending for the faith is to contend for the basic and crucial matters of God s new will, His new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Someone may say that Jesus died on the cross not for redemption but because He was a martyr and sacrificed Himself for His teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This understanding of the death of Christ is heretical; it is contrary to the basic items of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, we need to contend for the truth concerning Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is what it means to contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The faith, the common faith, has been delivered to the saints once for all, and what we need to do now is to contend for it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>RUNNING THE COURSE OF THE RACE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The believers also experience the dispensing of the processed Triune God by running the course of the race.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Christian life is a race, and we are runners.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hebrews 12:1 says, Let us also, having so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, put away every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us and run with endurance the race which is set before us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul also says in 1 Corinthians 9:24, Do you not know that those who run on a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Run in this way, that you may lay hold.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These verses indicate that we must not only run, but run successfully in order to obtain the prize, which is a reward as an incentive to us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First Corinthians 9 reveals that the Christian course involves preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To preach the gospel is to dispense Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By dispensing Christ into those who are receptive to our preaching, we run the Christian course.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To run in a racecourse is to labor, but to receive the prize is to have enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we preach the gospel, we are running the course.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, to receive a reward, a prize, at the coming of the Lord Jesus is to have a particular enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The race we are running is actually Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord Jesus said, I am the way John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A race is a way, a course.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is the race because He is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The way we are walking is the race we are running.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, Christ, who is the way, is also the race we have to run.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although Christ is our way, we should not take this way simply as a way; rather, we should take the way as a race to run.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not take the time to consider, look around, stand still, or walk slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to run the race until we can declare, like Paul did in 2 Timothy 4:7, I have finished the course.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul began to run the course of the heavenly race after he was taken possession of by the Lord, and he continued to run 1 Cor 9:24-26; Phil 3:12-14 until he finished the course Acts 20:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then at the end he triumphantly proclaimed, I have finished the course.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He also proclaimed that he would receive from the Lord a reward the crown of righteousness 2 Tim 4:8 .</S>
