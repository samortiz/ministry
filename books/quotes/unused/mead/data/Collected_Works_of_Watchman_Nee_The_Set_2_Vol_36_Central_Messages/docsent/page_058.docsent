   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ Becoming Our Sanctification</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before God, our righteousness is not our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But this does not mean that we do not have to care for our conduct while we live on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our righteousness before God is settled, but what should we do about our conduct and living?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must see that God has made Christ not only our righteousness, but our sanctification as well.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This sanctification is not a thing or condition, but a person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God has made Christ our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some Christians have a certain concept about sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They think that sanctification is Christ helping them to be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that they are not holy, but they will become holy through Christ's help.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Corinthians 1:30 tells us that God has made Christ sanctification to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not have to try to be sanctified by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not become sanctified through the help of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ Himself has become our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our sanctification is the person of Christ, not the help of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some Christians think that sanctification is Christ empowering them to become holy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They pray for the Lord to give them strength.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They think that as long as they have the strength, they can be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But God's Word does not say that we can be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It does not say that Christ gives us the strength to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's Word tells us clearly that He has made Christ sanctification to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our sanctification is a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our sanctification is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our sanctification is not the result of a power from God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not have the vision, we will not see the vast difference between these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not something that our mind can comprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do not have the revelation, it is useless even if our mind understands.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God must show us that Christ does not come to help us to become holy; He does not give us the strength to be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, He Himself is our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many Christians believe that there are two things related to sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One is the power of sanctification, and the other is the fruit of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They think that a man must have the power of sanctification before he can bear the fruit of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to this theory, where should we put Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Should Christ be on the side of power, which means that Christ as our power enables us to become sanctified?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yet God's speaking in 1 Corinthians 1:30 is totally different from this theory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ did not come to be our power of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ Himself is our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He did not come to be our power of sanctification to enable us to produce sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He Himself is sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have to shout Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He does not become our power of sanctification, which enables us to produce sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, we have Christ; therefore, we have sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brothers and sisters, if we say that sanctification is a thing, God's Word will tell us that Christ is that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brothers and sisters, our thing is a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our sanctification is a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our thing is Christ; our sanctification is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can take humility as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Suppose I am a very proud person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I am aware of my pride, yet I cannot humble myself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, I pray, "God, be merciful to me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Please send the Lord Jesus to help me so that I can be humble."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Brothers and sisters, have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I have made Christ my help in trying to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I think that with His help I can become humble.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, I ask Christ to help me to become humble.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But this is my concept; this is not God's way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God does not ask Christ to help me to become humble.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God gives me Christ, who is my humility.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God has not given us Christ as a power so that we can produce humility; God has given us Christ to be our humility.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Brothers and sisters, does the Lord have power?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Yes, every one of us knows that He has power.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Has He given us this power?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Yes, He has given us this power.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then why are we still so weak?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have to realize that He has given all the power to us already, but we cannot use this power.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord's power is real, but we cannot use it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we try to be humble by the Lord's power, we find that we cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>At the most we perform some outward acts which we call humility.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But inwardly, there is no such thing as humility.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God's Word shows us that our humility is not the power of Christ, but Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What does it mean for us to say that humility is just the Lord Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It means that I do not have any humility and I cannot be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Even if the Lord gives me the strength to humble myself, I still cannot be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I can only say to the Lord, "You are my humility.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I allow You to become my humility."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Brothers and sisters, what is the meaning of Christ becoming my humility?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Simply put, it means that Christ replaces me and expresses His own humility in my place.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When we ask God for power to humble ourselves, we may be able to humble ourselves for a while, but this humility is merely good behavior, a good attitude, a good intention, and a good condition.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This humility is not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When we ask the Lord to be our humility, we lift up our heads and say to Him, "Lord, I do not have any humility in me.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Even if You give me the strength to humble myself, I still would not have humility.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Therefore Lord, I ask that You come and be my humility and that You be humble in my place."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>After we look to the Lord this way, any humility that we begin to have will be a spontaneous humility.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Such humility will not be a work, but a living person Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Take patience as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I do not have any patience, and I cannot be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>My patience is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The same is true with meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I do not have any meekness, and I cannot be meek.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>My meekness is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Brothers and sisters, have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>God has made Christ my patience.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>God has made Christ my meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>All our virtues are just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Christian virtues are different from common human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The virtues that we commonly speak of are individual things, but Christian virtues are not individual, fragmentary things, but a living person, who is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Our virtue is not plural in number, but singular in number.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Our virtue is not fragmentary things, but a person.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Brothers and sisters, if we do not have Christ, we do not have anything.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When Christ becomes our life within, He responds to all the demands outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>There is only one life, but because the demands outside of us are different, there are different kinds of responses.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>When pride comes, Christ is manifested as our humility.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>When anxiety comes, Christ is manifested as our patience.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>When jealousy comes, Christ is manifested as our love.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>From this one life issue all the virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Because the need in the environment varies, the manifestations of this life also vary.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Daily we encounter many things.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>When the Lord manifests Himself in these things, we find Him in many virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Hence, the many virtues of Christians are not their own behavior, but the reflections of Christ and the manifestations of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>This is the meaning of Christ becoming our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Hence, the Christian life is a matter of how much we know about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>It is not a matter of our humility, our patience, or our meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Everything depends on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The more we know Christ, the more His virtues are manifested through us.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Others may think that these are our virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>But we know that they are nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>A Christian has no virtue other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>All Christian virtues are just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Brothers and sisters, if we know Christ more, we will see that our virtues are just the outflow of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Sister Wang's patience is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Brother Chan's patience is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Brother Chow's love, Sister Hu's meekness, and Sister Liu's humility are not different virtues; they are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>The virtues manifested through different persons are different.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>But they are all Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>All of our virtues are just Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Everything that flows out of us is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>The love that flows out of Brother Chow is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>The meekness that flows out of Sister Hu is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>The humility that flows out of Sister Liu is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>The demands in the environment may be different, but the supply within is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>The outward manifestations are different, but the intrinsic nature is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>No Christian virtue is a product of one's own work; every virtue is the outflow of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>It is Christ reflecting Himself out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Brothers and sisters, once we realize this, we will lift up our head to the Lord and say, "I have tried in the past to be a Christian by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>I was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Lord, I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Now I know that You are my sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>I want You to live Yourself out of me."</S>
