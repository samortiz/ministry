   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY THE WHOLE BODY SERVING Co-workers' Meeting Date: April 26, 1948, evening</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai GOD'S SALVATION AND DEMANDS BEING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE SAME TODAY AS AT THE BEGINNING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I believe that God is going to do great things today, and I believe that God has done something great already.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God has given us a great salvation, a thorough salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the first century God saved men.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today He is doing the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The extent to which God saved men in the first century is the extent to which He is saving men today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has not changed the gospel in the course of two thousand years of human history.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There has been no change in the result and the demands of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not think that first century Christians were required to pay a great price, but that we do not need to pay the same price today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who follow the Lord today must pay the same price as those in the first century.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At that time men had to forsake everything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The requirement has not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is, of course, a difference between putting a lamp under a bushel and putting it on the lampstand, but the lamp itself has not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE DEGRADATION AND</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During the past two thousand years, the gospel has not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the very day that the church was produced, God saw this new creation and considered that it was good.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is like God considering everything as good in Genesis after He created everything in six days.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After some time, the situation changed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although the situation changed, the beauty of the original creation remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The beauty of the church on the first day at Pentecost was comparable to the beauty of Eve on the day of her creation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the church gradually changed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It changed from Ephesus to Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the time of Martin Luther, God began to take the way of recovery step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For the past four hundred years, God did some recovery work every fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>During the past one hundred years, His work has been especially strong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It seems as if the last few decades have seen the peak of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There has never been a time when the church has been as rich as it is now.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE BODY TESTIMONY BEING GOD'S FINAL RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We believe that God is recovering the most difficult thing today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What worries us the most today is the fulfillment of Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It seems as though we do not have to worry about the fulfillment of John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are not afraid that it will not be fulfilled, and we are not worried.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose someone says that he has believed and asks what he should do if he still has not received eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He has believed, yet he has not seen any result.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are not worried about this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have read the New Testament more than two hundred times.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am not worried about any other passage.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have even read Revelation a few hundred times.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am not worried about that book either.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, I am worried about Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I am concerned about how this passage of the Scriptures will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ephesians 4 says that the work of the ministry is to arrive at the oneness of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church is the Body of Christ, and it builds itself up in love.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are not concerned about things like the new heaven, the new earth, and the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But when I lie on my bed, I am always apprehensive about the fulfillment of Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have studied the Bible, and I have prayed, but I still do not have the assurance that the condition in Ephesians 4 will be fulfilled in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Among God's children today, there is much confusion, and there are all kinds of divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When will we be one?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today there are all kinds of ministries; the situation is very complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How can this chapter be recovered?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yet, brothers and sisters, we believe that there will be a day when God's recovery will reach the fulfillment of Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God is doing a recovery work everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The ultimate work among all these works may very well be the recovery of the Body testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God's leading today is to bring us back to the beginning and to recover us to the condition at the beginning.</S>
