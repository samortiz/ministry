<h2 class="head1">EXPLANATION AND FELLOWSHIP</h2> 
<ol class="decimal">
<li>These lessons have been specifically prepared for the home meetings of new believers. The first two volumes cover different matters between a believer and God which he should know, understand, and practice immediately after his salvation. Then the last two volumes cover the full salvation which God has prepared in Christ for us who have believed into Him, the riches which we have obtained in Christ, the experience which we should have in Christ, the things which we should accomplish in Christ, and the goal which we should attain in Christ.</li> 
<li>It is difficult to avoid certain terms which are relatively deep and hard for new believers to understand. There is no need for added explanation while reading these lessons in the meetings. As lesson after lesson is read, a thorough understanding of the terms will be acquired. Even if there is not such a thorough understanding at the time, this understanding will be gained gradually.</li> 
<li>Knowledge is empty and the letter kills; only Christ is reality and only the Spirit gives life. Thus, there must be prayer, confession of sins, and the abundantly rich filling and saturation with the Spirit of Christ before reading these lessons. In reading, there should be the practice of depending less on the mind and more on the spirit, rejecting the old way of knowledge and emphasizing the new way of life. Sentence after sentence that is being read should be pushed out by the spirit with life that others&rsquo; spirits may be touched for them to receive the life supply of the pneumatic Christ.</li> 
<li>The Bible verses in these lessons are quoted in an economical and suitable way. Furthermore, their explanations are both concise and adequate, having no need for further explanation. The only need is to repeat what is read, to emphasize what is read, to read in a living way, and to pray-read. At times, the reading should be supplemented by hymns or testimonies. Never extend the meaning of the text or develop an understanding based on inference.</li>
<li>The Scriptures quoted in these lessons are from the Recovery Version of the New Testament and the King James Version of the Old Testament.</li>
<li>For these lessons to be beneficial to the home meetings, there is a great need for much prayer. May the Lord bless His recovery, perfect His saints, and build up His Body.</li>

<h1 class="title">THE WAY TO ENJOY GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION&mdash;<br />
INCLUDING THE FIRST STAGE OF SANCTIFICATION</h1>
<p>In the previous three volumes we covered thirty topics concerning the matters between God and us, and between us and God. In this fourth volume, we still need to have an overall view of God&rsquo;s full salvation. We will first look into the way to enjoy God&rsquo;s full salvation; then we will consider the different aspects of God&rsquo;s full salvation. According to the divine revelation in the Bible, there are clearly three steps which constitute the way to enjoy God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SANCTIFICATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:2).</p>
<p>The word here shows us how the Triune God causes His salvation to reach us: God the Father chose us according to His foreknowledge, and God the Spirit sanctifies us that we may receive God the Son&rsquo;s redemption, denoted here by the blood of Christ. According to our experience of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the sanctification of God the Spirit is the first step in our enjoyment of God&rsquo;s full salvation. God the Father chose us in eternity past according to His foreknowledge. Then, after we were born, God the Spirit came to sanctify us from the world, according to the Father&rsquo;s selection, that we might enjoy the redemption of God the Son. Therefore, the sanctification of God the Spirit becomes the first step in our enjoyment of God&rsquo;s full salvation. This step, however, is not taken by us. It is the work of God the Spirit.</p>
<p>The sanctification of God the Spirit separates us from the world that we may belong to God and enjoy God&rsquo;s full salvation. This sanctification in us is divided into three stages. The first is for our repentance, the second is for our justification, and the third is for our transformation. Hence, God the Spirit&rsquo;s coming to separate us unto repentance according to God the Father&rsquo;s selection in eternity is the first stage of His complete sanctification in us. In this first stage of sanctification He enlightens us, causing us to be convicted concerning sin (John 16:8), to come to ourselves (Luke 15:17), and to repent and turn to God (Acts 26:20).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. OUR REPENTANCE</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Repent and believe in the gospel&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 1:15).</p>
<p> This word tells us that in order to enjoy God&rsquo;s full salvation, we must repent and believe in the gospel; that is, we must receive God&rsquo;s salvation. Therefore, our repentance is the second step in our enjoyment of God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;Light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek carefully...one sinner repenting...he came to himself&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 15:8, 10, 17).</p>
<p>In these verses, lighting a lamp, sweeping the house, and seeking carefully signify that, at the time that we hear the gospel, God the Spirit (the Holy Spirit, who sanctifies us) enlightens us from within and searches out our sins one by one, that we may know our sins and repent. Hence, this portion of the Bible shows us that it is because of such enlightening and searching of the Holy Spirit in us that we the sinners come to ourselves and repent. The Holy Spirit enlightens and searches us inwardly to sanctify us from the world and to cause us to turn to the Lord and receive God&rsquo;s full salvation. Thus, the sanctification of the Holy Spirit is the first step in our receiving salvation, and our repentance is the second step.</p>
<p><strong>3) &ldquo;Repent and turn to God&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 26:20).</p>
<p>Repentance literally means a change in mind which produces regret and a consequent change in goal. We repent and believe in the Lord because, after we hear the gospel, our mind is sanctified by the Holy Spirit to become regretful and to have a change, a turn to God to take Him as our goal in everything.</p>
<p><strong>4) &ldquo;Preaching...repentance...Prepare the way of the Lord; make His paths straight. Every ravine shall be filled up, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked places shall become straight, and the rough places smooth roads;...shall see the salvation of God&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 3:3-6).</p>
<p>It is through much straightening and smoothing in our hearts that we see (that is, possess) the repentance in God&rsquo;s salvation. The ravine, the mountain, the crooked places, and the rough places are figures of speech describing the conditions of men&rsquo;s hearts toward God and toward each other and the relationships among men. When we repent and believe in the Lord, our repentance straightens all the crooked places and fills up all the rough places in our hearts, making our entire being straight and smooth for God to come in to carry out His full salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">III. OUR BELIEVING AND BEING BAPTIZED</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Believing</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Repent and believe in the gospel&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 1:15).</p>
<p> This word shows us that in order to enjoy God&rsquo;s salvation, we must repent and also believe. On the negative side, when we repent, we regret and confess our sins to clear up and straighten our condition, which is fallen and away from God. On the positive side, when we believe, we believe into Christ and receive God into us, that we may obtain Him and His eternal life.</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;That everyone who believes in Him should... have eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:16).</p>
<p>When we believe in the Lord, we believe into the Lord that we may be joined to Him in God&rsquo;s eternal life to enjoy the full salvation which is prepared by God in Him. Therefore, the fact that &ldquo;to believe&rdquo; is &ldquo;to believe into&rdquo; strongly conveys a sense of being joined and united.</p>
<p><strong>3) &ldquo;But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:12).</p>
<p>To believe is not only to believe into but also to receive. To believe into equals to be joined to, referring to our being joined to Christ, into whom we have believed; to receive means to receive the Christ into whom we believe and who has come into us to be joined to us. Our believing into Christ makes us those who are in Christ; our receiving Christ causes Him to be the One who is in us. &ldquo;In Christ&rdquo; is the beginning of our union with Him, which affords us the position and sphere to enjoy God&rsquo;s full salvation; &ldquo;Christ in us&rdquo; is the progress of this union, which further gives us the experience and the elements of the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s full salvation. If we allow our experience of these two&mdash;our being in Christ and Christ&rsquo;s being in us&mdash;to continue without hindrance or distraction, we will richly and unceasingly enjoy God&rsquo;s full salvation in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>4) &ldquo;Those who have been allotted like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (2 Pet. 1:1).</p>
<p>The faith through which we believe into Christ and receive Christ, and by which we are saved (Eph. 2:8), is the like precious faith allotted to us. &ldquo;Allotted&rdquo; indicates that we do not have this faith in ourselves; rather, it is obtained by us from God. Moreover, this faith is &ldquo;like,&rdquo; that is, it is of the same one whole. &ldquo;Like faith&rdquo; indicates that the faith possessed by us, who have believed into Christ and have received Christ, is of the same one whole, out of which we all have been given an allotment. It is like the whole of the good land of Canaan, which was allotted to the Israelites in the Old Testament (Josh. 14:1-5). The good land of Canaan in the Old Testament typifies the all-inclusive Christ in the New Testament. In the New Testament, God gives this rich Christ as an allotted inheritance to all those who were chosen by Him. This inheritance is included in the faith, and through this faith we were allotted and have received the inheritance. Hence, this faith of ours is the inheritance which we have received from God. It is also the faith through which we were allotted and have received this inheritance from God. Therefore, the inheritance allotted by God and the faith through which we were allotted and have received God&rsquo;s inheritance are one and the same, that is, Christ Himself given to us by God. On the one hand, the Christ given to us by God is our inheritance from God; on the other hand, He is also the faith through which we were allotted and have received God&rsquo;s inheritance. Both are Christ. When we hear and believe in the gospel, the Holy Spirit who sanctifies us and causes us to repent brings Christ into us, on the one hand, to be our inheritance from God and, on the other hand, to be the faith through which we are allotted and receive God&rsquo;s inheritance. Both are the portion which God gives to us, that is, the portion of the saints from God (Col. 1:12). Furthermore, the Holy Spirit, who brings Christ into us, is the ultimate expression of the Triune God reaching us and entering into us to bring Christ into us as our eternal portion from God. Thus, the Triune God enters into His chosen people to be their faith, causing them to enter into Him to be joined to Him as one in His divine life. This is the ultimate significance of the very faith by which we enter into Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being Baptized</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 16:16).</p>
<p>This simple and definite word further reveals to us that in order to enjoy God&rsquo;s full salvation, we must not only believe but also be baptized. To believe and be baptized are not two steps; they are one step that requires both feet. Both are needed to complete one step. To believe is the inward reality of our entering into Christ, and to be baptized is the outward confession, testimony, sign, and declaration of our entering into Christ.</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 3:27).</p>
<p>Just as our inward believing is our entering into Christ, so also is our outward baptism. Only when these two are combined is there a complete and substantial entering. Through faith and baptism we enter into Christ completely and substantially, putting on Christ as the righteousness that we obtain by believing into Him. Thus we become heirs of God (Luke 15:21-23) to inherit the Christ of God as our inheritance (Gal. 3:29).</p>
<p><strong>3) &ldquo;As many as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:3); <strong>&ldquo;...buried together with Him [Christ] in baptism, in whom also you were raised together&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 2:12).</p>
<p>When we are baptized into Christ, we are also baptized into His death. By being immersed into Him, we have a union with Him, and whatever He experienced becomes our experience. Since He experienced death and resurrection, by being baptized into Him to be joined to Him, we participate in the death and resurrection which He experienced. We died with Him in His death and were thus delivered from everything of the old creation. We were also resurrected with Him in His resurrection to enter into everything of the new creation.</p>
<p><strong>4) &ldquo;Which figure [of the water] also now saves you, baptism, not a putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the appeal of a good conscience unto God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 3:21).</p>
<p>As the flood rescued Noah&rsquo;s family from that corrupted generation (Gen. 6:11, 17), baptism rescues us from the corrupted world. This baptism is not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the appeal of a good conscience toward God. It is an appeal to God for a good conscience towards Him by those who are being baptized, that they may be able to testify before men that all their problems with God have been solved, that there is no more accusation in their conscience, that instead they are full of peace and faith, and that they have been baptized into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19). Furthermore, through the resurrection of Christ, that is, through Christ becoming the Spirit of life in resurrection, they are organically united with Him.</p>
<p>The sanctification of the Holy Spirit, our repentance, our believing and being baptized, which we have now seen, are the three necessary steps for us to enjoy God&rsquo;s full salvation in Christ. Moreover, in us who are experiencing God&rsquo;s full salvation, the experience of the reality of these three steps should be repeated as a cycle again and again.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON THIRTY-EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS<br />
AND THE CLEANSING AWAY OF SINS</h1>
<p>In His full salvation, God first forgives us of our sins and cleanses us of our sins. When we receive God&rsquo;s full salvation, the first items we enjoy are God&rsquo;s forgiveness of our sins and His cleansing away of our sins.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. FORGIVENESS OF SINS</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Everyone who believes into Him receives forgiveness of sins&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 10:43).</p>
<p>Forgiveness of sins is the first part of our redemption, and it is received by us at the moment we believe. Our first problem before God is that there is a record of sin because of our sinful deeds. Only when our record is cleared can the righteousness of God release us. Unless our sinful deeds before Him are eliminated, the righteous God cannot grant us the remaining items of His redemption. Therefore, we first need to have God&rsquo;s forgiveness of our sins.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Significance of Forgiveness of Sins</h2>
<p><strong>1) Being delivered from the penalty of God&rsquo;s righteousness&mdash;&ldquo;He who believes into Him is not judged&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:18).</p>
<p>First, forgiveness of sins means the elimination of our record of sin before God that we may be delivered from the penalty of God&rsquo;s righteousness. Because we had a record of sin before God and were condemned, we should have suffered God&rsquo;s righteous punishment. But when God forgave us, He delivered us from His righteous penalty and condemned us no longer.</p>
<p><strong>2) Causing the sins to leave the forgiven ones&mdash; &ldquo;Give...forgiveness of sins&rdquo; (Acts 5:31); &ldquo;The Lord hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of us all&rdquo; (Isa. 53:6); &ldquo;Himself [Christ] carried up our sins in His body onto the tree [the cross]&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 2:24).</p>
<p>In the New Testament the Greek word for forgiveness means &ldquo;causing (it) to leave&rdquo; and &ldquo;sending away.&rdquo; When God forgives us of our sins, He not only eliminates our record of sin before Him but also causes the sins which we have committed to depart from us. This is because, when God made the Lord Jesus our offering for sin on the cross, He laid all our sins on Him that He might carry them for us. Furthermore, when God caused the Lord Jesus to carry our sins on the cross to suffer God&rsquo;s judgment and punishment in our place, He also caused all our sins to be laid on Satan that he should bear them forever. This is revealed in type in the atonement recorded in Leviticus 16. Sin came from Satan and was passed on to us, resulting in our having a record of sin before God. God put all our sins on the Lord Jesus that He might carry them all to suffer God&rsquo;s punishment for us and cancel our record of sin before God. Having done this, God gave all our sins back to Satan that he might bear them himself. In this way, God is able to forgive the sins of the forgiven ones and cause their sins to leave them. &ldquo;As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us&rdquo; (Psa. 103:12).</p>
<p><strong>3) Forgetting the sins of the forgiven ones&mdash;&ldquo;I [God] will be propitious to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins I will by no means remember anymore&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 8:12).</p>
<p>When God forgives the forgiven ones of their sins, He also forgets their sins. When God forgives our sins, He not only cancels our record of sin and causes our sins to depart from us, but in Himself He also forgets our sins. Once He forgives us, He erases our sins from His memory and will by no means remember them anymore.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Basis for Forgiveness of Sins</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 9:22).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s forgiveness of sins is based on the shedding of blood for redemption. Because He is righteous, God cannot forgive men&rsquo;s sins without a cause. His righteousness requires that all who sin must die (Ezek. 18:4). Unless His righteous requirement is satisfied, His righteousness cannot allow Him to forgive sinners of their sins. But since the Lord Jesus died and shed His blood on the cross according to the righteousness of God, thus satisfying God&rsquo;s righteous requirement, God can legally forgive men of their sins according to His righteousness. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins&rdquo; (Matt. 26:28). Since the blood of the Lord Jesus was shed for men according to God&rsquo;s righteousness, thus fulfilling God&rsquo;s righteous requirement, it has become the basis upon which the sins of those who believe in Him may be forgiven.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Way to Receive Forgiveness of Sins</h2>
<p><strong>1) Repentance&mdash;&ldquo;Repentance for forgiveness of sins&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 24:47).</p>
<p>Repenting unto God is the first step for sinners to receive God&rsquo;s forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p><strong>2) Faith&mdash;&ldquo;Everyone who believes into Him [Christ] receives forgiveness of sins&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 10:43).</p>
<p>On the negative side, to repent is to turn away from sins, while on the positive side, to believe is to believe into Christ. To believe into Christ is to enter into Him and to be joined to Him. This is the second step for us to receive God&rsquo;s forgiveness of sins. This step immediately follows repentance.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Results of Forgiveness of Sins</h2>
<p><strong>1) Fearing God&mdash;&ldquo;But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 130:4).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s forgiveness of sins causes us to fear Him. The more we enjoy God&rsquo;s forgiveness of sins, the more we fear God.</p>
<p><strong>2) Loving God&mdash;&ldquo;Her sins which are many have been forgiven, because she [the sinful woman] loved much&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 7:47).</p>
<p>This was the word spoken by the Lord regarding the sinful woman whose sins He had forgiven. The clause &ldquo;because she loved much&rdquo; does not refer to the reason for which the Lord forgave her. Rather, it refers to the testimony of her being forgiven by the Lord. Her loving the Lord much testified that she was forgiven by the Lord much. The more we are forgiven by the Lord, the more we love the Lord. Therefore, loving the Lord is an issue of being forgiven by the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE CLEANSING AWAY OF SINS</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;He [God] may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:9).</p>
<p>This word here shows us that God&rsquo;s cleansing us from our sins closely follows His forgiving us of our sins. When He forgives us of our sins, at the same time He cleanses us from our sins.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Significance of the Cleansing Away of Sins</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 51:7); <strong>&ldquo;Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 1:18).</p>
<p>When God forgives us of our sins, He exempts us from the penalty of sins; when God cleanses us from our sins, He erases the traces of our sins. If there were only the forgiveness of sins and not the cleansing away of sins, although our sins might be forgiven, the traces of our sins would still remain. Forgiveness is a legal procedure, whereas cleansing is an actual clearance. Concerning God&rsquo;s righteous law, our sins need to be forgiven. Concerning the traces of sins in us, our sins need to be washed away. Thus, in God&rsquo;s full salvation, He not only removes our record of sin before Him according to the righteousness of His law, but He also cleanses away the traces of sins in us. His cleansing away of our sins makes us as white as snow and as wool. The cleansing that makes us as white as snow is a positional cleansing from without; the cleansing that makes us white as wool is a cleansing of our nature from within.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Two Aspects<br />
of the Cleansing Away of Sins</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Cleansing Away of Sins by the Blood</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:7).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s cleansing us from our sins is of two aspects. One is in our outward position, while the other is in our inward nature. God&rsquo;s outward and positional cleansing from our sins is through the blood of the Lord Jesus. The blood of the Lord Jesus, the God-man, outwardly and positionally cleanses us from all sin.</p>
<h2 class="head3">a. Before God</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Who [Christ]...having made purification of sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 1:3).</p>
<p>This refers to the Lord Jesus who purified us from our sins before God once for all by the shedding of His blood on the cross, thus making us positionally pure before God and before His law.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. In the Conscience of the Believers</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;The blood of Christ...purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 9:14).</p>
<p>The blood of the Lord does not purify our heart but our conscience within. Since the Lord&rsquo;s blood cleanses us from our sins before God and His law, it also purifies our conscience before itself, thus enabling us to serve our living God with boldness.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Cleansing Away of Sins by Life</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;The washing of regeneration&rdquo;</strong> (Titus 3:5); <strong>&ldquo;But you were washed...in the Spirit of our God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 6:11).</p>
<p>These two verses show us the life of God that regenerates us and our being cleansed by His Spirit. This is an inward cleansing in our nature by His life and by His Spirit. When we are regenerated, we receive God&rsquo;s life and we have God&rsquo;s Spirit dwelling in us. When God&rsquo;s life grows in us and His Spirit moves in us, a metabolic function takes place which removes and washes away the uncleanness in our nature, in our disposition. Thus, we enjoy the cleansing away of sins in God&rsquo;s full salvation both in our outward position and in our inward disposition.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON THIRTY-NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">PROPITIATION AND RECONCILIATION</h1>
<p>In God&rsquo;s full salvation, there are the items of propitiation and reconciliation; that is, God propitiates for us who once had a problem with Him, and God reconciles to Himself us who were His enemies. When we believe into the Lord and are saved, we gain and enjoy these two items.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. PROPITIATION</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...His [God&rsquo;s] Son a propitiation concerning our sins&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 4:10).</p>
<p>When we sinned against God, we became sinful before Him. This caused a problem to develop between God and us. For this reason, the Lord Jesus not only offered Himself as our sin offering on the cross (Isa. 53:10) to redeem us from our sins before God, but He also became our propitiation to appease the problem which we had with God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Significance of Propitiation</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;He [Christ] is a propitiation concerning our sins&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:2).</p>
<p>The word propitiation literally means a mediation between two parties in order to make them one. When party A develops a problem with party B, either offending party B or owing something to party B, then party B will make some demand on party A. If the demand is not met, the problem between the two parties will not be resolved, and the two will not be able to be reconciled. Thus, there is the need for propitiation. Our sins separate us from God and inhibit our fellowship with Him. They cause us to have a problem with God. Therefore, we need the Lord Jesus to be our propitiatory sacrifice to satisfy God&rsquo;s demand.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Accomplishment of Propitiation</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;He might...make propitiation for the sins of the people&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 2:17).</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption for us on the cross, He also accomplished propitiation for us. Since His suffering of death and shedding of blood dealt with the sins that caused our problem with God, they appeased the problem that was caused by sins. This enables God and us, us and God, to be mutually at peace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Application of Propitiation</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Whom [the redeeming Christ] God set forth a propitiation-cover [the lid of the ark] through faith in His blood, for the showing forth of His righteousness&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:25).</p>
<p>On the cross Christ accomplished propitiation for us through His redemption. He Himself became our propitiation, which is typified in the Old Testament by the lid of the ark in the Holy of Holies, the place where God showed mercy to man. Upon Christ as the propitiation-cover, God is able to apply the very propitiation accomplished by Christ to those who believe in Christ and draw near to God. This appeases the problem between Him and them which is caused by sin.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. RECONCILIATION</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;God...reconciling the world to Himself&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:19).</p>
<p>Reconciliation to God closely follows propitiation and is brought to us by propitiation. The propitiation accomplished by the Lord Jesus through His redemption reconciles us to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Significance of Reconciliation</h2>
<p>To be reconciled to God literally means to have a thorough change toward God. In man&rsquo;s fall, man rebelled against God, developed a problem with God, opposed God (Col. 1:21), and became God&rsquo;s enemy (Rom. 5:10). Therefore, man needs a thorough change toward God; that is, he needs to be reconciled to God through the redemption of Christ. It is not that God is reconciled to us, but that we are reconciled to God. Since God has never caused any problem with us, He does not need to be reconciled to us. Rather, it is we who have developed a problem with God and therefore need to be reconciled to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Accomplishment of Reconciliation</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;But all things are of God, who [God] has reconciled us to Himself through Christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:18-19).</p>
<p>It is of God that we are reconciled to Him. God reconciles us to Himself through Christ and in Christ. Therefore, reconciliation is all God&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p><strong>2) God &ldquo;through Him [Christ] to reconcile all things to Him, having made peace through the blood of His cross&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:20).</p>
<p>Since God wants to reconcile us to Himself, He made peace for us through the blood shed by Christ on the cross, and then through Christ He reconciled us to Himself. Therefore, this sweet matter of our being reconciled to God was accomplished by God. It was accomplished by God through Christ shedding His blood on the cross. By shedding His blood on the cross, on the one hand, Christ made peace on our behalf to reconcile us to God, and on the other hand, He accomplished the same on God&rsquo;s behalf, since it is God who made peace for us through Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Issue of Reconciliation</h2>
<p><strong>1) Having peace toward God&mdash;&ldquo;We have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:1). To have peace is to be at peace. We were once sinners, those who had problems with God. We had no peace with God and were not at peace with God. But now since we have been reconciled to God through the redemption and propitiation of Christ, we have peace toward God and enjoy peace together with Him.</p>
<p><strong>2) Boasting in God&mdash;&ldquo;We also are boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:11). Literally, the word &ldquo;boasting&rdquo; here includes the meaning of rejoicing, exulting, extolling, and being filled with pride. Since we have been reconciled to God through the Lord Jesus Christ and have gained God, God Himself has become our eternal portion. We can enjoy Him, boasting, rejoicing, exulting, extolling, and being filled with pride in Him; that is, &ldquo;we also boast in tribulations&rdquo; (Rom. 5:3), and we &ldquo;boast in hope of the glory of God&rdquo; (Rom. 5:2).</p>
<p><strong>3) Being saved in life&mdash;&ldquo;Having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:10). By being reconciled to God, we are brought into the life of Christ. As a result, we can be saved in the life of Christ, that is, saved by the life of Christ from many negative things, to be delivered from our entangling sins, from the world and its usurpation, from our flesh, our temper, and our disposition, and from our self and our natural man.</p>
<p>The above three items are the issues of our being reconciled to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Second Step of Reconciliation</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;We beseech you [believers] on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:20).</p>
<p>In the preceding text of this verse, it says that God reconciled the world to Himself. We have seen this matter previously. In this verse, God tells the believers, who are already reconciled, to be further reconciled to Him. This indicates that there are two steps in our being fully reconciled to God. The first is that when we were sinners, we were reconciled to God, being delivered from sins and being justified by God. The second is that, while we are still living in the natural life after we are saved, we are reconciled to God, being delivered from the flesh to become the righteousness of God. For the first step of our reconciliation to God, Christ died on the cross to bear our sins (1 Pet. 2:24; 1 Cor. 15:3), so that our sins may be forgiven by God and that God may justify us because of Him. For the second step of our reconciliation to God, Christ was made sin and crucified for us on the cross (2 Cor. 5:21), that we may be delivered from the flesh and that God might make us His righteousness in Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON FORTY</h1>
<h1 class="title"> SANCTIFICATION&mdash;THE SECOND STAGE</h1>
<p>Sanctification is another important aspect of God&rsquo;s full salvation, and it becomes a facet of our experience in the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SANCTIFICATION</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...ye may put difference between holy and unholy&rdquo;</strong> (Lev. 10:10).</p>
<p>The meaning of Sanctification, whether in the Hebrew of the Old Testament or in the Greek of the New Testament, is mainly separation. Thus, to be sanctified (to be made holy) in the Bible means to be separated from the ordinary and common things. Holiness is the state of God&rsquo;s nature, which is not only sinless and without evil, but also different from all and distinct from the common. Hence, whenever the Bible mentions God and the things concerning God or belonging to God, it describes them as holy. Any person, thing, or matter that is not rendered unto God or does not belong to God is common. Once it is rendered unto God and belongs to God, it is sanctified, separated.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE SECOND STAGE OF SANCTIFICATION</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 6:11).</p>
<p>It has already been mentioned in Lesson Thirty-seven that, according to the revelation in the Bible, Sanctification in God&rsquo;s salvation is divided into three stages in us: the first is for our repentance, the second is for our justification, and the third is for our transformation. The verse quoted here refers to the second stage, after washing and before justification. Hence, this stage of sanctification follows the cleansing away of sins covered in Lesson Thirty-eight and ushers in justification, to be discussed in the next lesson. Before we can be sanctified, we must first be cleansed from our sins; likewise, before we can be justified, we must first be sanctified.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. POSITIONAL SANCTIFICATION</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Receive forgiveness of sins...among those who have been sanctified&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 26:18).</p>
<p>In the second stage, the sanctification which we receive in God&rsquo;s full salvation is both positional and dispositional. Positional sanctification is a fact, a sanctified position, which we receive in Christ when we believe. The sanctification spoken of in this verse is such a positional sanctification.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Through the One Offering of Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;We have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 10:10).</p>
<p>This positional sanctification is accomplished through the offering of the body of Christ once for all, as a sin offering, to set us apart.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Through the Blood of Jesus</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...Jesus, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 13:12).</p>
<p>This positional sanctification is obtained by us through Christ&rsquo;s redeeming blood shed on the cross. Once we are bought back by the Lord&rsquo;s blood, we are separated from the world, receiving a sanctified position and being made holy unto Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. By Being Called</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 1:2).</p>
<p>This positional sanctification is obtained by us as a result of our being called by God. When we are saved and called by God, we are separated by God to be saints. This is a matter of position. Of course, we also received God&rsquo;s holy life when we were saved and regenerated, but this holy life was not yet lived out to become our experience of sanctification.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. DISPOSITIONAL SANCTIFICATION</h2>
<p>Dispositional sanctification is the sanctification lived out from within us as a result of the growth of the life that we received by believing into Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Through the Sanctifier</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all out of one&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 2:11, lit.).</p>
<p>Christ is holy, and He is also the One who sanctifies us. Both He and we are out of God the Father. &ldquo;Out of&rdquo; indicates that this sanctification is out of the divine life of God the Father, which is both in His Son and in us. Christ and we have the same life (Col. 3:4) and the same nature. God in Christ dispenses His divine life and nature into us that we may be the partakers of His divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4), thus living out a sanctified life by His divine life with His holy nature in us. Therefore, this sanctification is the sanctification of God&rsquo;s life and the sanctification we experience; it is mainly dispositional, not positional.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. In the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;You were sanctified...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 6:11).</p>
<p>The sanctification mentioned here is not the sanctification which we obtained objectively in our position through the Lord&rsquo;s blood. Rather, it is experienced subjectively in our disposition in the Lord&rsquo;s name. To be in the Lord&rsquo;s name is to be in His person, that is, to be in the organic union with Him through faith. In reality, this is to be in Himself. When we were saved, calling on the Lord Jesus, we were immediately in His name, in His living person. We entered into an organic union with Him, partook of His divine life and nature, and were sanctified dispositionally.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. In the Spirit of God&mdash;the Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;You were sanctified...in the Spirit of our God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 6:11).</p>
<p>We are sanctified dispositionally by being in the Spirit of God. This verse says that we were sanctified not only in the name of the Lord Jesus but also in the Spirit of God. The name of the Lord Jesus Christ is just His person, and His person is the Spirit. The Lord&rsquo;s name and His Spirit are inseparable. When we call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, the Lord reaches us with the Spirit. Since the Spirit is the Spirit of holiness (Rom. 1:4), when we are joined to the Lord, we experience the sanctifying work of the Spirit and are sanctified subjectively and dispositionally.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE WAY TO BE SANCTIFIED</h2>
<p><strong>1) By faith in Christ&mdash;&ldquo;...among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me [Christ]&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 26:18). To be sanctified and thus set apart unto God, we must first believe into Christ. Christ shed His blood for our redemption to purchase us (1 Cor. 6:20) that He may sanctify us (Heb. 13:12). If we desire to partake of this fact, we must believe into Him and be joined to Him. Once we believe into Him and are joined to Him, we are sanctified by His redemption, having the fact of sanctification and obtaining the position of sanctification.</p>
<p><strong>2) By being in Christ&mdash;&ldquo;...have been sanctified in Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 1:2). Upon believing into Christ, we enter into Him to be joined to Him. Since He Himself is holy (Luke 1:35), once we are in Him and are joined to Him, we are set apart to be holy. Christ is the element and sphere in which we are separated, sanctified unto God.</p>
<p>The above two items are the ways for us to be sanctified.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE MEANS OF SANCTIFICATION</h2>
<p><strong>1) Life&mdash;Christ&mdash;&ldquo;Who [Christ] became...to us from God...sanctification&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 1:30). This verse points out that sanctification is simply Christ. Upon our believing into Him, Christ comes into us to be our life. This life is holy and can cause us to live out a holy life and be sanctified.</p>
<p><strong>2) Light&mdash;the holy Word&mdash;&ldquo;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth&rdquo;</strong> (John 17:17). In order to make us holy, God gives us life within and the holy Word without. The holy Word is the truth which is able to sanctify us. The life of God within us, with its holy nature, requires us to be holy; the holy Word of God, as our sanctifying light and guidance without, teaches us to be holy. These two correspond from within and without to sanctify us.</p>
<p><strong>3) Power&mdash;the Holy Spirit&mdash;&ldquo;...having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 15:16). In order to make us holy, God also gives us the Holy Spirit to be our sanctifying power. These three&mdash;the life of Christ, the light of the holy Word, and the power of the Holy Spirit&mdash;work together to sanctify us.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON FORTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">JUSTIFICATION</h1>
<p>Justification is a key item in God&rsquo;s full salvation. After obtaining the forgiveness of sins and the cleansing away of sins, and after being sanctified, we have no further problems before God. God then has the position and the ground to justify us. This is another crucial link in our enjoyment of God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF JUSTIFICATION</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;For the showing forth of His righteousness... that He should be just and justify the one who is of the faith of Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:26).</p>
<p>In the Bible, justification means that God, according to His righteousness, declares man righteous. In other words, God justifies man according to the standard of His righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. OBJECTIVE JUSTIFICATION</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...shall be justified before Him [God]&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:20).</p>
<p> God&rsquo;s justification is in two aspects, the objective and the subjective. Objective justification is our being justified positionally according to the righteousness which we received from God (Phil. 3:9); it is our being justified by having Christ as our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30). We obtain this justification by reason of the following four items:</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. By the Grace of God</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Being justified freely by His [God&rsquo;s] grace&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:24).</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s being justified by God is, first, by God&rsquo;s grace. God&rsquo;s justifying us by His grace is His freely fulfilling all His righteous requirements for us. This justification can be accepted and received by everyone without human effort and without price; therefore, it is grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Through the Redemption of Christ Jesus</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Being justified...through the redemption in Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:24).</p>
<p>God can justify us by His grace through the redemption of Christ Jesus. Apart from the shedding of the blood of the Lord Jesus on the cross to accomplish redemption for us and to satisfy God&rsquo;s righteous requirement, there is no ground and no way for God to justify us by His grace, even if He desires to do so. However, because on the cross the Lord Jesus shed His precious blood, paid the price, and satisfied all the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness upon us (Rom. 5:9), God is able to justify us by His grace according to His righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Through Our Faith in Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Yet knowing that a man is not justified by works of law, but through the faith of Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:16).</p>
<p>Man is justified by God not only by God&rsquo;s grace and through the redemption of Christ Jesus, but also through his faith in Christ. Both the grace of God and the redemption of Christ Jesus are on God&rsquo;s side, whereas the faith in Jesus Christ is on our side. By His grace, and through the redemption of Christ Jesus, God would justify us and can justify us; yet for us to be justified by God, there is still the need of our faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Proven by the Resurrection and<br />
Ascension of Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Who [Jesus]...was raised because of our justification&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 4:25).</p>
<p>The resurrection of Christ is a proof of our justification. The death of Christ satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirements that God may justify us. Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is God&rsquo;s justification and approval of His work; hence, it is also a proof of His work.</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;...concerning righteousness, because I [Christ] go to the Father&rdquo;</strong> (John 16:10).</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s ascension to the Father in heaven after He was resurrected is also a proof of our justification, even as the third stanza of <em>Hymns,</em> #20 says:</p>
<p class="hbody">Father God, Thou hast accepted<br />
 Jesus as our Substitute;<br />
Judged the Just One for the unjust,<br />
 Couldst Thou change Thy attitude?<br />
As a proof of perfect justice,<br />
 At Thine own right hand He sits;<br />
He, as Thy full satisfaction,<br />
 Righteously Thy need befits.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, ascension, and being seated at the right hand of God are a proof of our justification by God, confirming that God has justified us because of Christ&rsquo;s death, which satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirements.</p><h2 class="head1">III. SUBJECTIVE JUSTIFICATION</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...so also through one righteous act unto justification of life to all men&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:18).</p>
<p>We have obtained the objective and positional justification by God&rsquo;s grace, through the redemption of Christ Jesus, and through our faith. This affords us the position to receive God&rsquo;s life, as stated in this verse, &ldquo;...unto justification of life.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. By the Life of God</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Having been filled with the fruit of righteousness, which is through Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 1:11).</p>
<p>When we live by God&rsquo;s life, which we received in our positional justification, we bear the fruit of righteousness through the Lord Jesus. This fruit is Christ as our righteousness, whom we live out by God&rsquo;s life, that we may be subjectively justified. This justification, which is of life, is not obtained outwardly but is lived out from within. Hence, it is subjective.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Through the Resurrected Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Who [Jesus]...was raised because of our justification&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 4:25).</p>
<p>We are subjectively justified also through the resurrected Christ. The resurrection of Christ mentioned in this verse is not only an outward proof of our objective justification; it is also for Christ to enter into us to be our life (Col. 1:27; 3:4), that we may live Him out as our subjective righteousness and thus be subjectively justified. We obtain objective justification because we believe into Christ and gain Him as our objective righteousness; we obtain subjective justification because we live by Christ and live Him out as our subjective righteousness. Objective justification causes us to have life; subjective justification enables us to grow in life and be transformed unto maturity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. In the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 6:11).</p>
<p>To be in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is to be in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ, that is, to be in the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. This speaks of our organic union with the Lord, our partaking of His divine life and nature, and our becoming subjectively righteous. That is, it speaks of our being joined to Christ in Christ to become the righteousness of God (2 Cor. 5:21b).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. In the Spirit of God</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;You were justified...in the Spirit of our God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 6:11).</p>
<p>We experience subjective justification also in the Spirit of God. When we were saved, the Spirit of God entered into us to bring to us the life of God, that we may be justified subjectively by God in life. Therefore, we obtain subjective justification in life by God&rsquo;s life, through the resurrected Christ, in His person, and in the Spirit of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE CYCLE WITH RESPECT TO REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>The six steps of experience from forgiveness to justification are all in the redemptive aspect of God&rsquo;s full salvation. These six steps constitute a perpetual cycle in the believers&rsquo; experience of the spiritual life, until the redemption of their bodies, that is, until their glorification. At the same time, repentance, which is the way to enjoy salvation, also accompanies this cycle according to the need of these six steps of experience. Before the redemption of our body, it is inevitable that we fail or become defiled. Whenever we fail or are defiled, we need to repent that we may again be forgiven, cleansed, propitiated, reconciled, sanctified, and justified, in order to thus maintain our fellowship with God and to continue to live before God. Whenever we trespass and are again defiled, we must repent once more in order to again be forgiven, cleansed, propitiated, reconciled, sanctified, and justified. This then becomes a cycle of experience repeated again and again in our spiritual life, that we may continue in the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON FORTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">REGENERATION</h1>
<p>In God&rsquo;s full salvation, when we believe into Christ and thereby experience the forgiveness of sins and the cleansing away of sins, propitiation and reconciliation, and sanctification and justification, we immediately receive God&rsquo;s regeneration. The six steps of experience spoken of previously belong to the redemptive aspect of God&rsquo;s full salvation. Regeneration (the new birth) belongs to the life aspect of God&rsquo;s full salvation, and it is the beginning of this aspect. It is therefore a most crucial matter pertaining to our enjoyment of God&rsquo;s full salvation, having to do with our living and work in the present age after we believe into Christ and are saved, as well as with our destiny in the coming age and in eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE NEED FOR REGENERATION</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;I [the Lord Jesus] said to you [Nicodemus, who sought to do good], You must be born anew&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:7).</p>
<p>Every man is willing and ready to do good, thinking that he needs simply good deeds and morality, never realizing that he needs to be born anew, to receive another life. Thus, the Lord Jesus told Nicodemus, who sought good works, &ldquo;You must be born anew.&rdquo; Nicodemus represents all those who desire to do good without knowing man&rsquo;s need. Only God and the Lord Jesus know man&rsquo;s need. This need is regeneration.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Man Being of the Flesh</h2>
<p><strong>1) Jesus said, &ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:6).</p>
<p>Man needs to be regenerated because man is born of the flesh and is of the flesh. That which is born of the flesh and is of the flesh is flesh. The flesh is not and cannot be subject to the law of God, and it cannot please God (Rom. 8:7-8). The fleshly man is brought forth in iniquity (Psa. 51:5, ASV) and is out of sin. He is sold under sin (Rom. 7:14) and belongs to sin, and he is estranged from the life of God (Eph. 4:18) and has nothing to do with God. Whether it is good or bad in man&rsquo;s eyes, that which the fleshly man has is merely a human life of the flesh, not the life of God. Therefore, man needs to be regenerated to obtain the life of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. For Entering into the Kingdom of God</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God...unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:3, 5).</p>
<p>Man also needs to be regenerated in order to enter into the kingdom of God. Unless a man is regenerated, he cannot see the kingdom of God, nor can he enter into it. The kingdom of God is spiritual, and to see this spiritual kingdom of God is to enter into it. Regeneration is the unique entrance through which man enters into God&rsquo;s kingdom. The kingdom of God is the realm of what God is, just as the plant kingdom is the realm of what plants are, and the animal kingdom is the realm of what animals are. Without plants there is no plant kingdom, and without animals there is no animal kingdom. What man is and what God is are basically different, being in two different realms and in two different kingdoms. In order to enter into the human kingdom, one must be born of man to have the human life; likewise, in order to enter into God&rsquo;s kingdom, one must be born of God to have God&rsquo;s life. Therefore, man must be born of God, that is, he must be regenerated that he may have God&rsquo;s life and may enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF REGENERATION</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Nicodemus said to Him [the Lord Jesus], How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter the second time into his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born, can he?&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:4).</p>
<p>The meaning of the words &ldquo;born anew&rdquo; is &ldquo;born again&rdquo;. Thus, Nicodemus thought that he needed to enter again into his mother&rsquo;s womb to be born a second time. Although he understood correctly the literal meaning of &ldquo;born anew,&rdquo; he misunderstood the significance of the new birth. Although to be regenerated literally means to be born again, the significance of regeneration is not to enter into the mother&rsquo;s womb and be born a second time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Regeneration&mdash;to Be Born of God</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:13).</p>
<p>To be regenerated is not to be born of blood (the fleshly life of man), nor of the will of the flesh (the will of the fallen, fleshly man), nor of the will of man (the will of the God-created man), but of God, that man may obtain the spiritual life of God. Therefore, we who are regenerated have obtained the life of God in addition to the human life which we already possess.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Regeneration&mdash;to Be Born from Above</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:3).</p>
<p>In the original language the word &ldquo;anew&rdquo; here is the same word as &ldquo;from above&rdquo; in John 3:31. Therefore, to be regenerated also means to be born from above. When we were born the first time, of our parents, we were born from the earth, from below, and the human life of the flesh which we obtained is from the earth and of the earth. When we are born the second time, of God, that is, when we are regenerated, we are born from above, from heaven, and the spiritual life of God which we receive is from heaven and of heaven. Hence, to be regenerated is to be born from above that man may have this heavenly life of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Regeneration&mdash;to Be Born<br />
of Water and the Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:5).</p>
<p>The matter of being born of water and the Spirit spoken of by the Lord Jesus refers to regeneration through the water of the baptism preached by John the Baptist and through the Holy Spirit given by the Lord Jesus. The water of baptism indicates death and burial, symbolizing Christ&rsquo;s death and burial for the termination of the repenting and believing ones. The Spirit, who is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of life and resurrection, causes the believing ones to participate in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection in order that the terminated ones may experience the germination of a new life. By being baptized into this water and into this Spirit, those who believe into Christ are regenerated and are delivered from all the old things of men to enter into the kingdom of God, which is the realm of the divine life and the divine ruling. This enables them to live by God&rsquo;s eternal life in God&rsquo;s eternal kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Spirit Begetting Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:6).</p>
<p>Regeneration is also God&rsquo;s Spirit begetting our spirit, that is, the Spirit of God regenerating our human spirit with God&rsquo;s life. When we believe into Christ and are regenerated, the Spirit of God dispenses God&rsquo;s life, God&rsquo;s element, into our spirit, enlivening our spirit and making it a new spirit (Ezek. 36:26).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE MEANS OF REGENERATION</h2>
<p><strong>1) Through the resurrection of Christ&mdash;God the Father &ldquo;has regenerated us...through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:3).</p>
<p>The first means by which God regenerates us is the resurrection of Christ. When Christ was resurrected, we who believe into Him were all included in Him and were raised up together with Him (Eph. 2:6). His resurrection dispenses God&rsquo;s life into us and enlivens us with God&rsquo;s life, that we may have the life of God and be joined to God organically. Hence, God regenerates us through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>2) Through the work of the Holy Spirit&mdash;&ldquo;And having come, He [the Holy Spirit] will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment&rdquo;</strong> (John 16:8); <strong>&ldquo;...born of the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:8).</p>
<p>The second means by which God regenerates us is the work of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit first convicts us concerning sin, concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment, causing us to repent and to believe. After we repent and believe, He brings God&rsquo;s life into our spirit that we may obtain God&rsquo;s life and may be regenerated.</p>
<p><strong>3) Through the word of God&mdash;&ldquo;Having been regenerated, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:23).</p>
<p>The third means by which God regenerates us is His living word, which is the word of God in the Bible. God&rsquo;s word in the Bible contains His life. When we believe the gospel, we believe God&rsquo;s word of life (John 5:24). Once we receive through faith God&rsquo;s word of the gospel, this word sows the life of God as the seed of life into us (1 John 3:9). Thus, God regenerates us through His word of truth (James 1:18).</p>
<p><strong>4) By man&rsquo;s faith&mdash;&ldquo;Those who believe into His name...were born...of God&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:12-13).</p>
<p>The last means by which God regenerates us is our faith. The resurrection of Christ accomplished for us the fact of regeneration, the work of the Holy Spirit applies this fact to us, and the word of God coordinates with the Holy Spirit to put this fact before us. However, there is still the need for us to receive this fact by faith. Therefore, in order to be regenerated, we must believe into Christ according to God&rsquo;s word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE ISSUES OF REGENERATION</h2>
<p><strong>1) Obtaining the eternal life of God&mdash;&ldquo;Everyone who believes in Him [Christ] should...have eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:16).</p>
<p>Eternal life is God&rsquo;s own life, that is, God Himself as life. Both God&rsquo;s nature and the functions within Him are in this life. When we are regenerated, we obtain God&rsquo;s eternal life with all the elements and functions in this life.</p>
<p><strong>2) Becoming the children of God&mdash;&ldquo;To them He [Christ] gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name: who were born...of God&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:12, 13).</p>
<p>Since regeneration causes us to obtain God&rsquo;s life, it also makes us the children of God. God&rsquo;s life is the authority for us to become God&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p><strong>3) Becoming the firstfruit of God&rsquo;s new creation&mdash; &ldquo;He [God] brought us forth...that we should be a certain firstfruit of His creatures&rdquo;</strong> (James 1:18).</p>
<p>Regeneration also makes us the firstfruit of God&rsquo;s new creation among God&rsquo;s creatures, possessing His life that matures first for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose.</p>
<p><strong>4) Having a living hope&mdash;&ldquo;...regenerated us unto a living hope&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:3).</p>
<p>Since regeneration causes us to have God&rsquo;s life, it gives us a living hope, including such things as the growth in life, the manifestation of gifts, the ability to function, transformation, and glorification. This is like the life of a newborn babe, which brings with it the hope that belongs to that life, including such matters as growth, maturity, a career, and marriage.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON FORTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">RENEWING</h1>
<p>In the life aspect of God&rsquo;s full salvation, after we experience regeneration, the experience that follows immediately is renewing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE NEED FOR RENEWING</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Put off...the old man&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:22).</p>
<p>Not long after man was created, he sinned and became fallen. In the fall of man, Satan injected his evil nature of sin into man, poisoning man completely, making man corrupt and evil, and eventually making him an old man mixed with satanic evil (Eph. 4:22). This transmuted and corrupted old man needs to be put off (Col. 3:9). Therefore, in His full salvation, God prepared this item, renewing, for us to experience and enjoy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE TRUE MEANING OF RENEWING</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Titus 3:5).</p>
<p>Here it says that God saved us through two things, the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit. This speaks of the aspect of salvation by life in God&rsquo;s full salvation, and it differs from the aspect of redemption by the blood. Salvation by life is accomplished through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit. On the negative side, the washing of regeneration is a washing that washes away our old man and everything of the old man; on the positive side, the renewing of the Holy Spirit is a renewing that brings to us God&rsquo;s life as the new element for us to become the new man. Although regeneration is accomplished once for all, the effectiveness of its washing continues along with the renewing of the Holy Spirit. The renewing of the Holy Spirit is constant, beginning with our regeneration and continuing until the transfiguration of our body and our entrance into God&rsquo;s glory. Therefore, after we are regenerated, we are saved at every time by continuing daily, even hourly, in the ceaseless renewing of the Holy Spirit. This is to be saved in the life of Christ (Rom. 5:10).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE MEANS OF RENEWING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Life of God</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;We also should walk in newness of life&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:4).</p>
<p>The newness of life proves that this life, the life of God, is a new life. Because of the fall, our created life became an old life. The life of God received in regeneration, which begins the renewing, is a new life. After regeneration, this life of God is the basic means of our continuous renewing. If we walk by this renewing life of God, we will manifest the newness of this life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. A New Heart and a New Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;A new heart also will I [God] give you, and a new spirit will I [God] put within you&rdquo;</strong> (Ezek. 36:26).</p>
<p>When we are regenerated, God not only imparts to us His life, but He also gives us a new heart and a new spirit. The new heart produces in us a new desire, a new love, and a new inclination toward God. The new spirit renders us a new ability to receive God as the satisfaction of our new man. When we desire God and love God according to this new heart and receive God by this new spirit, we are constantly renewed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Spirit of the Mind</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Have put off...the old man...are being renewed in the spirit of your mind...have put on the new man&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:22-24).</p>
<p>At the time of our regeneration, we enter into the fact of the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man through the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection. Nevertheless, after being regenerated, we still need the experience of putting off the old man and putting on the new man moment by moment in our living. This is accomplished through the spirit which is in our renewed mind (Rom. 12:2). The spirit of our renewed mind is our regenerated spirit mingled with God&rsquo;s Spirit, spreading into our mind to do the work of renewing in our mind. It is in this renewing spirit that we put off the old man and put on the new man. Thus, we are renewed, and we become a new man in the new creation in reality. With this new man, old things have passed away, and they have become new (2 Cor. 5:17). Our Christian life is not a matter of religion or self-improvement, but of being a new man of the new creation (Gal. 6:15). The ultimate aggregate of this new man of the new creation is the coming New Jerusalem, which in eternity will show forth in a particular way the renewing aspect of God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON FORTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">SANCTIFICATION&mdash;THE THIRD STAGE</h1>
<p>We have seen that in God&rsquo;s full salvation, when sanctification is applied to us, it is divided into three stages. The first stage is for our repentance, the second stage is for our justification, and the third stage is for our transformation. We saw the first stage in Lesson Thirty-seven and the second stage in Lesson Forty. Now we will go on to see the third stage, the sanctification that is for our transformation. This is the very sanctification stressed in Romans 6:19 and 22.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE POWER OF THIS SANCTIFICATION&mdash;<br />
THE SANCTIFYING SPIRIT</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 15:16).</p>
<p>According to the way in which this verse is written, sanctification is accomplished gradually. This agrees with what we saw before, that God&rsquo;s sanctification in us is divided into three stages and is accomplished gradually. Thus, the sanctification spoken of here surely includes the third and ultimate stage of sanctification, that is, to make us acceptable to God through this sanctifying transformation. This third stage is accomplished in the sanctifying Spirit. The Holy Spirit, who is the sanctifying Spirit, is the sanctifying power in this ultimate stage. We must live in this sanctifying Spirit, living and walking by Him and acting and working according to Him, in order to enjoy the sanctification of this ultimate stage.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE LIFE OF THIS SANCTIFICATION&mdash;<br />
THE SANCTIFYING CHRIST</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Christ Jesus, who became...to us from God... sanctification&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 1:30).</p>
<p>Christ is holy (Luke 1:35), and He is the One who sanctifies us (Heb. 2:11). He has become the sanctification to us from God, because He is the sanctifying life within us, infusing the elements of His divine life into our entire being to sanctify us gradually. This sanctification is not obtained at one time, outwardly in position; rather, it grows in a gradual way, inwardly in our disposition. If we desire to experience the ultimate sanctification in God&rsquo;s full salvation, we must take Christ as life and live by Him in the organic union.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE REALITY OF THIS SANCTIFICATION&mdash;<br />
THE SANCTIFYING NATURE OF GOD</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Sanctify them in the truth [reality]; Your word is truth&rdquo;</strong> (John 17:17).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s nature is holy, and the word of God brings the reality of such a nature to us that we may obtain it as the reality of our sanctification. This is to be sanctified in reality. When we live by the holy life of Christ in the sanctifying Spirit, the reality of the holy nature of God will become the reality which sanctifies us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE PERFECTION OF THIS SANCTIFICATION&mdash;<br />
THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FATHER OF SPIRITS</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;The Father of spirits...disciplined us...that we might partake of His holiness&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 12:9-10).</p>
<p>The Father of spirits, our Father who regenerates us in our spirit, desires that we may enjoy the holiness of His nature. If we do not cooperate with Him, He disciplines us, forcing us to be willing to pursue His holiness, that He may perfect us in His holiness. This is even more so in the ultimate stage of His sanctification. Therefore, we should not make light of His discipline (Heb. 12:5). If we make light of it or refuse it, we will surely lose the opportunity to enjoy His holiness in God&rsquo;s sanctification, and especially in the ultimate stage of His sanctification.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE PURSUIT OF THIS SANCTIFICATION&mdash;<br />
OUR ENDEAVORING IN LIFE</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Pursue...holiness without which no one shall see the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 12:14).</p>
<p>Literally, to pursue holiness is to press toward holiness. This, of course, refers to our constant pursuit of holiness, after we are saved and are positionally sanctified unto God, until we are mature and glorified. We should especially strive to press toward holiness in God&rsquo;s ultimate stage of sanctification. This is the endeavoring in life which we should have.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE PERFECTION OF THIS SANCTIFICATION&mdash;<br />
OUR SELF-CLEANSING</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 7:1).</p>
<p>God perfects us in His sanctification, and He also wants us to perfect ourselves in His sanctification. God perfects us through discipline; we perfect ourselves through self-cleansing, removing all defilement of flesh and spirit, and by being in the fear of God. Often, because we do not cleanse ourselves according to God&rsquo;s enlightening nor follow the Holy Spirit to remove all defilement of flesh and spirit, we even do not fear God. At that time, the Father of spirits, who is our Father in our spirit, has no alternative but to exercise His discipline on us to perfect us in His holiness. This is so that we may fear Him, be willing to cooperate with Him, and cleanse ourselves, putting away all defilement within and without, in order to perfect that which He desires us to obtain, the holiness in His nature.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. OUR WHOLE BEING ENJOYING<br />
THIS SANCTIFICATION&mdash;<br />
THE SPIRIT, THE SOUL, AND THE BODY<br />
BEING WHOLLY SANCTIFIED</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 5:23).</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s full salvation, we must enjoy God&rsquo;s sanctification to such an extent that our entire being is in this enjoyment. Our spirit, soul, and body must be wholly sanctified with God&rsquo;s holy nature, that we may be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus. This is the ultimate completion of the sanctification we enjoy in God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON FORTY-FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">TRANSFORMATION</h1>
<p>In the life aspect of God&rsquo;s full salvation, every step, from regeneration to glorification, gradually progresses forward and upward. Regeneration leads to renewing; renewing leads to ultimate sanctification; ultimate sanctification leads to transformation; and transformation is followed by maturity, conformation, and glorification. We will now consider the matter of transformation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF TRANSFORMATION</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Being transformed into the same image [of the Lord]&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 3:18).</p>
<p>In the original Greek the word &ldquo;transformation&rdquo; is a compound word composed of two parts. The first part means &ldquo;change,&rdquo; while the second part means &ldquo;the inward form,&rdquo; which implies &ldquo;element&rdquo; and &ldquo;essence.&rdquo; Thus, in the New Testament, transformation refers to a change of essence in our inward form. This reveals that the transformation of life which we enjoy in our experience of God&rsquo;s full salvation is the transformation of our inward essence. It is the adding of the element of the divine life of Christ to our human element, producing a metabolic effect, which causes a change of essence, a transformation of our inward being into the image of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE PROCESS OF TRANSFORMATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Removing the Veil</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;But whenever it [the heart] turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 3:16).</p>
<p>The veil refers to the covering on those who are under the law and who intend to keep the law. Being under the law and desiring to keep the law turn a man away from the Lord to take the law as his goal. These things cover him like a veil so that he is unable to see the Lord face to face. Self-improvement and trying to do good, apart from the Lord, have the same effect. They cause a man to turn away from the Lord and to aim at good deeds; hence, being covered by good deeds, like a person with a veil, he cannot see the Lord face to face. Since we have believed in the Lord and have turned to the Lord from things such as the law and good deeds, our heart should turn from our former aims to the Lord, that the veils which cover us may be removed and that we may see the Lord face to face.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being Freed</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 3:17).</p>
<p>When we turn to the Lord from all other goals, such as the law and good deeds, the Lord, who is the Spirit, immediately frees us. If we aim at any matter other than the Lord, we will be occupied and bound by it, so that the Lord Spirit will be unable to do anything for us. Once we turn to the Lord from that goal, the Lord immediately has the ground in us to free us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Beholding and Reflecting the Lord as a Mirror</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 3:18).</p>
<p>Since we have turned to the Lord to take Him as our goal, the veil has been removed from our face, and with an unveiled face we are able to behold and reflect as a mirror the glory of the Lord. At this moment, our face is open to the Lord, and as an unveiled mirror we are able, on the one hand, to behold His glory and, on the other hand, to reflect His glory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Being Transformed into the Lord&rsquo;s Image</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...beholding and reflecting...the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 3:18).</p>
<p>When we behold and reflect the glory of the Lord with an open and unveiled face, we are gradually transformed into the Lord&rsquo;s image, and as a mirror we reflect the Lord for others to see. This is the glorious result of our beholding the Lord face to face without any veil.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. From Glory to Glory</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...transformed into the same image [of the Lord] from glory to glory&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 3:18).</p>
<p>Our beholding the Lord face to face to reflect the Lord and our being transformed into the same image of the Lord are progressive, advancing from one degree of glory to another higher degree of glory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Being Transformed from the Lord Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 3:18).</p>
<p>In the process of His death and resurrection, Christ, who died, resurrected, and accomplished redemption for us, was transfigured to become a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). The Lord Spirit spoken of here is Christ Himself as the life- giving Spirit. After we receive the redemption accomplished through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection and are regenerated, this life-giving Spirit works in us, from our spirit through our soul, continually transforming us into the image of the Lord from glory to glory, progressing from one degree of glory to a higher degree of glory. This is the metabolic transformation that is being accomplished in us by the Lord, who is the Spirit of life, continually infusing the essence of His life into us, until we are raptured and our body is transfigured to be the same as His glorious body.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Being Transformed by the Renewing<br />
of the Mind</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...transformed by the renewing of the mind&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 12:2).</p>
<p>The glorious transformation mentioned previously takes place also by the renewing of our mind. Our mind is the entrance of our heart. Whatever enters into us must first pass through our mind before it enters into our heart. The Lord Spirit transforms us inwardly by passing through this entrance of the mind, bringing the divine essence of the Lord&rsquo;s life into us through the understanding and receiving of the mind in our heart, the desire of the emotion in our heart, and the approving of the will in our heart, in order to transform our whole being from within into the image of the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON FORTY-SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">MATURITY</h1>
<p>In the life aspect of the full salvation prepared by God for us, the transformation in life which we experience spontaneously causes us to grow in the spiritual life unto maturity. Thus, our experience also enters into the aspect of maturity in the growth of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MATURITY</h2>
<p>The meaning of the word &ldquo;mature&rdquo; in Greek is &ldquo;at the end point.&rdquo; When the word is used to describe organisms, it denotes completion, full growth, and maturity. This word is used many times in the New Testament, referring to the believers&rsquo; being full-grown, mature, and perfected in the life of God, which they receive at the time of regeneration. It indicates that although we receive the life of God when we are regenerated, after regeneration we still need to grow and mature unto perfection in this life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE NEED FOR MATURITY</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...have become those who have need of milk and not of solid food. For everyone who partakes of milk...he is a babe; but solid food is for the mature&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 5:12-14).</p>
<p>These verses show us our need to grow and mature in the spiritual life. If we do not grow and mature, we will remain in the childish stage, unable to comprehend God&rsquo;s word of righteousness, which is like solid food. Hence, like the Hebrew believers in the early days, we will be unable to comprehend the revelation of God&rsquo;s deeper word and thus be unable to participate in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The wisdom in God&rsquo;s economy can be spoken only to the full-grown (1 Cor. 2:6). To enter into God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, into God&rsquo;s eternal plan, requires that we grow and mature in the life of God.</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;At a full-grown man...that we may be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:13-14).</p>
<p>After our regeneration as believers, although we may no longer be newborns in the life of God, we still may be babes, easily tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching, deceived and led in craftiness with a view to a system of error, being tricked by Satan. We need to grow and mature in order, on the positive side, to comprehend the revelation of God and to know His economy and plan, and on the negative side, to not be deceived or tricked by Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE GOAL OF THE APOSTLES</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Whom [Christ] we [the apostles] announce, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man full-grown in Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:28); <strong>&ldquo;Who [a co-worker of the apostle]... always struggling on your behalf in prayers, that you may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 4:12).</p>
<p>In the Greek text, the word &ldquo;stand&rdquo; in the second verse is in the passive voice, meaning &ldquo;placed,&rdquo; or &ldquo;presented and displayed,&rdquo; which corresponds to the word &ldquo;present&rdquo; in the first verse. These two verses in the book of Colossians show us that the laboring of the apostles in Christ for the believers and their struggling in prayers for them are all for the believers&rsquo; growth and maturity, that they may be presented and displayed full-grown and mature before Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE COMMANDMENT OF THE LORD</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;You, therefore, shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 5:48).</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; at the beginning of this verse indicates that this word is the conclusion of the law of the new life in the kingdom&rsquo;s constitution, which the Lord decreed in the preceding text, verses 17-47. In this conclusion, the Lord commands us to be perfect (in life) as our heavenly Father is perfect. To be perfect in life is to grow and mature in life. The Lord commands us in this way in the conclusion of the law of the new life in the kingdom of the heavens because we are children born of our Father with our Father&rsquo;s life. This life is able to make us perfect in the life of our Father, as our Father is perfect. Therefore, this commandment of the Lord is based upon the divine life of the Father. It is also fulfilled by the divine life of the Father. The divine life of the Father is able to make us perfect in life as He is perfect. This is not only the Lord&rsquo;s commandment to us but also the Lord&rsquo;s expectation concerning us. We should care for the Lord&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire, keep His commandment, and grow and mature by the Father&rsquo;s life within us, thus accomplishing the will of the Triune God.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE PURSUIT WE SHOULD HAVE</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ, let us be brought on to maturity&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 6:1).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The word of the beginning of the Christ&rdquo; refers to the word in the gospel concerning Christ&rsquo;s saving us and regenerating us, that is, the word in God&rsquo;s salvation which initiates us in the spiritual life. This verse exhorts us to leave the word of the beginning, that is, to leave the beginning of our spiritual life, and to be brought on to perfection in the spiritual life. This is to grow and mature in the spiritual life.</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;Not that I...am already perfected [full-grown in life], but I pursue, if also I may lay hold of that for which I also have been laid hold of by Christ Jesus [for me to gain Him]...I do not yet reckon myself to have laid hold [of Christ], but one thing&mdash;forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal [Christ] for the prize [Christ] of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let us therefore, as many as are full-grown [in life], have this mind&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 3:12-15).</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul tells us in this passage how he pursued growth and maturity in the life of Christ. In this matter, he was never contented with himself but always pursued, forgetting the things which were behind and stretching forward to the things which were before, pressing toward Christ, who is the goal and the mark. This he did in order to gain Christ that he might grow and mature in His life. With his own pursuit as the pattern, he exhorted the believers whom he was leading and caring for to be like him, to pursue in the life of Christ, and to gain Christ fully in order that they might grow and mature. Finally, Paul said that as many of us as are (relatively) full-grown should have this mind and set this as the goal.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE PREREQUISITE FOR MATURITY</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word, that by it you may grow unto salvation&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 2:2).</p>
<p>The prerequisite for maturity in the spiritual life is to grow continually in this life. As soon as a believer is regenerated and becomes a newborn babe spiritually, he should long for God&rsquo;s word in the Bible as the guileless milk that he may grow in his spiritual life.</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;I [Paul] planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 3:6).</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, a believer is, on the one hand, a person with the spiritual life and, on the other hand, like a plant cultivated on God&rsquo;s farm (1 Cor. 3:5-9). Whether as a person or like a plant, a believer needs to grow that he may become mature. Therefore, continuing growth is a prerequisite for becoming full-grown and mature.</p>
<p><strong>3) &ldquo;But holding to truth [Christ] in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:15).</p>
<p>We grow in the spiritual life by holding in love to Christ as the truth and growing up into Christ as the Head in all things. This kind of growth, which takes Christ as the truth and which grows into Christ, is a further prerequisite for our becoming full-grown and mature.</p>
<p><strong>4) &ldquo;...holding the Head [Christ], out from whom all the Body, by means of the joints and bands being supplied and knit together, grows with the growth of God&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 2:19).</p>
<p>This verse indicates that the church as the Body of Christ grows with the growth of God by holding Christ as the Head, by receiving the rich supply from Him, the Head, through the joints of His Body, and by being knit together by the bands of His Body. This growth in the Body of Christ is also a prerequisite for our growth and maturity in the life of Christ. This prerequisite consummates in the growth of this Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. THE ISSUE OF MATURITY</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Until we all arrive...at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:13).</p>
<p>The full-grown man here refers to the church as the Body of Christ growing into a mature man. The fullness of Christ indicates the Body of Christ becoming His expression. In brief, the measure of the stature is just the stature. This stature is the church as the Body of Christ growing into the stature of Christ. This is the ultimate and full issue of the believers&rsquo; growth and maturity by the life of Christ in His Body. Our transformation in the life of Christ makes us like Him in the image of His essence; our maturity in the life of Christ makes us like Him in the measure of His stature. Thus, on the one hand, we have His image, and, on the other hand, we have His stature.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON FORTY-SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">CONFORMATION</h1>
<p>In God&rsquo;s full salvation, after we have enjoyed the growth and maturity in the life of Christ, the next step is conformation. This conformation is not accomplished by our outward following of some model; rather, it is worked out by the growth of Christ&rsquo;s life from within us. Therefore, conformation comes from the life of Christ within us, and this conformation in turn becomes our experience and enjoyment in His life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. WE BEING CREATED ACCORDING TO<br />
GOD&rsquo;S IMAGE</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 1:26).</p>
<p>Image is inward, whereas likeness is outward. This reveals to us that when God created us in the beginning, He purposed that we should be like Him, having His inward image&mdash;love, light, holiness, righteousness, and so on&mdash;and having His outward likeness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. CHRIST BEING THE IMAGE OF GOD</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...Christ, who is the image of God&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 4:4); <strong>&ldquo;Who [Christ] is the image of the invisible God&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:15).</p>
<p>Christ, the Son of God&rsquo;s love, is the image of God. He declared God that man may see God (John 1:18). We were created in God&rsquo;s image, that is, according to Christ. Thus Adam, who was created in God&rsquo;s image, is a type of the Christ who was to come (Rom. 5:14).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. CHRIST TAKING THE FORM OF MAN</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Who [Christ Jesus] subsisting in the form of God...equality with God...taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 2:6-7).</p>
<p>This verse tells us that Christ, who is the image of God, subsisted in the form of God. He then took the form of a slave (a man) and became in the likeness of men. In this way He became a God-man, having both the image of God and the form of man. On the one hand, He is like God, and on the other hand, He is like man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. CHRIST IN HUMAN FORM BEING BORN<br />
AS GOD&rsquo;S FIRSTBORN SON</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;God...raising up Jesus, as it is also written in the second psalm, You are My Son [firstborn Son]; today [the day of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection] I have begotten You&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 13:33).</p>
<p>In eternity Christ was God&rsquo;s only begotten Son (John 1:18; 3:16). Later, He took the form of man and the likeness of man to become a son of man. This Christ, who became a son of man, after passing through His death and resurrection, was begotten to be God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. This firstborn Son of God possesses both divinity and humanity, being both the complete God and the perfect man. This is different from His being the only begotten Son of God in eternity, having only divinity and not humanity, being only God and not yet man. Since the firstborn Son of God, who already had divinity, now possesses humanity, He can be like us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE BELIEVERS BEING REGENERATED<br />
TO BE GOD&rsquo;S MANY SONS</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;God...has regenerated us...through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:3); <strong>&ldquo;He should be the Firstborn among many brothers&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:29).</p>
<p>These verses show us that not only Christ, who became man and took the form of man, was born to be God&rsquo;s firstborn Son in His resurrection, but also we, His believers through the centuries, have been born together with Him as God&rsquo;s many sons in His resurrection, that He may be the Firstborn among many brothers, and that we the believers may be like Him. He was the Son of God, having only the nature and image of God, who became the Son of Man, taking the human nature and form; we were the sons of men, having only the human nature and form, who were later born to be God&rsquo;s many sons in His resurrection, having God&rsquo;s nature and image. Now, He is both the Son of God and the Son of Man, having God&rsquo;s nature and image as well as the human nature and form; and we are both the sons of men and the sons of God, having the human nature and form as well as God&rsquo;s nature and image. Therefore, we and He are completely alike in God&rsquo;s nature and form as well as in the human nature and form.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE BELIEVERS BEING TRANSFORMED INTO<br />
THE SAME IMAGE AS CHRIST&rsquo;S</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;We all [the believers]...are being transformed into the same image...even as from the Lord Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 3:18).</p>
<p>In the resurrection of Christ, the believers are first regenerated to be God&rsquo;s many sons, who have the likeness of Christ, the firstborn Son of God. They then are gradually transformed into the same image as Christ&rsquo;s in the Lord Spirit to become more like Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. THE MANY SONS BEING CONSTITUTED INTO<br />
THE IMAGE OF THE FIRSTBORN SON OF GOD</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Whom [God&rsquo;s many sons] He [God] foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:29).</p>
<p>This verse says that in eternity God predestinated us, the many sons of God, to be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God, Christ. This will be accomplished when the firstborn Son of God comes again to the inhabited earth (Heb. 1:6) to rapture us and to transfigure our body. We were regenerated in the resurrection of Christ to be the sons of God, who are like Him, the firstborn Son of God. Following this, we are being transformed daily in the Lord Spirit into the same image as Christ&rsquo;s, who is the firstborn Son of God. When the Lord comes again, our body will be redeemed, transfigured, and conformed to the body of His glory (Rom. 8:23; Phil. 3:21). By that time, we shall be completely conformed to His image, to be fully like Him even in our body (1 John 3:2), enjoying with Him the eternal divine glory. Such a glorification is the ultimate peak of our conformation in the life of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON FORTY-EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">GLORIFICATION</h1>
<p>In God&rsquo;s full salvation, we begin with regeneration and continue to experience and enjoy the rich life of Christ through renewing, sanctification, transformation, maturity, and conformation, and ultimately, unto glorification. To be glorified is to enter into God&rsquo;s glory, to experience and enjoy, without measure and without limit, the infinite and eternal life of God in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. GOD&rsquo;S PURPOSE</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...the God of all grace, who called you into His eternal glory in Christ&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 5:10).</p>
<p>Here we are told that God&rsquo;s purpose in calling us in Christ Jesus and in giving us all grace is that we may enjoy His eternal glory. In eternity past He predestinated us according to His foreknowledge, and in time He called us and justified us that we may be glorified (Rom. 8:29-30). This will be fulfilled when the Lord comes again. At that time we shall &ldquo;be manifested...in glory&rdquo; (Col. 3:4) together with Christ, who is our life today, and shall enjoy &ldquo;the glory of the children of God&rdquo; (Rom. 8:21). Our sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with &ldquo;the coming glory to be revealed to us&rdquo; (Rom. 8:18), that is, God&rsquo;s own glory (1 Thes. 2:12).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. GOD&rsquo;S LEADING</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 2:10).</p>
<p> Since God predestined that we should enjoy His own eternal glory, beginning from the day of our salvation, He leads us into His glory. As the Creator of all things, He orders and arranges all things, causing them to work for us (Rom. 8:28-30), that through them He may lead us into His glory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. GOD&rsquo;S PERFECTING</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Our momentary lightness of affliction works out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 4:17). Here we see that the affliction which we suffer today for being Christians, for following the Lord, and for witnessing for Him is momentary and light. Our momentary lightness of affliction works out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory. The working out of this affliction is God&rsquo;s perfecting work. Through affliction, God perfects us to enjoy the coming weight of glory. We suffer together with Him that we also may be glorified together with Him. Through all the things created and ordered by Him, God leads us into His glory; through afflictions, or sufferings, God perfects us to enjoy His incomparable glory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. OUR ENJOYMENT</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;What are the riches of the glory of this mystery...which is Christ in you, the hope of glory&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:27). Although we who believe into Christ have not yet entered into the glory which God predestined for us, we do have Christ in us as the hope of glory. This is a mysterious glory with tremendous riches.</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;When Christ our life is manifested, then you also shall be manifested with Him in glory&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 3:4). Today we enjoy Christ as our life. When He is manifested, we will be manifested with Him in His glory to enjoy His divine glory. That glory will free us from the slavery which the corrupted creation is under today. It is not only a glory which we desire to enjoy, but also a glory that the whole creation is eagerly expecting (Rom. 8:19-21). Today, that glory is the Christ who is in us, growing in us continually. When Christ comes, on the one hand, it is God who will lead us into that glory, and on the other hand, it is Christ who will permeate through us as the glory into which we will enter. This is Christ being glorified and marveled at in His saints (2 Thes. 1:10), that is Christ being manifested from within His believers and upon His believers as glory and as their enjoyment. In the future, our bodies will be permeated by the glory of Christ to manifest His glory; that is, our bodies will be redeemed in the life of Christ and conformed to His glorious body. We will then put off our bodies of the old creation and be freed from the slavery which both we and the corrupted creation are under, that we may enter into the freedom of the glory of the children of God to enjoy God&rsquo;s eternal glory.</p></body></html>
