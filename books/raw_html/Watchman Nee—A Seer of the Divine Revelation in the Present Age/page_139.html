<P>16)Christ Is All Spiritual Matters and Things. This book also comprises five chapters. The first three chapters are the same as the first three chapters of the preceding book; chapter four is on Christ being the matters and things of God (John 1:29; 6:35; 8:12; 11:25; 14:6; 1 Cor. 1:30; Col. 3:4; 1 Tim. 1:1; Psa. 27:1); and chapter five is on Christ versus matters or things (John 8:28; Col. 3:3-4; 1:16-20).</P><P>17)Christ Becoming Our Wisdom (1 Cor. 1:30). God has put us in Christ and has made Christ in us to be our wisdom for our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</P><P>18)Christ Is Our Righteousness. This book comprises three chapters: 1) the righteousness of God (Rom. 3:21-28); 2) Christ as our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30); and 3) our being made the righteousness of God (2 Cor. 5:21).</P><P>19)The Holy Spirit and Reality (John 4:24; 16:13; 1 John 5:6). Reality is in the Holy Spirit. Everything that is in the Holy Spirit is reality.</P><P>20)The Glorious Church or Holy and without Blemish (Eph. 5:22-32). The messages in this book use Eve in Genesis 2, the wife in Ephesians 5, the woman in Revelation 12, and the bride in Revelation 21 to illustrate all the spiritual aspects concerning the church's being glorious, holy, and without blemish.</P><P>21)The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This book is on the three aspects of the full experience of a believer. The first aspect is to know God the Father and to experience Him as the source of all blessings, as portrayed by the experience of Abraham. The second aspect is to know the inheritance of the Son and to enjoy all the rich inheritance God the Father prepared in Christ for the believer, as portrayed by the experience of Isaac. The third aspect is to know the discipline of the Holy Spirit and to experience the dealings of the natural life and the Holy Spirit working Christ into the believers, as portrayed in the experience of Jacob.</P><P>22)The Breaking of the Outer Man and the Release of the Spirit (John 12:24; Heb. 4:12-13; John 4:23-24; 1 Cor. 2:11-14; 2 Cor. 3:6; Rom. 1:9; 7:6; 8:4-8; Gal. 5:16, 22-23, 25). This book stresses the breaking of our outer man, which is the natural man, that our spirit with the Holy Spirit may be released from within us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Books on the Practicality of the Church</H2><P>In his books on central messages, Watchman Nee covered the reality of the church. He was also burdened to put out five books on the practicality of the church:</P><P>1)The Assembly Life. This book comprises an introduction and four chapters. In the introduction he stressed the need of the church. The subjects of the chapters are as follows: 1) the authority of the church, the eldership; 2) the practice of fellowship among the local churches; 3) how to meet; and 4) the boundary of a local church being the boundary of the city in which the local church is.</P>
