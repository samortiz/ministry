[1]  Often we are faithful, but despite our faithfulness there is no blessing and no fruit.
[2]  Brothers, if God brings us to the point of seeing that everything in God's work depends upon His blessing, it will bring about a basic change in our labor for God.
[3]  We would say we do not have enough, but the blessing is sufficient.
[4]  I once said to Brother Witness that if we had the Lord's blessing, the things we did right would be right and the things we did wrong would be right as well.
[5]  We may be unable to eliminate all our weaknesses, but we must ask God to have mercy on us so that we would be those who are able to receive His blessing.
[6]  God's blessing is like a bird that will only fly from the outside into a room by itself.
[7]  We often may do something right, but what can we do if God does not bless us when we do things right?
[8]  Putting it more strongly, we do not deserve any results because of our weaknesses and failures, but astoundingly we obtain something, and what we obtain is the blessing.
[9]  If we only look for results based on what we are, if we only look for a little fruit, and if we do not hope for great results, we run the risk of losing God's blessing.
[10]  For God to withhold His blessing is more serious than for Him to not grant blessing.
[11]  We labor through the night and should obtain certain results, but if God withholds His blessing, we will obtain less than we should.
[12]  We must ask God to keep us in His blessing in our work and actions.
[13]  We must come before God to see that we do not expect the results of our labor, but expect God's blessing.
