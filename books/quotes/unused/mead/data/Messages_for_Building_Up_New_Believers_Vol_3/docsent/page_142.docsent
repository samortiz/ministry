   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WHAT CHRIST WILL SETTLE WHEN HE COMES A. Injustice</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the Lord comes back, the first thing He will settle is injustice.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today the biggest problem in the world is injustice.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Isaiah 11:4 says that the Lord will judge the poor in righteousness, / And decide with equity for the afflicted of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To judge with justice is something more than what the world can do today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not a Christian s job.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the Lord comes again, He will execute justice.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>B. Wars</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the Lord comes again, He will settle all wars.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today man cannot deal with the problem of wars.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>World War II has just finished, but many places in the world are still at war.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Everyone agrees that there should be peace, but there is no real peace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man cannot achieve peace through war.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet Isaiah 2:4 says that when the millennium comes, men will beat their swords into plowshares, / And their spears into pruning hooks, / Nation will not lift the sword against nation, / Nor will they learn war anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should realize that we are not the ones to disarm others of swords and spears.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not wage wars, and we do not stop wars in the hope of achieving peace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These are things beyond us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When Christ comes, He will annul all wars and bring in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>C. Sicknesses</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Christ comes He will settle all sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today many people pay attention to public health, hygiene, and medical aid.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But sickness will never be thoroughly eradicated today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Bible the two books that speak of plagues the most are Ezekiel and Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Both books show us that plagues are in the Lord s hand; the Lord is in control of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the prophecies in Revelation and Matthew, we are told that plagues will increase in the end times.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A Christian should not be given merely to the work of hygiene and medical aid.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must realize that sicknesses in this world will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Isaiah 33:24 says that when Christ comes, no one will say, I am sick.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ezekiel 47:12 says that in the new heaven and new earth, the tree of the new city will be for the healing of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, when the Lord comes again, the problem of sickness will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>D. Famine</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the Lord comes again, the problem of famine will also be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In China many people have recently turned their attention to the problem of famine.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some have done very commendable works.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One interesting thing that our eyes have observed is that the harvest of man s labor always requires much plowing and tilling, whereas thorns, thistles, and weeds grow well without man s tending.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The tares do not need sowing, yet they make their way through the wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No matter how hard scientists and horticulturists try, they cannot stop weeds from growing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Genesis God cursed the land, and it no longer yielded its strength to man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today the earth no longer yields its strength to man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have never heard of a thorn that requires man s tilling.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is true that we have made achievements in irrigation and machineries, and improvements in seed and fertilizers, but we still cannot eliminate weeds.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Neither have we been able to take care of all of man s other needs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Man has to fight against nature and wrestle with it in order to survive.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If he allows nature to take its own course, he will not have a harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are not depreciating the efforts of the scientists.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are merely saying that such problems cannot be solved by man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God also has no intention for the church to solve these problems.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are here only for the Lord s return.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Bible says that when Christ comes back, the earth will once more yield its strength to man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Isaiah 43:19-20 and 35:1 speak of God making rivers in the desert and of the desert blossoming like the rose.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Isaiah 51:3 says that God will make the wilderness like Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When Christ comes again, there will be no more desert, and the thorns and thistles will all pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>E. Education and Knowledge</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Educators and philosophers teach men about good and evil and to turn away from evil and to choose good.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But no one can solve the problem of sin in man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No educator can give a man the knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hebrews 8:10-11 says that when Christ comes back again, we will have the knowledge of God that comes from our intuition, and all will know God, from the least to the greatest.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>F. Establishments of Vice</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There are many establishments of vice in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many places are hotbeds of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The church and the Christians are saving men out of these sinful places.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Yet these establishments remain unchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Matthew 13:41-42 says that when the Lord comes again, the angels will cast out all the stumbling blocks and those who practice lawlessness, that is, those who corrupt others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In an instant the Lord will cleanse the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>CHRISTIANS NOT TAKING ROOT ON EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What we have spoken of can be considered as the social philosophy of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In other chapters we have seen various aspects of the Christian faith and walk.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>While we remain on earth, we should do what we need to do, but our hearts should always be set on the Lord s return.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our attention should be on the heavenly calling.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We have no permanent plans for things of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Even the most spiritual things cannot bind us or imprison us in the earthly realm.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Christians should not take root on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The earth is not a place for Christians to plant their roots.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God s Word is being fulfilled bit by bit, and the Lord is at the door.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Today our eyes are not set on the problems of the church; we are waiting instead for the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is our heavenly calling.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>May the Lord be gracious to us and may our eyes be set solely upon His return.</S>
