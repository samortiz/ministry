<h2 class=head4>h. Of a Female from Sixty Years Old and Upward, Ten Shekels</h2><p>The valuation of a female from sixty years old and upward is ten shekels (v. 7b). This signifies the female’s deterioration.<h2 class=head3>3. The Person Who Was Poorer than the Valuation to Be Valued by the Priest according to His Means</h2><p>“But if he is poorer than the valuation, then he shall be presented before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the means of him who vowed, the priest shall value him” (v. 8). This signifies that we are not valued according to our spiritual age but according to our spiritual ability, not according to what we should do spiritually but according to what we can do spiritually.<p>The valuation of a person has a purpose. If you want to redeem yourself from your vow, you have to pay the cost according to your valuation. In the church life we may devote ourselves to God. Our valuation according to the spiritual scale may be a certain amount, but according to our actual condition and ability we may not be able to afford to pay that much.<p>Here we would note that in God’s redemption there is no difference of degree, but in our devotion there is the difference of degree. What we are and what we can do spiritually will be valued at our devotion.<h2 class=head2>B. The Devotion of Cattle to God</h2><p>In verses 9 through 13 we have the devotion of cattle to God.<h2 class=head3>1. To Be Holy</h2><p>“If it is cattle such as they may offer as an offering to Jehovah, all such that a man gives to Jehovah shall be holy” (v. 9). To be holy is to be sanctified to God and thus to belong to God, becoming His possession.<h2 class=head3>2. Not to Be Replaced or Exchanged</h2><p>“He shall not replace it or exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good” (v. 10a). Once devoted it is God’s forever, and its status cannot be changed by any replacement or exchange. It is difficult to change your status once you have devoted yourself. Changing your mind about your devotion will only cause trouble.<h2 class=head3>3. If an Exchange Were Made, both the Devoted Animal and That for Which It Was Exchanged Would Be Holy</h2><p>“If he should exchange animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is exchanged shall be holy” (v. 10b). Both animals would become God’s. This indicates that God aspires after our devotion.<p>Once something has been devoted to God, being placed on the altar, it cannot be returned. From this we see that we need to be careful in the matter of devoting ourselves to God. God means business; He does not play around with us. Whenever you consecrate yourself to Him you need to have a thorough consideration. Do not make your devotion in a light way.
