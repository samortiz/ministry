   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE LIFE IN RESURRECTION 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall see more of the shadow of the church life as typified in Genesis 8 and 9, this time seeing something on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>g. The Failure of the Leader</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>and the Deputy Authority</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the midst of all the positive aspects of the church life, something negative occurs the failure of Noah who was the leader and God's deputy authority on the new earth 9:20-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1 Because of the Success of His Work</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why did Noah have a failure?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because he had been very successful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the record of Genesis, Noah had become the leader on the new land and the father of all mankind on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At that time, he, as the father and leader of all mankind, undoubtedly was under God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Noah began to be a farmer and planted a vineyard 9:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We know he was successful in this because the vineyards produced grapes from which wine was made 9:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then Noah became somewhat loose.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The grape wine was nourishing, and Noah drank it in excess.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was wrong in this looseness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He should have exercised self-control, but he did not, and became drunken.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Being drunken, he was not only loose, but was careless, becoming naked without realizing it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was unconsciously naked, and his son, Ham, saw this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This shows us that we all must be careful whenever we experience success under God's blessing, for that success can easily cause us to be loose and careless.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not be overly joyful with our success.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead, we should be joyful in our suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we suffer, we must rejoice Rom 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But when we are successful, we must be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Any kind of success can cause you to be loose in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After being loose, you may become careless.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then you may lose your consciousness and even become naked.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What does it mean to be naked?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It means to lose your covering in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here I must speak a strong word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As fallen human beings, we need a covering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need a covering not only spiritually, but also physically.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Spiritually and physically we must be covered in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before the fall of man, man was naked before God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There was nothing wrong with that nakedness because there was no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After the fall, because sin has come in, it is sinful to be naked.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are sinful in our nature and need a proper covering in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Physically speaking, the proper covering is our clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Immediately after the fall, Adam and Eve discovered that they were naked and tried their best to cover themselves 3:7 , but they did not do it very well.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then God came in and covered them with the skins of the sacrifice 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That covering was also a type of Christ as the covering for fallen people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Physically speaking, fallen man needs a covering, especially before God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The priests were not allowed to be naked; they had to be fully covered when they came into the presence of God Exo 20:25-26; 28:40-43 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>People today like to be naked, exposing their bodies as much as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is no need to ask what the Bible says about this just ask yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do you not feel that it is shameful to be naked?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Your nature tells you that it is.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The situation today is pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>People not only go against the Bible, but also against their own nature and consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Both males and females must cover their bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Due to this deep conviction, I try to cover myself as much as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I do not like to have my body exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The more we are covered, the more we hide ourselves under a covering, the more peace we have.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When I was young, I saw some people who wore short pants in the summer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If I were to wear short pants when I stand up to minister, I would not be able to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even if I were to stand on the platform with bare feet or wear a short-sleeved shirt, I would find it difficult to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The more we expose our physical body, the less peace we have.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you read the Bible, you will find that this conviction regarding nakedness comes from the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Regardless of how holy we are, we still need a covering.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our physical body must be covered.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If I could have my whole body covered, including my head and my hands, I could speak much better, because I would have the assurance that no one would see me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I could speak in a covered way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We all must cover ourselves as much as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need a spiritual covering even more than a physical covering.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What is our spiritual covering?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In typology, all garments and clothing are types of Christ as our covering Luke 15:22; Psa 45:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To be naked spiritually speaking means to lose your covering in the presence of God, that is, to lose Christ as your covering.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In fellowship, many times the brothers become overly excited about some success that they have had.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When, in that excited talking, they become loose and careless, they lose Christ as their covering.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They talk in the presence of God without any covering.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I have seen this among the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some dear sisters prayed very spiritually with a full covering in the church meeting, but when the time came for them to fellowship with one another about certain exciting things, they became loose and careless.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They lost Christ as their covering.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In a sense, they were drunken and naked.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Whenever I saw this situation among the sisters, I did not dare to enter in. From my learning in the past, I have come to realize that it is not good to see the nakedness of any saint.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When the sisters engage in that kind of excited, naked fellowship, it is not good for me to see what is there.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I like to see a wonderful prayer meeting, a meeting that is so high, with the prayers strong, and all the brothers and sisters fully under the covering of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is a blessing to see such a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But, when I see a negative situation, I run away, for I do not like to see what is exposed there.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We all must be careful not to be excited to the degree that we become loose, careless, drunken, naked, and lose the proper covering.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Many times we were like this even while talking about spiritual things or about the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Perhaps we were even talking about a high church meeting, but we talked about it in a naked way without the covering of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>As fallen human beings, we must keep ourselves covered by Christ in every kind of activity, in everything that we do or say.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I would not do anything without Christ covering me.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I would not talk to my wife, my children, or to my brothers or sisters without being covered by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If I do anything without the covering of Christ, it means that I am loose, careless, drunken, and naked.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It means that I have lost my self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>That was exactly what happened to Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Young people must learn how to be fully covered in their attitude, talk, and even in their fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is a real lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Whatever you lack now will be fully exposed when you are older.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We older ones must realize that our present lack exposes the lack of learning when we were young.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It is just the same as in education.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If you do not learn sufficiently when you are young, you will feel that you lack certain knowledge when you become old.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It is good to be saved as early as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The young people must be encouraged to learn the lessons now.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Otherwise, when they are older, their shortage then will expose the lack of learning today.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Now is the time to learn some of the lessons of the fine details concerning the spiritual life.</S>
