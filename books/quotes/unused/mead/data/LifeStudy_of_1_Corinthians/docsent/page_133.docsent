   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. His Rights</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 3 Paul says, My defense to those who examine me is this.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to pay attention to the words examine and defense.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Corinthians were actually examining Paul; they were investigating him to determine whether or not he was an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What a shame to them!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is just like children examining their father to see if he is a genuine father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The colon at the end of verse 3 in the text indicates that the following verses are intended to be Paul s defense.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Certain so-called spiritual people think that a believer should never make a defense for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They claim that Christians should always suffer, bear the cross, and refrain from defending themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, sometimes the Lord Jesus defended Himself, and here Paul set forth his defense before the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 4 Paul asks, Do we not have a right to eat and to drink?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Literally the Greek word rendered right is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The same word is used in 8:9 and 9:18.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The right here is that of eating and drinking for the gospel v. 14 at the expense of the saints and the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verse 5 Paul continues, Do we not have a right to take along a sister as a wife, even as the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once again, Paul s words are strong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The complicated philosophical believers at Corinth made it necessary for him to speak in such a strong, direct way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 6 says, Or only I and Barnabas, have we not the right not to work?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not to work here means not to have a job.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some of the apostles did not work at a job, but were supported by the church or by the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul and Barnabas had the right not to work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But they worked with their hands in order to supply their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 7 Paul asks, Who at any time carries on a war at his own expense?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Or who shepherds a flock and does not eat of the milk of the flock?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul s reference to carrying on a war implies that formerly the Corinthians were captives and that Paul had fought for them so that they might be released from Satan and set at liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here Paul seems to be saying, We have fought in a war to release you from captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Should we carry on such a war at our own expense?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Is it fair that we must do so?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, Paul s word about a vineyard and a flock indicates that the believers at Corinth were a vineyard to produce fruit and also a flock shepherded by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verses 8 through 10 say, Am I speaking these things according to man?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Or does not the law also say these things?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For in the law of Moses it is written: You shall not muzzle a threshing ox.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Is it for the oxen that God cares?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Or does He say it assuredly for our sake?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For our sake; for it was written that the plower should plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope of partaking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here Paul quotes the Old Testament in a wonderful way and applies it to the present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He also says that the plower should plow in hope and he who threshes, in hope of partaking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here he again likens the church in Corinth to a farm.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 3:9 he had told them that they are God s farm.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul plowed the ground and threshed in hope of partaking.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In verse 11 Paul says, If we have sown to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your fleshly things?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once again Paul is quite strong.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Corinthians did not have a case against him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In verse 12 Paul continues, If others partake of this right over you, should not rather we?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But we did not use this right; but we bear all things that we may not cause any hindrance to the gospel of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Greek word translated bear literally means to contain as a vessel, to conceal; hence, to cover as a roof.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul was like a vessel containing everything the Corinthians had done to him and also like a roof covering them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But they forced him to remove the covering and pour out the contents of the vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In all this Paul s concern was not to cause any hindrance to the gospel of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In verse 13 Paul again refers to the Old Testament when he asks, Do you not know that those who labor on sacred things eat the things of the temple; those who attend to the altar partake with the altar?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In verse 14 he applies this principle to those who preach the gospel: So also the Lord has ordained that those who announce the gospel live of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In verse 15 Paul declares, But I have used none of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>And I did not write these things that it might be so with me; for it is good for me rather to die than that anyone should make my boast empty.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Here we see that the apostle is desperately absolute for the Lord s interests.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is willing not only to sacrifice all his rights vv.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>12, 15a, 18 , but also to pay the price even of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Paul definitely did not write these things in order to receive support or gifts from the believers at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the contrary, he was willing even to die for Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we look into the depths of 1 Corinthians 9, we shall see that Paul was not only a person one with God, but was also a person with a pure heart and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>No other portion of the Bible presents such a picture of a person who is clean and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If Paul had not been pure, he would not have been able to write all these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Problems among Christians are caused not only by their complications, but even the more, by their lack of purity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For the most part, the complications are on the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Under the surface lies impureness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The elders, the co-workers, and the saints may not be pure in their motive or intention.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To be pure is to be genuine, single, and altogether without politics.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In this chapter we should be deeply impressed by the fact that Paul was pure and genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Corinthians, by contrast, were not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They examined Paul and had doubts concerning his apostleship.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In their motives, thoughts, and feelings they were impure.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some of the Corinthians even thought that Paul was defrauding them, that he was cheating them in a crafty way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Had they been pure even as Paul was pure, they would have had no doubts about Paul or his apostleship.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Brother Nee once said that those who are thieves are often worried that others will steal from them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If someone suspects that a person sitting nearby will steal from him, this may indicate that he himself is a thief.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If he had not stolen from others, he would not have the fear that others might steal something from him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the same principle, because the Corinthians were not pure, they suspected that Paul was not pure and that he was taking advantage of them.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The fact that they had such thoughts about Paul proves that they were impure.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This evil of impureness is hidden in us all.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Because of our fallen nature, we are all impure.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Suppose a brother comes to me with a gift, and I suspect that this gift is presented with the intention that I do something for the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This thought is not sinful, but it is impure.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Concerning the receiving of gifts, I have learned an important principle from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This principle is to accept every gift as genuine, having no thought that it may be given with a motive, and then not do anything for the one who gives the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>To do something for a person who gives us a gift indicates that we have been bribed.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A few times people have given me things out of an impure motive.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>At the time I had no thought that those persons were impure; only later did I learn that the motive was not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>To repeat, thinking that a gift is given out of an impure motive indicates that we ourselves are impure.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If we are pure, we shall not think like this.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I appreciate Paul s word in verse 15: But I have used none of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>And I did not write these things that it might be so with me.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Such a word exposed those Corinthians who thought that Paul wrote in this way so that he would be given some support or supply.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Paul closed the door on such impure thoughts by saying plainly that he did not write with the intention of receiving anything from the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Once again we see that Paul was one spirit with the Lord and that he was absolutely pure.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Because of his purity, he could be frank, direct, and straightforward.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If Paul s purpose in writing chapter nine had been to be supplied by the Corinthians, Paul would have been impure.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>However, in writing this Epistle Paul was pure.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In the church life today many problems are apparently due to complications; actually, the problems are caused by impureness.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>It is impure to say or do anything with the aim that others will do something for us.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>It is also impure to think that others are trying to take advantage of us.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In the church life we must close the door to impure thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If we are impure, we shall not be able to be bold, frank, or direct.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Instead, we shall be political, polite.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In 1 Corinthians 9 we see that Paul s only motive and intention were related to Christ and His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Paul was pure to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If we were pure in the church life in every respect, there would not be any problems.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The underlying cause of problems in the church life is impureness.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>On the one hand, the Corinthians asked questions of Paul; on the other hand, they examined him.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>They welcomed him, but they also had doubts about him.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>This exposes their impureness.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>But even though the Corinthians were not pure, Paul conducted himself in a pure way as a begetting father.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>In writing to the believers at Corinth he revealed himself as a person who was one with God and absolutely pure.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>In the Lord s work he had no motive other than Christ and the Body.</S>
