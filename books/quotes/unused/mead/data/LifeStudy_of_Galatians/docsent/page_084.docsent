   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Neither Circumcision nor Uncircumcision</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>but a New Creation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Circumcision is an ordinance of law; the new creation is the masterpiece of life with the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The former is of dead letters; the latter is of the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, it counts, it avails.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This book exposes the inability both of the law and of circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Law cannot impart life 3:21 to regenerate us, and circumcision cannot energize us 5:6 to live a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the Son of God who has been revealed in us 1:16 can enliven us and make us a new creation, and Christ who lives in us 2:20 can afford us the riches of His life to live the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Law is replaced by Christ 2:19-20 , and circumcision is fulfilled by Christ s crucifixion 6:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation with Christ as its life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The new creation spoken of in 6:15 is the old creation transformed by the divine life, by the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The old creation was old because God was not part of it; the new creation is new because God is in it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We who have been regenerated by the Spirit of God are still God s creation, but we are now His new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, this is real only when we live and walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever we live and walk by the flesh, we are in the old creation, not in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Anything in our daily life that does not have God in it is the old creation, but what has God in it is part of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s intention is that we become a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This new creation is composed of sons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In a very practical sense, the corporate sonship is God s new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those in the old creation are sons of Adam in the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But through God s redemption and regeneration and through the dispensation of Himself into us, we who once were sons of Adam have now become sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here in this divine sonship we are the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we would be in the new creation, we must enter into an organic union with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Apart from such a union, we shall remain in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But now by the organic union with the Triune God we are in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here in the new creation neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything or avails anything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Apparently Paul wrote the book of Galatians to deal with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually this book deals with the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although Paul tells us that we are justified by faith, the main point is not justification, but the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we were in the flesh, we were very much involved with the law and we were, of course, in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But when we are in the Spirit, we are not under the law and we are in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, Paul s concern in Galatians is not merely with the doctrine concerning the law and justification by faith; it is with the revelation that we are God s new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here we are no longer involved with law-keeping, circumcision, and religious practices.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the new creation only one thing is vital and crucial to us the Triune God who has been processed to become the life-giving Spirit so that He may be our life, our nature, and our everything through the organic union between us and Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How wonderful it is that in this organic union we are a new creation!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many readers of Galatians have missed this crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They have seen that in this Epistle the law is set aside and that justification by faith is emphasized.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But Paul s burden in this book is not merely justification by faith; it is to unveil to his readers the matter of sonship by the divine life, by the Triune God becoming everything to us in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When considered corporately, the sons of God are the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The main issue in Galatians is not circumcision or uncircumcision, religion or no religion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is an issue of whether or not we are the new creation through an organic union with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we would live the new creation, we need to experience the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to 6:14 and 15, the cross deals with the religious world.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is unfortunate that many Christians regard the world in 6:14 as only the secular world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But as we have already indicated, the context makes it clear that the world in this verse is primarily the religious world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This understanding fits the basic concept of the whole book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This book was written not to deal with the secular world; it was written to deal with religion, with Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this book Paul deals with religious people, with those who are concerned for the things of God, but who express their concern in a wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To them, religion has become a world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, we have both the secular world and the religious world.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today millions of Christians are occupied even more by the religious world than by the secular world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Take Christmas as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The celebration of Christmas is certainly related to the religious world.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you still observe Christmas, it is doubtful that you are living a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The celebration of Christmas has nothing to do with God s new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By the cross we are separated from the religious world.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we are still involved with the religious world, we shall not be able to live a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should be able to say that the religious world has been crucified to us and that we have been crucified to the religious world.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should be able to testify that even if we tried to go back to that world, we would be rejected by it, for we have been crucified to it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even if Paul had desired to return to Judaism, the religionists would not have accepted him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, they would have commanded him to leave, for he was in another world.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To Judaism Paul had been crucified, and Judaism had been crucified to him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Between him and the religious world there was the separation of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is this separation which qualifies us to live a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Everything practiced in the religious world is part of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But through the cross of Christ, we are finished with religion and are in another world, another realm.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this realm we live a new creation by the Spirit, not the old creation by the flesh.</S>
