   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Heart after God's Will</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A person who has learned the lessons is one who is always fearful of God and who always fears Him in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whether or not a man fears God depends mainly on whether or not he does things by himself or by the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To love God is a matter of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To fear God is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the heart is right before God, it is all right even if the things are done a little bit off.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes I hear people say that we should pray more about such-and-such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I hear this, I do not feel at peace about it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It does not mean that the words are wrong, but the person who says the words is not a proper person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Solomon said that it is ugly to put a golden ring on the nose of a pig Prov 11:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The golden ring is surely good, but some people are like the nose of the pig; their hearts are not right, and they do not have a proper kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Can a person love a pig just because it has a golden ring on it?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you take away the ring, nobody will want the pig any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as a person is after God's will, this person is a right person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A handsome person is handsome even if he puts on pig's skin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many people talk about God's will, but they are not proper persons.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such persons can never really know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God can never reveal His will to an improper person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To have the blessing is one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To have the blessing does not mean that you are a proper person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our God is not stingy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God blesses even those whose hearts are not right.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our hearts must be calibrated on God, in the same way that the needle of a meter should be calibrated to the scale.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First a Proper Heart, Then a Proper Person</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a person's heart is right, that person is right.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even if he does the wrong things, he will not veer off very much.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even when he makes a mistake, he will not go too far off.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whether or not you can become a blessing to others depends on your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you are a proper person, wherever you go, you will become a blessing there.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a person's heart is not right, even if he were to accomplish monumental works, others will still not receive the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some people have become a problem to us, not because of what they have done, but because of their person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With the conscience, it is a question of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With the heart, it is different; the heart only deals with the question of being for God or not for God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The heart must be set on God, instead of set on the works.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many things in the church life, such as the persons, the things, the events, the relationships one with another, the love toward the church and the brothers and sisters all these can turn man's heart away from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A sinner is saved by turning his heart to God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is not saved through having something to do with any person, things, or events.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a robber comes to you and tells you that he will treat you well, you should not believe in him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The reason for this is that the person himself is not a proper one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One story goes that a yellow fox was once paying a New Year's visit to a chicken.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The heart of the fox was not right, for after the visit he intended to swallow the chicken down into his stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The chicken would not believe in the fox, because the fox's heart was not right.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In serving the Lord, we have to pay attention to the person, and not merely to doing the right things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>OUR WORK BEING TO PERFECT OTHERS Producing Apprentices and Developing Talents</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our work does not depend on the achieving of the job, but on the perfecting of men.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to produce apprentices and develop the personnel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order for a company to expand, it must discover the talents.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>During the past few years, our church life did experience some shortages.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In all the churches, the attendance is high, and those who come to listen to messages are many, but you cannot find the suitable persons.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To do a work is easy, but to produce some apprentices is hard.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we are to preach the gospel and save sinners, we have to do it in such a way that some men are perfected in our work before God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For someone to be able to do something himself is not so extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To be extraordinary, a person has to be able to cause others to do the same thing that he is doing, and even to do it better than he does.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A person does not have to be a scholar himself, but he has to be able to produce an apprentice who is a scholar.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the same way, a person does not have to be a performer himself, but he has to be able to train others to become performers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some can only do a good job if they are to do it themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is like some people who cannot tolerate having an amah, a servant, not because they are ill-tempered or they are unkind, but because they always think that they alone can do the job well; nobody else can.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To them, no amah is suitable.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They have to make their own dumplings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If the amah were to make the dumplings for them, they would think that the dumplings are not right.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Actually, they may be making dumplings that are clumsy and ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Yet they still think that they are the only ones who can do it, and that no one else can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There is a fallen concept within man; people always think that what they do is better than what others can do.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Actually, if you are truly good at doing something, you can pass on the skill to others and can help others to become just as good.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If others do not do it right, you can ask them to do it again, until they become as good as you are.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you would do this, it shows that you are one who has learned the lessons and has been dealt with by the Lord.</S>
