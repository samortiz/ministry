   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Intensified for God's Move</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Seven is the number of completion in God's dispensational move, while twelve is the number of completion in God's eternal administration.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, God created the earth in six days plus one Sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, there are seven dispensations in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For God's move today, the church has the number seven.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the book of Revelation the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls are all for God's dispensational move.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, the sevenfold Spirit is the intensified Spirit in God's move today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is the seven Spirits of God for God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As seven is the number for completion in God's operation, so the seven Spirits are for God's move on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In substance and existence, God's Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God's operation, God's Spirit is sevenfold.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is like the lampstand in Zechariah 4:2.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In existence it is one lampstand, but in function it is seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the time the book of Revelation was written, the church had become degraded and the age had become dark.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God was needed for God's move and work on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all are familiar with three-way bulbs, light bulbs that can be switched to three successive degrees of illumination.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we do not need very much light, we switch the bulb to the first degree, but when we need more illumination, we switch it to the second or third degree.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In like manner, the seven lamps on the lampstand were the sevenfold, intensified light.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the four Gospels, the Spirit of God was one-fold because at that time there was not the need for so much light.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, after the church had been degraded and the age had become exceedingly dark, there was the need for the Holy Spirit to be intensified sevenfold.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this way the one Spirit of God has become the sevenfold Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In existence, the Holy Spirit, like the lampstand in Zechariah, is one, but in function the Holy Spirit is seven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE SEVEN LAMPS OF FIRE BURNING</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>BEFORE THE THRONE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Revelation 4:5 also tells us that "seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that God will touch the earth by the seven lamps, by His seven Spirits which are burning, shining, observing, searching, and judging.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The seven lamps here refer to the seven lamps of the lampstand in Exodus 25:37 and the seven lamps of the lampstand in Zechariah 4:2.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The seven lamps of fire which are the seven Spirits of God signify the enlightening and searching of the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Exodus 25 and Zechariah 4, the seven lamps, signifying the enlightening of the Spirit of God in God's move, are for God's building, either for the tabernacle or the building of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here the seven lamps are for God's judgment, which will issue also in God's building the building of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>While God executes His judgment, His sevenfold intensified Spirit will carry out God's eternal building by searching, enlightening, judging, and infusing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is fully developed in the following chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The issue is the consummation of the holy city, New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE SEVEN EYES OF THE LAMB</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, in Revelation 5:6, John saw "a Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A. For Moving and Transfusing</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our eyes are for our moving.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we are blind, it is very difficult to move.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In God's move today, Christ as the Lamb of God has seven eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The seven eyes of the Lamb are also for watching, observing, and transfusing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I look at someone, something of me is transfused into him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We often talk about loving one another; but how can you realize that someone loves you?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Love is transfused through the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you look at me in a loving way, your eyes will transfuse your love into me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When Christ looks at us with His seven eyes, we may be terrified at first.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually, however, these seven eyes will transfuse Christ's element into us.</S>
