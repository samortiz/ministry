   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ENJOYING THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although the building of the church is taking place, we ourselves cannot build the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some may find this hard to believe and say, "In the past you told us to endeavor to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now you are saying that we cannot build up the church."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the one hand, the church has already been built, and there is no need for us to build it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the other hand, the building of the church is still going on in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In a very real sense, we do not need to build the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead, we should simply stay in the building and enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In John 2:19 the Lord Jesus said, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Are these three days over, or are they still going on?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is difficult to answer this question.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As far as accomplishment is concerned, the three days are over.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But as far as enjoyment is concerned, we are still in these three days.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Are we, then, accomplishing the building, or are we enjoying what has already been built?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is hard for our limited mentality to answer this question.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to our way of thinking, we are still doing the work of building.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Apparently, we are doing the work of building; actually, we are enjoying what has already been built.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may experience the building in resurrection every day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I am not speaking something I have not experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What I am telling you is what I have been experiencing and enjoying.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Day by day, I enjoy what the Lord Jesus has accomplished in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In chapter two of John there are two signs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first is the changing of water into wine; the second is the raising up of the destroyed temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thank the Lord that today we are for this and in it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have this living, and we are for this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are living a life of changing water into wine for the unique purpose of building up Christ's mystical Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Gospel of John is deep because it gives the mysterious stories of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Most of today's Christians neglect the mysterious matters revealed in this Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We thank the Lord that He has brought us into these mysterious stories of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because these matters are mysterious, we cannot adequately utter all that we see concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, I believe that the Spirit will speak much more to you than I am able to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we shall all enjoy an inner, mutual understanding concerning the changing of death into life for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Praise the Lord for the revelation in John 2!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this chapter we see the changing of water into wine for the unique and glorious goal of building up the mystical Body of Christ.</S>
