<h1 class="title">THE SEVEN EYES OF GOD<br />
FOR TRANSFUSION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Zech. 4:10; 2 Chron. 16:9a; Rev. 5:6; 4:5; Psa. 33:18; 32:8</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEVEN LAMPS ENLIGHTENING AND BURNING</h2>
<p>We have seen that the golden lampstand involves a number of items. In the previous message, we saw that the seven lamps of the golden lampstand ultimately become the seven lamps of fire. Do not think that the seven shining lamps and the seven lamps of fire are completely identical. They are very similar but they are not absolutely identical. The seven lamps in Exodus were seven shining lamps without any burning fire. Lamps are usually shining but not burning; however, when we come to Revelation, the seven lamps on the lampstands are not only brightly shining but also burning. Revelation 4 says that lightnings, voices, and thunders come forth out of the throne and that there are seven lamps of fire burning before the throne. By looking at this picture, we can see that God wants to have His move, His government, and His economy and that God&rsquo;s move is in the lamps of fire. There are seven lamps of fire burning before the throne of God, that is, before God Himself. Not only is there light for shining and enlightening, but there is also fire for burning. Furthermore, this burning is for motivating. In a remarkable way, Revelation 4 also says that these seven burning lamps of fire are the seven Spirits of God, and chapter five says that the seven Spirits are the seven eyes of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Seed and the Harvest of the Revelation<br />
in the Bible concerning the Golden Lampstand</h2>
<p>We should never consider that these matters are in the Bible in a random, coincidental way. The revelation in the Bible is progressive. It may be compared to a seed planted in the soil. At first, all we know is that a seed has been planted and is buried there, but we cannot see anything. After a period of time, we can see a sprout coming forth, but it is so small that it is difficult to distinguish what the plant is. After another period of time, the stem comes out, and gradually small branches appear with leaves on them. Sometime afterwards, it blossoms and bears fruit, and lastly, there is a harvest. At that time, everyone is clear at one glance what kind of plant it is.</p>
<p>Most of the biblical revelations are sown as seeds in Genesis, but a small number are sown in the second book, Exodus. The seed of the golden lampstand is sown not in Genesis but in Exodus, and the growth is in 1 Kings. The golden lampstand in 1 Kings is in the holy temple; yet, although the growth of the seed is there, the golden lampstand is still vague because we cannot see its relationship to the Spirit. When we finally come to Zechariah 4, we see that the emphasis of the golden lampstand is not Christ but the Spirit, who is signified by the olive oil within the lamps. Therefore, in Zechariah there is a further development. This is a big step, but there is still no harvest. Where is the harvest? It is in Revelation. In Revelation we see that the golden lampstand has developed and arrived at its ultimate goal&mdash;the church. With the church there is Christ, and with the church there is also the Spirit. The church is the reproduction, the reprint, of the Spirit with Christ. In this reprint, we see the Spirit, and we also see Christ. These two&mdash;Christ and the Spirit&mdash;added together become the church. What is the church? Today we can strongly say that the church is the manifestation of Christ added together with the Spirit. When Christ and the Spirit are manifested together, that is the church, and that is also the golden lampstand. I hope that all the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery can have their eyes opened to know the church to this extent.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Golden Lampstand in Exodus&mdash;<br />
the Shining Lamps for Enlightening</h2>
<p>There are seven lamps on the golden lampstand. In Exodus, the seven lamps enlightened in the darkness so that the priests who served God could move in the realm of God&rsquo;s presence, that is, in the Holy Place. There wais no door or window in the Holy Place, so without the golden lampstand there would be no light, and the priest could not know what to do or how to move when he entered to serve God. In the Holy Place there was a golden lampstand, upon which were seven lamps shining forth brightly. A priest who entered into the Holy Place immediately knew God&rsquo;s move and God&rsquo;s economy.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Ultimate Significance of the Golden Lampstand &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
