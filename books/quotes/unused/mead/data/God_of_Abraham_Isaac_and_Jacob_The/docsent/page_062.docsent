   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>But thank the Lord that this was God's hand upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Bethel God said that He would bring him back to the land.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God promised that he would return.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before that, however, He first wanted him to know God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God was holding Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He put Jacob in the house of Laban, a man who was as crafty, clever, and shrewd as he was, so that Jacob would be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>During this period, Jacob began to learn to submit under the mighty hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But this does not mean that Jacob as a person had changed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Jacob still devised methods to make the lambs spotted and speckled so that they would become his.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jacob was still the same old Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even Laban could not deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even though Laban changed his wages ten times, Jacob still had the way to come out ahead of him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God had a purpose in Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to fulfill His purpose, God disciplined him in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He wanted to deal with his strong points.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was God's work which He wanted to accomplish in Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He dealt with Jacob step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For twenty years Jacob was repeatedly wounded and he repeatedly suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the one hand, God was working in him to discipline him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the other hand, his flesh was still present, and he was as cunning and crafty as before.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, God did not give up working on him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through all of his adverse circumstances, he eventually came to acknowledge God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob thought about returning home.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But his days of discipline were not yet fulfilled, and he still had to submit under the hand of Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He could not leave one day too soon.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should believe that everything that passes through God's hand is good.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our circumstances are arranged by God and are there for our benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every environmental arrangement is for our benefit; it deals with the strong points in our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We hope that God will not need to use twenty years to deal with us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But unfortunately, some people do not learn the lesson even after twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although some people have been tested and disciplined, they never advance; it is a pity that their flesh is never touched or weakened, and they are still scheming and supplanting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brothers and sisters, we should not complain that God's hand is too heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God knows what He is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Originally, Jacob was a merciless person, but after he was disciplined by God, he became a kind and loving person in his old age.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>May we see that all our experiences in our environments are measured one by one by the Holy Spirit according to our need.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No experience comes to us by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the experiences we encounter are arranged by the Holy Spirit and are there to edify us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>While we are passing through these disciplines and trials, we may not feel joyful or comfortable, but they are all part of God's work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Afterwards, we will realize that these experiences were all for our benefit.</S>
