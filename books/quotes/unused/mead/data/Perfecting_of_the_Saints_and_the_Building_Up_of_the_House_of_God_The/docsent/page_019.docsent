   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EFFECTIVENESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Chinese have a saying that a single statement may cause a nation to rise or to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This shows the serious effect of words.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Words can save a person s life or destroy a person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Words can also cause a country to rise or to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Likewise, the building up or the tearing down of a church depends on the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The brothers serving in the ministry of the word must realize the importance of their responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we minister the word in a poor way, the church will suffer loss, but if we serve well, the church will benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, whether the church suffers loss or is benefited depends on us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One day we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ to give an account to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord will surely question us concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The brothers who minister the word must not blame the saints or the church for not doing well.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, we must bear the blame and admit that the problems are a result of a deficiency in our ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must not shirk our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may blame the church, but when another worker, who can supply the church with a strong ministry in the word, comes, the condition of the church will change.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The ministry of the word causes the saints to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is wrong for a mother to beat and scold her children because they are thin and sickly in appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The condition of the children is the result of poor nutrients.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A mother may think that she gives her children sufficient nutrients, but the food she prepares tastes like medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She may think that the food is nutritious, but to the children it tastes like bitter medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Similarly, the speaking brothers may feel that the message they give is rich, but the saints do not receive a supply.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The brothers may blame the saints and even rebuke them for their lack of comprehension.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the saints do not eat, because the brothers prepare only bitter medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we should not blame the children for being thin and sickly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should rather make sure that the food we give them has flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must understand that the root of the problems in the local churches is related to the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the word of the gospel is properly preached, crowds of people will repent and be saved, but if the word is not properly preached, few people will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the word that is spoken makes a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This applies to the word spoken to sinners and to the word spoken to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, we must pay attention to the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE WORD BEING WITH GOD AND</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE WORD BEING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word that we are referring to is the word of ministry spoken from the podium, not the common words spoken in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The brothers who serve in the ministry of the word must grasp a basic principle the word that they minister must be God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>John 1:1 says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>John did not begin the sentence with the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He first said, The Word was with God, and then, the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The spoken word must be with God so that the saints receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Oftentimes when we listen to a message, the word that is spoken is not God and does not have the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Such words are empty and can be idle talk.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE WORD BEING SPIRIT AND LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The words spoken by the brothers must cause the saints to see God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord Jesus said, It is the Spirit who gives life...the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The words released through the ministry of the word should always be the utterance of God, and they should be spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The apostles wrote the Epistles according to this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For example, sometimes the apostle Paul spoke his own words, but he felt that God was in his words 1 Cor 7:10, 12, 25, 40 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is what makes the Bible special and proves that the Bible is God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Most people are afraid to speak about themselves, but much of what Paul said was concerning himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It seems that Paul in his Epistles spoke more about himself than about the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He never mentioned where the Lord Jesus was born, but he gave a clear account of his own background.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>While most people today dare not speak about themselves, Paul spoke about himself, particularly in the books of 1 and 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, as we read the words concerning Paul, we sense God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul even said that it was necessary, not expedient, for him to boast and that he boasted like a foolish man 2 Cor 12:1; 11:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In these words Paul did not speak about God, the Lord, or the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, when we read them, we sense God, because Paul spoke forth God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even though Paul spoke concerning himself, his words conveyed God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is possible for us to say God or Lord in every sentence but have nothing of God when we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What Paul said was full of the element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hence, when we read Paul s words, we touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Paul s words are God, the Spirit, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we want our words to convey God, the Spirit, and life, our words must pass through God and be in God.</S>
