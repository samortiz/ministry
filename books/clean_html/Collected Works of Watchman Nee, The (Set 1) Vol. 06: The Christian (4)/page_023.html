<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Confessing His Sins</H2><P>We have seen how this robber rebuked his companion, expressing his own faith. Now we want to also see that he not only expressed his faith by rebuking his companion, but in his confession he declared that he had believed in the Lord Jesus. Let us read verse 41. "And we justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for what we did." What do these words mean? "And we justly" means they deserved a brutal death for their punishment. The punishment that they received, the punishment of the cross, befitted what they had done. They were robbers. They had sinned, murdered, and committed arson. Moreover, there were sins in their hearts. Nothing of what they did, thought, or said was good. Being put to death in this way was most just and reasonable. The law did not mistreat them because before God, before man, and even before their own eyes, they were truly sinners!</P><P>The robber acknowledged that he deserved the punishment he had received. It was his own sins, his own conduct, that brought him this just penalty. He confessed that he was a sinner. He did not use any words to cover up his own sins. He also did not use any reasons to hide the guilt of his sin. He did not say, "I was a robber, but I did it according to my conscience. If I had not been a robber, my stomach would have gone hungry and my body would have gotten cold. I was forced to extort for lack of clothing and food. Life as a robber is a kind of business! Why can't this be?" Yet he did not talk in this way. He was moved by the Holy Spirit to confess that he was a sinner. He confessed this before his companion; he confessed this before the Lord Jesus; he also confessed this before those who were watching his execution. He did not forgive himself in any way; he confessed that he was a sinner. Normally it is very hard for robbers to confess their sins because their hearts are so perverse. "Swift are their feet to shed blood, destruction and misery are in their ways" (Rom. 3:15-16). But as soon as the Holy Spirit worked, this robber acted contrary to his normal behavior and confessed that he was a sinner. He wanted a Savior because he was a sinner. He wanted a Savior so he believed, asked for, and received one.</P><P>I am a gospel preacher. The first thing that I do is to lead people to know that they are sinners. This is a very hard thing to do. Some people answer me, saying, "I have not murdered anyone, and I have not committed any arson. What sin do I have?" And others would say, "Whatever I do, I do according to my conscience. What sin do I have?" Whenever I try to prove their sins to people, they always have many excuses. Even when people sometimes admit that they are sinners, they say, "Everyone in the world is a sinner, so what does it matter if I am just one of them?" They are willing to admit that everyone in the world is a sinner, but they will not admit in a simple way that they themselves are sinners. They do not realize that besides murder and arson there are many more sins! Pride in the heart, jealousy, unclean thoughts, lies of the mouth, sudden temper, all these are sins. Have you not committed these? Saying that you have no sin because you act according to your conscience is not altogether true, because I do not know what kind of conscience you have. If it has been darkened and deadened, it will not have a high standard to direct you. I remember once when I was going from Shanghai to Tientsin, I met someone from my hometown in the boat. His bed was opposite mine, so we soon began to talk. He was a dentist in Shanghai. He was a very good-looking young man. He did not know that I was a preacher. He told me of his experience in Shanghai. According to him, scores of young women had been seduced by him. He was very proud of himself when he said this. After he had finished speaking, I began to preach the gospel to him. I also had my story to tell. I told him how I had believed in the Lord Jesus and was saved. I said to him, "You are a sinner, and if you sin like that, you will perish in the future." He replied, "All my life I have done things according to my conscience." He would not accept my gospel. Gentlemen! Please listen to his reply. He ruined the chastity of scores of women, but he still said that he acted according to his conscience. Oh! What sort of conscience is this? Just think for yourselves. What sort of conscience is this? Is it reliable?</P><P>The first step the Holy Spirit does in a man's heart is to cause him to reprove his sins. This causes him to realize that he is a sinner and needs a Savior. It will lead him to trust in the Lord Jesus. If you will not allow the Holy Spirit to prove to you by the Scripture that you are a sinner, and if you resist God's evaluation concerning you and do not acknowledge that you are a sinner, it will be impossible for you to receive God's salvation. If you are not a sinner, why should you be saved? If you are not a sinner, why should the Lord Jesus die for you and save you? Confessing that you are a sinner is the prerequisite for being saved. I urge you to be humble and not be proud; do not be afraid of losing face; confess that you are a sinner! I often feel that the more a person is a sinner, the harder it is for him to confess that he is a sinner. He is too proud! If you tell him to confess his sins, he will lose face too much! For this reason he will not do it. The greater the sinner, the more he will say that he is good. He will even say that he is better than other people. This is because he is ignorant of himself. The more one knows himself, the more he will cry aloud, "There is nothing good in me, but only evil." The more one knows God's holiness, the more he will acknowledge that he is sinful and evil to the uttermost. I urge you at this time to be honest with yourself; let the Holy Spirit move in your heart to convict you of your own sins.</P>
