<h1 class="title">LIVING THE BODY LIFE</h1>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4; Col. 2</h1>
<p>In the Body life, because we walk according to the spirit and drink of the Spirit, the natural life is terminated, the natural strength is not used, and the natural way is altogether put aside (Rom. 8:4; 1 Cor. 12:13). Until we reach the stage of the Body life, we still live in the natural life and use our natural strength, way, and wisdom quite often. Within the realm of our natural wisdom, we have many schemes. It is even possible to have schemes and bad intentions in the church life. For instance, some brothers may intend that others would stop serving. This is a bad intention and a scheme. We thank the Lord that the church is different from society, but we have to admit that sometimes we are not pure in our motive, intention, and action. When we live in the natural life and do things with the natural strength, by the natural way, and with the natural wisdom, we cannot be pure. Even if we think that we have a pure motive and do not want to damage others, we are still not pure if we take the natural way. We need to realize that anything natural comes from an unclean, evil source. However, it is difficult for us not to be natural until we reach the stage of the Body life by walking according to the spirit and drinking of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Walking according to the spirit is a great matter. It is the conclusion of the first seven chapters of Romans. However, if we consider our experience, we have to admit that most of our walk is not according to the spirit but according to the flesh. We need to see that our living is still mostly natural. This is very serious because if we would walk according to the spirit, all the problems spontaneously would be solved, for the natural life, strength, way, and wisdom would be terminated. We should not think that we do not scheme. Only a person who continually walks according to the spirit does not scheme. Such a one has no intention to gain anything, be somebody, or have any success. Instead, he only lives the Lord. If we do not continually walk according to the spirit, we all have schemes. <em>Scheme</em> is a negative word, and we have to realize that all our natural intentions are schemes. As long as our intention is natural, even if it is a seemingly good intention to help the church or the saints or to do something for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we plan to have a success. Such natural planning is scheming for success and is impure. Perhaps we do not do outwardly sinful things, but if we scheme to be successful, even if we say that it is for the Lord, it is actually for our self and is natural. When we reach the stage of the Body life, we will be pure. We will not have any intention, and we will know only to live Christ and minister Christ as life to others. We may think that such a living is not easy to attain, but when we reach the stage of the Body life, it will be spontaneous and easy.</p>
<p>Around 1946, Brother Watchman Nee and I were fellowshipping one day in Shanghai. I had recently visited the churches in a certain region. Brother Nee asked me, &ldquo;Why did you visit the churches there?&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I had a burden to help the saints.&rdquo; I thought that this was pure and right, but Brother Nee replied that my going was a matter of politics. I was shocked and thought, &ldquo;Then we cannot work. Whatever we do in the work is politics.&rdquo; I asked Brother Nee to explain, but he only repeated, &ldquo;That was politics.&rdquo; I could not understand and was greatly troubled. However, after some days passed, I received light. When Brother Nee asked me why I went to visit the churches, the proper answer was, &ldquo;The Lord led me to go.&rdquo; The source of our activity in the work should be the Lord&rsquo;s leading and not our intention. Acts 8:26-27 says, &ldquo;An angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Rise up and go south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is the desert route. And he rose up and went.&rdquo; Verses 29 through 30 say, &ldquo;The Spirit said to Philip, Approach and join this chariot. And when Philip ran up, he heard him reading Isaiah the prophet.&rdquo; Philip had no intention but only the Lord&rsquo;s leading. We may say that we have a burden when we actually have an intention to have some success or accomplish something. Thus, I eventually was convinced that my going to visit the churches had been a matter of politics. Because some there did not see the light concerning the church adequately, I had a burden to go in order to correct the wrong ones, to help the disappointed ones, and to strengthen the leading ones. Although this seemed to be good, it was not the Spirit&rsquo;s leading but my doing.</p>
<p>There is a great difference between our intentions and the Spirit&rsquo;s leading. When we reach the stage of the Body life, we will not care for our own intentions but only for the Spirit&rsquo;s leading. If the Spirit leads us to go somewhere, we will go regardless of whether we think that anything will come of our going. Likewise, if the Lord does not lead us to go, we will not go. If we visit a locality because we have a burden to go, but we do not have the Lord&rsquo;s leading, we may have outward success. However, that church may begin to follow us personally. This is subtle politics. Without the Spirit&rsquo;s leading, we must question the real motive of our so-called burdens in the work. Most Christian works today come from political intentions and schemes. As a result, these works are not in the Body but in division. Everyone has their own individual work, and every work is a division. When we are in the Body, all our individual intentions, burdens, and desires are swallowed up. We only live and function in order to minister Christ as life to the saints. We have no intention to accomplish anything outward. This is the difference. With our individual intentions, the natural life, strength, way, and schemes are always involved. Furthermore, there are always divisions, with each one having a separate work. There is no Body life among most Christians today because most live the natural man with the natural life, strength, way, wisdom, intentions, desires, and burdens.</p>
