   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PERFORMED IMPOSSIBLE ACTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fourth qualification we mentioned is that one who claims to be God incarnated must be able to perform what an ordinary person cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Has Jesus of Nazareth performed any supernatural acts?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are not His contemporaries; it was almost two thousand years ago that He walked on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Naturally, we cannot be His witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But one thing is sure: the apostles who followed Jesus recorded, preached, and testified the things concerning Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The four Gospels were all completed within thirty years after His departure.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Most of the Jews who were then alive had seen Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the apostles' records were false, they would have been repudiated long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the Jews only argued that Jesus is not the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They never denied His deeds, for the deeds were all facts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today, when we read the four Gospels, we have no apprehension about their authenticity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If there had been a slight error when they were written, there would have been grave problems because many of the contemporaries had actually seen and heard Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There was no chance for any fabrication.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, these books cannot be a hoax.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the Jews could not attack these books, there is even less of a basis for an attack today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>PROVED BY MIRACLES</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let us examine some of the deeds of Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Matthew 11:2 and 3 say, "Now when John heard in the prison of the works of the Christ, he sent word through his disciples and said to Him, Are You the Coming One, or should we expect another?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John wanted to make sure that Jesus was the Christ sent from God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If He was not, John would wait for another.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verses 4 and 5 say, "And Jesus answered and said to them, Go, report to John the things that you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; and the dead are raised and the poor have the gospel announced to them."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Jesus answered neither "yes" nor "no."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He only asked the messenger to tell John of the things heard and seen.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He wanted John to think about them and decide for himself if Jesus was the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jesus proved His divinity by the miracles He performed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here is a man who accomplished things that are impossible for human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You cannot help but confess that He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 7:31 says, "But many out of the crowd believed into Him and said, Will the Christ, when He comes, do more signs than this man has done?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many people testified that He performed all kinds of miracles which no man could do.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>CLAIM TO DIVINITY</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John 10:24 says, "The Jews therefore surrounded Him and said to Him, How long will you hold our soul in suspense?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the one hand, the Jews hardened their hearts and refused to acknowledge His divinity, and on the other hand, they were puzzled by the many supernatural miracles that He performed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They gathered around Him and pressed for an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is one thing in which Jesus never gave in: His claim to divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He performed what mortals could not.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These acts testify to His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He told the people clearly, "The works which I do in My Father's name, these testify concerning Me" v. 25 . On the one hand, He made His claim, and on the other hand, He performed miracles to justify His claim.</S>
