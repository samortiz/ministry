   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE THREE STAGES OF CHRIST From Eternity Past into Time</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We all know that the Lord Jesus as the eternal God is from eternity to eternity, yet with Him there is an aspect of three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first of the three stages is from eternity past to the time of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He created the heavens, the earth, and man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The entire universe was created by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In His creation He made man the center.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In eternity past, He was merely the only begotten Son of God, who is the same as God and is the Second in the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the time of creation, He came out of eternity and entered into time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Coming with Divinity and Entering into Humanity, Living on Earth for Thirty-three and a Half Years, and Dying on the Cross for the Accomplishment of the Judicial Aspect of God's Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although He had come out of eternity, He had not yet come with His divinity into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He came out of eternity to enter into time, but He did not come with His divinity to enter into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In His creation, He created man in His image and after His likeness Gen 1:26 that He might attain His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, man fell, and Jehovah came to judge the fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In His judgment, He spoke a prophecy with a promise, that is, that the seed of woman would bruise the serpent's head 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At that time Adam and Eve could not do anything, even though they hated the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suddenly they heard that the seed of woman would come and would bruise the head of the serpent, so they were very excited.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, while the bruising of the serpent's head by the seed of woman was to deal with Satan, man still had the problem of sin before God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For this reason, God killed a sacrifice and made coats with the skin of the sacrifice for Adam and Eve to put on v. 21 . Before they put on the skin, both of them were naked v. 7 , without any covering before God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After God provided them with the coats of skin, they were redeemed and covered.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, God would come personally to become the seed of woman to destroy Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, four thousand years after that prophecy with a promise was spoken, God came personally.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After four thousand years, that is, two thousand years ago, He came not only from eternity into time but also with divinity into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now He is not only in time but also in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He as God in eternity was incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>John 1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. the Word became flesh" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At that time, the God-created man was fallen and had become flesh already.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Genesis 6:3 says, "And Jehovah said, My Spirit shall not strive with man for ever, for that he also is flesh " ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since man had become flesh and God would have nothing to do with the flesh, the Holy Spirit would no longer have any contact with man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This God is the Word becoming flesh, but having only its form, without its reality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Romans 8:3 says that He had "the likeness of the flesh of sin."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He had only the likeness, like the bronze serpent which was lifted up on the pole having only the serpent's form but without the serpent's poison Num 21:4-9; John 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was the eternal God entering into the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was in the flesh for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is His second stage.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first stage is in eternity, and the second stage is in the flesh until He was on the cross, saying, "It is finished!"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>John 19:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the cross He flowed forth blood and water v. 34 . Blood is for the accomplishment of God's redemption in the judicial aspect; water is for the fulfillment of God's salvation in the organic aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord Jesus was on the earth for thirty-three and a half years to accomplish the judicial aspect of God's salvation, fulfilling all that God had required according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What He did in His living of thirty-three and a half years was to accomplish the judicial aspect of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He did nothing according to His own will; everything He did was in subjection to the Father John 5:19, 30; 8:28 through the end when He went to die on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At that time, He knew that it would be a great suffering, so in Gethsemane He prayed and conferred with God, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will" Matt 26:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is altogether on the judicial side.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, He went to the cross, and there He cried out with a loud voice, saying, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>27:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must remember that in John 8:29 the Lord said, "He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Father was always with the Son and had not left the Son to be by Himself alone.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, for a short period of time on the cross He asked God why He forsook Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God forsook Christ on the cross because He took the place of sinners 1 Pet 3:18 He bore our sins 1 Pet 2:24; Isa 53:6 and was made sin for us 2 Cor 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ accomplished all of this in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the second stage.</S>
