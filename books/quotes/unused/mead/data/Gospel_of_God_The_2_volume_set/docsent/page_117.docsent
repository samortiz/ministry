   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Finally, verse 26 says, "For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our spirit resides inside our body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hence, we can say that our spirit is the spirit of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We say that evil spirits are spirits that have left their body, for they are without a body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is a kind of work that requires faith and must be linked to faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is a kind of work that comes out from faith and that issues from faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If faith is without works, it is dead in the same way that a body without a spirit is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, we are saved through faith, we are justified through faith, and we also receive life through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although there are many different ways to express faith, the source is still faith.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some express it by forsaking their profession.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Others express it by not following in the footsteps of their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Still others express it by not going along with their husband in certain things or by forsaking their position.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are all kinds of expressions of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The question is not good or bad works, but faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What James is saying is that when the opportunity arises, our faith should be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, we cannot say that salvation is of works.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hebrews 6:1 mentions the word of the beginning of the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The foundation of the word of Christ is repentance from dead works.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is repentance from dead works?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is repentance from what we have done when we were dead.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Bible, there are two things that we have to repent for.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The other is dead works.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everything that is wrong morally is a sin and a transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a man believes in the Lord, he must surely repent and deal with these sins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, we must also hate and repent for what we did as dead persons.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What are these dead works?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are all the good works that we were able to do by ourselves before we were saved, before we became the children of God, before we received the new life, and before we became a new race.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One sees his sins and transgressions for what they are.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But one does not see the things that he considers moral and noble as things to be repented of.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God says that these are dead works.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They were performed when we were dead.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must repent for all these works, not depending on them for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we are saved, there are two great repentances.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One is repentance for all the things that should not have been done.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But when someone understands the gospel and sees the complete work of the cross of the Son of God, he repents for the other things also, which are all the good works that he has formerly done.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Formerly, we tried our best to do good, as if God would save us if He were only impressed enough by our good works.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today, however, we have become Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must not only repent for our sins; we have to repent for our dead works as well.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, dead works cannot help us to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You may say that one should believe in the Lord Jesus, but one should also have good works.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But God sees you as a torn rag.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The righteousness that God gives us far exceeds the righteousness of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, if we want to come to God, not only must we not bring our sins along, we also must not bring our works along.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we wish to talk about works, then our works must be as perfect as Christ's are before God, before they can be acceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>My friends, you must see that salvation is not of yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You must realize from your heart that everything is of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Faith is not a virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Faith is just receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One of our gospel hymns says, "Working will not save me" and "Weeping will not save me" #1000 in Hymns, published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The last stanza says, "Faith in Christ will save me."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When I first saw this line, immediately I crossed it out and replaced it with "Jesus alone will save me."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Faith is not a virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Faith is just to allow the Lord to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is like a person who falls into the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When someone comes to save him by throwing him a net, he does not have to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As long as he does not jump out of the net, he will be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Everything is done by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I say again, never misunderstand James 2.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Work in James 2 is not a question of being good or bad, but of having or not having faith.</S>
