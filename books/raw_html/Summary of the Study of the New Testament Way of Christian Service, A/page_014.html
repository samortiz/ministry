<p>Following this fellowship and interceding, questions will be asked. No one should be assigned to answer these questions. Everyone should answer them. Someone may ask what the cross is, and a young brother who was saved just three weeks ago can answer this question. He may say, “Formerly I did not know what the cross was. But just recently a brother told me that it was a means used by the Roman government to put to death the worst criminals.” His answer is a short teaching. Another brother may continue by saying, “The cross was where the Lord Jesus was crucified. He was crucified there on behalf of us to take away our sins.” Then he may read one verse referring to this. Another brother may say, “When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He was crucified not only for our sins but also for us.” He would also give a verse to support what he has shared. Another brother can add something more by saying, “Today we have to experience the cross of the Lord Jesus. We can experience the cross by applying the death of Christ on the cross to our situation. When we are about to lose our temper, we need to call on the Lord. This brings us into the death of Christ in the Spirit.” This brother may then continue to share something further concerning the experience of the cross of Christ.<p>A number of questions may be asked in the group meeting. Some will be concerning the truth, and others will be concerning life. In this way there will be the mutual teaching of the truth and the experience of life. This does not mean that we do not need books to help us. We still need the help from books such as Truth Lessons and Life Lessons. In our fellowship with the new ones, we can tell them that it is best to have books like these in our homes so that we can study a part of a lesson when we want to learn something concerning the truth or life. Then when we are in the group meeting, we can refer to these books when we answer something. We can tell the new ones that they can read more concerning a certain truth at home in their spare time. When we take this way, the answers to the questions in the group meeting will become very rich. This way gives the opportunities to every attendant to use their knowledge and their experience to answer questions. If a new believer is brought into a group meeting, and he attends over forty-five group meetings a year, he will learn much truth. All of us start the meeting in our homes, and everyone in the meeting is a leader and a teacher.<p>The scriptural basis for the group meetings is in Hebrews 10:24 and 25. When Paul wrote this, he was talking to the Hebrew brothers and telling them not to forsake their own meeting, their Christian meeting. This is because some of the Jewish brothers had left their Christian meeting and had gone back to their Judaistic gathering. In our present situation, we need to have a meeting that is our own meeting. We should not forsake our own meeting. We must help all the saints to realize that the group meeting is their own meeting.<p>The group meeting is a meeting of mutuality in which all the saints participate. Everyone can start the meeting in his home, everyone can fellowship, everyone can intercede, and everyone can render the mutual care and the shepherding. In this way everyone in the group will be exercised to shepherd one another. It is impossible for a few elders to shepherd all the saints in the church. But if the church is divided into group meetings, all the saints will shepherd one another. The group meetings are so easy and so delightful. There is no hardship or any heavy burden on anyone. If someone were charged to be the leader of a group meeting, he would have to prepare a teaching to give, and he would be overburdened. But in the organic way, no one is overburdened. Everyone is ecstatic. When a question is raised, we can all answer, listen, and learn.<p>Hebrews 10:24 says that we should incite one another to love and good works. It is by this “free way,” the organic way, of having group meetings that we can incite one another. In this way there is no limitation, no assignment, and no designation. The meeting is left open to everyone. All the riches of the attending members will come out in the group meetings, and these are the riches of the Body of Christ.<p>If a certain brother were charged to take care of a group meeting, probably very few of the saints in the group would pray for that meeting. They would not bear the burden for the meeting because they know that a brother has been assigned to care for it. If this brother has some helpers assigned to him, they may not even help to bear the burden because they know that this brother is bearing the main responsibility. This brother has to consider what kind of lesson he should give. He has to pray to get a subject from the Bible with the help of books like Truth Lessons or Life Lessons. Sometimes such a teacher would be exhausted. He may not know what lesson to choose, what lesson is applicable at that time. When we take the God-ordained way of meeting, however, we leave this matter to the Holy Spirit. The Spirit knows what to cover, and He can be one with the attendants in the meeting to raise the appropriate questions. In one meeting many questions can be asked and properly answered. In the old way, the riches within only one brother are dug out, but in the God-ordained way, everyone has an opportunity to pour out his riches. These are the riches of the Body of Christ. This kind of mutual teaching incites us to love and good works. This is the ecstatic, joyful way to have a group meeting. No one is overburdened because we all bear the burden.<p>The group meeting gives everyone the chance to speak. Spontaneously, everyone will participate in the speaking. Humanly speaking, no one can learn a language unless they practice speaking it. By the saints practicing to speak in the group meetings, everyone will learn how to prophesy. It is also profitable for some brothers to act as tutors in helping the saints to prophesy. Perhaps there is a new one among us who has been saved for only six months. A brother who is functioning as a tutor can encourage this new one by telling him not only to speak by answering questions in the group meeting but also to go to the Lord’s Day meeting of the church to speak, to prophesy. He can tell this new brother to enlarge and uplift what he has been speaking in the group meeting for a prophecy in the Lord’s Day meeting. His speaking will be prophesying with the riches of his experience of Christ or with the riches of his knowledge concerning Christ.<p>When we prophesy in the larger meetings of the church, we should not speak too long. Each one should prophesy for no longer than three minutes. The brothers who are tutors can observe the saints who prophesy and help them by coaching them. They can take some time with the saints after the meeting on the Lord’s Day to give them some helpful adjustments. This is like a coach teaching the players. One thing we need to remember for all of our meetings is that we need to be “crazy” with and in the Spirit and the word.
