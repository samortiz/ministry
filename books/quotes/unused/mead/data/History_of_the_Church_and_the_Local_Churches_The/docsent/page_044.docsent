   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Learning Not to Vindicate Ourselves through</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Evil Report from the Opposers and Persecutors</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In addition to the attacks Brother Nee suffered, Christianity also spread rumors concerning him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul called these rumors an "evil report" in 2 Corinthians 6:8.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The opposers did their best to defame Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I would like to relate an illustration of the many false rumors concerning him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One day Miss Barber's co-worker, Miss Gross, came to visit Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By that time, Miss Barber had gone to the Lord, but Miss Gross still lived in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She heard some rumors about Brother Nee, and she came to see him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Brother Nee was single at that time, and Miss Gross, along with Miss Barber, had helped him spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Miss Gross had the position to rebuke him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>She spoke to him in a rebuking tone and said, "I heard that you have a woman living with you."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Brother Nee answered, "Yes."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then Miss Gross said unhappily, "How could you do such a thing?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She was very disappointed and left after a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As Brother Nee related this story to me, he said, "Witness, do you know who was staying with me?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That woman was my mother.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because I was so sick, my mother came from a distance to take care of me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then the rumor went out that I had a woman living with me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yes, I did have a woman living with me."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Being bothered, I asked Brother Nee why he did not tell Miss Gross that his mother was staying with him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He said, "She didn't ask me who the woman was."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then he said, "Witness, we have to learn never to say anything to vindicate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should just tell people the truth."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Miss Gross confronted him by asking if a woman was living with him, all Brother Nee said was "yes."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was learning the lesson not to vindicate himself, so he had to suffer the rebuking from Miss Gross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He said, "If she would have asked me who was living with me, I would have told her.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But she did not ask, so I did not need to tell her.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If I had told her, I would have been vindicating myself."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This shows us how Brother Nee, through his sufferings, was a man who was always learning spiritual lessons from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I believe that in this century he became the most useful vessel in the Lord's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have seen that in 1942 the enemy stirred up a big rebellion against him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nearly all the co-workers and leading ones were against Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There was a saying then that only "two and a half" persons among the co-workers and leading ones were not opposing him one sister and "one and a half" brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I was the one brother of this "one and a half."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I told people that I did not care how much they told me Brother Nee was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I could never forget the lessons I learned from him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I was with him day by day for a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I could never deny the solid things he learned and passed on to me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I did not care what others said about him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some in Christianity said to me, "You are just following a man Watchman Nee."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I said that it was a glory to me that I could have such a man from the Lord to follow.</S>
