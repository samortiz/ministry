   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Need for Virgins</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew is really a wonderful book.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It begins with the birth of Christ in chapter one, and it ends with the church going forth to meet Christ in chapter twenty-five.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It begins with Christ and ends with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It begins with one virgin bringing forth Christ, and it ends with ten virgins going forth to meet Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all need to be virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are not virgins, we have nothing to do with Christ, and if we are not virgins, we have nothing to do with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To bring forth Christ to others, we need to be virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be the church going forth to meet Christ as the coming Bridegroom, we also need to be virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do we need to be evangelists, pastors, preachers, or ministers with a doctor s degree?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all should be virgins going forth to meet Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was a virgin who brought Him in, and it will be the virgins who meet Him and bring Him back.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Praise the Lord that we are simply the virgins here.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are many in the local church in Los Angeles who are former missionaries, former pastors, former preachers, former teachers, and former seminary students.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, now they are all virgins!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the New Testament service there should be the freshness of a virgin, with nothing old, religious, or traditional.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everything should be so young, so new, so fresh, so up-to-date, and so much against culture, human nature, and even the natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The New Testament service is entirely contrary to religion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the time of the birth of Christ, the problem was the Jewish religion, but today it is the Christian religion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to see the principles in God s Word in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all need to realize that all those serving in the New Testament service should be as virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we consider that we are giant preachers, we are through as far as New Testament service is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Regardless of how much we could do for the Lord, we need to say, Lord, I would be nothing but a virgin to bring forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The book of Matthew begins with a virgin and ends with all the virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to be virgins to bring forth Christ and to bring Him back.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ does not need great giants today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He needs the virgins to conceive Him and to bring Him forth, and He needs the virgins to bring Him back.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Newness versus Tradition</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No matter how good the religion and traditions are, they have nothing to do with New Testament service.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is proved with the case of the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was above his equals in the Jewish religion and kept all the traditions of his forefathers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One day, however, when the New Testament way was revealed to him, all the religion and all the traditions passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They had been something of gain to him, but now they all became a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should apply these principles to ourselves, not to others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is very easy for us to remain in religion and tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For example, we need to consider why we come to the meetings without functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do you not think that this is according to tradition?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With many of us I am afraid that a great part of our Christian life and service is traditional.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometimes I ask people why they do not praise the Lord, and they answer, I am not accustomed to such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They are simply in the habit of being quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Being quiet is also a tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are under the influence of traditions, although not consciously so.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are influenced by them, and we are accustomed to them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The way some people read the Bible is simply traditional.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They have been reading it in a traditional way for years, yet there is no change in their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If they would pray-read the Word, what a difference it would make, and what a change would take place in their lives!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some people do not like pray-reading because it is something new.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What is wrong with praying and reading the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is even better than simply reading the Bible; it is not only reading but pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What is wrong with praying the Bible and praying about the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We admit that it may be something new, but does that make it wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The religious and traditional people, however, do not like anything new; therefore, they do not like pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some friends have even told me I should not minister anything new because it might offend others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In that case, how could we have the recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we avoid offending people by not speaking about anything new, then we would need to keep all the old things, and the recovery would be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Suppose that in the time of Martin Luther someone told him not to speak about anything new because it might offend others.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Justification by faith would not have been recovered if he had taken such advice.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I am a little man, but recently I received a letter from a place I had never visited, a letter telling me that the leaders in a group there were aware that I teach new doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>That letter did not offend me, but rather it encouraged me to teach more new things, more heavenly new things.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Oh, how much the traditions are a frustration to us!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We all need to pray, O Lord, Amen, deliver us from traditions!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we would do this for ten days, many traditions in our Christian life would be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We may even see that the word of grace we offer at the dining table may be simply traditional.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we are in the spirit, we may simply shout Hallelujah! as our word of grace at the table, according to the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should not be set in a way that has become old.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we come under the heavenly light, we will see how many things we need to let go of.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All the old things, the out-dated things, the religious and traditional things, will be put aside, and we will be living, active, and aggressive.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Our sharing with others, both with unbelievers and believers, will be quite different.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It will be something of the Spirit, and not something of dead letters.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I am so thankful to the Lord for the meetings here in Los Angeles, but I am still praying that the Lord will grant us something new and newer.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We need to be daily renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We need newer things.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we would be more in the spirit, the Lord would be brought forth in a new and different way.</S>
