<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Accomplished by the Son, with the Father,<br>and through the Spirit</H2><P>This was accomplished not only by the Son but also with the Father (John 8:16, 29) and through the Spirit (Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:18, 20); hence, He was called the mighty God and the eternal Father (Isa. 9:6), but He was lying in a manger as a human baby (Luke 2:7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Human Living</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Living on the Earth as a Man</H2><P>The God-incarnated Jesus lived on the earth as a man for thirty-three and a half years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Experience Trials and Troubles</H2><P>He passed through human living to experience all the trials and troubles in human living (Heb. 4:15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. To Manifest God's Attributes</H2><P>He manifested God's attributes (1 Tim. 3:16) in His human virtues in the flesh. His human virtues were the expression of the divine attributes.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Going through Temptations</H2><P>The incarnated God went through temptations, yet without sin, and He had no sin even though He was made sin (Heb. 4:15; 2 Cor. 5:21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Made Perfect through Sufferings</H2><P>Hebrews 2:10 says that Christ was made perfect through sufferings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Qualified to Be the Redeemer and Savior</H2><P>Thus, He has qualified Himself to be the Redeemer and Savior of the men of sin. He has been tested and approved. He "graduated" from human living. That gave Him the qualification to be our Savior.</P>
