<h2 class="head2">Concerning the Small Group Meeting&mdash;</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Everyone Leading, with No One Behaving<br />
in the Way of a Worship Service</h2>
<p>The small group is the all-inclusive unit of the church life. In the church life, if the small group meeting is not strong, the church life will not be strong. The secret of a sustained, healthy church life is simply the small group meeting. The small group is the practical church life and the practical church service.</p>
<p>However, we must remember that the small group meeting is not a worship service. A small group meeting is not one where everyone meets together at a specified time and place. In the new way, we may begin meeting at home at a quarter after seven, even when the scheduled time for meeting is half-past seven. Actually, our meeting should begin from the time we have our revival in the morning. During the whole day, we live in such a revival until we come to the small group meeting.</p>
<p>On our way to the meeting, whether we are riding in the car or walking on the street, we should either be praising or singing. When we arrive at the saints&rsquo; home, even when there are only one or two there, we do not wait. There is no set program or procedure for the small group meeting. Nor is there any leader. Every brother and sister is a leader. When you are there, you are the leader. When I come, I am the leader. Everyone who comes can be the leader, and everyone is free to sing, pray, or read the Scriptures.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Mutually Asking Questions<br />
for Guidance in Life and Truth</h2>
<p>Furthermore, everyone can ask questions in the small group meeting. Everyone can also answer the questions. For example, I am an old man. I have a problem about whether I should retain a beard. I can ask, &ldquo;Can a man of my age keep a beard?&rdquo; Such a question can be raised in the small group meeting. The small group meeting is there to solve my problems. If there is a young sister in the meeting, and she thinks that she is not a brother, nor an elderly one, nor a leader, and should therefore sit there quietly, she is wrong. We have to see that everyone who comes to the small group meeting is qualified to speak.</p>
<p>If the young sister realizes this, she may say, &ldquo;To me keeping a beard is a troublesome matter. Recently we were pursuing a study of the book of Leviticus. There it says that all the hairs of the body have to be completely shorn. Although I am a young sister, I feel that according to the Bible, it is better not to have a beard.&rdquo; Another elderly sister may say, &ldquo;She is absolutely right. Although she is young, her words contain the biblical light. To me it is troublesome for an elderly person to have a beard. It is more simple for him not to have one. In these days, no one likes to see people with a beard. Whoever has a beard makes others feel uncomfortable. Those without beards are more proper. For the sake of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, it is better that the brothers do not have beards.&rdquo; This is a good example of a teaching. After this, a small sister speaks again, and then another brother adds something. Finally a more experienced one may put in a few words. In less than five minutes, the question is answered.</p>
<p>This is a very good practice. Those that dared not speak before, now will dare to speak. Those that could not speak before, now are able to speak. Those who considered that they were unqualified before, now will realize that everyone is qualified to ask and to teach others. Throughout the fifty-two weeks of the year, we should have this kind of meeting at least once a week. All the attendants of the small group meetings will then be like children of an educated family. When they speak, they will be filled with light and truth.</p>
<p>Do not be afraid of speaking the wrong thing in the meetings. We are all learning here. If we are not learning, we will not make any mistake. If we are learning, surely we will make some mistakes. We are practicing at the same time that we are learning. This is the secret of the small group meetings in the new way.</p>
