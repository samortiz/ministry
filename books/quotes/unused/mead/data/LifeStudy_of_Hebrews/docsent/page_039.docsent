   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE TWELVE THE MANY SONS, THE MANY BROTHERS,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the book of Hebrews all of the basic factors of the New Testament are implied in a deeper and yet very simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Apparently it is difficult for anyone to realize that the church is mentioned in the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although you might have read Hebrews a number of times, perhaps you have never been impressed with the mention of the church in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are all familiar with the mention of the churches in Acts and in the other Epistles, but we may not have the impression that the church is found in Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thirty-eight years ago I conducted a detailed study of this book with two different groups of people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time, I thought that I knew this book thoroughly, but I did not see the church in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church is only mentioned twice in this book, in 2:12 and 12:23.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 2:12 it says, I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise unto You.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I do not think that in the past many of us paid attention to the church in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This verse is composed essentially with the matter of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this verse both the brothers and the church are mentioned in a very deep way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Son says to the Father that He will declare the Father s name to His brothers and sing hymns of praise to the Father in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do you know the meaning of this?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this verse we must notice three elements: the brothers, the church, and what the Lord is doing today in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This verse is a very great revelation of what the church is and of what the Lord is doing in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In no other book can we find out something concerning the nature of the church that is revealed so thoroughly, basically, fundamentally, and crucially as it is found here.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not consider 2:12 as a small verse.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is a great verse.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It contains a marvelous revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this message, I hope that we all shall not only have a revelation, but that we all shall see a vision of what the church is and of what the Lord is doing today in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church is a corporate composition of the brothers of the Firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do you still remember the difference between the only begotten Son of God and the Firstborn Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The only begotten Son of God had divinity without humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although He had the divine nature, He did not have the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the Firstborn Son of God has both the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The brothers are not the brothers of the only begotten, but the brothers of the Firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are the same as the Firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is divine and human, and we are human and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Firstborn Son has humanity as well as divinity and all of His brothers are the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whether we are brothers or sisters, we are all His brothers, for Christ does not have any sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Tell me, are you human or divine?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Is the Firstborn Son divine or human?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is both divine and human, and we are both human and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is first divine and then human, and His brothers are first human and then divine.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eventually, He and we, we and He, are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are wonderful people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are not only human we are also divine.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you realize whose son you are?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You are God s son.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God is our divine Father, and we all are His divine sons because we all have been born of His divine life with His divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are the many sons of the Father and the many brothers of the Firstborn Son of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is not a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is reality.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church is both human and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the nature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The church is a composition of the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church is a corporation of the many brothers of the Firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I never saw the church this clearly years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>More than forty years ago I saw that the church was a group of real believers in Christ meeting together.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This definition of the church is not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Approximately one hundred fifty years ago it was revealed to some of the brothers that the church is not a building of brick and stone.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They declared strongly to all of Christendom that the church is not a physical building.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is not a cathedral, chapel, or sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They declared that the church is a gathering of God s called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When true believers in Christ come together, they are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have received much help from this revelation and more than fifty years ago we also began to say that the church is a gathering of God s called saints.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We were thankful for the help that we received from those brothers in the last century.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Later on, we began to see that the church is not only a gathering of real believers; it is a body, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you gather many chairs together, the chairs cannot become a body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you gather sheep together, they likewise cannot be a body.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As everybody knows, a body is an organism with life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It has life tissues, life cells, life nature, life shape, life ability, and life function.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The church is deeper, higher, and more profound than just a gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord has shown us the real significance of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Praise Him that He has granted us to see that the church has two natures the human nature and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The church has two lives.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>These lives are not only combined but are also mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The church is an organism with two natures and with two lives combined and mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Do you realize that the church has two lives?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Do you realize that the church has two natures?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Do you realize that the Firstborn Son of God has two lives and two natures, that He is not only the Son of God, but also the Son of Man?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Firstborn has all of the divine attributes as well as all of the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What we have is not just a little humility or submission.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This rich store is much more profound than this.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is unlimited and immeasurable, filled with the divine attributes and the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The church is such an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Quite often bad news comes to me about a church in a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Someone may say, The church there is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It has problems.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I do not like to hear things like this, because my concept of the church is based upon my faith.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I believe that every church is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>There is not a church that is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Although you may think that a certain church is not good, after a period of time that church becomes very different.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Because the church is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It grows.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Your body may be quite tired, but after a while it is invigorated.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It changes by life because it is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The churches in the Lord s recovery are organic.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Never believe that the church in a certain locality is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The church is wonderful because it is an organism that grows.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Never forget that the church is a living corporation of all the brothers of the Firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The church is neither physical nor organizational; it is altogether of life the divine life and the uplifted, resurrected human life.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Nothing is richer than life.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The best life in the universe is the divine life, and the second best life is the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The human life that we have today for the church is not the natural human life but the uplifted, resurrected human life.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We have such a life!</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This human life plus the divine life is the life of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>It is in such a profound way that the church is revealed in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The church is a living composition of all the sons of God, a living corporation of all the brothers of the Firstborn Son of God.</S>
