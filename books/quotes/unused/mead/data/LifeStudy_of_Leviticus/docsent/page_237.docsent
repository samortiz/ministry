   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE CRUCIAL ITEMS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fifth point is our realization that three items are crucial to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God as Our Unique Goal</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God Himself should be our unique goal, our unique aim.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Apart from Him we should not have any other goal.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not seek anything other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our goal is the Triune God processed, completed, and consummated to be our full enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Respecting God's Completed Work</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all need to respect God's completed work, the work that God has accomplished for our interest and for our rest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's work has been accomplished, and it has been accomplished for our rest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, we need to regard God Himself and His work for our interest.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's work has a result, and this result is His enlargement, His extension.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This enlargement is the Body of Christ, which is the mingling of the processed Triune God and His chosen and redeemed people as one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This entity is God's dwelling, God's embodiment, and God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, it will be God's manifestation in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Obeying God</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Based upon the fact of having God as our unique goal and regarding His completed work, we obey God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To obey God simply means to go along with God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To obey God is to agree with all that He is and with all that He has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we obey God, we agree with God and with His work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We also agree with the result of God's work, which is His enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we agree with God and go along with Him, we spontaneously obey Him, and by obeying Him we receive His rich blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>MAKING A VOW</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Finally, we need to see that there is the need for those who are willing and able to enjoy God, to enjoy God's work, and to enjoy the result of God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we would be those who enjoy God, God's work, and the result of God's work, we need to respond to God's desire by making a vow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our response to God's desire that we be His enjoyers should not be ordinary but particular.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that it should be a vow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to make a vow in which we tell God that we shall enjoy Him according to what is revealed in the book of Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should tell Him that we want to enjoy Him by regarding Him, by respecting His work, and by honoring the result of His work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a vow to enjoy the processed, completed, and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This Triune God is embodied in Christ, and Christ is one with His Body, which is His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all need to regard God, His work, and the result of His work, go along with Him, and become those who enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For this, we have to respond to God by making a vow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Are you willing to do this?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let us all make such a vow today.</S>
