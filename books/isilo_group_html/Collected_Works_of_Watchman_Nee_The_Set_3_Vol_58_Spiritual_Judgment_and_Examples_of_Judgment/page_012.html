The first are those with minor problems. We can point out their problems while we are alone with them. We can deal with these problems one on one. The second kind are those with serious problems. These problems have taken root in them and have become part of their constitution. We have to speak a strong word to them before they can turn. If we feel that one person is not enough, we should invite two or three experienced brothers to go with us. We should speak a strong word to their face in the presence of the brothers. The third kind are those whose problems are so serious that it is hard to correct them. We must then bring two or three brothers with us when we talk to such ones. When there is enough indignation within us and we are disgusted with the matter, we should rebuke them severely. The indictment and the rebuke should have been brewing within us for some time. When we meet with them, we should not only exhort them but rebuke them severely. We are representing God; we are not only speaking to them but rebuking them. If we want to rebuke, we must have a proper indignation within us. If the listeners are willing to take our word, they will be saved, and their problems will go away.</p><p>How can a man overcome his weakness? How can he overcome his problems? Intense light burns away problems and weaknesses. When God's light shines into us, we have no place to hide. Everything that is not of God dries up and wilts away. The stronger the light, the faster the wilting. Whether or not a brother can overcome his problem depends on the light he receives from us. Everything that is not planted by God will be uprooted. A hidden leprosy is not easily healed. But when it is exposed and proven to be leprosy, it can be more easily healed. If we want to dispense great light to others, we ourselves must be delivered from personal feelings and interests; we should only be for the good of the other person. If we have personal feelings of our own, we will not be able to deal with others' problems. If we have personal interests of our own, we will not be able to help others. If we speak to others in a frank way and expose their weaknesses under God's light, they will crumple. They will not be able to rise again, and their problems will go away.</p><p>Some may ask, "Why do we have to bring two or three people with us?" Sometimes the words of one person do not afford enough light and exposure. Bringing two or three persons intensifies the light, precipitates the other's mistakes, and increases the exposure and shame of the matter in view. In this way he will break down immediately, and his problems will be taken care of. The light of two or three people is stronger than the light of one. The only question left is whether or not the recipient will acknowledge the light.</p><p>Why is there the need for rebuke? The Bible contains many words of rebuke. Why are we afraid of rebuking others in the church today? It is because we are wrong in the way we live; we are not qualified to rebuke others. As soon as we rebuke others, we are condemned in ourselves. Those who are full of personal feelings cannot rebuke others. In order to rebuke others, we must be free from personal feelings. The rebukes found in the Bible are all free of personal interests. They are all done for God, for the church, and for the brothers and sisters. For the good of the brothers and sisters, we have to speak the truth. In order to rebuke someone concerning a matter, we have to hate that matter deeply enough and oppose it strongly enough. There must be enough indignation within us. Unless we are such persons before the Lord, we cannot rebuke others. If our word is from God, light will come to the brother as we speak such a word soberly to his face, and he will be paralyzed by this light. After two or three days, he will gradually see the light. He will be cut, and there will be a wound in him. As a result, his problem will wither away.</p><p>I have a title for the subject of these messages. I call it judgment or discernment. God's judgment is executed through His wrath. Once He judges, everything is cleansed. One day, when God pours out His wrath, the world will be cleansed, and Satan's work no longer will exist. It is a good thing for a follower of Christ, who has been with the Lord for thirty to fifty years, to be able to express God's wrath upon man. The wrath of an elderly brother often helps other brothers overcome their problems. But young ones should never be tempted to do this. Your time has not come. You can only learn to bear the cross and accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit. When you lose your temper, you lose it in yourself. After you have lost your temper, you must turn back to God. Some elderly brothers do not have to confess or repent when they lose their temper; they do not have to turn back to God for what they have done. There is a great difference between our own wrath and the wrath that comes from God. The wrath that comes from ourselves needs confession; without such confession we are cut off from fellowship with God. The wrath that comes from God does not require a return to God; the fellowship is never cut off in such a case. At most, an ordinary brother can exhort; he cannot rebuke. Only an elderly brother with some inner assurance can condemn a brother's mistake in the wrath of God. We do not talk about these subjects frequently, because they are not ordinary practices. Such matters must be practiced in fear and trembling. We need more training in the matter of judging men according to our spirit.</p><p>Prayer: Lord, we have to offer special supplication for the brothers and sisters. We pray that they would experience an inward deliverance and know themselves thoroughly. We pray that they would no longer indulge in self-love or be discouraged. We pray that they would be able to render help to many and bring many out of darkness to the path of light. Day by day, may they live more in You and less in themselves so that they would receive more light through You and more discipline from the Holy Spirit. May they learn to fear You, and may they learn to be delivered from themselves.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 58: Spiritual Judgment and Examples of Judgment &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
