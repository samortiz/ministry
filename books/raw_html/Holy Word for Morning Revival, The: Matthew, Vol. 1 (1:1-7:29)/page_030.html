<p class="bold">WEEK 5 — DAY 1</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 6:1-4, 6</h2><p class="bold">1 &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>But take care not to do your <sup>2</sup>righteousness before men in order to be gazed at by them; otherwise, you have no reward.…</p><p>2 &nbsp;Therefore when you give alms, do not <sup>1</sup>sound a trumpet before you as the <sup>2</sup>hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be glorified by men.…</p><p class="bold">3 &nbsp;But you, when you give alms, do not let your <sup>1</sup>left hand know what your right hand is doing,</p><p class="bold">4 &nbsp;So that your alms may be in <sup>1</sup>secret; and your Father who <sup>2</sup>sees in secret will repay you.</p><p class="bold">6 &nbsp;But you, when you pray, enter into your private room, and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret…</p> <h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>1<sup>1</sup> The fourth section of the King’s decree on the mountain, vv. 1-18, concerns the righteous deeds of the kingdom people.</p><p>1<sup>2</sup> Righteousness here denotes righteous deeds, such as giving alms (vv. 2-4), praying (vv. 5-15), and fasting (vv. 16-18).</p><p>2<sup>1</sup> Surely the heaven-ruled spirit of the kingdom people restricts them from such fleshly boasting.</p><p>2<sup>2</sup> A stage actor, an impersonator. It was a custom for Greek and Roman actors to wear large masks with mechanical devices that increased the force of their voice. Hence, a dissembler. So in the succeeding verses.</p><p>3<sup>1</sup> Indicating that, as much as possible, the righteous deeds of the kingdom people should be kept secret. What they do in their spirit under the heavenly rule to please solely their Father must not be interfered with by their flesh in its lusting for man’s glory.</p><p>4<sup>1</sup> The kingdom people live by the Father’s divine life and walk according to their spirit. Thus, they are required to do good things in secret, not in public. Public exhibition does not correspond with the mysterious, hidden nature of the divine life.</p><p>4<sup>2</sup> The kingdom people, as children of the heavenly Father, must live in the presence of the Father and care for the Father’s presence. Whatever they do in secret for the Father’s kingdom is seen in secret by the Father, and He will repay them. Their heavenly Father’s seeing in secret must be an incentive to doing their righteous deeds in secret. So in vv. 6 and 18.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>[In Matthew 6:1-18] the Lord uses three illustrations—the giving of alms, praying, and fasting—to reveal how we are filled with the self and the flesh. Man’s flesh, seeking to glorify itself, always wants to do good deeds before men in order to gain men’s praise. But the kingdom people, who live in an emptied and humbled spirit and walk in a pure and single heart under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom…must do all things in the spirit to please their heavenly Father.</p><p>To the kingdom people God is not only their God but also their Father.…Hence, the new law of the kingdom…is given to them…that they should keep it not by their fallen human life but by the Father’s eternal, divine life, not to gain man’s glory but to receive the Father’s reward.</p><p>Regarding each of the three illustrations, the Lord uses the word “secret” (vv. 4, 6, 18). We must do our righteous deeds in secret, for our Father is in secret.…The effect of doing our righteous deeds in secret is that the self and the flesh are killed.</p><p>Although the Lord speaks about the matter of reward (vv. 1, 5), the important thing here is not the reward, but the growth in life.…We all need some secret growth in life, some secret experiences of Christ…because such experiences kill our self and our flesh.</p><p>No matter what kind of righteous deeds we do—giving material things to the saints, praying, fasting, doing something to please God—we must try our best to do them in secret. (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 258, 260-261)</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 257-265; Hymns: #622</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
