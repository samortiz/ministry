   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AS THE SON OF DAVID</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND THE SON OF ABRAHAM Scripture Reading: Jer 23:5; Matt 1:1; Rev 22:16; Matt 22:42-45; Rom 1:3</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the New Testament there are a great many aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more we study these aspects, the more we are brought into the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Phil 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Through this excellency of the knowledge of Christ, we enter into the rich experience and enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this message we will consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the son of David and the son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>CHRIST AS THE SON OF DAVID</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The New Testament opens with the words, "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham" Matt 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this verse there are two titles of Christ: son of David and son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is surely significant that the very first verse of the New Testament mentions these two titles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we know the New Testament as a whole, we will realize that the entire New Testament is wrapped up with these titles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Revelation 22:16 the Lord Jesus refers to Himself as "the Root and the Offspring of David."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In His divinity, Christ is the "Root of David," his source; in His humanity, He is the "Offspring of David," his issue.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, Christ is the Lord of David as the Root, and He is also the seed, the branch, of David as the Offspring Matt 22:42-45; Rom 1:3; Jer 23:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some may think that Matthew 1:1 is simply a revelation telling us how Christ came into mankind through being the son of Abraham and the son of David.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, the titles son of David and son of Abraham are not simply for us to know the revelation concerning Christ's person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These titles are for us to experience Christ and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Gospel of Matthew emphasizes the fact that Christ is the son of David 9:27; 15:22; 20:30-31; 21:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Solomon, the son of David, was a type of Christ in three main aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First, he was a type of Christ inheriting the kingdom 2 Sam 7:12b, 13; Jer 23:5; Luke 1:32-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Second, Solomon had wisdom and spoke the word of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Matthew 12:42 Christ, the greater Solomon, also had wisdom and spoke the word of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Third, Solomon built the temple of God 2 Sam 7:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the son of David, Christ builds up God's temple, the church.</S>
