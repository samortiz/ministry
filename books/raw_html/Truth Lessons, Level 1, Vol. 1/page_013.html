<h1 class="title">TEXT</h1><p>Our God is a God with a purpose, a will, and a plan. Thus, He created all things entirely according to His will and plan. Revelation 4:11 says, &ldquo;You have created all things, and because of Your will they were and have been created.&rdquo; &ldquo;Because&rdquo; in the Greek here means &ldquo;through.&rdquo; All things were created not by chance, nor accidentally, nor casually, but through God&rsquo;s planning. In God&rsquo;s plan, He ordained that through all things He will reach His goal. Therefore, He created all things.</p><h2 class="head1">I. GOD&rsquo;S ORIGINAL CREATION</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Purpose</h2><p>Colossians 1:16-18 says, &ldquo;All things have been created through Him and unto Him; and He is before all things, and all things subsist together in Him;...that He might have the first place in all things.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s purpose in creating the universe is entirely for His Son, that His Son may have the preeminence and be glorified in all creation. Not only so, Christ the Son is God&rsquo;s embodiment because all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily (Col. 2:9). Therefore, when the Son is glorified, God is also expressed. God&rsquo;s purpose in creating the universe is that His Son may be glorified and that He Himself may be expressed.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Means</h2><p>In Genesis 1:1 the word &ldquo;created&rdquo; is <em>bara</em> in Hebrew, which means to bring something into existence out of nothing. Therefore, God&rsquo;s original creation was brought into existence out of nothing. How then in God&rsquo;s creation did He create? What was the means through which He created? Hebrews 11:3 says, &ldquo;The universe has been framed by the word of God.&rdquo; John 1:3 also says that all things came into being through the Word of God. God spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast (Psa. 33:9). Therefore, God created the universe out of nothing by His Word. How powerful His Word is!</p><p>On the other hand, the Bible clearly tells us that God created the heavens and the earth by Christ His Son. Hebrews 1:2 says that God made the universe through His Son. Colossians 1:15-16 also says that all things were created in the Son of God. Actually, the Son of God is the Word of God (John 1:1, 14); the Two are one. The Word of God is the explanation of God; the things created through the Word of God are for the explanation of God, the revelation of God.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Process</h2><p>Job 38:4-7 reveals the process of God&rsquo;s creation. The heavens with all the hosts and angels therein were created first. The earth, with the living creatures dwelling therein, was created second. Job 38 shows us that when God laid the foundation of the earth, the stars and the angels (the sons of God) were there already. It also shows us that the earth created by God had been measured, with the line stretched upon it; everything was orderly and exceedingly beautiful. Therefore, the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy. Not a shadow of sin nor a trace of confusion could be found in the universe then. It was altogether bright and beautiful. This shows us how bright and beautiful the Creator is.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Creation Proving the Existence of God</h2><p>Psalm 19:1 says, &ldquo;The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth His handiwork.&rdquo; Although God&rsquo;s eternal power and divine characteristics are invisible, man can understand them by the things that were made. Man can understand and is therefore without excuse (Rom. 1:20). Hence, by looking at creation, we ought to know that there is a Creator.</p>
