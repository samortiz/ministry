   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in His Four Stages according to</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s New Testament Economy</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Stage of His Incarnation Scripture Reading: Isa 52:14 53:3;</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1 Cor 1:22-24; 2 Cor 8:9; Mark 6:1-6 The purpose of God s move in the stage of His incarnation is: To bring God into man Matt 1:20-21, 23; Isa 7:14; 9:6.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To make God man that man may become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead John 1:1, 14; 12:24.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To mingle God with man that God and man may be one Lev 2:4-5.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To accomplish God s redemption for man Rom 8:3; 1 Pet 1:18-20; Heb 9:26, 28, 12; 2:14.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To carry out God s salvation in man 1 Tim 1:15.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To impart the divine life into man 1 John 4:9.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The incarnated Savior is the arm of Jehovah; the arm of Jehovah is God Himself in His saving power Isa 53:1b: When the Lord Jesus came out to preach the gospel, that was the unveiling of the arm of Jehovah Luke 4:14, 18-19; Mark 1:14-15.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Old Testament term is the arm of Jehovah; the New Testament term is the power of God 1 Cor 1:24.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although Christ was unveiled as the arm of Jehovah, many did not see that He was Jehovah Himself coming in power to save them; they did not believe, because He grew up like a tender plant before Jehovah and like a root out of dry ground Isa 53:2a; John 1:46; Matt 13:55.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the Lord Jesus comes back, the remnant of Israel will repent and wail and be saved Zech 12:10-14; Rom 11:26-27 ; at that time they will confess the contents of Isaiah 53, and this chapter will be full of taste to them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the complete God, signified by the arm of Jehovah, the power of God, Christ became a perfect man, signified by a man of sorrows vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>1b, 3a; John 1:1, 14; 1 Tim 2:5: The arm of Jehovah is Jehovah in His power, and the man of sorrows is Jesus; when these two are added together, they equal incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 1 Corinthians 1:22-24 Christ crucified corresponds to the man of sorrows in Isaiah 53:3, and the power of God corresponds to the arm of Jehovah in verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a perfect man, the Lord Jesus lived a lowly and sorrowful human life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>2-3: He grew up like a tender plant before Jehovah and like a root out of dry ground v. 2a: The plant here refers to a sprout, which is tender, small, and delicate; because He was such a small, delicate person, no one would pay attention to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He grew up like a root out of dry ground, which signifies a difficult environment; this means that He was born of a poor family v. 2a; Luke 2:21-24; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Lev 12:8; 2 Cor 8:9.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus was raised in the home of a poor carpenter in the despised town of Nazareth and in the despised region, Galilee; this was the fulfillment of the dry ground in Isaiah 53:2a.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord s environment being one of dry ground means that His environment did not render Him any help at all: Everything that He had was from God; He did not receive or expect anything from His surroundings that would encourage, support, or comfort Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our Lord had God s will as His satisfaction all His life; He was satisfied only with God John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our Lord was never discouraged Isa 42:4; 49:4 ; He had no hope toward the world and did not expect to receive anything from it; His only hope was in God, and His only satisfaction was in God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who take their satisfaction in God will never be disappointed John 4:13-14.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He had no attracting form nor majesty that men should look upon Him Isa 53:2b: Jesus had neither an attracting form, nor did He have a beautiful appearance; He did not have any form or comeliness that would cause others to appreciate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead of majesty, Jesus had poverty Matt 8:20 , and instead of an attractive form and a beautiful appearance, He had a visage and form that were marred Isa 52:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Visage denotes the appearance and also refers to the face or facial expression; Christ s face and His form were marred disfigured in order that He might save us; this is astonishing, different from what people expected Christ as a servant of God to be v. 15.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ was despised and forsaken of men, like one from whom men hide their faces and whom men do not esteem 53:3.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord Jesus lived as a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; this was a part of Christ s qualifications for accomplishing redemption v. 3a.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was a man whose chief distinction was, that His life was one of constant painful endurance Keil and Delitzsch .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ s being such a man and His living such a lowly and sorrowful human life fully qualified Him to be the Redeemer and the Savior to save us from Satan, sin, death, and self Heb 2:14-18; Matt 1:21; Rom 8:3; 2 Tim 1:10; Matt 16:24-25.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Mark 6:1-6 may be regarded as a fulfillment of the prophecy in Isaiah 53:2-3: The Nazarenes, blinded by their natural knowledge, knew the Lord Jesus according to the flesh, not according to the Spirit Mark 6:2-3; 2 Cor 5:16.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only in the Gospel of Mark is the Lord Jesus called a carpenter 6:3: Carpentry is not a magnificent work, but it requires much fineness and patience; in such a work the Lord Jesus was found in fashion as a man Phil 2:8 , not in loftiness but in lowliness, fineness, and patience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Mark 6:3 the word carpenter is used in a despising manner: The Nazarenes were astounded by the Lord s teaching, by His wisdom, and by His works of power, but they regarded Him as a person of low status vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>2-3.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They were stumbled in Him because, although they heard wonderful words out of His mouth and saw some of His marvelous deeds, they considered that He did not have a high status or degree.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They saw the Lord Jesus as one who was merely a carpenter; therefore, they were stumbled in Him, and they despised Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The record in Mark 6:1-6 should cause us to ask ourselves what we want and what we value.</S>
