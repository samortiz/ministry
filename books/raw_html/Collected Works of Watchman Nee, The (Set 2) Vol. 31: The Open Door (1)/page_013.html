<h2 class="head2">The Future of the Work in Szechuan</h2><p>Brother Chang Yu-zhi has not been feeling well lately. He needs some rest and our supplication. After Sisters Peace Wang, Phoebe Chang, and I arrived in Chungking, we met together to pray for the future of the work. We have decided to have a week of gospel meetings with the women in the Meditation Chapel of X denomination beginning January 3, 1938. We will have one meeting a day, and Sister Peace Wang will be responsible for the speaking. After the meetings, the Lord willing, Brother Yu-zhi will conduct another gospel meeting, which will be followed by Bible studies. After this, Brother Yu-zhi and Sister Peace Wang both feel to go to Ch'eng-tu.</p><p>Ruth Lee in Chungking<br />December 27</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from a Western Missionary,<br />Wu-Yang, Honan Province</h2><p>Dear Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I have received your postcard and the nine books. Thank you. Enclosed please find ninety-cent stamps for the price of the books. I recall the times that we were together in Hou-Ma seeking after the Lord. It was as if they were things of yesterday. How unforgettable are those times! Now I am in Honan and you are in Hankow. Thank the Lord that everything is in His hand. Thank the Lord that He has prepared a work in Wu-Yang. Today I started a girl's Bible class. The Lord willing, I will conduct such a class for two weeks, after which I may move on. The work of the Spiritual Work Band is sprouting, but everywhere there is much need of nurturing. Please pray for this. I hope that Rev. Yang Shao-tang can come. May the Lord lead him. What kind of light have you received in Hankow? Is there any work in Honan? When can we meet again? I hope that you will write to me when you are free. May the Lord be with you all the time.</p><p>Sister Rong Fu-tien<br />November 8</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Faithful Luk, Singapore</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>I received your letter. Thank you. I have been in Singapore for a month, and I have been busy here and there without much achievement. The Lord loves me and opened the door of preaching for me. Thank Him! Miss Ding Shu-hin will arrive in Singapore next Saturday. Please pray much for us. I heard that Miss Chen Wan-ching is thinking about coming to Singapore. The brothers all hope that she can come. I also hope very much that she can come. I hope very much that X can send me a written copy of the light that you have received this time concerning the difference between the work and the church. (Brother Watchman Nee is busily editing the notes of the last Bible study in Hankow. Hopefully, we will be able to publish them as a separate book. For this reason, there is no need to send our brother a written copy&mdash;Editor.) Peace to you! Greetings to Sisters Chang and Wang.</p><p>Faithful Luk<br />The twenty-eighth<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Letters of Philip Luan</h2><h2 class="head3">From Canton</h2><p>Dear Brothers Watchman, Yao-ju, Lan-seng, and Tsi-yi and Sisters Ruth, Peace, and Chi-nien:</p><p>Thank and praise the Father for His amazing grace. Through the prayer of the brothers and sisters, I have been protected to safely arrive in Canton. Brother Shuan Chang-ming came to the station to receive me. Everything is well. Please do not worry. Yesterday on our journey a few planes bombed the Jiang-Kou, Li-Dong, and Loh-Tong stations two hours ahead of us. The railway tracks were cut off in a few places and many supporting railway ties were damaged. Thank the Lord that we have not met with any danger. His deliverance and protection are complete. Praise His name! We met Mrs. Suen (Sister Zhu Ming-seng) this afternoon. All the brothers and sisters in Canton are protected by the Lord and are safe. Barring any unexpected circumstances, we will leave for Hong Kong tomorrow. I write this hastily and send you my greetings in the Lord. Please greet all the brothers and sisters in Wuhan for me. Miss Miao, Miss Tzo, Miss Mei, and Tze-sien all send their greetings to you.</p><p>Brother Philip Luan<br />December 10<br />[Address omitted]</p>
