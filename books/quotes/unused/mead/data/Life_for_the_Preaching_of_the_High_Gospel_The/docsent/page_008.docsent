   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>People talk much about the so-called Sermon on the Mount.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But we must see that unless we become the children of God, we cannot practice the Sermon on the Mount.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Sermon on the Mount is not for worldly people, the unbelievers, but for the children of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is indicated in Matthew 5:48, where the Lord said, "You therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are His children and He is our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, we can be perfect as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For us to be perfect as the Father is perfect simply means that we have the Father's image, or in other words, that we express the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, there is still one crucial thing, and that is whether or not we are in the dominion of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why the Lord Jesus told us to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not righteousness first but the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, we need to seek the kingdom, and then spontaneously we will have righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we have seen earlier, righteousness simply means to be right according to God, to be agreeable with God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is to be perfect as God the Father is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I would like to stress again that what God wants is not moral people, religious people, or even so-called spiritual people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What God wants are people who remain under His dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as you are under God's dominion, God's authority, all things will be under your dominion, your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you are going to represent God, you need to be in God's dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In human society there are many deceiving things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The material things are deceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, people are constantly anxious, saying, "What shall we eat?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What shall we drink?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With what shall we be clothed?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All these whats are deceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus told us that these are things sought after by the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to forget about these things and seek God's kingdom and God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But how about our living?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Matthew 6:32 the Lord Jesus told us that our "heavenly Father knows that you need all these things," and then in verse 33 He spoke a word as a promise: "Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do you really believe that the heavenly Father will take care of your living?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have been believing in the heavenly Father's care for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to believe in the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we seek the kingdom of God and the righteousness of God, He will give us His kingdom and His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In addition, He will give us all the things that we need.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I realize that it is not so easy for the young people to believe that the Father will take care of all their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many of you are worried about your future.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am afraid that many of you are also anxious about your marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A sister may wonder, "What kind of husband should I have?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A brother may consider, "What kind of wife is good for me?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let me tell you honestly that without God, you can never have a good husband or a good wife.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why today there are so many divorces.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Learn to leave everything to God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I was young in the Lord's ministry, the young people considered me as a teacher of the Word of God and also as one who was experienced in the matter of marriage, since I was already married.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, they used to come to me for advice concerning their marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I gave them the best instructions that I had collected, and they tried to apply them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But eventually, I found out that these good instructions did not work.</S>
