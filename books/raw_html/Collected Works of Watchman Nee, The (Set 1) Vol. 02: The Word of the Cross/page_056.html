<H1 CLASS=MSG>LESSON SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>WHAT SHALL I DO TO BE SAVED?</H1><P>The position of man and his end before God depends upon whether he receives or rejects the works which His Son, Jesus Christ, accomplished on the cross. If he lives in unbelief until his death, he is hopeless and eternal condemnation is guaranteed. There is no need to ask if he will perish when he dies. He will certainly perish. If a man has not received the blood shed by God's Son, Jesus Christ, for the covering of his sins, he is "condemned already" (John 3:18).</P>	<ol class="upper-roman">	<li>An unbeliever is under the wrath of God:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"The wrath of God abides upon him" (John 3:36)</li>		<li>"Having no hope" (Eph. 2:12)</li>		<li>"Blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers" (2 Cor. 4:3-4)</li>		<li>"Will die in your sins" (John 8:24)</li>		<li>"Shall be condemned" (Mark 16:16)</li>		<li>"In flaming fire...vengeance" (2 Thes. 1:7-8)</li>		<li>"Lake which burns with fire and brimstone" (Rev. 21:8)</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Saved by believing in the heart:<br>	Believing merely in a historical Christ is neither having the faith which saves by believing in the heart, nor the receiving 	of Christ, the believing of the testimony that God gave concerning His Son.		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"Believed...the testimony which God has testified" (1 John 5:10-12)</li>		<li>"Believe in your heart" (Rom. 10:9-11)</li>		<li>"Believed God" according to His Word (Rom. 4:3, 20-21)</li>		</ol></li>	<li>What to believe:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"Christ died for our sins" (1 Cor. 15:3)</li>		<li>"Buried" (1 Cor. 15:4)</li>		<li>"Raised" (1 Cor. 15:4)</li>		<li>"Was delivered for our offenses" (Rom. 4:25)</li>		<li>"Was raised for our justification" (Rom. 4:25)</li>		<li>"Bore up our sins" (1 Pet. 2:24)</li>		<li>"The iniquity of us all...on Him" (Isa. 53:6)</li>		<li>"Made sin on our behalf" (2 Cor. 5:21)</li>		<li>"Having become a curse" (Gal. 3:13)</li>		<li>"Believes...has eternal life" (John 3:36)</li>		<li>"Believes...has" (John 5:24)</li>		<li>"Believes...justified" (Acts 13:39)</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Salvation is absolutely free:<br>	Salvation is not by man's ways, nor by self-discipline, self-effort, or self-strength.		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"Without money and without price" (Isa. 55:1)</li>		<li>"I give to them eternal life" (John 10:28)</li>		<li>"The gift of God" (Rom. 6:23)</li>		<li>"Believe" (1 John 5:13)</li>		</ol></li>	</ol>
