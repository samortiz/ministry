   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TO KNOW CHRIST AND THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should not think that we know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yes, on the one hand, we all have known Christ, but on the other hand, we still do not know Him in an adequate way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That Paul aspired to know Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>8, 10 seems to pose a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, this does not mean that Paul did not know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He knew Christ very well, but he still needed to know Him more.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He aspired to know not only Christ but also the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This relates to the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If Christ were not the life-giving Spirit within us, we could not know and experience the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The power of His resurrection is not in our body; it is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the time Paul wrote this Epistle, he was in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Throughout all the years, Christians have extolled the experience of Peter when he was in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The prison doors were opened, and Peter was released Acts 5:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The power that opened the prison and physically released Peter from the material prison was the power of God, but it was not the power of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Paul was put in prison at the time he wrote Philippians, the prison was not opened and his chains did not fall off.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was kept there month after month and year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Within him, however, was the power to suffer gloriously.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the power of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have heard many people praising Peter's experience of being released from the outward prison, but I have not heard many people praising the experience of Paul, who was imprisoned outwardly but released inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even today we still enjoy the issue of his release.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians were all written in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Outwardly he was imprisoned, but inwardly he was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we are childish, even babyish, and we become ill, we may pray about the illness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord may say, "All right, let the illness be gone," and it is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we gain more growth and maturity, we may still pray about our illness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, many people can testify that the more they pray, the more serious the illness becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord will not take away the illness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, He will say, "My grace is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You have to experience My resurrection power."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The illness will remain, but praise Him, it simply paves the way and lays the ground for us to experience the resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we do not have the illness, we can never experience the resurrection power of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the past and even until today, I know some brothers and sisters with problems.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They prayed much, but their problems remained.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Recently, a sister whom I have known for more than thirty years came to me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She spoke of her husband, whom I also had known even as a schoolmate, saying that there had been no change with him before the Lord for year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Day by day he still complains to her that she should not be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every day this sister has suffered, and she is still suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She asked me why it is so.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I did not say a word, but I looked to the Lord that He would speak to her.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I realized that she has truly learned something within, not of the power of God's creation but of the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For almost forty years the people of Israel saw the miracle of manna every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we were to open the door tomorrow and see that manna had come down, we would all be excited, and it would be in the major newspapers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The people of Israel experienced this more than ten thousand times.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Day by day they saw a miracle as something that came down from heaven in the morning, regardless of where they went or where they stayed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, that was too outward to be the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Regardless of how many years God performed that miracle, nothing was wrought into the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today in the New Testament time God will generally not do that kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the New Testament dispensation God's intention is to work Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The manna sent down was of the power of creation, not of the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God's intention, however, is not an outward miracle but an inward miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The inward marvel is that Christ as the Spirit is wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the power, not of creation, but of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even for the prison to be opened to release the apostle Peter was not the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Philippians, however, there is another apostle, who was kept in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God did nothing for him outwardly, but he suffered by the power of resurrection within him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When Peter was released from prison, I believe he did not experience the resurrection power by that event alone.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When he was old, though, he was martyred by crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At that time God would not release him; God would not deliver him from the persecutors.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When Peter suffered persecution and was martyred, he experienced the resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What kind of power do we expect to have?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We all may childishly expect to have the power of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We may think that it would be wonderful for the Lord to send manna throughout the city we live in; then all the millions of people will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I do not believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>How many of the people of Israel were truly gained by Lord through the daily miracles for almost forty years?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Not many were.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord Jesus fed five thousand people, not including the women and children, with five small loaves.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>That was a marvelous miracle, but how many people were saved through that miracle?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Only a handful of people continued to follow the Lord and seek the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>According to John 6 the crowds left Him, saying, "This word is hard; who can hear it?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>60, 66 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The power we expect to experience must be the resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must have the goal of the resurrected Christ as the very resurrection power within us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must seek Him, pursue Him, and follow Him, taking Him as our goal, aim, mark, and the prize of God.</S>
