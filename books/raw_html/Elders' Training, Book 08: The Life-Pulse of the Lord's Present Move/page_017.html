<h2 class="head1">A SHAMEFUL SITUATION</h2>
<p>The home meetings are the very base for the church to be built up. History proves this, today&rsquo;s situation testifies to this, and our experience over the last ten to sixteen years also confirms this. In Taiwan for over twenty years there has not been much increase. In the matter of the riches in the Word and the riches of Christ, the others who practice the home meetings cannot compare with us. However, they gain quite a number of people. One group in the northwestern United States gained eighteen hundred people in ten years. Within eleven years another group in the eastern United States gained a hundred homes with fifteen meeting in each home. This is a shame to us. We have such riches in the Word and the riches in Christ, yet what have we done? For this reason I was bold to blow away all the oldness. We all should feel shameful that we have wasted the Lord&rsquo;s time and wasted His mercy, His grace, His riches, and all the divine truths He has delivered to us. We all need to repent.</p>
<p>We must take care of the real situation based upon the real one accord among all the churches and upon the revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. You may have only a few hundred persons in your locality. This is not satisfactory. Within only eleven years in a little town of only thirty thousand people, one Christian group grew to fifteen hundred. How many do you have in your locality? You claim that you have the ministry with all the riches, and you use the materials of this ministry. However, you may be in a poor and pitiful situation. Let us all consider our ways. Haggai told the people, &ldquo;Consider your ways. Ye have sown much, and bring in little&rdquo; (Hag. 1:5b-6a). Yet even though this is your situation, you may still be so contented with what you are doing. I would beg you all to reconsider your ways. Not one among us could boast peacefully. The Lord has given us so much, and the riches are here. Yet we have to labor much, to fast, to pray, to wait on the Lord time after time, to have a thorough dealing with the Lord, and to have ourselves fully dealt with by the Lord. We must also labor on how to take care of each home meeting, to tend them, to enrich them, and to give them the proper word that they may use to minister to others.</p>
<p>We must not merely have a routine church in a routine way, where everything is set up with a routine schedule year round, every year the same. We all have been practicing this for over fifteen years. Year after year it is still the same. The routine is the same; the number is the same; everything is the same. This is deadness, coldness, oldness, and lukewarmness. Therefore, wake up! Reconsider the situation. Take the proper way, the living way, the biblical way, the way of life. In Taipei I spoke strongly, reminding them that there were over eleven thousand on the name cards but only about four thousand in the meetings. But thank the Lord, He has honored what I have done. So many dear ones were awakened. They would not remain in that pitiful situation any longer.</p>
 <p>Now I would say nearly the same thing to the dear ones in the United States. Consider for how many years the churches have been in this country. It seems that no one has ever risen up to say that they could not sleep well, that they could not eat well, that they were desperate due to the situation. Come together to fast and pray. If three days are not sufficient, let us pray for seven days or even three weeks. In Acts chapter one the one hundred twenty prayed steadfastly for ten days. Do not merely come together to talk about the way to drive the car. Even if you know the way, you are still short of gasoline. You need to prepare and pray and get your tank filled. Then just drive; there is no need to talk about the way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREPARING OURSELVES FOR THE MEETING</h2>
<p>In speaking of preparing ourselves for the meeting, I would primarily refer this word to the elders. We all need to be prepared for the meeting. Perhaps quite often even you as an elder were not prepared for the meeting. You simply went to the meeting in the routine way. You kept the scheduled time. Even in some localities the elders come to the meeting after the scheduled time. You were not only not prepared, but you even came to the meeting late. For a leading one in a local church to come to the meeting even ten minutes early is a shame. As elders you should be the first ones to come to the meeting. If you would come to the meeting in this way, so many others would come early. They will follow you. You are the head sheep; you take the lead. If as the head sheep you come to the meeting only two minutes before the scheduled time, how could you expect the others to come to the meeting early? If you have already lost interest in the meeting, how could you expect others to have an interest? We must rise up and consider this seriously. Do we mean business to take the lead in the many churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery? If we do mean business, we cannot take this way in coming to the meetings. It is a shame for us to enter a meeting five minutes late.</p>
<p>To come early is a small thing. If you would practice this, it would become easy. However, to prepare yourself for the meeting implies very much. You could not do this in only half an hour. You must prepare yourself for the meeting every day. First Corinthians 14:26 says, &ldquo;What is it then, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.&rdquo; This verse uses the word has. This does not mean that whenever you come together you should pray and wait on the Lord that you may receive inspiration. It means that you already have something, that something is prepared in you.</p>
<p>It is too late to get something after you come to the meeting. In many of the churches the brothers and sisters used to bring food for a love feast. Each one would bring something different; everyone had something. When each one came with something, there was a rich feast and a rich exhibition. When all the food was put together, you could see the riches. The exhibition became a mutual enjoyment. We could not have practiced to come to the meeting to attend a love feast with no preparation. If everyone came this way, there could be no feast. Even to have bought some groceries on the way to the meeting would have been too late.</p>
<p>This illustrates the situation in our meetings. Perhaps only one brother is charged and burdened to have a message for the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting. If one would become a full-timer in your locality, you may spontaneously assign him to give the message. Only that one will suffer. All the others will take it easy and go according to their routine, according to the schedule. Only one bears the burden to strive and to share a word. As the speaker, you must also be prepared to be criticized. Many eyes will be watching over you. Either all will welcome and praise you, or they will drop their heads before you. This is our way to practice the meetings. All the attendants are like spectators at a football game. When you play well, they will clap, shout, and yell. When you play poorly, they will criticize you. This is not merely my observation; it is according to my scientific investigation of our meetings. You elders should bear the burden and the blame because you did not do your duty to train the flock under your care. You cannot blame the flock. They never received the adequate help from you.</p>
 <p>To get yourself prepared you need to contact the Lord all the time. You need to get into the Word. You need to have something which you have gained, obtained, and even digested from the riches of the Word. For a young man to receive a Ph.D. he has to prepare himself for more than eighteen years. It is not possible to prepare for this merely in a single year. This is why the strong ambition for the eldership among so many bothers me very much. I could not see many who are really faithful to the eldership. They may be strong in ambition, but very poor in the responsibility. If you are faithful to the Lord, you do not need to be anxious and ambitious for the eldership. Spontaneously the eldership will be yours.</p>
<p>The Lord knows I never had the ambition to take the lead in the recovery. Throughout the years I only knew one thing: to work and to labor. You do not need to be ambitious to be a great father. The wise way is simply to produce sons. If you would produce two dozen sons, you will be a great father, even if you do not care to be.</p>
<p>The elders should be produced in this way. The duty fulfilled by you should be much greater and higher than your ambition. Your ambition should be nothing; your duty should be everything. Just as obtaining a Ph.D. is not an easy thing, to be an elder is also not an easy thing. You need to get yourself prepared.</p>
<p>Note 1 of verse 26 in 1 Corinthians 14 says:</p>
<p class=indent1>&ldquo;Has,&rdquo; five times in this verse, is in Greek <em>echo,</em> a word widely used, with many meanings, of which the following three are the main ones: 1) to hold, to possess, to keep (a certain thing); 2) to have (a certain thing) for enjoyment; 3) to have the means or power to do a thing. The first two should be applied to the first three of the five things listed in this verse, and the third to the last two&mdash;a tongue and an interpretation of a tongue. This indicates that when we come to the church meeting, we should have something of the Lord to share with others, whether a psalm to praise the Lord, a teaching (of the teacher) to minister the riches of Christ to edify and nourish others, a revelation (of a prophet, v. 30) to give visions of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose concerning Christ as God&rsquo;s mystery and the church as Christ&rsquo;s mystery, a tongue for a sign to the unbelievers (v. 22) that they may know and accept Christ, or an interpretation to make a tongue concerning Christ and His Body understandable. Before coming to the meeting we should prepare ourselves for the meeting with things like these from the Lord and of the Lord, either through our experience of Him or through our enjoyment of His Word and fellowship with Him in prayer. After coming into the meeting we need not wait, and should not wait, for inspiration; we should exercise our spirit and use our trained mind to function in presenting what we have been prepared with to the Lord for His glory and satisfaction and to the attendants for their benefit&mdash;enlightening, nourishing, and building up.</p>
<p class="indent1">This is just like the feast of tabernacles in ancient times: the children of Israel brought the produce of the good land, which they reaped from their labor on the land, to the feast and offered it to the Lord for His enjoyment and for mutual participation in fellowship with the Lord and with one another. We must labor on Christ, our good land, that we may reap some produce of His riches to bring to the church meeting to offer. Thus, the church meeting will be an exhibition of Christ in His riches and a mutual enjoyment of Christ shared by all the attendants with one another before God and with God for the building up of the saints and the church.</p>
<p class="indent1">According to the stress and emphasis of this Epistle, all five things listed in this verse should be focused on Christ as God&rsquo;s center for our portion and the church as God&rsquo;s goal for our aim. The psalm should be the praise of God for giving Christ as wisdom and power to us for our daily life and church life. The teaching from a teacher and the revelation from a prophet should teach and minister Christ with the church as His Body to people. A tongue and its interpretation should also have Christ with the church as its center and content. Any stress on things other than Christ and the church will confuse and distract the church from the central lane of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, making the church like that in Corinth.</p>
 <p>This is the way to get ourselves prepared that we may have something. To get ourselves prepared with these things in this way requires years to study the Word and to experience Christ according to the divine revelation. Whenever we come to a meeting, just like the Israelites who attended their feasts, we have something on hand. They had some produce of the good land on hand to bring to the feast and offer to God to enjoy with God and with each other before God. This has been our teaching for years. But where is the real practice? We may keep all these teachings in the pages of the ministry on our shelf or at best in our memory. There is little practice of all these riches. This really bothers me.</p>
<p>The elders should bear the blame and responsibility. This is your mistake. I must be honest to the elders. I hope that my word would warn everyone to never have any ambition to be an elder. To be an elder is not an enjoyable position. I only enjoy my labor. My labor day and night is the top enjoyment to me. I have no other enjoyment. Sometimes I am still working after twelve at night. However, if I do not labor in this way, the recovery could not go on. In a sense my laboring nearly every day is my suffering, but to my sensation this is not a suffering to me; it is a joy. I hope that one day I will stand before my Lord at the judgment seat and He will say, &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful slave;...enter into the joy of your lord&rdquo; (Matt. 25:23). What I have seen in many of the churches is not like this.</p>
<p>If you elders would be like this, surely the rest of the saints in your locality will follow you. Everyone would contact the Lord diligently. Everyone would spend time in the presence of the Lord. Everyone would get into the Word. Everyone would edify themselves by the enjoyment of the Lord. Everyone would get themselves prepared. Then when they come to the meeting, they will have something. One has a song, one has a teaching, one has a revelation, one has a tongue, and one has an interpretation. Just as we would come to a feast, we would all come with something. When we put all the portions together, that will be a real feast. Our enjoyment becomes a good exhibition of the Lord&rsquo;s riches.</p>
