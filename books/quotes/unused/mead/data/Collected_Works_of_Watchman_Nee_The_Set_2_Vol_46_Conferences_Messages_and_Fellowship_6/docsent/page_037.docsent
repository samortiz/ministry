   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY-EIGHT THE WILL OF GOD Scripture Reading: Luke 22:41; Heb 10:5, 7-9; John 6:38; 12:27; Mark 10:45; Gen 22:1-2, 10; 1 Sam 15:21-23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When our Lord was in Gethsemane, He prayed, "Not My will, but Yours" Luke 22:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In our pursuit to please the Lord, two things are set before us: the cup and the will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The cup should always be secondary to the will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord came to be crucified, and yet He prayed, "Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me" Luke 22:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is inexplicable to us cf.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John 12:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was possible for the Lord to pray, "If You are willing, remove this cup from Me."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But was impossible for Him to pray, "If possible let Me not do Your will."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have no direct connection with the cup, only with the will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not take the cross for the cross's sake but only because it is the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"To obey is better than sacrifice" 1 Sam 15:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The cup represents things which are related to God's will, and we get so taken up with them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, the Lord was wholly taken up with the will of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He drank the cup, but He did not drink it because of the cup, but because it was the will of God for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we seek the will of God, our greatest danger is being taken up with something He has shown us, and it can become a kind of obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even to the last moment, however, the Lord could give up the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Are we holding on to the things which God has shown us?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Is the will of God everything to us?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should be fully bound up with the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our attitude should be, "I am for His will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am not for anything."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Abraham knew God and His will, yet he received two different commands.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What did Abraham say?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Did he say, "You commanded me to sacrifice Isaac; therefore, I am going to sacrifice him"?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God does not call us to a life of offering Isaac, but to a life of doing His will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must not think that because we have gone through the motions that we are necessarily doing the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even on that last night the Lord still checked about the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If God shows us that this is His will, we should trust that His power will carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should keep ourselves in direct touch with His will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It should matter little to us whether or not we will do something, and it should matter little if we have to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to ask God to detach our hearts from the things and hold us to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Father, is this Your present guidance?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we try to carry a thing out, we will have to use a power that is not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should be really flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not be afraid to stop and take a step back, or even appear to undo things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is a living God, and He has a living will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One day He may call us to offer up Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The next day He may call us to take Isaac back.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not be occupied with the killing of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are concerned only with the will and not the thing, we can be stopped without any pain.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the stopping causes pain, this shows that something of us has crept in. "Lord, I want nothing for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I only want Your will."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have a peaceful life when there is no expectation of things, because there are no disappointments.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our trouble is that we are often so certain of what we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should instead pray, "Lord, I am apt to miss Your will."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We can never say that we have come to a place where we are above mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every cup should be held very loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is a blessed thing to be able to be turned back.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This attitude keeps us in the most pliable state before God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There are stops in the life of Paul that are recorded in the book of Acts!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How many of us can be stopped by God?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Brokenness and pliability are more important than sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must have no connection with things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We want to love what He wants, not love what He has shown He wants.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There must be readiness to do the present will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>John 6:38 says, "For I have come down from heaven not to do My own will but the will of Him who sent Me."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God's will has nothing to do with our makeup.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many times we can know a person by the kind of guidance he has supposedly received, because the natural strength often intrudes into the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Nothing is more serious than this.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The pure will of God is where we are ruled out.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>So much of the guidance among the children of God has a personal taint to it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A timid brother is always "guided" to take a back seat.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A forward brother is always "guided" to take a front seat, and yet both claim to be "guided."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>"Not my will" means that it has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I must not color the will of God for my own sake.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must come to the end of our natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The natural strength cuts very deep and must be thoroughly purged.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>How good it is for one to come to a place of purity, a place where there is no mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Spirit discerns all things 1 Cor 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The natural life must be severed from the divine things, and the natural strength must be destroyed and its backbone broken.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should be so filled by the Spirit that those beside us have no way of telling how the Lord is leading.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is only when we have something natural with us that others can discern us.</S>
