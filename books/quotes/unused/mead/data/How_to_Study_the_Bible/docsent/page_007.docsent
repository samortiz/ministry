   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Need for Continual Obedience</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God grants us revelation of scriptural teachings according to the measure of obedience we render to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The more we obey Him, the more light we will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we continue to obey God, we will continue to see.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without consecration, we cannot see.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without a continual obedience, we cannot continue to see.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If our consecration is not thorough, the shining will not be great.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If our obedience is not fine and detailed enough, the light we receive will not be fine and detailed enough.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, the fundamental issue is consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a man does not understand the meaning of consecration, he cannot understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A consecrated person must not only have an initial, fundamental consecration, but he must sustain an obedience before the Lord all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only then will he continually see.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The amount of light a man receives depends on the amount of obedience he sustains after his initial consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we are perfect in our obedience, we will be perfect in our seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should pay special attention to the Lord's word in John 7:17: "If anyone resolves to do His will, he will know concerning the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a man resolves to do God's will, he will know.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, obedience is the one condition for knowing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A resolution to do God's will is a condition for knowing God's teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a man has no intention to do God's will, yet wants to know God's teaching, he is asking for the impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order to know God's teaching, a man must first resolve to do His will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This resolution relates to one's attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God wants us to be obedient first in our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a man is obedient to God in his attitude, God's teaching will be clear to him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not ask what the Bible teaches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead, we should ask if we are willing to obey His word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The problem is with our attitude; it has nothing to do with the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whether or not the Bible will be open to us depends on our attitude towards God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are responsible for our attitude, while God is responsible for His teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If our attitude is right, God will reveal Himself to us and open our eyes immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we supplement this with our obedience, our attitude will be right once again and God will grant us further revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First there is a right attitude, and then there is revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we respond to the revelation with obedience, we will have more of the right attitude and will receive more revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many people claim that they have seen truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Actually, only those who resolve to do God's will have seen them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only they can claim that their seeing is clear and thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord has to do much work in us before we can "resolve" this way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not think that light comes without a price.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every seeing is accompanied by a high price; we have to pay a price to see.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sometimes God has to bring a person through two or three experiences before he sees something.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sometimes God has to bring him through six or seven experiences before he sees anything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God's light often comes to us in a reflective way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First it shines on something else, and then it is reflected to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's light is often reflective light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must see light from one angle before we can see light from another angle and then a third angle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sometimes we need to go through a few experiences before we can see light.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we are disobedient in one thing, we miss the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the way God's light acts.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many times we can only see clearly after we have positioned ourselves in different angles.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more price we pay before the Lord, the more light we see.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One experience of obedience will lead to another experience and then to even more obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One experience of light will lead to another experience and then to even more light.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God's will is behind every arrangement He has made.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whenever a man misses two or three opportunities to obey God, he suffers loss before God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No matter how much confidence we have in our consecration and obedience, we have to realize that something is wrong with our consecration whenever we are veiled.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever we fail to see, our eyes are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God is never short of light, but whenever He sees any unwillingness on our part, He will hold back His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God never forces anyone to do anything, but neither does He release His word in a cheap way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If there is any unwillingness on our part, the Holy Spirit will shy away; He will retreat and not release Himself in a cheap way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If something is wrong with man's consecration, God will not give him any light.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is not a small thing for a man to fail to understand the Bible, because it underscores a problem in his consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Spiritual eyesalve involves a price; it does not come freely.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Every seeing involves a price.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>No seeing comes freely.</S>
