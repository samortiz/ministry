   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE TWO FELLOWSHIPPING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE INNER CHAMBERS OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: S.S. 1:4b-8</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the first message we stressed two words: personal and affectionate .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In saving us and in building up a relationship with us, God came to visit us personally and affectionately.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How personal and affectionate Jesus was in the Gospels!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But this was His visitation to His chosen people in the physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was a man physically, but was not yet the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One day He told His disciples of His intention to die.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They could not understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They thought that He had come to build up the kingdom of God and that they would be with Him on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>James and John wanted to sit at His right and left in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the other ten heard this, they were indignant, showing that they also were ambitious to be with the Lord on the throne Matt 20:20-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They were in the physical realm.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through His death and in His resurrection, He became another kind of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was no longer physical, because He became a life-giving Christ, a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The last Adam, who was Jesus in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I would like to ask, Are you still preaching and ministering a physical Jesus or a pneumatic Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Mostly, those in Christianity preach a physical Savior, but the Bible unveils to us that this physical Savior, after He accomplished God s full redemption through His death, changed into a life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They do not believe that Christ has become another kind of Person, not physical but spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Christ was in the flesh, He could visit His disciples outwardly and openly, but there was no possibility for Him to visit His disciples inwardly and privately.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today Christ visits us privately and spiritually because He is the life-giving, compound, consummated, all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is the Spirit as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God, so He visits people secretly, privately, not openly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE KING, CHRIST, BRINGING US INTO</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>HIS INNER CHAMBERS, OUR REGENERATED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First, in Song of Songs the Lord captivates His seeker, and she with all her companions follows Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To pursue Christ for satisfaction is the first crystal in Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The second crystal is the King bringing His seeker into His inner chambers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Song of Songs is a book of figures.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In a figure of speech, the king s inner chambers signify our regenerated spirit as Christ s inner chambers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God created man that man may become Him by His being received by man so that He can enter into and stay in man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For this reason God created us with a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the New Testament teaching, our regenerated spirit is not only for us to have a means to receive Him but also for us to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second Timothy 4:22 says, The Lord be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ephesians 3:16 says that we need to be strengthened into our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The inner man is our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Ephesians 2:22 shows that our spirit is a habitation, a dwelling place, to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The real inner chambers to God are our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Regretfully, the majority of Christians in today s Christianity do not believe that there is such a thing as the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They say that the human spirit is synonymous with man s soul or heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Chinese translation of the Bible mixes up the heart, the soul, and the spirit by using the terms spirit-soul or heart-spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not many Christians today know definitely that they have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I came to the United States in the early 1960s I began to teach concerning the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many told me that before I taught this, they never knew that they had a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There are three verses in the New Testament that show the divine Spirit and the regenerated human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>John 4:24 says, God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this verse are God the Spirit and our spirit, with which we worship God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>John 3:6 says, That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Romans 8:16 says, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I came to the United States with a burden to release all the high-peak truths.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One among these is the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Another is that Christ, as the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ as the life-giving Spirit dwells in our human spirit, and these two spirits are mingled together to be one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this message we want to stress the words private and spiritual .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christianity preaches the physical Jesus, but we preach the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This One is private and spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have seen that the king s chambers signify our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He visits us in our spirit privately, and He comes to us in a spiritual way, not a physical way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He visits us privately as the all-inclusive, consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ the King brings His seekers into His chambers, that is into their regenerated spirit, His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Let us consider the application of this.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When I was young, I was taught to pray to God as the heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I was also told not to pray to the Spirit, because in the entire New Testament you cannot find a verse concerning praying to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But the more we pray, the more we have the feeling that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us Eph 4:6; 2 Cor 13:5; Rom 8:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>According to our experience, our spirit is the Holy of Holies the dwelling place, the inner chambers, of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In this first chapter of Song of Songs He and we have the private and affectionate fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The seeker in Song of Songs prayed, Draw me; we will run after you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then the king drew her and she followed, but she did not know where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The King knows where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must go to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The inner chambers of Christ are His lovers regenerated spirits mingled with and indwelt by Him as the life-dispensing Spirit Rom 8:16; 2 Tim 4:22; Rom 8:11 and are the practical Holy of Holies in Christ s lovers for their participation in and enjoyment of the pneumatic Christ as the consummated Triune God Heb 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>After we were saved we began to pray and eventually we realized that the heavenly Father, the Lord Jesus, and the Spirit are all in us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But at that time we did not know in what part of our being the Triune God dwelt.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We did not know that we had a human spirit, but gradually we found out that the Triune God dwells in our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The seeker followed the Lord, and He immediately brought her to her regenerated spirit to have fellowship with Him.</S>
