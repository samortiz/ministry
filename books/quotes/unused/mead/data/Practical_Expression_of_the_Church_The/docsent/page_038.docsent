   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Why must you look down on those who speak in tongues?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>And why must you look down on those who do not speak in tongues?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you think speaking in tongues can help you, do it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But do not look down on those who do not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And if you do not speak in tongues, do not look down on those who do.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We really need grace to be one in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The fellowship of the Body and of the church is based upon one thing: that is, we all are redeemed by the same blood and regenerated by the same divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our practice is one thing, but to take our practice as a basis for fellowship is another.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our practice may be according to our need, but we should not make our practice the basis of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For instance, we love to practice pray-reading because it helps us to enjoy the Lord, but we should never make pray-reading the basis of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether you like pray-reading or not, we do not care.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We simply love you because you are a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some who speak in tongues always like to convince others to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And some who practice baptism by immersion always like to convince others to take immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But we must be willing to drop all of these things as a basis for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may practice certain things because they help us, but we should not make any practice a basis for our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We really need grace for this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even our way of doing things should not hinder our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The way we do things may differ from that of others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If this is the case, we should not say a word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our way of doing things is not the basis for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There have been some in the past that have tried to adjust us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But we have told them that since we do not adjust them, they should not adjust us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Could everyone drive a car in the same way?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why we have "backseat" drivers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the car is driven by you, you must drive it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But when it is driven by others, you should let them drive it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Could you do this?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Could you let others drive and not say a word?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you drive a car in a certain way, you should not expect others to drive it in the same way as you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, we told the dear ones who tried to adjust us that as far as we were concerned, it was quite all right for them to do things in their way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We only asked that they would please give us the same freedom to do things in our way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must learn the lesson of grace in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may practice many things for the Lord, yet we should not make any one of these things the basis for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we practice the church life and take the standing of the unique ground of unity, we must not particularize in any thing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we once particularize anything, we become a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you prefer to speak in tongues, you should not expect the church to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you expect the whole church to speak in tongues, you will make it a sect of speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church is general, very general.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It cannot specialize in any particular thing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But the problem is that if the church does not take your opinion or your way, you will say that the church is narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But really, it is you who are narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We cannot take anything special.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must be general.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then we are really not narrow, but, in fact, broad.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be broad does not mean that we take in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To be broad means to be general, not opposing anything nor imposing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you are of a certain opinion, you should realize that not all the brothers will have the same concept.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot expect others always to hold the same opinion as we.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must be general.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should not be particular in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Wherever you go, do not make demands upon others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Perhaps their way is better than yours, or yours better than theirs, but this is not important.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must be so general that we may have the proper fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The proper fellowship is not based upon a way or a practice.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is only based upon the same life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Why must we always attempt to convince others?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Why must we make them the same as we?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As long as we all believe in the same Lord and are on the ground of unity, any kind of practice which is not sinful is tolerable.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must learn to give others the freedom to do things in their way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should never make anything a basis of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must respect every local church, realizing that it has its own jurisdiction.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>San Francisco may prefer to use wine at the Lord's Table, while another place may prefer grape juice.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must give them the freedom to use whatever they choose.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Why do we need to draw attention to this matter?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is because we have seen in the past that these things have created much trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>That is why we must be general.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only the Lord Himself can be our basis for fellowship.</S>
