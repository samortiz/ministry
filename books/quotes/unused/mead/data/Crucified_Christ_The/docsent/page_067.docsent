   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPIRITUAL GIFTS BEING CHRIST HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not only should our service be Christ, but our spiritual ability should also be Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is spiritual ability?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christians often mention the word gift.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A gift is a spiritual ability.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, if you are able to preach the word, this is your spiritual ability.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you preach the gospel better than others and bring many people to salvation, this is your spiritual ability.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some have this kind of ability, and others do not.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible shows us that there are many gifts, but we must understand that spiritual gifts are Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Spiritual gifts, spiritual abilities, come through the Holy Spirit and are functions of Christ in man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Corinthians shows us that the church is the Body of Christ and that every saved one is a member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the human body, the blood circulation of the members is the blood circulation of the body, and the blood circulation of the body is the blood circulation of the members.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The blood circulation of the ears is the blood circulation of the body, and the life of the ears is the life of the body, the life of the head.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, the life in Christ, the Head, and the life in the church, the Body, are both Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>EVERY MEMBER OF THE BODY OF CHRIST HAVING A FUNCTION</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The same life has the same blood circulation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When this life comes to the ears, it becomes the life of the ears, and when this life comes to the eyes, it becomes the life of the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is only one kind of life in the body, and there is only one blood circulation in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The life and the blood circulation are the same in every part of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, it is wonderful that when the life and the blood reach the eyes, the eyes can see; when the life and the blood reach the ears, the ears can hear.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This life, this blood circulation, enables every part of the body to have its own function.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A newborn baby can barely see with its eyes, hear with its ears, walk with its feet, or do things with its hands.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The baby's four limbs are all there and more or less have some function, yet they are not fully developed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Just as every member of our physical body has its own function, as saved ones and members of the Body of Christ, we each have our own function.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The function of the ears is to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hearing is the ability of the ears, which in biblical terms, is the gift of the ears.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, one's gift is one's function.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible tells us that some in the church can speak for the Lord and preach the gospel as the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This kind of speaking is a gift and is referred to in the Bible as prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some may not possess this kind of gift and function, but those who do have the prophesying gift may not possess the gift and function that others have.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To illustrate, the feet cannot speak, but they can walk; the hands cannot walk, but they can do things; the mouth cannot do things, but it can prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This shows us that the hands have the gift of doing things, the nose has the gift of smelling, and the mouth has the gift of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually, these gifts are the functions of the different members.</S>
