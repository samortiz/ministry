<h1 class="title">THE FIRST GREAT PILLAR<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY&mdash;THE TRUTH</h1>

<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY<br />
BEING THE RECOVERY OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>Today the whole earth needs the truth of the Lord that is in His Word. Regrettably, however, the Bible, the divine Word, has not been fully opened to the world. Thus, it has not been possible for people to fully know the truth of the Lord. At the most, Christians are able to boast that the holy Word of God has been published into many languages and propagated over the whole earth. Yet they are not able to say that after reading the Bible, regardless of which language, they have been able to truly understand the deep mysteries within it. They have been able to understand the superficial meanings of the things revealed in the Bible according to their own culture, philosophy, tradition, customs, ethics, living, and morality but have had no way of comprehending the mysteries of the truths in it. The mysteries of the truths in the Bible are very deep and profound. We need the spiritual enlightening of the Spirit of God to understand them, and we also need to spend time to dig them out (cf. 1 Cor. 2:10-14).</p>
<p>The truths in the holy Word of the Lord were completed approximately two thousand years ago, but over a period of a little more than one thousand years they seemed to slowly vanish. Only in the last few centuries have the truths again been released little by little through the zealous and careful study of many lovers of the Lord. This is what we refer to as the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the recovery of all the truths in the Bible that were lost. Thus, the recovery of the truth is one of the great pillars in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery lies with the recovery of the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH<br />
FOR THE SPREAD OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>The New Testament says repeatedly that we should know the truth. Moreover, when referring to this matter, Paul repeatedly says that we should come to the full knowledge of the truth (1 Tim. 2:4; 2 Tim. 2:25; 3:7; Titus 1:1). This means that we must know not just a small part or one aspect of the truth but rather the truth in its entirety and in all of its aspects. Paul also said that the church is the pillar and base of the truth (1 Tim. 3:15). This implies that the truth in the Bible is like a large building that is not one-sided but complete on all sides with a foundation and a roof. If we are going to spread the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today, we must know the truth and be able to expound the truth. For this reason, we must know every side of the truth without any biases or particular leanings.</p>
<p>The truth not only has many sides but also includes many crucial items. For example, the Bible speaks about God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, the believers, the church, the kingdom, and the New Jerusalem. The Bible begins with God, then continues with God&rsquo;s creation, man&rsquo;s fall, God&rsquo;s redemption, and God&rsquo;s entering into man to be man&rsquo;s life for man to be regenerated, sanctified, renewed, transformed, conformed into His own image, and ultimately to be brought fully into glory. In the midst of all these matters, the Bible also shows us the believers and the corporate church. This corporate church brings in the kingdom, consummating in the ultimate expression, which is the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. All of these aspects are included in the truths of the Bible.</p>
<p>Considering the deeper and more detailed truths, the Bible speaks about the two aspects of God&rsquo;s complete salvation of us: redemption and salvation. The aspect of redemption includes forgiveness, cleansing, justification, reconciliation, and acceptance; the aspect of salvation includes His coming to regenerate, sanctify, renew, and transform us, so as to conform us to His image and ultimately to bring us into His glory. This is God&rsquo;s complete salvation. We must diligently learn all of these things, obtain the knowledge of them, and be able to speak them clearly to others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO KNOW THE MYSTERIES OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>The above points merely show the different aspects of the truth, not the mysteries of the truth in their entirety. What are the mysteries of the truth in the Bible? What is the central mystery of the Bible? In brief, in the holy Word of God there is a central mystery. This central mystery is that the Triune God wants to dispense Himself into man. Our God is the Triune God, and He wants to dispense Himself into His chosen ones to be their life and everything. This is the kernel, the core, of the mystery in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Creating Man in His Image<br />
for the Purpose of Dispensing Himself into Man</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, many Bible readers do not and cannot see this point. For example, when they read Genesis chapter one, all they can see is that God created the heavens and the earth, that He then created all the living things, and that He finally created man. However, they do not see that the purpose of God&rsquo;s creation of man was to make it possible for Him to dispense Himself into man. They may realize from their reading that God created man according to His image, but they do not understand at all why God created man according to His image.</p>
<p>God created man in His own image so that He would be able to put Himself into man. Romans chapter nine says that God made man to be a vessel (v. 23). A vessel is a container made to hold something. For example, to hold a round object, a vessel for round objects must be made; to hold a square object, a vessel made for square objects must be made. A vessel is made in the shape of the object it is to contain. The hand has five fingers; thus, for a glove to be worn by the hand, it must resemble the five fingers of the hand. When a glove is made, it is made with five fingers so that one day a hand can be inserted into the glove. In the same way we are &ldquo;gloves&rdquo; made to contain God. The reason we were created in God&rsquo;s image and likeness was so that one day God could be put into us.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
