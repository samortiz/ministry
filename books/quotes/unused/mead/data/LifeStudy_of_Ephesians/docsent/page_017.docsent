   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FIVE THE PRAISE OF THE GLORY OF GOD S GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider the praise of the glory of God s grace 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This may appear to be a very simple subject, but actually it is very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may think that we are familiar with the words praise, glory, and grace, but if we are honest, we shall admit that we do not adequately know what they mean.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ephesians 1:6 says, To the praise of the glory of His grace, with which He graced us in the Beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This verse does not stand by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, it is the issue of predestination unto sonship mentioned in the preceding verse.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that the praise of the glory of God s grace is the result, the issue, of the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, in order to understand the praise in verse 6, we must know the sonship in verse 5.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we do not know the content of the sonship, we may merely understand verse 6 in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I. GOD S GRACE BEING WHAT HE IS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>TO US FOR OUR ENJOYMENT</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is God s grace?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is very difficult to define grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have been puzzled by this for many years, and even today I am still studying it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the New Testament, grace is what God is to us for our enjoyment John 1:16-17; 2 Cor 12:9; 1 Cor 15:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John 1:17 says that the law was given through Moses, but that grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul says that he labored more than the other apostles, yet not he, but the grace of God which was with him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Galatians 2:20 is parallel to 1 Corinthians 15:10.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Galatians 2:20 says, Not I, but Christ, and 1 Corinthians 15:10 says, Not I, but the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that grace is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Other portions of the New Testament emphasize grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, 2 Corinthians 13:14 says, The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, Paul opens all his Epistles with a reference to grace; he also ends them all with a word about grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Galatians 6:18 says, Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Second Timothy 4:22 says, The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Grace be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this verse Christ and grace are parallel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For the Lord Jesus Christ to be with our spirit is equal to grace being with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that grace is virtually equal to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we have Christ, we have grace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Christ came, grace came.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the reason John 1:17 says that grace came through Jesus Christ, indicating that grace is somewhat like a person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is personified.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This personification of grace is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although this may sound strange to some ears, it is nevertheless a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you get into the spirit of the New Testament concerning grace, you will realize that grace is somewhat personified.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When Paul said, Not I, but the grace of God which was with me, grace was a living person to him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Paul, a Person became the very grace to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, grace is actually God Himself; it is what God is to us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When God is enjoyed by us, that is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Grace is the very God in His Son Jesus Christ to be our portion so that we may enjoy all that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we do not enjoy Him as love, we do not have grace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if we enjoy God as love, we have grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Again I say, grace is what God is to us as our portion for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should sing not only of God s mercy enduring forever, but also of God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to compose some songs about God being grace to us, songs to express what God is for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we praise God only for His mercy, we remain on an elementary level.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to go on from God s mercy to God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Grace issues from mercy, just as high school is the continuation of elementary school.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After elementary school, we need to go on to high school.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to go on and not remain in elementary school so long.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many of today s Christians, however, remain in the elementary grades, even though they may have been Christians for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Let us go on to the higher grades and praise God for His grace.</S>
