<p>We have invited close to eighty trainees, who are neither elders nor co-workers, to join the training for elders and co-workers. At the same time we have also accepted some from various localities who are learning to be elders. I hope that these ones will not think that their coming here means that they are elders; hence, they should not give people the impression that they are being trained and invited to the elders&rsquo; training because they will soon be appointed to be elders. This simply is not true. Our purpose in inviting these ones is that many more young brothers will know the importance of the elders, the need for elders, because as Paul said, &ldquo;If anyone aspires to the overseership, he desires a good work&rdquo; (1 Tim. 3:1). Whether or not these ones eventually become elders depends upon their future performance.</p>
<p>No one should think that because he has been invited, he is an elder. Becoming an elder depends on future performance and the manifestation in their environment. Nevertheless, we deeply hope that after hearing such a word and seeing God&rsquo;s need, the younger generation will pray, &ldquo;O Lord, have mercy on me. For Your use I want to have the portion of being an elder and bearing responsibility in Your recovery.&rdquo; If there are six hundred elders who can be sent out two by two to serve in different places, over three hundred churches will be raised up immediately. We believe that if two proper elders, who have some learning, know the truth, and hold God&rsquo;s people in their bosom and bear them upon their shoulders, are sent out, they will certainly raise up a church no matter where they go.</p>
<p>Our problem today is basically that the elders in the local churches are weak. If the elders were strong and rich in spiritual matters, we would have had much increase in these twenty years. In Taipei we have ten thousand saints as a foundation; although we have such great capital, we have not made a profit in twenty years; this is inexcusable. We are here not to reprimand anyone but with the hope that we all will be on the alert and know our real situation and lack.</p>
<p>This lack is mainly due to two groups of people: the elders and the co-workers. If the condition of an existing church is poor, the elders bear more of the responsibility. If the elders are strong and rich in spiritual matters, the church will surely yield rich fruit, and it will not be without increase for twenty years. Moreover, the population in Taiwan is increasing, the economy is thriving, and every aspect is progressing; only the church is an exception. It is not right for every aspect of society to be advancing while the church stands still. If the entire society was going backward and the population was decreasing, there might be an excuse for the lack of increase in the church, because basic qualities are lacking. However, in these twenty-some years, the development of Taiwan has become well known throughout the world. At the same time the conditions for the advance of the church are more than favorable; nevertheless, if the church is still unable to advance, the responsibility lies entirely upon the elders and co-workers.</p>
<p>For this reason we need to come together to study and see God&rsquo;s need from the view of God&rsquo;s economy. We should never think that since we serve full time and have some experience in the Lord&rsquo;s work, we are co-workers. In fact, this is not worth anything. If we have some value, it is because our heart is truly set on the Lord, and we are willing to do something for Him. I hope that the young people can see this point clearly. There is no position among us; if someone desires to seek a position among us, he has come to the wrong place. There is no future among us; if some here are planning for their future, they have come to the wrong place. We have neither position nor future. All we have is God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>The Lord has given us many messages on the cross for the purpose that we would daily live under the shadow of the cross and put our soul-life to death. As such people we have no future. We daily live in death and put our soul-life to death. We know that while man seeks to live, Christians need to die. On the one hand, we have lost our future and are without any future. On the other hand, we have a future, a future that is full of glory. If we are not for the Lord&rsquo;s church, our being on earth is without meaning. Many who have heard my experience know that I should have died many years ago, but the Lord has allowed me to live for more than twenty years; therefore, I would like all the young people to see the Lord&rsquo;s way clearly, receive a burden from the Lord, and be used by Him to release His riches and grace. Today in the local churches the Lord needs two groups of people&mdash;the co-workers and the elders. The church needs these two groups of people. I hope that we all are clear concerning this point and learn to present ourselves and pray to the Lord: &ldquo;Lord, I want to be a co-worker or an elder.&rdquo;</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_071.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_073.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 2: Leading the Saints to Practice the New Way Ordained by the Lord &nbsp; pg 72</div><br></body></html>
