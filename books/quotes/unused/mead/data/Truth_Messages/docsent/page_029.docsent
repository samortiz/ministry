   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD OVERLAYING HIS RECOVERED PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Recently, some among us became dissenting, although they claimed to have seen the ground and to be for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because they had not been solidly overlaid with gold, they caused the oneness to be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The same thing may happen in the future to anyone who is not fully overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not having an adequate amount of God can create a serious problem with the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord s recovery is not a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We do not desire to gain a large number of people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the recovery we are concerned for the genuine weight of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The important question is this: How much of God do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord s recovery consists of God overlaying His recovered people with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whenever I see that any are dissenting, I feel sorry for them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the same time I realize that such a situation of dissension is a test, an exposure, and a purification.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is a test of what is real, of how much gold we actually have.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all need to gain more gold.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not sufficient only to have a good heart, to know the truth, and to care for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everything depends upon how much gold we have.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all can become dissenting if we are short of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This should be a warning to us all.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Again I say that genuine oneness is possible only in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE TOP PORTION OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to say a word now about the golden rings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even after the boards had been overlaid with a heavy layer of gold, they could not be held together without the rings, which were called the receptacles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The overlaying gold is the ordinary gold, but the golden rings are the top portion of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates our need for the top portion of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For the practical oneness we need this special portion of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order for there to be the oneness among the standing boards of the tabernacle, every board had to have this portion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was the rings made from this portion of gold that held the uniting bars.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we seriously consider the picture of the standing boards in Exodus 26, we shall be deeply impressed with how much we are short of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From 1925, I began to read articles in Christian magazines about the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although these articles provided help on how to be victorious, they did not say that we needed more of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We do not need to learn so many methods.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our need is simply to sink into the Triune God and to gain more of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God is our truth, our way, our life, our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not have God, we have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our problem is that we are short of God, and our need is to gain more of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Perhaps you are one who is standing firmly in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is very good, but what about the oneness in the Triune God?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all need an adequate portion of God for the overlaying of the boards and the top portion of God for the rings that hold the uniting bars.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we have both the ordinary gold and the top portion of gold, we shall have no problems with the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, if we do not gain the necessary gold, sooner or later we shall have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need the solid oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This oneness is the adequate amount of God we have obtained.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do not rely on teachings or doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Moreover, do not depend on your own love or your natural affection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not even your steady will is trustworthy in keeping the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only one thing is dependable for oneness, and that is the adequate amount of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Just as the standing boards could be one only in the gold, we can be one only by sinking into God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today the Lord needs the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we do not have this oneness, we cannot go on in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, the most vital and crucial matter is the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The only way to be kept in this solid, real oneness is to have an adequate amount of the experienced God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is our need today.</S>
