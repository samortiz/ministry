 <h2 class="head1">THE MINGLED SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Not only can you not divide Christ from the Spirit, but you also should not separate the Holy Spirit from your spirit. Romans 8:4 says that we need to walk according to spirit. According to what spirit shall we walk? It is not just according to the Holy Spirit nor just according to the human spirit. But it is according to the mingled spirit. In like manner Romans 8:6 says that we need to set our mind upon the spirit. What spirit is this? Again it must be the mingled spirit.</p>
<p>Even in the matter of being led by the Spirit as mentioned in verse 14, it is a matter of the human spirit with the Holy Spirit. The Spirit would never lead you apart from your spirit. He leads you when He is mingled with your spirit. He can never lead you unless your spirit is mingled by Him and with Him. What a subjective thing this is! By this you can see that few Christians today actually understand the Spirit&rsquo;s leading because they don&rsquo;t know they have a spirit. Even the more, they don&rsquo;t know that the Holy Spirit today is one with their spirit. How then could they know the Spirit&rsquo;s leading? The leading Spirit today is not only in our spirit, but also mingled with our spirit. It is such a mingled spirit who is leading us. Sometimes when people have problems, they think they need to go to a certain place and think about them for several days in order to solve them. Our experiences tell us that the more we think concerning the problems, the more we get into the forest. We get into the thick woods because the leading is not there. Why? Because the Leader is not there. The Leader is in our spirit. Actually, this Leader makes our spirit a partnership of His leading. Forget about going to the mountain to think about something; turn to your spirit! Many of us could testify that regardless of the situation, when we would turn to our spirit, the sky is clear. This is to be led by the Spirit in and through and with our spirit. It is wonderful!</p>
<p>Then we would cry, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a son of God! He&rsquo;s my Father and I&rsquo;m His son! He and I are one life! We are one nature! Wonderful! Oh, Father!&rdquo; Then we would witness, and we would groan, and He would intercede within us. When we are in such a groaning, in such an interceding, we are really one spirit with Him. We don&rsquo;t care for anything on this earth. We have no interest other than His. When we are in this kind of situation, the law of the Spirit of life works, setting us free. At that time no doubt we are actually sons of God, and we are members of Christ. Right away we are in the Body life. Now you see that the Lord couldn&rsquo;t have the Body life for centuries because there were no Christians who were in such a kind of situation-walking according to spirit, setting the mind on the spirit, putting to death every practice of the body, being led all the time, crying, witnessing, and groaning. We must be such a person in such a living. Right away we will be in the Body of Christ in an actual way.</p>
