   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A BAIT WITH A HOOK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the same way, I do not care that much for doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I am so much for the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As long as I have Christ, I have the real gold.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Please do not talk to me about doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Doctrine is always a bait, and with the bait there is a hook.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must be careful about doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am afraid that many of you are still not off the hook.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You have been hooked for years with your doctrines, but how much Christ do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some dear Christians think that they are so right and scriptural, yet they are so dead.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They have been hooked for over twenty years, and they are still hooked.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They have not been freed from doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Immediately after I was saved, I was hooked by doctrines for seven and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One day while I was walking on the street, the Lord stirred within me to show how dead and unfruitful I was.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I had much knowledge from the types and prophecies, but I was dead.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I repented to the Lord and asked for His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It seemed that I had gotten off the hook.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the little hook was still in my throat.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It has taken me twenty-five years to fully get off this hook.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But today I can say that I am free.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Praise the Lord, I am liberated!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have been liberated from the hook of doctrine!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now I would ask, How about you?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you have been liberated from the hook of doctrine, you will never say I do not like this doctrine or that.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You are free from this hook.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To care for the doctrines means to care for the hook.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I fear that nearly all Christians are hooked.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the day you were saved there was something living, bubbling, and transparently wonderful within you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then you thought you had to go to church to learn more about the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There the pastor helped you study the Bible and learn all the right doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He may also have recommended that you go to Bible school or seminary.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then you graduated in a dead way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You were hooked by all the dead doctrines; you have been distracted from receiving the help of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>May the Lord have mercy upon us all!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>While ministering in a certain place, a young man studying at a seminary came to speak to me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He asked if I believed in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I told him that I believed more than he.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then he asked if I believed in the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I asked what kind of rapture he was talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is the pre-tribulation, post-tribulation, and mid-tribulation rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Poor Christianity!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no ministry of Christ as the rich gold.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They only have the dead teachings and doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After this young brother had asked me a few questions and I did not satisfy him, he said, Goodbye Mr. Lee; I ll see you in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I called him to come back and sit down.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He wanted to see me in heaven, but I wanted to see him here.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I thank the Lord that He saved this young brother from the doctrinal hook.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Nearly all Christians in this country have been killed by the teachings, doctrines, and knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The first year I came to minister in this country, I was invited to three different groups.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everyone was utterly dead.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I told them that Christ today is the living One and that they did not need the dead doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What they needed was the living Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All of them rebuked me to my face.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Immediately after I finished speaking, they came to tell me that my doctrine was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I assured them that whether I was doctrinally wrong or not, they would see one day that they are short of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>That was the end. They never invited me again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Instead, I became famous among them as a preacher of heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They sent out a paper saying that none of their groups should invite me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When I read it, I was happy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I did not need to minister the living Christ to such a dead place.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is just a waste of time.</S>
