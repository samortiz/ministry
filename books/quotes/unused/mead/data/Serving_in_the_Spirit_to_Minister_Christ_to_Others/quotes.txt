[1]  We must learn not to act or serve according to knowledge, but to act and serve according to the inmost feeling.
[2]  But gradually the Lord brought me to a point where I had to minister in the spirit, according to spirit, not according to the mentality or to knowledge.
[3]  And I can testify to you that many times in the past years, even on the way to the meeting, I didn t know what to minister, simply because I was planning to serve in the spirit.
[4]  Many times, when I was praying together with some living ones who prayed in the spirit, after just one sentence I had to say, Amen, because there was a deep echo in my spirit to their prayer in the spirit.
[5]  When you are going to visit one of the saints, you need to learn to visit in the spirit.
[6]  Because you have a renewed spirit which is indwelt by the Holy Spirit, you have the anointing within you.
[7]  During the very time you are listening to her, you must exercise your spirit to sense her spirit and to sense the anointing within you.
[8]  If you would do this, while you are listening on one hand and sensing on the other hand, the anointing, the Holy Spirit within you, will reveal to you something so spiritual and so heavenly.
[9]  While you are listening, you have to fellowship with the Lord and to sense both what is in her spirit and what is the anointing in your spirit.
[10]  In one gospel meeting after we had taken the way of preaching according to the inner feeling of the spirit, while I was speaking I felt I should say, You say you are not a sinner?
