   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FACE OF A MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first face is the face of a man, because we ourselves are men.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since we are men, we should look like men.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We were created as men, but we were corrupted, poisoned, and damaged by the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, we needed the Lord's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By the Lord's redemption, we were brought back to the proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Strictly speaking, the humanity we have now is not ours but His.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have the humanity of Jesus within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Among the Chinese people there is a kind of saying that it is difficult to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They feel that it is preferable to end the human life by death and to become something else.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But this concept is absolutely different from the Lord's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord's salvation is to make us proper men.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some of the husbands might say, "I am tired of being a husband."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But you must realize that the Lord's salvation is to make you a proper husband on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you are a wife, the Lord's salvation is to make you a proper wife.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you are a parent, the Lord's salvation is to make you a proper parent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you are a child, the Lord's salvation is to make you a proper child.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hallelujah, the Lord's salvation is to make us proper human beings!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, we all must bear the face of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Occasionally, I have seen some seeking ones, particularly sisters, who do not seem to be human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are so "spiritual" that it seems they are strange creatures half human and half angel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They even practice this kind of behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes I upset this kind of situation by causing them either to laugh at me or to become angry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then they became real.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once a dear sister whom I knew quite well came to me in a peculiar way as half human and half angel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because I was really unhappy with that, I said to her, "Sister, I know that you are always not right with your husband."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Immediately she blew up.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"What!" she said, "Brother Lee, you are a brother and you always take the side of the brothers!"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then I said to her, "Now I am happy."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The half angel was blown away by my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all prefer to be something else.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The sisters especially like to be something else, but we all need simply to be human.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Never pretend to be something else.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You must be what you are a man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But this is not to be human by your own humanity, but by the Lord's humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to have the face of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Please read the four Gospels again and notice that Jesus was a person with the proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many who read the four Gospels only pay attention to the miracles worked out by His divinity; they never pay attention to the things worked out by the Lord's humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I like to see the beauty shown in the Lord's humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example, John 4 relates how the Lord Jesus was traveling with His disciples to the city of Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because He was tired and thirsty, He asked His disciples to go into the city to buy something to eat, while He rested.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After they were gone, the Samaritan woman came.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What a marvelous picture!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was the Almighty God, yet He was behaving Himself like a normal man, without any hint that He was God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When He asked the woman for water, He gave no indication that He was anything more than a man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That woman even rebuked Him, and He was willing to suffer her rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The four Gospels record many stories like this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord Jesus behaved Himself like a normal human being, bearing the face of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today, we too must bear the face of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE FACE OF A LION</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We also must bear the face of a lion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A lion in the Bible signifies boldness, vigor, strength, and victory.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In our Christian life we need first to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At our school, in our office, among our neighbors, we must be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But we must also be a lion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If in the office you are a proper man, it will draw people to you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When they are drawn to you, they will be the germs corrupting you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They will like you and invite you to participate in evil things, such as movies.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At that time you must not behave as a man, but as a lion.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Toward anything sinful or worldly, we must be as bold as a lion.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All the people working in your office should know that if they talk to you about going to a movie, you will behave like a lion.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>People always consider that the Lord Jesus was gentle and mild.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But at least once He was not gentle.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When He went into the temple and saw all the moneychangers, He whipped them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He was mad.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Furthermore, one day He called those Pharisees a generation of vipers Matt 23:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He was bold and vigorous, even mad.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He was really like a lion.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In Revelation, He is called "The Lion of the tribe of Judah" Rev 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We all must have the face of a lion.</S>
