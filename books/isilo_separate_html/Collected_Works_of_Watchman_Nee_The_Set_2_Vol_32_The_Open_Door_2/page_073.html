Thank the Lord that His Spirit moved ahead of me. Not long after I arrived, I encountered Him in many things. I was sick for ten days after I arrived, because of my maladjustment to the environment. However, it was actually the base attack of Satan. Thank God that He always leads us into victory in the Christ. Hallelujah! Glory to Him! I need greater dealings, brighter revelation, and deeper knowledge. Spiritual work is indeed most serious, proper, and real. Unfortunately, we have worked foolishly, capriciously, and loosely in the past, and we have truly come short of the glory of the Lord. Except for the Lord's mercy and endurance, our one talent would have been withdrawn and given to those who have ten talents. Thank the Lord that He is willing to give us grace, and by grace we are still able to go on. The victory of Joshua at the bottom of the mountain was due to the lifted hands of Moses and the supporting hands of Aaron and Hur on the top of the mountain. Please pray much for the work in the Philippines. I hope that the Lord will give us some Filipino and Western co-workers, release much truth, and build up the scriptural local churches. In Christ there is no difference in nationality, race, and social status. If we only preach to the Chinese, is our work not somewhat unbalanced? Sister Chai Teh-an is still here. May the Lord open the door to the work among the Westerners and the Filipinos. "O Jehovah, revive Your work/In the midst of the years;/In the midst of the years make it known;/In wrath remember compassion" (Hab. 3:2).</p><p>Brother Wu Ren-jieh, January 2, 1939</p><h2 class="head1">MISCELLANEOUS NEWS</h2><p>(1) Sister Bau Shu-min wrote on December 29 of last year that she arrived in Pu-Tien on the twenty-eighth.
