   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CLEARING THE ARTERIES OF OUR PSYCHOLOGICAL HEART</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our psychological heart has three main arteries.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These arteries, which are also the three parts of the soul, are the mind, the will, and the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is important to know how in a practical way to have these arteries unclogged.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The way to unclog the three main arteries of our psychological heart is to make a thorough confession to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From experience I have learned that we need to stay with the Lord for a period of time to confess our defects, failures, defeats, mistakes, wrongdoings, and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A. Concerning the Mind</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may begin by confessing all the sinfulness and uncleanness that is in our mind, in our thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The artery of our mind can be compared to a ditch that is clogged with dirt and needs to be dug out so that water can flow through it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By confessing our thoughts one by one, we shall remove the blockage from this artery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we are making confession in this way, we may confess to the Lord how natural our understanding is concerning many matters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may understand the Lord, the church, the saints, and our parents according to our natural concepts and not according to the Spirit and the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to confess to the Lord and say, "Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although I love You, my understanding of many matters are still natural.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Deliver me.''</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is an illustration of the kind of confession we need to make concerning our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>B. Concerning the Will</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What then, about our will?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we go to the Lord concerning our will, He will expose it in a thorough and detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It may seem as if we are being examined under a divine microscope, for one by one there will be brought to light all the germs in our will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In particular, we shall realize that we are very rebellious, that we do not know what it means to be submissive to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One by one, we need to confess the germs of rebellion in our will.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord may show you that, a few years ago, you were wrong in a particular matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then He may go on to show you how you were wrong with a certain brother or a certain sister.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Each time you will need to confess.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You should thank the Lord that you are under His light, under His exposure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By confessing all that the Lord exposes in our will, we unclog the artery of our will.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>C. Concerning the Emotion</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The artery of the emotion also needs to be unclogged.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we realize how serious is the problem we have with our emotion, we may be deeply sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may despair and feel utterly ashamed of the condition of our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We shall realize that in many cases we hate what we should love, and love what we should hate.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we come into the light of the sanctuary, we shall see that the most ugly aspect of our being is our emotion, for we do not use it properly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Both our joyfulness and our sorrow may be altogether natural.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As the Lord exposes us, we may feel ashamed of the way we have expressed joy and sorrow, for that expression often was natural, fleshly, even fleshy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No wonder our psychological heart does not function normally.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we take the time necessary to unclog the three main arteries of our psychological heart, we shall have the sense that our entire being has become living.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our mind, will, and emotion will all be in a very healthy condition.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the "dirt'' in these "ditches'' will then be dug away.</S>
