   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE FUNCTIONING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE BODY DRINKING BY SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 12:13 says that in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body and that we were all made to drink of one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we consider this verse in the light of verses 3 through 12, we shall see that to drink is both to call on the name of the Lord and to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we speak, we drink.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The baptism into the one Body, which transpired nearly two thousand years ago, has positioned us all to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Practically speaking, to drink is to function, to call on the name of the Lord, and to utter something for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you do not speak in the meeting, you cannot drink.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Apparently, when we speak, we are speaking something out; actually, we are drinking, taking something in. The more I speak, the more I drink.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the reason I am satisfied after speaking in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Probably you have often had the sense in the meeting to say something; but because you were cautious, the opportunity was lost, and you went home defeated, feeling like a deflated tire.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, we can also testify that when we speak in the meeting, we return home in triumph.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that if we speak in the meetings, we are drinking as we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we speak out, we drink in. Our speaking is our drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, we all need to learn to speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First Corinthians 12:15 and 16 say, "If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to understand Paul's intention in writing these words.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many Christians, members of the Body, have the concept that they are not as good or as high as others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, we may think that our hands are better than our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Suppose one of the members of the Body who is a foot says, "I am just a poor foot, not a beautiful hand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, I am not of the Body."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a form of self-despising.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I know that in their hearts many saints despise themselves and say, "I am not that good.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord didn't give me five talents or two talents.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I'm not sure He even gave me one full talent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because I am so poor, I don't need to function."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who feel this way may consider that they are not of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When they come to the meetings, they act like outsiders or spectators.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They do not join in the Body activity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, Paul's intention in these verses is to tell those who, outwardly speaking, may seem inferior to others not to despise themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such members should not say that they are not of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After referring to the foot and the hand, Paul speaks of the ears and the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Comparatively speaking, the eyes are more excellent than the ears.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When you look at a person's face, you look firstly at his eyes, not at his ears.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Just as the feet are apparently inferior to the hands, so the ears seemingly are inferior to the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Body, some are the feet, and others are the ears.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Both may consider themselves inferior to other members.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some among us hold this concept and say, "I am not as smart as Brother So-and-so.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is no need for me to say anything in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even if I did speak, I could not speak well.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, I am excused from functioning."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In my experience throughout the years, I have come to know the psychology of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some of the sisters say, "We are the weaker vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the meetings, the brothers should be the ones to bear the responsibility because they are the stronger ones."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Others may excuse themselves as being too old, too young, or too shy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For this reason, only a few, such as the hands and the eyes, function in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The reason so many do not function is that they consider themselves inferior.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If they are a foot, they view themselves as inferior to the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If they are an ear, they see themselves as inferior to the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, they do not function.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It seems that their not functioning is humility; actually it is a form of pride.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some feel that if they cannot say something outstanding, with an utterance better than that of the Apostle Paul, they will not say anything at all.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We all need to be converted and become like little children who gradually learn to speak without any consciousness of being smart or dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One of my little grandchildren talked all day long, although hardly anyone understood what he was saying.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It was even difficult to tell what language he was speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But day by day his speaking improved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At first, not one word was right.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But gradually he began to use the right words.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now he speaks better English than I do.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All the saints must learn to speak in the meetings, even if they seem at times to speak nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Of course, I do not encourage anyone to speak nonsense intentionally.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We in the church are a family, not a graduate school where everyone is studying for a master's degree or a doctoral degree.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Most of us are still in kindergarten or even in nursery school.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some are in elementary school, others in junior high or high school, and a few are on a college level.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The church is not an army it is a family, a body.</S>
