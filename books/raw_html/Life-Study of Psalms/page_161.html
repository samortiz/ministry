<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. PRAISING THE KING IN HIS VICTORY</H2><P>In Psalm 45:3-5 we have the psalmist's praising the King in His victory. Adam and all his descendants, including us, have been defeated. Only Christ is the Victor. The Gospels reveal that He has overcome everything and has gained the victory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. As the Mighty One<br>Girding His Sword upon His Thigh<br>in His Majesty and Splendor</H2><P>Verse 3 says, "Gird Your sword upon Your thigh, O mighty One,/In Your majesty and Your splendor." In the eyes of Satan and of all the fallen angels, Christ is the mighty One who has girded His sword upon His thigh, the One with majesty and splendor. Both His majesty and His splendor are signs of His victory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In His Splendor Riding On Victoriously<br>Because of Truth, Meekness, and Righteousness</H2><P>Verse 4a continues, "And in Your splendor ride on victoriously/Because of truth and meekness and righteousness." Splendor is the expression of glory. While Christ was on earth, the only time He showed His splendor was when He was transfigured on the mountain (Matt. 17:1-2). But after His resurrection and ascension, He showed Himself in His splendor and majesty to Paul (Acts 26:13-15) and to John (Rev. 1:9-20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. His Right Hand Performing Awesome Deeds</H2><P>Psalm 45:4b says, "Let Your right hand teach You awesome deeds." Here we understand the word teach to mean perform. Christ has performed many awesome deeds, including His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. The most awesome deed performed by Christ was His crucifixion. Christ's crucifixion was a great event that threatened Satan, the demons, and the fallen angels, the powers of darkness in the air. The cross of Christ is the most awesome thing in the universe. Whereas we appreciate the cross, Satan flees from it.</P><P>The Lord Jesus did many awesome things during His life and ministry on earth. Actually, everything He did was awesome. For example, His boldness in rejecting His natural relationship with His mother was awesome (Matt. 12:46-50). Likewise, His way of dealing with Peter in Matthew 17:24-27 was awesome. Peter spoke presumptuously concerning Christ's paying the temple tax, which was equal to a half-shekel (vv. 24-25a). After Peter did this, the Lord corrected him. Eventually, as part of His correction of Peter, He said to him, "Go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. And when you open its mouth, you will find a stater [equal to one shekel]; take that and give it to them for Me and you" (v. 27). Because Christ is the Creator, He could do such an awesome thing. Everything the Lord Jesus does, whether great or small, is awesome.</P>
