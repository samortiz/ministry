   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT OF GOD IN GOD'S CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Spirit was first the Spirit of God in God's creation Gen 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In His person He is forever the Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 2 the earth became waste and empty because of God's judgment on Satan's rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then God came in as the Spirit of God to move upon the face of the waters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This Spirit is God in the element of His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As the Spirit of God, He is related to the creation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE SPIRIT OF JEHOVAH</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>IN GOD'S RELATIONSHIP WITH MAN</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Spirit is not merely a power or an influence; He is a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Genesis 1 this wonderful person was the Spirit of God in God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In chapter two the name Jehovah is mentioned for the first time v. 4 . Jehovah is God's name in His relationship with man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's relationship with man is more intimate than His relationship with creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After creating man, God remained intimately involved with him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is why in the Old Testament the Spirit is usually referred to as the Spirit of Jehovah Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>3:10; 6:34; Isa 61:1; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>11:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Spirit of Jehovah came upon certain people Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>3:10; 6:34; 11:29; 14:6, 19; 15:14; 1 Sam 16:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that the Spirit of Jehovah has to do with God's reaching of man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As the Spirit of Jehovah, He empowered man to carry out His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, in the Old Testament two wonderful titles of the Spirit are unveiled.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first title is the Spirit of God in God's creation, and the second title is the Spirit of Jehovah in His reaching of man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THE CONCEPTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>OF JOHN THE BAPTIST AND THE LORD JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the New Testament, when the Lord was about to move forward to do something further in His economy, the title the Holy Spirit is used for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Psalm 51:11 and Isaiah 63:10-11 the King James Version uses the term Holy Spirit; but the proper translation of this term should be "Spirit of holiness."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was the Holy Spirit in the conceptions of John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus in order to sanctify humanity for Christ's incarnation Luke 1:15, 35; Matt 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is a distinction between the work of the Holy Spirit in the conception of John the Baptist and the work of the Holy Spirit in the conception of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the conception of John the Baptist the Holy Spirit came to an overage, elderly person in order to produce a son who was merely human.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was God's miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>John the Baptist was full of the Holy Spirit from his mother's womb Luke 1:15 , but he had only the human nature and lacked the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John's being full of the Holy Spirit enabled him to stand against the tide of that evil religious age and initiate a new dispensation for God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This also qualified John to be the one who introduced the Savior to His people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the conception of Jesus the Holy Spirit went further.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Luke 1:35 says, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore also the holy thing which is born will be called the Son of God."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the conception of Jesus the divine essence of the Holy Spirit was added to the human essence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to Matthew 1:20, the Triune God was born into Mary's womb through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The result of such a work of the Spirit was a God-man with two natures, divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Jesus is the complete God and the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today the Holy Spirit is still working.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is working in us not according to the conception of John the Baptist but according to the conception of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to 1 Corinthians 12:3, whenever we call on the name of Jesus, we are in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This Spirit is operating in us to saturate us with God's holy nature, making us holy for God's purpose.</S>
