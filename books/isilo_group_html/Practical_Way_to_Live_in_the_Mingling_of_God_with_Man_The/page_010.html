BEING THE KEY TO THE SCRIPTURES</h2>
<p>After forty years of studying the Bible, I can say with assurance that if we do not realize the mingling of God with man, we can never understand the Scriptures thoroughly. The key to all the parables, types, prophecies, admonitions, teachings, doctrines, and truths in the Bible is the mingling of God with man. Without this key, even if we seemingly understand the Bible, our understanding is superficial. We cannot understand the Bible deeply until we touch the mingling of God with man. Because this is the key, it is possible to see this mingling in any part of the Scriptures. For example, 1 Corinthians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?&rdquo; The temple of God is the mingling of God with man. The temple itself, humanity, is the container, and the One who comes into the temple to dwell there, God Himself, is the content. Hence, the real meaning of the temple of God is the mingling of God with man. By this we can see that the key to unlocking the Bible is the mingling of God with man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICAL WAY TO BE MINGLED WITH GOD</h2>
<p>In order to participate practically in the mingling of God with man, we must know how to exercise our spirit and deny our soul-life. Genuine spirituality and the mingling of God with man can be realized by us only in the spirit; it cannot be realized in the soul. Nevertheless, most Christians are taught and trained to exercise their mind; rarely are they taught how to exercise their spirit. As a result, although people may understand doctrines, they may not know how to enter into the experience of these doctrines in their spirit. Take for example the matter of taking Christ as our food and drink. Although some may understand this matter as a teaching or a doctrine in the mind, very few know how to exercise their spirit to eat and drink Christ practically. Hence, we must learn how to exercise the spirit that God has formed within us. The exercise of the spirit is not mere doctrine; it is the practical way to eat and drink Christ and thus be mingled with God.</p>
<p>The way to exercise our spirit is to deny our self&mdash;the natural mind, emotion, and will. In our daily life we constantly encounter situations that expose our need to deny the self and exercise the spirit. If you are a man from China, you were raised in a certain way and have a particular way of doing things. Another brother, however, may be from the United States and may consequently do things the American way. If you and the American brother are in the self and have to coordinate to do something, there will be friction. In your emotion, you will not be happy with the other brother, and in your mind, you will not agree with some of the things he does. If you would take Christ as your life, you cannot go along with your emotion and mind. If you cling to your natural mind and emotion, that is an indication that you are still living by your natural life and are not taking Christ as your life. You must deny the self, including the mind, emotion, and will. It is good in such situations to declare to the self, &ldquo;I am a reborn person. Christ dwells within my spirit, and He is my life. Mind, I will not live by you. Emotions, I will not go along with you. Christ lives in my spirit, and I will go along with my spirit.&rdquo; This is to deny the self and reject the natural life. In so doing, you give the Holy Spirit within your spirit an opportunity to take over, saturate, and renew your mind, emotion, and will, transforming them from being natural to being the mind, emotion, and will of Christ. When we turn to our spirit, the Holy Spirit strengthens us into our inner man to reject the natural life.</p>
<p>My burden is not to give you more knowledge and doctrine; my burden is to help you know how to exercise your spirit, where God and man are mingled. There are two ways to live our lives. The first is to merely imitate what the Lord did. The second is to receive Him as our life and then let Him live in us. It is one thing to imitate Christ; it is another thing entirely for this very Jesus to come into us, mingle with us, and be our life. It is impossible for us to do what He did and be what He was by imitation. Even if such an imitation were somehow possible, it would be a false imitation. The outward imitation of Christ is not the genuine Christian life. The real Christian life is one of mingling with Christ by both exercising our spirit to eat and drink Him and denying the self. This is the practical way to live in the mingling of God with man.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Practical Way to Live in the Mingling of God with Man &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
