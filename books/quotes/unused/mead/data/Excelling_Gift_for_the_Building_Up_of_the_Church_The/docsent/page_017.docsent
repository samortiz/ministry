   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PATTERNS OF PERFECTING The Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The patterns of perfecting are the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Acts 20 Paul reminded the elders in Ephesus of what he did when he was among them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That meant that he wanted the elders to do the same thing that he did among them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He told them to remember how he was with them for three years, admonishing all the saints day and night with tears v. 31 . He said that he did not shrink from declaring to them all the counsel of God v. 27 . He also reminded them that he taught them publicly and from house to house v. 20 . This was how the Apostle Paul perfected the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1 Thessalonians Paul likened himself to a nursing mother 2:6-8 and an exhorting father 2:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was a mother cherishing and nourishing the saints and a father teaching the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the way to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The gifted ones among us should do the work of cherishing and nourishing the saints as a mother and of exhorting, admonishing, teaching, and instructing them as a father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should have many mothers and fathers in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to follow the Lord to go out as a mother and as a father to visit others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are many saints among us who have not been in the church meetings for years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All of these dear ones need us to nourish them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not go to them and say, We haven t seen you in a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Please come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to nourish them and take the opportunity to give them some helpful instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to recover the dear ones among us who have not been coming to the meetings for years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul said that he yearned over the saints and was well pleased to impart to them not only the gospel but also his own soul 1 Thes 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all should do this kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some may ask whether Paul was doing the work of an apostle, a prophet, an evangelist, or a shepherd and teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>My response is that I neither know nor am concerned about this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What matters is that we do the work that Paul did.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this fellowship we have seen what the work of the ministry is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do not respond to this fellowship and the Lord returns, He may call us slothful slaves and cast us into outer darkness for a period of time Matt 25:26, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not good enough to have merely the knowledge of what the gifted persons do.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many sinners need to be saved, and many backsliding saints need to be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to cooperate with the Lord to carry out this work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We also have to speak Christ forth into others, ministering the riches of Christ into others whenever the church comes together.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is the need of such a revival among all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to bear our responsibility and do our duty.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our duty today is to perfect others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to get people saved, nourish them, teach them, raise them up, and put them into the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is not to build up a congregation but to build up the Body of Christ in an organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Prophets</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A pattern of prophesying is seen in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 3 says, He who prophesies speaks to men building up and encouragement and consolation Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>. This is a pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verses 24 and 25, he says that prophesying convicts people and judges them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we speak the word in a pure motive without any intention to judge others, our word will be used by the Lord to convict others, to judge them, and to make their condition manifest to them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When people s real condition is manifested to them, they will admit that God is among us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If God were not among us, how could an unbeliever or unlearned person s condition be manifested to him when we do not even know it?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Such prophesying ministers God to the hearers and brings them to God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Evangelists</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Acts 8 presents the pattern of the evangelists.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 4 says that all the scattered saints from Jerusalem went out to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Surely their preaching involved visiting others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These saints did not have a hall to have a large gathering for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They went everywhere to visit people and bring the good news to them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Philip the evangelist also went out to preach the gospel v. 5 . As he was on the road, he preached the gospel to an Ethiopian man and baptized him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He did not baptize him in a baptistry but in a body of water that was near the road.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The baptisms of the early believers were without regulations and rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They did what was convenient according to where they were.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Shepherds and Teachers</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Scriptures also show us the pattern of the shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord s conversation with Peter in John 21:15-17 indicates that if we love the Lord, we must feed His lambs, shepherd His sheep, and feed His sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Matthew 28:20 the Lord charged the disciples to teach the ones that they had baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They were to teach them to observe whatever the Lord had commanded them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the perfecting work of the shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to cooperate with the Lord to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The results are up to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I hope that many of us will make a vow with the Lord to devote six hours weekly to the Lord to walk in the biblical way so that the Lord will have a way to build up His organic Body.</S>
