   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INNER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Corinthians 4:16 speaks of the outer man and the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The outer man needs to be consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This consuming takes place gradually, little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have been under this consuming for many years, and my outer man still has not been thoroughly consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we are going to live and act in our spirit, the outer man needs to be consumed all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then the inner man is being renewed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our outer man needs to be reduced, not corrected, and our inner man needs to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Renewal is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to be metabolically renewed day by day with the fresh supply of the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are old because we remain in the soul so much.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As long as we remain in the soul, we are old.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to be transferred from the soul to the spirit, and this transfer is the renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be renewed day by day simply means to be transferred all the time from the soul to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is not a matter of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Teaching does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is absolutely a matter in life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should always learn to turn from the outer man to the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 2 Corinthians 6 Paul said that he and his co-workers commended themselves as ministers of God "in a holy spirit" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This refers to their regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that our spirit must be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, in the next chapter Paul said that we have to purify ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and of the spirit 7:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then the spirit will be holy, and we will perfect holiness in the fear of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to purify ourselves so that the holiness of God can saturate our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may be right in our reasoning and arguing, but we are not holy in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need a holy spirit without any defilement, even without the defilement of arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may be right in our mind, in our soul, in our argument, but filthy in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more we talk and argue, the more we are right, but the more we are defiled in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may be right in our doing, but not so holy in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need a holy spirit, a spirit separated from all things unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need a spirit that does not care for anything except God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we get rid of all the defilements, such as arguments and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may have many reasons, but all those reasons are filthy to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can be defiled in our spirit not just with outwardly sinful things but with something which is right, but other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Anything other than God is a defilement to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to be separated and consecrated to the Lord inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our spirit must be solely and wholly separated unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If our spirit is tied to anything other than God, that becomes a defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need a holy spirit.</S>
