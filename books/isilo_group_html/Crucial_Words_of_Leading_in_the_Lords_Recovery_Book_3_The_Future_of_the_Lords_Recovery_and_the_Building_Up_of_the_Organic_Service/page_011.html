<h1 class="title">BEING EDUCATED IN THE TRUTH<br />
AND ELIMINATING OPINIONS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">LAYING A FOUNDATION OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p><em>Question: How do we have a deeper study of the truths that require further development, such as the twelve precious stones in the New Jerusalem? And how can we be kept from pursuing the truth in a natural way so that we are not led astray?</em></p>
<p>Answer: It is a terrible thing when a person does not know the flesh, yet he pursues the truth and sees visions. We have continually emphasized the importance of the truth, hoping that all the saints would know the truth, but the truth can be useful only in the hands of a person who knows the flesh. To those who do not know the flesh, the truth is merely a tool. Hence, the prerequisite to knowing the truth is to know the flesh, the natural life, and the self and to deal with these things seriously.</p>
<p>In pursuing the truth, the younger saints should not begin with studying the twelve precious stones in the New Jerusalem. You should begin by reading what is already published in our books concerning the truth. This must be your foundation, your base. If you would study the twelve precious stones without a foundation, you will get lost. You should begin with the basics. You should be able to give a clear word concerning justification before you can speak concerning the twelve precious stones.</p>
<p>There are approximately forty-five thousand saints in Taiwan. However, of these forty-five thousand, are there even four hundred fifty who can give a clear, thorough, and logical word concerning the truth of justification that would supply light and life to others? I am afraid that not even forty-five saints can speak such a word. You may think that I am being too pessimistic and that instead we should be optimistic and appreciative of our work. If we think this, can we say that there are forty to fifty saints attending the training who can speak concerning justification? Yet we still may consider this to be too elementary and instead want to speak on something higher, such as the twelve precious stones. We need to lay a firm foundation in our education in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We must begin with the most basic spiritual matters.</p>
<p>Suppose we are asked to describe the condition of man according to the Gospel of John. Can we speak about the nine different kinds of people who are in need of Christ as life? In learning the truth we must first lay a solid foundation before we can begin to build. We have to complete elementary school before we can go to junior high school and then high school; otherwise, we will lack a foundation. In everything that we learn, we must be realistic and start with a good foundation.</p>
<p>When someone who knows how to develop an educational system arrives at a certain place, he will begin by starting an elementary school; after an elementary education becomes widespread, he will start a junior high and then a high school. This takes a minimum of twelve years. A work must have a goal. He will not teach some physics today and mathematics tomorrow. Regrettably, the work in Taiwan is done almost entirely in a scattered way. We teach a little of this here and a little of that there, and this is the reason that it is difficult to have results.</p>
<p>During the long period that I have been away from Taiwan, you should have managed to accomplish some great successes in the work. Who would have imagined that the population of Taipei would increase, but the number of saints in the church would decrease? Before I left Taipei, there were about four thousand saints who attended the meetings in the halls on the Lord&rsquo;s Days; there were never less than at least three thousand saints. During these past twenty to thirty years, even if some of the saints have passed away, moved away, or become cold and backslidden, you should still have increased in numbers. But it seems as if you have done nothing in your twenty-three years of work. First, the statistics show that there has been no advance in the work. Second, the work has lost useful ones in all the places; consequently, the number of co-workers has decreased. In the past there were almost one hundred co-workers in Taiwan, but now their number has been reduced greatly. Third, even though the elders in all the localities have shown some improvement, the overall situation of our work has not improved. The reason for this is that the co-workers pay more attention to giving messages than to practical matters.</p>
<p>In order to run an educational system, it is not enough to simply invite famous speakers to come and speak once or twice a month or even every week. The students would not gain anything from this. We all must clearly see this, and we must go step by step to be sure that we have a foundation. At a minimum, we would have a group of &ldquo;elementary school graduates&rdquo; in six years, and we could continue to teach them. Then after sixteen years we would have a group of &ldquo;university graduates.&rdquo; This is the only way to produce useful saints. We cannot leap high without laying a foundation; we cannot work with our heads in the clouds. We must pay attention to being practical and to laying a good foundation in our work.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 3: The Future of the Lord's Recovery and the Building Up of the Organic Service &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
