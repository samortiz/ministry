<h2 class="head1">THE MEANING AND THE SPHERE OF THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class="head2">The Two Aspects of the Church</h2><p>Witness Lee: What is the meaning and the sphere of the church?</p><p>Watchman Nee: There are two meanings to the word church. The first is the universal church, and the second is the local church. The universal church is the general church, which includes the church of yesterday and today, both here and elsewhere. It even includes the church in the future. The local church is the church that appears in each locality.</p><h2 class="head2">The Two Aspects of the Universal Church</h2><p>There are two aspects to the universal church. One aspect refers to the church that includes all of God's children both yesterday and today, both here and everywhere. However, we have to realize that today we are neither in yesterday nor in the future. God's children are living on earth today. When all these children of God are added together, we also have the general church. What was there yesterday is past, and what will be there in the future is not here yet. Between the past and the future, there are all the children of God on earth today. God's children must not only practice the oneness in the locality, but they must learn to be one with all God's children on the whole earth today.</p><h2 class="head2">Maintaining the Local Testimony<br />and God's Testimony on Earth As Well</h2><p>If Nanking develops a problem with Shanghai, that is, if the church in Nanking is at odds with the church in Shanghai, you can only say that they are maintaining a local testimony; they have not maintained God's testimony on earth. We must not only maintain a local testimony; we must also maintain God's testimony on earth. We cannot isolate Shanghai and try to keep it out of trouble. Shanghai belongs to the general church on earth. The Body spoken of in 1 Corinthians is different from the Body spoken of in Ephesians 4. The Body in Ephesians 4 includes all the believers past and present, here and everywhere, but the Body in 1 Corinthians only refers to all the believers on earth at that time.</p><h2 class="head2">Learning to Be One</h2><p>The church is local, whereas the work is regional. A local church cannot encompass the work of a region, because a region involves more than one local church. However, all the local churches plus all the regional works equal the general church. In order for us to practice the oneness of the church, we must practice the oneness of the general church. This requires that we learn to follow others and learn to be one.</p><h2 class="head1">THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class="head2">The Authority of the Church<br />Being with the Elders, whereas the Authority<br />of the Work Being with the Apostles</h2><p>Witness Lee: What is the authority of the church, and who can represent the church?</p><p>Watchman Nee: The authority of the local church is in the hands of the elders, whereas the authority of the work is in the hands of the apostles.</p>
