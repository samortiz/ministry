<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">A CHANGE OF CONCEPT<br />CONCERNING VALUE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 23:16-26</h1><p>A person often measures the value of something according to the amount of knowledge he has of it. In Matthew 23:16-26 we find some people whose eyes were on the splendor of the temple and how it was built mostly with gold. They considered the temple to be most valuable. Some saw the altar and compared it with the oxen, lambs, and turtle doves offered on it. They reckoned the altar to be of little value but the oxen and lambs and turtle doves to be of much value. Some offered a tenth of the mint, anise, and cummin, yet they neglected the weightier matters of the law&mdash;justice, mercy, and faithfulness. Some were very careful about everything. They strained out the gnat, but they swallowed the camel. Some were in a hurry to use the cup and the dish. They cleansed the outside of them, but inwardly there was filth. We can ask a new believer, "How would you evaluate these different kinds of people if you met them? What do you think of their concept of value?" In Matthew 23:16-26 the Lord Jesus called these people fools, blind men, and hypocrites because they did not know the true concept of value. Their concept of value was all wrong.</p><h2 class="head1">A GENUINE BELIEVER HAVING A CHANGE<br />IN HIS CONCEPT OF VALUE</h2><p>Before a person believes in the Lord, his concept of value is perverted. But once a person is saved, his concept of value changes. He no longer cherishes what he once cherished, and he treasures what he once despised. This is a change in his concept of value. Anyone who has not witnessed such a change in concept is not a genuine Christian.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHANGE IN CONCEPT OF VALUE IN A BELIEVER</h2><p>The Bible has much to say concerning a change in one's concept of value. Such passages on this change can shed light to the new believers. These passages show us the proper concept of value for a Christian. Let us consider a few examples to prove our point.</p><h2 class="head2">The Valuation of the Lord Jesus</h2><p>Psalm 118:22 says, "The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner." This is a change in valuation. In the eyes of the builders, they rejected what they considered to be a useless stone. In the eyes of the Jewish leaders, Christ was something redundant, and they wanted to get rid of Him. Yet this rejected stone was chosen to be the cornerstone of the newly enacted salvation. A cornerstone must be flat on at least two or three sides. Actually it should be flat on all six sides. God treasured the cornerstone which was rejected by the Jewish builders and used it for the building of His salvation. How different are these two kinds of valuation! We have to bring new believers to such a change in valuation. We have to ask how they viewed Christ before and how they view Christ now. We have to show them that what was once worthless is now priceless. What was once untrustworthy is now trustworthy. Others have rejected Christ, but we treasure Him.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning the Word of the Cross</h2><p>First Corinthians 1:18 says, "For the word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God." The cross is despised by those who are perishing; it is considered foolishness by them. Yet it is held precious by the saved ones and received by them as the power of God. This speaks of the great change in valuation of the cross, from the time before a person is saved to the time after he is saved. Before a person is saved, he considers the cross useless. After he is saved, he sees it as the power of God, something precious and valuable. Once a person believes in the Lord, his concept of value changes immediately. The salvation of the cross becomes something very precious.</p>
