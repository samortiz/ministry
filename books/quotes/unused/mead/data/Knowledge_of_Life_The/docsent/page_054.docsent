   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE WAY TO BE ENLIGHTENED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since enlightenment rests wholly in the controlling hand of God and depends entirely upon His mercy, should we then be completely passive and indifferent?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No, not at all.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From the teaching of the Bible and our own experiences, we see that we still bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second Corinthians 4:6 says: Seeing it is God, that said, Light shall shine out of darkness, who shined in our hearts...</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This verse tells us that God has already had mercy on us, has already shined on us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The God who shines in our heart is our light.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As long as we are saved, we already have God within us, and we already have light.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the question now is not how we may ask for light or seek light, but how we may obtain enlightening or how we may allow the light to shine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the sun has already risen, we do not need to seek the sun again; we only need to receive its shining.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only fools look for the sun when it is already past daybreak.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ephesians 5:14 says, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You only need to awake; then you will receive the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, enlightening is a matter of obtaining, a matter of accepting; it is not a matter of demanding or seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The responsibility we bear is to remove the coverings in order to accept light and be one who is enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This includes at least the following points:</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Firstly, we must want the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since light depends not on our asking or seeking, but upon our accepting and receiving, then whether we are willing to accept and receive is the first condition of our being enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The sun has already risen; therefore, you need not seek or ask; you only need to be shined upon by the light and receive the shining of light.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you are not willing to receive the shining, if you do not want to be shined upon, but continually cover yourself, then even if there is sun every day, it still cannot shine on you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The light of life is also like this; it has already shined within us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today, it is not that we wait for the light, but that the light is waiting for us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The light is within us, constantly waiting for us to receive its shining.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, if we want the shining and accept the shining, we can be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do not want it and do not accept it, it is difficult for us to be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Very few today really want the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some do not want it because they are indifferent in heart, and others do not want it because they have made up their mind to reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thousands of things have become veils to the light within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are not willing to remove the veils, we are those who do not want the shining and refuse it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Naturally, then, there is no way for us to be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, in the morning when we read the Bible and pray, if we really want the shining, it will definitely come.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the shining comes, then we can see something inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This seeing is our inner sense.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whenever we have a certain consciousness deeply within us, it is a proof that the shining of light has come.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The question now is whether we obey the consciousness of this shining.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we obey the consciousness of this shining and have certain dealings, then we remove the veils from us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, we are those who want the shining and accept the shining of light, and we will continually have the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we do not deal according to the sense of the shining, it means that we are not willing to remove the veils from us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we are those who do not want the shining, who refuse the shining of light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, we cannot obtain the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Secondly, we should open ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord is light, so if our whole heart is turned toward Him, we definitely will have light; but if we turn away from Him and incline toward other things, we definitely will not have light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Second Corinthians 3:16 says, Whensoever it the heart shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the heart is not turned toward the Lord, the veil is there; but when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then one can see the Lord face to face; then one can see light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, if we want to receive the shining, we must open ourselves to the Lord and, from deep within, release ourselves, putting ourselves before the Lord without a bit of reservation or holding back.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, it will be very easy to obtain light.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But, the problem is that it is not easy for us to open ourselves toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We still often hide ourselves; we still hold back.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Not only do we dare not open ourselves to the Lord; we even dare not to pray to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is like a child who is sometimes afraid to see his parents face.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When his parents call him, he answers with his mouth; yet he is not willing to come, for behind their back he has done things which he cannot tell.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Oh, there are many whose condition before the Lord is like this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because they have things and affairs which are not pleasing to the Lord, they hide themselves and hold back.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They fear that the Lord might touch these things and affairs then what would they do?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord might want them to deal with such things and affairs then what would they do?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord might want them to submit to Him something which they treasure then what would they do?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since they are so afraid of being enlightened by the Lord, they dare not open themselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hence they are like a piece of paper which is tightly rolled up, never willing to unfold and allow God to write the words He wants to write.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Though such people who are not willing to open to the Lord still use their mind to listen to messages and read the Bible, the messages they hear and the Bible they read only become a reference for them to judge others, an instrument to criticize others, while they themselves receive not a bit of light.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This situation is like a man who is in a room at night.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If the room is bright, he cannot see clearly the things outside; if the room is dark, he can see the things outside very clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Likewise, those who close themselves to the Lord are experts in judging and criticizing others.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They are very clear about others condition, but they do not know a bit concerning their own condition.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This proves that they are entirely in darkness!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Such who are not willing to open themselves to the Lord can even preach and work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Though they themselves are not willing to accept the shining, they can persuade others to seek the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Though they often hope the Lord will be gracious to them and give them abundant life, equipping them and bestowing gifts on them so they can minister and work, they are afraid of the Lord s shining and even refuse the Lord s shining.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Thus, the words they minister and works they do are but dead exhortations which cannot impart to men the living shining.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When men are thus unwilling to open themselves to the Lord, they become inwardly waste and void, dark and without light.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is like being in the cellar: no matter how strong the light is outside, it cannot shine within.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But for one who is open to the Lord, the condition is entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He completely releases himself, and from inside to outside spreads all things before the Lord without any reservation, allowing the light of God to shine.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Such a person will definitely and frequently obtain enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Whether it is in hearing a message or reading the Bible, as soon as he receives the shining of light, he humbly accepts it, on the one hand being sorrowful and on the other hand worshipping the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He is sorrowful because of his own desolation and failure; he worships the Lord because of His mercy and the shining of God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Being in the light, he does not see others faults, but only his own deficiencies.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Thus, he does not condemn others; he only feels that he himself is a most pitiful person, like a worm or a maggot, which cannot lift up its head before the holy Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He also looks to God for mercy, asks God to save him, and is willing to receive deeper shining of light.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In this way, the light of God continually enlightens him within, and the life of God continually grows within him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He then becomes a transparent person, full of consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Thirdly, we should put a stop to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>What does it mean to put a stop to ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is to put a stop to our views, our ways of looking at things, our feelings, opinions and words, etc. We all know that to stop is not an easy matter.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>There are only a very few who can really stop in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Yet being unable to put a stop to ourselves is also a veil, a serious veil, which prevents us from being enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>For example, some brothers when reading the Bible always read with their own feelings and ideas and put their own thoughts into its meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The Bible clearly says, Simon Peter, but when they read it, it becomes Peter Simon.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Bible clearly says, Paul, the apostle of Jesus Christ, but when they read it, it becomes Paul, the apostle of Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When they are not reading the Word of God, their opinions are not in evidence; but as soon as they read the Word of God, their opinions arise.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Therefore, whenever they read the Bible, there is not one passage concerning which they do not have an opinion and feeling; yet they know not that such opinions and feelings are all wood, hay and stubble, of no value.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Some brothers are like this in their ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When they are preaching, their words fly all over the sky, without a central or main point.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Some brothers and sisters, when listening to the ministry, simply miss all the important and essential points, even after many repetitions.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Yet they remember clearly the fragments, the nonessential words, which people normally forget after speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This also is because they have many thoughts and feelings which they cannot stop.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Such brothers and sisters who are always extremely busy outwardly and indulge in fancy imaginations inwardly cannot stop any part of their entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Consequently they cannot obtain one bit of light.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>In the New Testament there is such an example.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Luke 10 and John 11 both speak of one who was most busy and could not be stopped: Martha.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Luke 10 records how busy she was outwardly, while John 11 records how active she was inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We may say that her whole person was in a flurry.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Not only did she have many opinions and feelings, but she also had many words; she could not be stopped for a moment.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Therefore, not one word of what the Lord spoke to her could enter into her.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>When she met the Lord, before the Lord could open His mouth, she opened hers and blamed the Lord, saying, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The Lord replied, Thy brother shall rise again.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Then she immediately had an opinion and answered, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>She expounded the Lord s words so wonderfully that the time of resurrection was put off till several thousand years later.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Again, the Lord said to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth on me, though he die, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Believest thou this?</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>She said, Yea, Lord: I have believed that thou are the Christ, the Son of God...</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Her reply in no wise answered His question.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>She did not hear at all what the Lord had said; she was so opinionated and talkative.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>When she finished these words, she immediately went away, and called her sister Mary secretly, saying, The Teacher is here, and calleth thee.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>This was entirely her fabrication; it was her idea put forward for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Those who are talkative and opinionated are those who can give suggestions and express opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Such people cannot stop a bit; thus, they are totally veiled from the light, and there is really no way for them to be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The difficulty of being unable to stop lies within man.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Many read the Bible without light and hear the ministry without grasping the essential points, not because they are sinful and worldly, but because they are full of opinions, feelings, ideas and words.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Strictly speaking, sin and the world are like a piece of worn-out clothing, which is not difficult to put off.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>But the opinions, feelings, and ideas in us are not easy to cast off.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>That is why they become today the most serious veil in us; they render us unable to obtain the shining of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Thus, if we desire to be enlightened, we must quiet ourselves and put ourselves to a stop.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Not only should our outward activities be stopped; even the opinions, feelings, ideas, views and words within us should be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>When a person who is completely stopped comes before the Lord, he can be exceedingly simple and single in receiving the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Whatever the Lord says, he hears and comprehends.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>When he reads the Bible, he does not read his own opinion and explanation into it; rather, he reads the meaning in the Bible into himself.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>In the beginning, it seems that he does not understand what he reads.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>But when the light comes, the great things in the Bible shine in him, causing him to have revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>The same is true when he hears a message.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>His whole person from within to without waits quietly before the Lord, desiring to hear His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Thus, when the words are released, he can grasp the essential point of the message and receive from within the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Such a person, because he can stop himself, is able to receive unceasingly the living Word of God, which means the light of God, for the light of God rests within the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Thus, the third requirement for being enlightened is to stop oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Fourthly, we should not dispute with light.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>This is another basic requirement for being enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>As soon as we have the enlightening and sense within, we should immediately accept, submit, and deal accordingly; we cannot have any disputation.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Whenever we dispute with the light, the light is withdrawn.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>When the Holy Spirit performs this enlightening work within man, it is a very tender and delicate matter.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>As soon as He meets resistance from man, He immediately withdraws.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>To cause the Holy Spirit to withdraw by resisting Him is extremely easy, but to ask Him to return is quite difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Even if we confess, repent, and thereby obtain the Lord s forgiveness, the Holy Spirit may still not come back immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>We read of such a situation in the Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>When the Lord knocked on His loved one s door, she did not open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Later, when she realized what she had done and went to open the door, the Lord could not be found.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>When the Lord hides Himself in this way, it is His punishment toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>Not only does the Holy Spirit work in this way; even those who have the ministry of the Holy Spirit work in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>A servant who knows God and is used by God is always happy to help others.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Yet if you criticize him or intentionally resist him, he will not contend with you, reason with you, or argue concerning right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>He has only one way: He simply withdraws, having nothing more to say to you and being no longer able to help you.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>Thus, he who likes to contend is foolish, and the loss he suffers is tremendous!</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>Toward one who has the ministry of the Holy Spirit we should really be careful!</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>You may freely criticize those who walk on the street, but you should not freely criticize nor purposely dispute with one who has the ministry of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>This does not mean that your criticism is not right or your disputation not reasonable; perhaps all of your criticisms are right, and all of your disputes are reasonable; but one thing is certain: as soon as you criticize him and dispute with him, his ministry toward you is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>He may be able to help thousands of people, but he cannot help you.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>It is not that he would not help you, but he cannot help you.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>Even if he wants to help you, you would gain nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>What a serious matter this is!</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>How careful we should be!</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>Thus, toward both the Holy Spirit who speaks within us and the ministers who speak without, we cannot engage in criticism or dispute.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>The enlightening of the Holy Spirit within man cannot be disputed with, for once you dispute with Him, you will be in darkness for at least several days.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>This period of darkness is both a punishment and reminder to you.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>You think it does not matter to offend God once, for you can still ask His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>Yes, He can forgive you, but God has His government; you cannot escape the punishment He has for you.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>And if you offend Him many times, your end will definitely be even more tragic.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>The people of Israel in the wilderness continually disputed with God and offended God.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>When they reached Kadesh-barnea, the hand of God s government came forth: they could only return to the wilderness to wander.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>Though they wept and repented, there was no way to restore the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>Thus, whether it be the enlightening we receive from the Holy Spirit or the enlightening we receive from the ministers of God s Word, we should obey and not dispute.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>This also is a serious principle in the pursuit of spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>When the Holy Spirit enlightens us, if we are really weak and cannot submit, the most we can say is, O God, I should obey in this matter, but I am weak; have compassion on me.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>This kind of heart attitude is still of His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>But it is best when we are enlightened to immediately submit and not dispute in the least.</S>
