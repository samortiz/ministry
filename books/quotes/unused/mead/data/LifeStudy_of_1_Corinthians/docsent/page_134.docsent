   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FORTY-SIX DEALING WITH EATING OF SACRIFICES TO IDOLS 3 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 9:16-27</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have pointed out that 9:1-15 reveals how pure Paul was.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we use the word pure here, we use it in a biblical sense.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, the Lord Jesus said, Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God Matt 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this verse to be pure means to be single in motive in seeking after God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If our motive is single, we are pure.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Otherwise, we are impure.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we say that Paul was pure and that the Corinthians were impure, we mean that Paul had a single motive in seeking after God, but that the Corinthians had mixed motives.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because they were not pure, they even doubted Paul s apostleship and wanted to examine him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Second Corinthians 12:16 indicates that some of the believers at Corinth thought that Paul was gaining material profit from them through craft.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They could think this way about Paul because their motives were not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whether or not we are pure depends on our motive.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our motive may be related to our personal benefit, to something which would be a profit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The problems in the churches are often related to the seeking of some kind of personal gain.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a particular aspect of the church life is a benefit to you, you may be happy and very much for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, if there is no personal gain for you in the church, you may be unhappy and find fault with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we fail to receive what we expect, we may be unhappy with the church, the elders, or the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This indicates that we are not pure, that our motive is for our personal benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all love the Lord and the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may even stand up in a meeting and declare that we consecrate ourselves to Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may say that Christ is marvelous and that the church is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if our motives are not pure, we may begin to have problems with the church after making such a declaration and consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Regarding our motives, we need to be crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need the cross to touch our motives.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul was pure because he knew experientially what it was to be crucified with Christ and to be one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He lived a crucified life, and he practiced being one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, he did not have any motive related to personal gain.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His motive was wholly in Christ and for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was the reason Paul could be so pure.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because he was so pure, he could speak in 9:1-15 in a bold, frank, strong, and direct manner.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Like a surgeon who has been cleansed of all bacteria, he could operate on the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If Paul had not been pure, his impurity would have been imparted to the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But because he was pure, he could perform spiritual surgery on the believers at Corinth without contaminating them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>C. His Faithfulness 1.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Necessity Laid upon Him</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Having seen Paul s purity in 9:1-15, let us go on in 9:16-23 to see his faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 16 Paul says, For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for necessity is laid upon me; for woe to me if I do not preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By necessity Paul means a burden which becomes a pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such a necessity, such a pressing burden, to preach the gospel was laid upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, he could say, Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul did not care how the Corinthians treated him or how they reacted to him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He had a burden which pressed upon him to carry out the work of his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His ministry to preach the gospel was a necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul knew that if he did not preach, he would suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This indicates Paul s faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Like love, faithfulness can make us blind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are keen to know the attitude and reaction of others toward us, we may not be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not faithful to preach the gospel only if others give us a favorable reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we are faithful in preaching the gospel, we shall not care for the way others react or for the way they treat us, because we have a burden, a necessity, to fulfill our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This faithfulness blinds the faithful one to the reaction of others.</S>
