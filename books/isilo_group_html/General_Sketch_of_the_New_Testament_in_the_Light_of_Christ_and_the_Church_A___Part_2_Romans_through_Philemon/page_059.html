Almost every matter in this book is a main point.<h2 class=head1>KNOWING CHRIST AS THE WILL OF GOD</h2><p>Colossians is a book concerning God&#8217;s will. In the first chapter Paul says, &#8220;Therefore we also, since the day we heard of it, do not cease praying and asking on your behalf that you may be filled with the full knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding&#8221; (1:9). Wisdom is in our spirit for us to realize, sense, and perceive the spiritual things, while understanding is in our mind to interpret what we perceive. We need all spiritual wisdom and understanding in order to have the full knowledge of the will of God. The will of God mentioned here is not His will in small matters. It is not merely for us to know what school to go to, what house to buy, or whether or not to marry. These things are too minor. The will of God mentioned here is the eternal will of God, the great will of God. It is related not to the things in our daily life but to God&#8217;s purpose, God&#8217;s intention. To know this will requires that we have full knowledge and all spiritual wisdom and understanding.<p>What is the will of God according to His desire, His intention, in the whole universe, in creation, in redemption, in the coming age, and in eternity? The entire book of Colossians is the answer to this question. If we read this book, we will realize that the answer is Christ Himself. The will of God is in Christ, concentrated in Christ, and for Christ. Christ is everything in the will of God. We must know this and realize this with spiritual wisdom and with our understanding in a clear, renewed mind.<p>The last chapter of this book tells us, &#8220;Epaphras, who is one of you, a slave of Christ Jesus, greets you, always struggling on your behalf in his prayers that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God&#8221; (4:12). In the first chapter the apostle Paul and his co-workers prayed that the Colossians would know the will of God, and in the last chapter Epaphras as a slave of Christ struggled fervently in prayer on behalf of the church concerning the same thing. Therefore, this is a book which reveals to us the eternal will of God in the universe. We must keep these two verses in mind.<h2 class=head1>GOD BEING A MYSTERY</h2><p>In writing Colossians the apostle was much in the spirit, expressing from the spirit of prayer what was on his heart and in his spirit. As a result, it is difficult to divide this book into sections. The best way to know this book, therefore, is to see not the sections but the main points. There are at least seven main points revealed in this book.<p>First, Colossians speaks of the mystery of God in relation to the will of God. In order to speak about a person&#8217;s will, we must know what is in his heart. We must know him, understand him, and know what type of person he is. God has a mystery, and He is a mystery. We know that God exists, but apparently it is difficult for anyone to know Him. Not only God Himself is a mystery, but what He desires and intends to do is also a mystery.<p>The term the mystery of God is found in Colossians 2:2. This verse says, &#8220;Unto all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.&#8221; Here the apostle uses such spiritual terms as all the riches, full assurance of understanding, and full knowledge. The mystery of God is too mysterious, too profound, and too great. It needs all the riches of the full assurance of understanding. What is the mystery of God? By ourselves we cannot thoroughly explain what God is and what God intends to do; the answer is in the book of Colossians.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>General Sketch of the New Testament in the Light of Christ and the Church, A - Part 2: Romans through Philemon &nbsp; pg 59</div><br></body></html>
