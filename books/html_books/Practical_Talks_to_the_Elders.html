<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is comprised of a series of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Anaheim, California from January through April 1983 and in Irving, Texas during April and June 1983.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE NEED FOR THE FOCUS<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 3:9, 16</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, how we treasure this time. How we thank You for the fellowship in the Spirit. We first trust in Your cleansing blood. We worship You for Your cleansing blood. Lord, we thank You for Your recovery, and we thank You for Your revelation among us. We can never thank You enough for all the mercies and grace You have shown us. We trust in You for the fellowship tonight. O Lord, open up Your heart. Open up Your Word. Open the heavens. And open us. We would like to have a thorough fellowship, a fellowship full of light, transparent. Lord, give us the freedom. Anoint us. Give us the clear anointing with the holy anointing oil. Thank You, Lord. Thank You, You are now the Spirit. We look unto You not only for ourselves, but for all the churches, for all the leading ones in the churches. We pray desperately that they all may see Your vision, that they all may see Your heart, that they all may see the desires in Your heart. Speak a clear word to us tonight that we all may be brought in, into Your desire, into Your move today. Lord, do cover us. We are fighting. You know the battle. Defeat Your enemy, and destroy the power of darkness. Lord, we would reject him in Your mighty name. Satan has to be condemned. He has to be under our feet. Cast him under our feet. This is the day for You to do this. Release Your truth. Release Your recovery. Release Your Word. Amen.</p>
<p>When the Lord&rsquo;s recovery came to this country, I had a strong burden as to what I should do. And I did according to the Lord&rsquo;s leading. I had no liberty from Him to speak on other subjects. From the beginning I have always been in the Lord&rsquo;s central lane, His focus for His economy. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery among us is absolutely different from any kind of reformation. We are not here for a recovery of any doctrine or any practice. Because of this, in the twenty years that I have been here with you all, I have given messages only on the central lane, on the focus.</p>
<p>Because of my observation, I have become really burdened for some of the churches. It seems some of you do not have the clear vision about this. You may be satisfied just to have a church raised up. There is a danger ahead. If the elders lack a clear vision as to what the Lord is doing&mdash;and this vision must be very strong&mdash;we are doing things in vain.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ARE WE BETTER THAN THE BRETHREN?</h2>
<p>I strongly stressed this need when I gave the messages on <em>The World Situation and God&rsquo;s Move.</em> In those messages I pointed out very clearly that it is not enough to have the best gospel preaching, the best exposition of the Bible, and the most scriptural way of meeting. These three things are respected by all Christians. They are what the Brethren practice. In their early days, as their writings at Darby&rsquo;s time indicate, the Brethren were clear about something higher and deeper than these three things. But by the time I got into the Brethren assembly, there were only these three things.</p>
<p>I can recall when I was with them. They did not even stress gospel preaching that much. Mainly they emphasized Bible teaching, the exposition of the types and practices and the teaching of the different books. It was a help to me. They also insisted that everything, every little thing, be according to the Bible. Why didn&rsquo;t they celebrate Christmas? It was not according to the Bible. The same with the Chinese New Year. The Brethren assembly in my home town did not celebrate any holiday, including even the Chinese New Year. It seemed very strange.</p>
<p>But I can recall also that there was no center, no focus. Christ as God&rsquo;s mystery, how He was processed to be the Spirit, they never mentioned. They had no idea of it. Nor did they have any idea about life. Even regeneration they could not define. I asked them to tell me; they had no proper definition. As for the church as an organism to be the Lord&rsquo;s Body, this also was never mentioned. That they did not speak of the church ground there is no need to say.</p><h2 class="head1">MISSING THE MARK</h2>
<p>Now I come to us. From what I have seen in going out to look at the situation and from what I have heard in fellowship from others, I have wondered if maybe the best we have is just like the Brethren assembly. Probably compared to a proper Brethren assembly, some local churches are inferior. We are loose. We act in a loose way under the cloak of liberty. &ldquo;Brother Lee told us we are against religion. We must not be bound by religion.&rdquo; It is wonderful not to be religious. But what, positively speaking, do we want to be? Brothers, I believe you understand me when I say that at best we are like Brethren assemblies. There is no need to say that some churches are even inferior to them. This troubles me. It burdens me.</p>
<p>I was checked by the Lord and even by myself. What are you doing here? Is it just to see that churches are raised up? What kind of churches? Apart from the general attendants at the church meetings, do even the leading ones have a clear vision to direct and protect them, to safeguard them from distraction?</p>
<p>Last week I spent a long time praying over all the points of the messages I have given these past twenty years. I prayed about them in order to check. The more I prayed, the more I felt confirmed. I tell you, I have the full assurance that what I have been sharing is what is on the Lord&rsquo;s heart. However strong the opposition is against me, I believe the Lord has told me that this is what He wants and that I must let the saints and the brothers know that if they do not have this, they are not in the recovery.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s center in His economy has been revealed and written in the Scriptures for close to two thousand years. Through all these centuries quite a few books have been published to unfold this mystery. Yet very few of even the lovers, the seekers, of the Lord have really seen this and lived a life for this. It is hard to find Christians who are really in this focus.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOLDING THE MYSTERY OF THE FAITH</h2>
<p>The churches in the United States have been in existence for quite some time. Most were not raised up recently. Of those of you who are here with me now, I would say that over ninety percent of you have been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery over ten years. As far as the actual and practical church life is concerned, I am burdened that there is not much evidence that the churches are such a testimony to God&rsquo;s economy. I don&rsquo;t mean that in every meeting we talk only about the central lane, the focus, God&rsquo;s economy. But I mean that we have a church life which is a testimony to what Paul calls the mystery of the faith.</p>
<p>Brothers, I would ask you humbly, look around at our present situation. What was there in 1982? Don&rsquo;t you realize that there are signs indicating we have somewhat missed the focus? There were gospel preaching, exposition of the Bible (even though using the Life-study messages), and meeting according to the Scriptures. But have we&mdash;I speak from the depths of my being; I change the word <em>we</em> to you, singular you&mdash;have you really seen a vision of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, a vision of God&rsquo;s economy, of what God wants?</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BURDEN</h2>
<p>I have been fighting for Christ being the Spirit and for the Triune God being not for doctrine but for experience. Some of you may think, &ldquo;Oh, this is Brother Lee&rsquo;s thought. He always speaks on this.&rdquo; No! I do not do this from habit. If I were only a Bible teacher, I have sixty-six books from which to teach. But the Lord has shown me that this would not be of His desire. He doesn&rsquo;t want me to do that.</p>
<p>In Revelation the churches are called lampstands. The lampstands represent the Triune God with the Father as the nature, the Son as the embodiment, and the Spirit as the expression. This is the church: the Father&rsquo;s nature plus the Son&rsquo;s embodiment plus the Spirit&rsquo;s expression. And this should be the very essence of the church&rsquo;s shining.</p>
<p>What is the light that the church shines forth? What is the testimony which shines out from the church? It must be the Triune God. I do not say that in every meeting this is the subject. But whatever we fellowship about, whatever we minister, there must be such a testimony. In everything we do&mdash;gospel preaching, Bible teaching, visiting the saints, and even visiting new ones not yet saved&mdash;we must bear a clear, evident, strong testimony of a lampstand constituted of the Father&rsquo;s nature, the Son&rsquo;s embodiment, and the Spirit&rsquo;s expression. What do we express in our gospel preaching? What do we express in our love feasts? What do we express in our conversation in our daily Christian life? We must bear such a testimony in every aspect of the church life and of our daily life, including the family life.</p>
<p>To bear such a testimony is to hold the mystery of the faith. &ldquo;Mystery&rdquo; here does not denote a doctrine; even the word &ldquo;faith&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean doctrine here. As you know, the faith is the reality of the content of the New Testament economy of God in which we believe. Our belief is not in doctrines but in such a reality. Of this faith, which is the content of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, there is a mystery. In using this word mystery, Paul refers first to Christ as the mystery of God (Col. 2:2) and second to the church as the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4-6). According to the context of 1 Timothy 3:9, the mystery of the faith should also include the church life (cf. v. 16). Why? Because the church life is constituted of God in Christ and of Christ as the life-giving Spirit. This corresponds to the constitution of the lampstand. As the lampstand is constituted of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, so the church also is constituted of the divine Trinity.</p>
<p>The church life is not something organized. It is not even something composed. It is a living organism constituted of the living God in His divine Trinity&mdash;the Father&rsquo;s nature, the Son&rsquo;s embodiment, and the Spirit&rsquo;s expression. This is not only the church; it is also the church life, the church&rsquo;s living. Thus it is a golden lampstand shining out the testimony of the Triune God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO EVALUATE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Ourselves</h2>
<p>I surely hope, brothers, that we all here will be desperate. &ldquo;Lord, have mercy upon me. Show me where I am. Am I in this kind of living? In my participation in the eldership, in the leadership, do I bear such a testimony? How about my participation in the care of the church&mdash;do I have such a realization?&rdquo; As we pray in this way, we may sense that our testimony is dim, vague, weak. We may bear a testimony, but it may not be that excellent.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t check anyone else. Just check yourself. How much is my daily life, my service to the Lord, my worship to God, my care of the church, and my fellowship with all the saints in this realization? Am I in such a reality that, even if I talk with the saints about ordinary things, I bear a striking sign that my being, my person, my life, my living is all in this focus of God&rsquo;s economy? When I preach the gospel, do I preach it in this focus? When I open up the Bible to teach, do I do it in this focus? When I go to shepherd an older one or a younger one, a new one or sick one, a weak one or a backsliding one, is my shepherding in this focus?</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Meetings</h2>
<p>How about our meetings? We like them to be living, yet we still have to check. Just because many are functioning, does that make the meeting living? Of course it is living in some way, but is that livingness the expression of the golden lampstand? Is it in the focus of God&rsquo;s economy? A meeting might seem high, but in what is it high? Is it high in the Lord&rsquo;s focus?</p>
<p>Christianity has been on this earth close to twenty centuries. They have many practices, many works. What do they bear as a testimony? Do they have the real focus of God&rsquo;s economy as a testimony? They have many different kinds of practices, all with their special atmosphere and particular emphasis. But do you think there is any place among them with a group of Christians bearing a testimony which corresponds to the mystery of the faith?</p>
<p>What shall we say about the meetings of the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery? When people come to our meetings, what is there for them to be impressed with? I am concerned that our meetings may not have the testimony of the very shining of the lampstand. This troubles me. Without such a reality in our church meetings, brothers, what we are practicing is vanity. There are enough Christian practices. There is no need for another one. Nor is there any need for another Christian work. These things have been on the earth for centuries, yet the Lord still has no way to come back. There is no need to say the Lord is not satisfied; I don&rsquo;t think any one of us is satisfied. According to what the Lord has shown us in these years, the situation among Christians today is far off.</p>
<p>We may not be off, but we are still quite far from the standard of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony. Perhaps we are on the way, but I don&rsquo;t know where we are. Are we halfway, or a third or a fourth of the way? I don&rsquo;t have the confidence that when I go to a church meeting there will be the focus of the Lord&rsquo;s central lane, of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LOOKING BACK</h2>
<p>Why am I so burdened? Let us trace a little of our history. The recovery in the United States began in Los Angeles in 1962. For ten years, from 1962 to 1972, I had very little concern. My only burden was to keep pressing on. This burden was with me from the first conference in the winter of 1963 on the all-inclusive Christ. During those ten years nothing happened that was a cause of concern to me. Some things did happen, but I was not troubled. Then the migrations began in 1970. In the two years from 1970 to 1972 the migrations did bring in much blessing. The number increased, I believe more than doubled, within those two years.</p>
<p>Then we became careless, or, more accurately, distracted. We were distracted from what the Lord had shown us, and turned our attention to the increase. From 1972 there was a tendency to promote numbers, to be occupied with getting the proper place and the proper people. That opened the door for some things to creep in to damage the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>From 1973 for at least five years we were in a somewhat drugged situation, even though the ministry never deviated from the central lane. To some the focus was lost; the central lane was left. There was talk, for instance, about what kind of meetings to have. In such talk there was little concern about how to have the focus of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>The Lord was sovereign, however. In due time He cleared up the situation. Then I began to say that we must turn our attention away from the increase and come back to the central lane, the lane of life, the lane of God&rsquo;s focus.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRESENT CONDITION OF THE CHURCHES</h2>
<p>Now that this distraction is apparently over, the churches seem to be doing quite well, to be going on steadily. From my observation, however, I would say that their attention is not fully centered on the focus. Some places are centered on good meetings; others, on the proper increase. By proper increase I do not mean the kind that was promoted from 1973 to 1978; I mean the proper increase. Some churches are endeavoring to build up their kind of church in their locality, with a bigger number, with more vitality. Because they realize they cannot do that much, they invite me and others as well, to go and help.</p>
<p>Brothers, even if you visit five or ten churches, I doubt you will find one whose church life is really centered on the focus of God&rsquo;s economy. I do not like to disappoint you and be unappreciative of all your good points, while pointing out your shortcomings. I do not like to do that, but my burden is to tell you frankly and honestly that the actual condition of the churches is not that encouraging. Whether you feel encouraged or not depends upon your point of view. This is why I say we must pray desperately that we may see the Lord&rsquo;s real testimony today, His real recovery, His real move. Once you have seen this, you will have the right point of view. Then you will not be satisfied with the condition of the churches because it is hard to find one that is centered on God&rsquo;s focus.</p>
<p>We must look to the Lord that we may concentrate everything&mdash;our time, our energy, our physical, material things&mdash;on this one thing, that is, the testimony of the Triune God. We need more prayer, more fellowship, more meetings. We are here only for this. Of course, we have to do something to make a living. That is a necessity. But apart from having a job to make a living, we have no necessity. We are not for a good living, pleasure, enjoyment on this earth. We are here only for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery of His testimony. We are not merely for good meetings, high meetings, living meetings. We are not merely for good Bible teaching. Nor are we merely for good gospel preaching. We are for a living testimony.</p>
<p>Do not use the excuse that the saints in your locality are too new to understand. Even if we are preaching the gospel to sinners who are hearing it for the first time in their whole life, you can still preach the Father&rsquo;s nature, the Son&rsquo;s embodiment, and the Spirit&rsquo;s expression. What we speak depends on how much we have seen the central focus, and how much we are burdened.</p>
<p>We must first check ourselves. Have I seen the real focus of God&rsquo;s economy? Am I burdened with this? Or is what I say merely what I have heard about the local church, about the ground, about this and that teaching? The problem lies with us. If we have not seen, then we are just doing a Christian work. We are merely helping people to know God in a general way and perhaps to take the church ground. But is there a lampstand? The church ground is not the lampstand.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BECOMING DOCTRINAL</h2>
<p>Some of the dear leaders in the local churches even stress the matter of the ground not in the light of life. The ground in some leaders&rsquo; minds has become a doctrine. I gave you ten messages on <em>The Genuine Ground of Oneness</em> (in 1979). My reason for giving those messages was because many of the leading ones understood the ground in a doctrinal way, not from the life point of view. Those messages were given from the life viewpoint.</p>
<p>Brothers, forgive me for my frankness. I wonder how many of you have gotten into those ten messages. No need to say the elders far away from here, even you who have been here with me at least six years, I doubt that you have really gotten into those messages, which speak of the genuine oneness from the life point of view.</p>
<p>Brothers, nothing can keep you in the recovery, nothing can keep you one with the brothers, except this vision. Paul says, &ldquo;I was not disobedient to the...vision&rdquo; (Acts 26:19). Only this can keep us. It has to be our life, our living, our work, our burden, our everything. Surely we must preach the gospel, but we preach with this as the focus. Surely we must expound the Bible, but we teach with this as the focus. Surely we want good meetings and a good church life, but the meetings and the church life must have this as the focus.</p><h2 class="head1">A SUBDUING ATMOSPHERE</h2>
<p>I think those of you who were with us in those years at Elden Hall will all agree with me that the recovery then was very pure. It had one direction, one tendency, one goal. I don&rsquo;t mean that all who were meeting with us had seen the focus; but the focus was there. A good number of the saints saw, and some did not, but there was no mixture. This made the atmosphere convincing, even subduing. Any who came with another goal either dropped it or stopped coming. Not too many left, yet there were some who did, because they had their own goal. They would have liked to use our field to carry out their own work; when they realized there was no way, they left. Many who came, however, were subdued, convinced, and purified. Today the churches seem to have lost that convincing, subduing power, as far as the leadership is concerned.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CARING FOR NUMBERS</h2>
<p>In some places there is an effort being made to build up the numbers in attendance at the meetings. I would ask you to check whether your concern is for the meetings to be in the focus of the Lord&rsquo;s economy or whether it is for an increase in the number attending. Even if you simply want to have a good meeting, this may cause you to miss the focus. The focus is to have the testimony of Jesus. &ldquo;Lord, I don&rsquo;t care merely for a good meeting. I don&rsquo;t care merely for numbers. I don&rsquo;t care merely for good attendance. Lord, I care for Your testimony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brothers, if there has been an increase in attendance in your locality, that is really good. But I would check with you, what is the focus in your locality? What is the goal of your work? Is there a real lampstand, or just a Christian meeting?</p>
<h2 class="head1">DESIRING THE LEADERSHIP</h2>
<p>As long as you have even a little desire to be a leader, that is a debit to God&rsquo;s economy. Brothers, as long as you have such a debit factor, you don&rsquo;t have the power to convince, subdue others. Elden was convincing because it was pure in God&rsquo;s move. The convincing, subduing power came from a source that was pure and clean.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s blessing is of different kinds. The rain, according to Matthew 5:45, is for everybody. The righteous do not get more and the unrighteous less. The Lord&rsquo;s blessing today is everywhere. Many Christian groups have some blessing in a general way. But the special blessing is not general. These groups do not enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s special blessing. I am afraid that in some of the churches in the recovery also this special blessing is lacking.</p>
<p>To take the leadership, to serve the Lord, you must have a pure heart and a pure motive. You must not try to build up a meeting just because it is in your hand. That is impure. To like being the leader is impure. To want to be the first leader is impure. Even to have a consideration that someone does not want you to be the leader is impure. As long as you have an impure heart, the blessing can only be general; it cannot be special. Apparently you all are pure. You love the Lord. You sacrifice your time, your family, your home, and many other things for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Yet you are not absolutely pure for the focus of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PLAYING POLITICS</h2>
<p>Another sign of impurity is to play politics. Even if it is only a little, in quality it is the same; only the quantity is different. You may bring your experience in the world into the church, even into the leadership. If you do this, it is impure. It is to contaminate, to pollute, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A WORD FOR THE FUTURE</h2>
<p>I want to have talk after talk with you, not messages but talks, that you may all see what the Lord wants in His recovery. Preaching the gospel? There are lots of preachers. If you say, &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s do the same thing,&rdquo; then there is no need for a testimony. Teaching the Bible? Coming together to have an assembly according to the Scripture&mdash;an <em>ekklesia,</em> the called-out ones meeting together? Is this all the Lord wants?</p>
<p>What I share with you here will be made available in printed form to the public. The video tapes will not last as long as what is printed. It will be sent to the whole earth, not just to Orange County. It is not for the present only; it will be available for the future.</p>
<p>It is good that the churches preach the gospel, that they use the Life-studies, that they are doing things according to the Scriptures. But, dear brothers, where is the focus? Do we practice the one spirit with the Lord? Do we have a vision, the prevailing, present vision, every hour controlling us, guarding us? If we do not, how can we expect the brothers and sisters in our locality to have such a vision?</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE PURENESS AND THE FOCUS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHINESE-SPEAKING MEETING</h2>
<p>I feel burdened to release some messages in the Chinese language that can be sent out to every part of the earth where Chinese saints meet. As to whether the Chinese-speaking saints in southern California come to these meetings, it is up to the churches. I would like to say a word both to the churches and to the Chinese-speaking saints.</p>
<p>As for the churches, surely something should be done, based upon the principle of shepherding, for the Chinese-speaking saints. Whether your church agrees for them to participate in these meetings where the message will be given in Chinese, you must still consider how to take care of them. The number of Chinese immigrants to this country is steadily increasing, every year by at least forty thousand, with most of them settling in southern California. There is a great need. This meeting could be of help to all the churches taking care of this need. The churches need to consider what to do about this.</p>
<p>As for the Chinese-speaking saints, if your English is sufficient, you are not qualified to come to the Chinese-speaking meeting. If you can understand the messages and testimonies in English and can express yourself in English in prayer, there is no need for you to come to the Chinese-speaking meeting. If, however, in spite of being able to manage well in English, you have a burden to care for some younger ones, or newer ones, or some of your relatives, you may still come to the Chinese-speaking meeting. We are not talking about a Chinese meeting, only a Chinese-speaking meeting. It is not based upon race, but upon the management of language. This meeting is set up only for those who cannot manage the English in the meetings. If we had another reason, it would be wrong to set up such a meeting. It would be a division. Just because of the language problem, we need for a time to have a bridge. Thus, if you do not have this language difficulty, even if you are Chinese, you are not qualified to attend; that is, unless you have a burden for some Chinese-speaking ones.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Trouble</h2>
<p>No matter what we do, there is always some trouble. Don&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, this practice will increase the trouble in the church.&rdquo; It is true, but if you do not want to have trouble, it is better to die and be buried! As long as you live, you will have trouble. If you want to eat, there is the trouble of getting the groceries, then of cooking them, then of setting the table, and then of cleaning up afterwards. Even sleeping is a trouble. What shall we do? We have to overcome the trouble.</p>
<p>Probably nothing is as troublesome as the church life. If I were not a Christian called and burdened by the Lord, I would not touch this matter; I would rather do something else. Just one meeting in one language is trouble enough. Now to have two meetings with two languages will not only double but even triple the problems. For one thing, the leadership has to be increased. One set of meetings will be in Chinese, needing some to take care of it; another will be in English, also needing some to take care of it. Be assured that your burden will be much heavier. Then there will be the need for coordination. With only one kind of meeting, you might not realize how important the coordination is. Two kinds of meetings will put you on the spot, testing how elastic is your ability to coordinate. I am afraid your elasticity will not stretch very far; after two weeks it will break! This is a warning, not a prediction; I hope it will not turn out to have been a prediction. Coordination is most necessary.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Overcoming the Problem of Race</h2>
<p>Even in the first century the apostles met this problem. In Paul&rsquo;s Epistles at least twice he says there can be neither Greek nor Jew (Gal. 3:28; Col. 3:11). Suppose the Jews had not gone into dispersion; they all lived in the good land. In Corinth, in Macedonia, in Ephesus and the other cities of Asia Minor, there would have been no Jews. How much simpler it would have been!</p>
<p>Why did Columbus discover America and open the way for so many people to come in? Last week (at our Chinese conference) we had about eleven hundred, all of the yellow race. Who would have thought that in America there could be over one thousand of them, all Christians? And more are coming. This means there will be more trouble!</p>
<p>The apostles had this trouble in their time; that&rsquo;s why Paul had to write &ldquo;no Greek, no Jew.&rdquo; This must be practically applied to us: no white, no yellow. More than a hundred years ago there was a war in this country between the north and the south over the matter of race. I read that during the battles the soldiers on both sides prayed. They prayed to the same God and Savior Jesus, and sometimes they called each other brothers. What a shame! I would like to tell you that this fighting has never ceased. Still today in Christianity this shame is prevailing. To overcome this matter of race is probably possible only in the recovery. And it is only a possibility.</p>
<p>Just before the Chinese conference, I spoke to the serving ones at the Living Stream on the subject, &ldquo;Grace Swallowing Up Race.&rdquo; Do you know what the church life is? It is the grace that swallows up race. Race is short of a letter, G. If we add G to our race, there will be no more race, only grace. If there is still race, it indicates we are short of grace. In my whole Christian life I have never performed a wedding, but now I will marry the two meetings with the two languages. This ceremony will not last just an hour; it may take several years. To have two meetings in two languages in one locality means trouble. I have seen and experienced and suffered much regarding this matter. But we have no choice.</p><h2 class="head2">The Need for a Chinese-speaking Meeting</h2>
<p>In the Bay area, for instance, I did my best to avoid this trouble. Some of you, I know, also tried to avoid this. In fact, I am concerned that among some of you there is still the desire to avoid this. If in your heart you are thinking, &ldquo;How good it will be if there is no Chinese-speaking meeting,&rdquo; you are trying to avoid this. But the situation does not give you any way to escape.</p>
<p>If you avoid this, the church which you take care of will surely suffer. It has been suffering already. At least three years ago, a Chinese-speaking meeting should have been set up in the Bay area. I am not criticizing; at most I am analyzing. Three years ago there was a great demand for such a meeting, but there was a strong avoiding. I did not say anything at that time, because I knew the time was not ripe. But don&rsquo;t think I feel the time is ripe now so I am initiating it. The setting up of Chinese meetings was not initiated by me. It was Abraham Chang who started it. Since it has been initiated, however, the tide is going on. If we, all of us, refuse to have a Chinese-speaking meeting set up in the Bay area, the church will suffer. I do not say this in a light way. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I speak very seriously.</p>
<p>Especially three or four places in the Bay area need such a meeting. There is no need to mention San Francisco because that is almost a Chinese meeting. But San Jose and Berkeley both need one. Probably Sacramento does too; I&rsquo;m not sure. As for the other places in the Bay area, like Santa Cruz, Pleasant Hill, and Hayward, the scale is still small and the need has not yet become evident. But where there is a need, if we delay, under today&rsquo;s atmosphere the church will suffer. We must consider how to find a way.</p>
<p>Tonight we have a number of brothers added. Most of them are the ones who will take care of such meetings. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are elders or will be elders.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Complicated Situation</h2>
<p>Let me give you an illustration of the type of situation you will face. Last weekend four brothers from Palo Alto told me that they now have twenty saints coming together in a brother&rsquo;s home for the prayer meeting. They feel a meeting is needed, and they are ready to have the church life started there. I told them that we did attempt to start the church life in Palo Alto more than five years ago. Then I received a phone call from a brother who already had a little meeting there under his hand. After resigning from the eldership in San Francisco, he took over a little group which was an outpost of the church in San Francisco. Some saints were unhappy about it, so instead of joining him they kept going to San Francisco or San Jose. When this brother heard that the brothers in the Bay area had a burden to start the church life in Palo Alto, he called me, saying, &ldquo;Brother Lee, we are all one family. We are already here, meeting as a local church. Why are the brothers coming here to compete with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I realized the situation was complicated. Without hesitating, I fellowshipped with the brothers that probably the time was not right. The number was few, although one brother had bought a house for this purpose. Since there were so few who would be going there, it would be better not to go and get involved in the complicated situation. Because of this, the brothers retreated, and the one who had bought a house sold it.</p>
<p>Well, when the four brothers from Palo Alto came to me this time, I realized that they were aware of that situation. I told them, &ldquo;The problem still exists there. If you want to start the church life, you surely need to clarify some of those things.&rdquo; Then they asked how to do this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; I answered them, &ldquo;you must clarify yourselves. Why did we feel the situation there in Palo Alto was not clear? We were deeply concerned as to whether they were clear about the truth. We also questioned, sorry to say, whether their motive was pure. Was their understanding of the truth clear? Was their motive pure? These questions bothered us because of the way that outpost was taken over. If there was the likelihood that that outpost was going to be a church, it should have been done under a sweet fellowship. But there was no fellowship. All of a sudden a kind of church was set up. If there were no other city on earth which had a church, there might not be a problem. But Palo Alto is one city among many cities in the Bay area with churches; and it was originally an outpost of an already-existing church. For such an outpost suddenly to become a church without fellowshipping with the nearby churches raises the question as to what kind of ground it is on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brothers,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;this complicated situation came about because of doubtful ground and a motive not so pure. If you want to begin the church life, how about your motive? If you are unhappy with the church you are now attending and still think this is the time to start a church in your locality (they all live in Palo Alto), this doesn&rsquo;t qualify you. If my motive was not pure, even if the conditions were favorable, even if I knew about the flesh and the lesson of the cross, I would never start a church. I would choose rather to drive a half hour to keep meeting in that place, even if that is another city.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">Applying a Truth from an Impure Motive</h2>
<p>Before they came down last weekend, one of these four wrote me a long letter, asking why, if we preach the truth of one city, one church, we do not practice it. Here they were living in another city, yet going to San Jose. I had no time nor desire to answer such a letter. Now the writer was standing before me. &ldquo;Brother So-and-so, now I will answer your letter,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The church ground&mdash;one city, one church&mdash;is for unity. If we utilize this truth to cover our motive of division, we are more than divisive. Further, this truth cannot be applied as a legality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consider the city of Anaheim. Its boundaries are irregular, like many other cities in the United States and also in other countries. Suppose a brother lives on the outskirts of Anaheim, yet very close to Cypress. His house is also just across the street from the meeting hall of the church in Cypress. If he goes to the meetings of the church in Anaheim, he will have to drive a long way to get to the meeting hall. Instead, he could simply cross the street. You would say that since he lives in Anaheim, he must not go to Cypress; that would be divisive. Well, it all depends. If he has no intention to cause division and has no preference, but just for the sake of time chooses to go with his family to the church in Cypress, what is wrong with that? We are all one church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let us suppose that some brothers in Anaheim are unhappy with this brother. They criticize him for not meeting with the church there. He could argue that they are being too legal and say that there is no need for him to be bound by such a legality. However, if he knows what the flesh is and what the lesson of the cross is, he would choose not to meet with the church which meets nearby. Every meeting he would drive a long way to the meeting hall in Anaheim to get on the altar to be slaughtered. I think you understand my language. This is the biblical way to carry out the church life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot use the truth of the church ground as a legality; then it is no longer a truth.&rdquo; I went on to tell this brother, &ldquo;The fact that there are twenty of you does not qualify you either. Even if the situation in Palo Alto were desirable for starting the church life, this still would not qualify you. You must check your motive. Once something is started by you under the umbrella of the church with an impure motive, everything is annulled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You brothers who have been newly added, I would like you to hear this word. The motive must be clear, must be pure. If you have even a little desire to be a leader, not an elder but just a leader in the Chinese-speaking meeting, this disqualifies you. No man may know, but the Lord knows.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR A PURE MOTIVE</h2>
<p>In the same principle, I would say a word to the elders. To judge with the best discernment whether to have a Chinese-speaking meeting in your locality requires a pure motive. If your motive is not pure, you are not qualified to say a word, either yes or no. Your impureness disqualifies you. Brothers, I say this seriously. Not only in this matter, but in every situation in the church life, especially in the leadership, this principle applies. In the Lord&rsquo;s work, if I have even a little ambition to be something, I am disqualified, I am through.</p>
<p>Among Christians a pure motive is a treasure. It is rarer than a diamond. In my &ldquo;practice of medicine&rdquo; for over a half century, I have surely known what &ldquo;sicknesses&rdquo; people have. It is unusual to find a pure motive in what touches the Lord&rsquo;s work or His church.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has had a history concerning this these past sixty years. There is no need to mention the things which happened on the mainland during Brother Nee&rsquo;s time. A number of you here were involved with what happened on Taiwan from 1958 till 1965. There were some who caused a lot of trouble and then left. I warned them that they would divide again and again. Now that seventeen years or so have gone by, my prediction has been fully fulfilled. They kept on dividing; there was not one exception. In making trouble, they were one. But after they left and began something, nearly no one would work with another. The motive was not pure.</p>
<p>We may be weak. We are still not so useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. I don&rsquo;t deny this. Yet even the dissenting ones cannot deny that the blessing has been on the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Twenty years of history have gone by since 1963; it is clear where the blessing has been. Impureness in the church life and in the Lord&rsquo;s work is the basic killer. It kills everything, including you if you are impure. As long as you have impurity in your motive, you are the first victim of this impureness. This is not a threat; it is a warning, firstly to myself. Only the Lord knows how fearful and trembling I have been for many years lest I be impure in making a decision concerning certain things.</p>
<p>To talk with you about this matter of purity is one of the reasons for these Monday night meetings. Of course, this is a minor point, not the central lane. Nevertheless, it is a major condition. However much you say that you are in the central lane, in the Lord&rsquo;s focus, if your motive is not pure you are off. You are not in the central lane. The central lane is good only for the pure ones to travel on. This is a serious matter. A church under pure hands may experience many troubles, but it is still under the blessing. Once it changes into impure hands, death comes in. You have probably seen this happen.</p>
<p>The same is true with the Lord&rsquo;s work. Soon after I came to this country, some jealous ones from another place said, &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we do what Brother Lee is doing? Let&rsquo;s go to the United States too and do the same thing.&rdquo; They came to this country and tried to do a work. Eventually nothing was accomplished. I don&rsquo;t believe the blessing on the recovery in the United States has been due to my ability. My ability at most could only have been a little instrument. It was due to something in the recovery which was pure. My conscience allows me to ask you brothers: is there any hint of impurity regarding the church and the Lord&rsquo;s work as far as I myself am concerned? I have been with you for twenty years. Tonight I stand before you, about a hundred people, to say that it&rsquo;s hard for you to find anything of the church and the Lord&rsquo;s work related to me that is impure. Brothers, this is the only reason that the Lord&rsquo;s blessing, not in prosperity but in life, is here. And it is because of this that I can speak boldly. My conscience does not have even a small hole. In other things I dare not say; but in this matter of pureness I have a conscience without offense.</p>
<p>Since there will be a number of new Chinese-speaking meetings, this will involve several things. It will involve the leadership of these meetings. It will also involve, at least indirectly, the eldership in the localities concerned. Coordination will be needed. To be patient, to be humble: these may be only religion. Paul may teach patience, but he does so rarely; what he teaches is endurance. Most translators render this as patience, but Paul&rsquo;s word is really endurance.</p><h2 class="head1">MISUNDERSTANDING RELATED TO IMPURENESS</h2>
<p>The prerequisite, however, in responsibility, in the eldership, in the leadership, is pureness. The coordination needs pureness. If you are short of this, regardless of how careful you are, you will have trouble again and again. In the church life, things are always happening. If you are not pure in your motive, you will be entangled either by this trouble or by the next one. It is unavoidable. By the same token, if you are pure, no trouble will entangle you.</p>
<p>Many times our seeming patience comes from impurity. We wait and do not take action because we are afraid of offending others. I don&rsquo;t mean that we should be rude or careless. But pureness is a basic factor. It kills all the germs. If you check with the elders of the church in Anaheim here, I believe they will all agree that, whatever I do, whether I am happy or not happy, they never doubt my motive. They do not doubt my motive, and I do not doubt theirs because we have a mutual history over many years. We have known each other for a long time. Thus, we can save much time and trouble in the way we do things and still not have misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Do you know where misunderstanding comes from? Often its source is impureness. A husband and wife who truly love each other without impureness may quarrel and have disagreements, yet without misunderstanding. Once some impureness comes in, however, there is one misunderstanding after another. They may try to be careful, patient, and wise, but the misunderstandings will continue because of the impureness.</p>
<p>To offend others comes from the flesh. Fear of offending others is also of the flesh. In the world, say, in a corporation, people are very careful not to offend each other, because the world is filled with impurity. If this is true of the church also, we are no more the church. In the church there should be nothing but pureness in every avenue, every corner.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUSPICION AND IMPURENESS</h2>
<p>It is when we are impure that we become suspicious. We become detectives to spy out the meaning behind what others say. If we are pure in our motive, we do not have such a thought. We are on another globe, taking others&rsquo; words in a simple way.</p>
<p>I have heard that some brothers notice things happening that are not right, but they dare not say anything. To avoid getting involved, they stay silent and let the suffering go on. To do this is to play politics. This is what some of you have been practicing. Dear brothers, change your mind. Repent. Let us have no more such thing.</p>
<p>You think someone has secretly reported to Brother Lee about you. Actually, I have not received any such report. There is a demon in your thinking, because you are doing something which you hope Brother Lee will not find out about. No one gave me any information, but under the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty I stepped in just to say that from today we will do things that way no more. Because my correction was exactly right, you thought someone had given me secret information about you. Such was not the case. The Lord Jesus Himself gave me the word to come to your meeting to correct certain things in principle.</p>
<p>If you are in this meeting tonight with an impure heart, you may think that what I am saying is the result of reports I have been given. You may think that a certain remark specifically applies to you, because it fits your situation exactly. If no one had reported you, how could I have known about it?</p>
<p>Well, what I am sharing with you I wrote down six days ago. I listed the points that I wanted to cover. After our last meeting, I wrote them all down, because I realized that, now I am getting older, I would not remember the points without notes. From this it should be clear to you that what I am saying is not because of reports I have received.</p>
<p>Learn to be pure. This is not a small thing. Now that the Chinese-speaking meeting has started, all these frogs from the depths of the well have come to the surface. Surely if you don&rsquo;t condemn those things, the blessing will be gone. Such suspicious thoughts will kill your service. If you wonder how I can keep going on, I would say it is because I have no such way. You all know my frankness. If you are pure, there is no need to be afraid of anything. Pureness is a basic condition of our service.</p><h2 class="head1">TAKING CARE OF EXTERNAL THINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Necessary, but Not the Lord&rsquo;s Commission</h2>
<p>Now I would like to share with you about Brother Nee&rsquo;s practice. When I was preparing his biography, I collected a number of his writings to show how he worked. Several times he mentions that the Lord&rsquo;s commission to him was not the external things of the work of the church life. The Lord&rsquo;s commission to him was the testimony of Jesus, that is, to live a life of Christ in His death and resurrection. In spite of this, he had no choice but to do many external things. He even published many books on such matters as church affairs. Even the New Beginners&rsquo; Messages are not classified as part of Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry under the Lord&rsquo;s commission; he specifically said the Lord had not commissioned him to give those messages. The Lord commissioned him to give messages on Christ, on His death and resurrection, and on His Body, the mystical Body. Notwithstanding, he published a good number of books for new beginners.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Present Focus on Externals</h2>
<p>What is the outcome of this? In the recovery many churches and many of the saints pay attention to church affairs, to the new beginners&rsquo; meetings, to Brother Nee&rsquo;s teachings on the external things, including the church ground. Sorry to say, not many really see what Christ is in experience. Because of this lack of seeing, we neglect it. We neglect the meaning of the death of Christ, of His resurrection, and of His mystical Body.</p>
<p>If you consider, you will see that what I say is really so. Do the leading ones in the churches really consider how to help the saints to know Christ, how to minister the real experience of the death and resurrection of Christ, and how to know the Body of Christ in an experiential way? It seems that most of the leading ones week after week have other things as their consideration: how to take care of the meeting, how to get the increase, how to help the weak ones, how to get the problems solved, how to build the meeting hall, and other such matters. Unconsciously we have left the central lane. We are not in the focus. Rather, we are somewhat like the Brethren assemblies. We meet according to the Scripture, we have good, even better biblical teachings, and we do preach the gospel. These three things we more or less take care of. But there is little care paid to the central lane.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Focusing on the Inner Life</h2>
<p>Circumstances forced Brother Nee to do things for the external side. Then, under the subtlety of the enemy, some said that before World War II Brother Nee was for the ground of the church, but after the war he changed. Thus they published his messages on the so-called inner life. Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry is prevailing today among many Christians just because of this line of the inner life. Still, you must realize that this is not the testimony of Jesus. Even though they put out <em>The Spiritual Man,</em> I wonder whether those who love Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry really know what Christ as life is experientially, and what His death and resurrection are. This is the poor situation of today&rsquo;s Christians. Even we who say we take Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry take mostly the external part, the chicken feathers and the garlic skins.</p>
<h2 class="head2">An Illustration</h2>
<p>To strengthen what I am saying, I would like to analyze the Chinese-speaking conference last weekend. I must say it was good, but I would like to say a word especially to the Chinese brothers who served there. The messages given were based upon the central lane, yet I don&rsquo;t believe the audience was adequately touched by this. The audience was carried away by the outward atmosphere, which I admit was very good. That atmosphere was of a great reunion, and it was this which occupied most of those who attended. If our work and service in the Chinese-speaking meetings stops with this, we miss the mark. That conference did not hit the central lane. The central lane was in the message, but most of the attendants missed it. All of them no doubt received some help, but it was mostly in the feathers or in the skin. I don&rsquo;t mean the feathers and the skin are not needed. I don&rsquo;t mean that the conference with all the services you provided was not needed. They are needed, just as your physical body is needed; without it, your spirit might be just a ghost. We do need to have such conferences, and all the services, and all the messages, especially the way I spoke then.</p>
<p>I have never before spoken in that way, neither in English nor in Chinese, though I ministered in Chinese for more than thirty years. The way I spoke last weekend was unusual. I realize it was hard to translate. Probably more than thirty percent was lost in the translation into English. Many of the expressions simply had no English equivalent. In that conference I did my best to use the best Chinese expressions in a common way. Because I tried to talk the way people on the street would talk, I used many idiomatic expressions. Such colloquialisms are hard to translate.</p>
<p>Well, that manner of speaking may have been needed, but what about the focus? Consider the Scripture readings for the last three messages (since the first two were intended as gospel messages). Though those verses were all on the central focus, I did not say very much about them. In the last meeting I said that the church is the Body of Christ, that it is the fullness of the One who fills all in all, that it is the house of God, God manifested in the flesh, that it is the golden lampstand, that it is the bride, and that in its consummation it is the New Jerusalem. I did not say that much about each point, but I covered a lot.</p>
<p>Yet I don&rsquo;t have the full confidence that the audience caught the significance of what I was saying. Some points no doubt inspired them, but as a whole I don&rsquo;t think they got the central thing. When others later ask them about the conference, will even one of them say that Brother Lee spoke on the continuation of the church, which will be the New Jerusalem? Some minor points they may mention, but mostly they will remember the wonderful reunion they had. After many years of being separated and scattered, both old and young came together, in some cases three generations, in Christ. Hallelujah! What an atmosphere!</p>
<p>If this is the only result, we miss the mark. The externals of the Lord&rsquo;s work and the church life are what Christianity offers. They are not Christ. They are anity, added to Christ. With us, it may be &ldquo;churchianity.&rdquo; They have the anity but not Christ. We may have the anity, but not the church. We may have the church as an assembly, but not as an organism, as the fullness, as the manifestation of God in the flesh, as the lampstand, as the bride, and as the consummation of the bride, the New Jerusalem. Even apart from those who attended the conference, I am deeply concerned as to whether those of you who are here now have really seen this and are in it.</p><h2 class="head2">Remaining in the Focus</h2>
<p>What I have shared with you tonight is about the pureness and the focus. We do need to have the external things like good meetings, proper Bible teaching, and good gospel preaching. Without these, we cannot exist. Mrs. Penn-Lewis lacked these, and so did T. Austin-Sparks. Because of this shortage, history shows that their ministry did not last long in its practical reality. The denominations, on the other hand, have lasted just because of their organization and all these external things. I don&rsquo;t say we have to follow them, but there is a principle. It was for this reason that Brother Nee, in spite of the sacrifice, took time to care for the external things. He learned by observing those who went before him and lacked these external things, so he did take care of them. At the same time, he told us of his hope that some brothers would be raised up to take care of matters like gospel preaching, new beginners, teachings, and practical church affairs. He regretted that there did not seem to be many among us who could replace him in this aspect.</p>
<p>Today it is the same. The external is still prevailing. We do not pay sufficient attention to the focus. There is a peril, a danger, that we may lose the vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>It is true that, in spite of our weakness and of our not being up to the Lord&rsquo;s standard, there is no other group of people who are so seeking. Not to say unbelievers, even other Christian groups are not as seeking and as sincere as we are. This is simply because of the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. We are somewhat attempting to be pure, and we hate the impureness. Nonetheless, we are not absolute in this hatred.</p>
<p>I look to the Lord that the leading ones in the churches may see this focus and practice it. We must not allow other things to invade our daily life, nor must we allow any practice, good or not good, biblical or not biblical, to invade the church life. May every local church have only this focus, this practice, all the time. Even though the externals are necessary, may we not let them become our focus. Only one thing can be the proper focus of the church life, and that is Christ, Christ experienced by us all. Doctrines cannot be the focus. No doubt we have this doctrine already. I know you all understand it. But to understand the doctrine is one thing; to see the vision and be caught by it, and to practice it, is another matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OUTCOME</h2>
<p>I believe Brother Nee left this earth without much joy. He did not see much outcome of the vision he had seen. There was very little real expression on this earth of his ministry. If there were not such a little continuation as what we have now, perhaps the only outcome would be some of his writings published to serve Christianity. When I consider this, I am very much warned. What will be the outcome of today&rsquo;s recovery?</p>
<p>The present spread of the gospel on mainland China I believe has been due to two things. First, it was due to the earnest prayers of many European and American brothers and sisters who went to China as missionaries. Of course, not all the missionaries were pure, nor did they all have a real burden. But some, like Hudson Taylor and others, did. I believe what is happening in China is an answer to the prayers they offered. Second, it is due also to the seed sown by the Lord in China through the recovery. Many of us prayed for the mainland, and the seed of the recovery was sown there.</p>
<p>Much of the present preaching there is shallow. Thus, our books that have been sent in have been used by the Lord; in fact, they have been very much used, because those new believers had nothing to feed on. When they received the books and Life-studies, they were fully satisfied. Of course, this is just the beginning.</p>
<p>We must endeavor to go on, to leave a real testimony. Every local church should be a genuine, pure lampstand. Today&rsquo;s world is small. Whatever we are here will have an effect on China and elsewhere. The influence, the news, will reach them. We hope that they may receive some publications and even these messages. How the recovery goes in other places depends on what we are here.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE NEED<br />
FOR A CHINESE-SPEAKING MEETING<br />
AND FOR BEING SOWN AS A SEED</h1>
<p>Many of you brothers are here tonight from different parts of California. This might be a good opportunity to fellowship with you about the building up of the churches here.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR A CHINESE WORK</h2>
<p>I would first like to speak of the Chinese-speaking meetings we are having every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. As you know, these meetings are a continuation of the weekend conference we had here with five meetings. That conference was the result of a deep concern for the saints both in the United States and in Canada who are in the church, yet cannot manage the language sufficiently to take in the messages to get the nourishment and to express themselves in praise and prayer to the Lord. For quite a long time they have been suffering a spiritual loss as a result. Because of this the burden of many Chinese-speaking saints has gotten heavier and heavier. And it has been the same with me.</p>
<p>When I was commissioned by the Lord to begin a work for His recovery in this country, I was charged not to touch any Chinese work. Even so, in the last few years, because of the increase in the immigration quotas for the Far East, many more saints have come to this country with their unbelieving relatives, friends, schoolmates, and neighbors. There is a need for us to take care of them. Otherwise, the Lord will suffer. In previous years I have not paid much attention to this need. I did not have the time, and I did not want the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the English language to be reduced or frustrated.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, I figure we have lost a thousand Chinese saints in this country these past few years. The actual number may be higher. Just in California we must have lost five hundred. Where have they gone? They were either misled or distracted. Human beings are living creatures in need of affection. Because of our indifference&mdash;there was no sign on our side that we were concerned about them&mdash;others came in. Do you know how they reached them? Some came here from the church in Taipei. Before their departure, some Christian workers in this country got word from their connections in Taipei as to who among us was coming. They found out their flight number, the date of their arrival, and other information. Then they met them at the airport, ready to serve these newly arriving ones. They offered to take them by car wherever they wanted to go; if they had no place to go, they took them to their guest house. Then in the evening there would be a meeting. Of course they agreed to go. Thus they were &ldquo;kidnapped&rdquo; and lost to the recovery. We cannot condemn these who believe they are working for the Lord. Only the Lord knows. But the impression we have given is that we do not care for the Chinese work.</p>
<p>Actually in 1967 I charged the church in Taipei, and even a specific co-worker, to pick up the burden for the Chinese coming to this country. Around that time there was a change in the immigration laws, and I foresaw that there would be a great increase in the number coming to this country.</p>
<p>Many have since come, but we have lost track of them. They did not have a strong foundation in the church life, so after they came they were distracted by their schooling, job, or relatives. They have been lost because of our indifferent attitude.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHINESE OPENNESS TO THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>I have realized how hard it is for the churches here to gain new converts. The opposition has made it difficult. Brother Nee taught us that our work is like farmers&rsquo;. We need to go where the water is. If there is no rain, the farmers would not try to farm in such a place. They know that not much would grow. Salvation is easy to apply to the Chinese, whether on the mainland, in Taiwan, or in the United States. I believe one of the reasons for this is the earnest, faithful prayers offered to the Lord by many missionaries from abroad, especially from Britain and America. There were a good number like Hudson Taylor, who cared only that the Lord&rsquo;s salvation be applied to the Chinese people. They fasted and prayed. Even though they were in the denominations&mdash;in their time they did not see the light&mdash;they were faithful, sacrificing their homeland, their families, and even their lives for what they called the Chinese souls. Now I believe the Lord is answering the faithful prayers of those dear missionaries.</p>
<p>The second reason, I believe, is the prayers by Brother Nee while he was in prison. What else could he have done but pray? He was not allowed to preach, even to his prisonmate. When this prisonmate, who was secretly brought to the Lord by Brother Nee, was about to be released, Brother Nee told him he must find a brother named Witness Lee and listen to whatever he said, and tell him that he (Brother Nee) had not changed his beliefs. This word came to me from a brother and his wife (a relative of Brother Nee&rsquo;s) who live in this country and who visited Shanghai and saw this former prisonmate twice. Surely Brother Nee was not idle during his imprisonment. He must have heard that I was in this country. He must have prayed for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and for China.</p>
<p>Thirdly, if you consider all of us who were there in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in China, and then suddenly found that the mainland was lost, you will realize that thousands of us have been praying, crying to the Lord to remember that great country. The door was shut tight. In 1949 when I left we had an estimate of about three million Christians in China. Now I have read a newspaper from Hong Kong which says there are over thirty million. All over China, wherever the gospel is given today, people turn to the Lord. This is the Lord&rsquo;s answer to the prayers of the missionaries, of Brother Nee, and also of many of us. It is mercy.</p>
<p>Even here in this country the Chinese respond if they are invited. They will come and they will believe. Most of them are professional people; they are not uneducated.</p><h2 class="head1">A LACK OF FRUIT AMONG US</h2>
<p>I give you this background so you will know why I have picked up this burden. In the twenty years I have been in this country, I took no interest in the Chinese side. But since last year my concept has changed a little. I still have no burden to build a Chinese work. My burden, my ministry, is to build the local churches in the United States. On the Chinese-speaking side, my burden is simply to make up the lack. Just in California alone among us there are over five hundred Chinese saints. Perhaps half can manage the English language; these are the ones who graduated from schools in this country. The rest know only the simplest English. They cannot express themselves in the prayer meeting and at the Lord&rsquo;s table. They cannot understand much of the spoken messages, so they have lacked nourishment. Due to this, some have left and gone to &ldquo;Chinese meetings.&rdquo; There are many of these, even here in Orange County. In Vancouver I have heard of one such meeting where there are eight hundred Chinese. The brother who raised it up was with us in Hong Kong before joining the Christian and Missionary Alliance. I felt shameful when I heard this story. We have had a church in Vancouver for years. Yet this brother, who learned so little from us, could bring in eight hundred by himself to listen to him in the Chinese language. In Rosemead, which is a continuation of Elden, there are only a hundred sixty Chinese plus eighty non-Chinese. Consider how many years we were in Elden, yet our numbers are so few compared to this other work in Vancouver.</p>
<p>What has been the fruit of all our work? San Jose has many good opportunities, yet nothing has been done. A brother from Taiwan was in San Francisco for a couple of years, and another was in Berkeley, yet nothing seemed to happen. It has disappointed me; it is a shame to me. Why, when our brothers came, could they not do anything, but when others came, they could accomplish so much? I am more than busy, but I have been forced to do something.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR PROPER &ldquo;COOKING&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Doctrinally speaking, we are not short of spiritual groceries to feed the churches. I don&rsquo;t mean that we are a seminary, offering different courses. I mean we are a great family, with groceries to feed our people. Do you know of any groceries that we lack? Please tell me if you do, and I will endeavor to make up the shortage. It seems to me we have more than is needed. But in our cooking there is a great lack.</p>
<p>I have been to the Far East. I have traveled throughout the United States. The meetings I have attended have usually included the giving of a message, followed by the sharing of the saints. The messages are largely repetitions of the Life-study messages, presented in different ways. Then, when it is time for the saints to share, what they have to say, because of the lack of proper cooking, generally lacks the focus of the central goal. I have given about three thousand messages in this country, all focused on the central lane of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>The proper cooking in the churches first of all requires that the leading ones get into the messages on the central lane. I mean that they should live, experience, practice those messages. Then you will be able to do more than just repeat them. Your speaking will be your experience. Only when you present to the saints what you have experienced have you done the proper cooking. The basic point of the proper cooking is this: the leading ones need the practical experience of the words on the central lane. Yes, the three thousand messages were on the central lane. Still, for anything to exist it needs skin and bones. You cannot experience the skin and the bones; you must experience the meat.</p>
<p>There is no need for you to repeat a message which has already been given. What is needed is your experience. Then when you give a message, you present your experience of it and the way in which you have experienced it. This will bring the saints to focus on the central lane and help them to practice living the points of God&rsquo;s focus. Such a message will provide the help for them to live in the experience of the central lane. These two things&mdash;to experience and to help others to experience&mdash;will take much time to practice, to learn, and to pray over.</p>
<p>For the present stage of the churches, our meeting should be to train, instruct, help every saint to get into life, the living, of the central lane. This cannot be done in even one or two years. As the system of universal education illustrates, a course of study takes three or four years. Elementary school takes six years, then junior and senior high take three years each, and then a college course of study needs four years. To help a church get into the practical living of the central lane, to set up a foundation, will take about four years.</p>
<p>The brothers of the church in Anaheim realized last fall that I was unhappy with the church meetings here. The meetings had no goal. It was like attending class after class in a university without being able to figure out what the course was about. The classes were just a waste; not only a waste, but even a damage to the appetite.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORK IN CHEFOO AND TSINGTAO</h2>
<p>As I prayed and considered the situation of the meetings, I recalled the revival that broke out in my city, Chefoo, in 1942. It came after four years of preparation. Before that time, in 1937, the work under Brother Nee&rsquo;s leadership assigned me to travel throughout the provinces in northern China. Everywhere I went I was welcome. Mostly I spoke and ministered in the denominations. The decision had been made by the work under Brother Nee&rsquo;s leadership to send the truths we had received of the Lord to the denominations. I remember we had a study on the book of Hebrews in the central station of the China Inland Mission in the province of Shansi. I spent about two or three weeks there to hold that study with their workers. From those experiences I learned that nothing would ever come of that kind of work. I decided not to do that anymore.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BY WAY OF SPEAKERS</h2>
<p>Dear brothers, this has been our way to carry out the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. It has not been by the way of going out to speak. That is the way of revival, the Christianity way. The Catholic Church has never taken the revival way. We never hear of the Catholic Church having a gospel campaign and inviting a famous evangelist to speak. But every year millions are added to them. You may say they are strongly organized. They have their way to keep their people, to teach them. It is hard to turn a Catholic away from the Catholic Church, whatever country they are in. How about our people? Like those from Taiwan, if they just change from one country to the United States, they get away. Why? It is because our work in Taiwan was not solid.</p>
<p>I believe the best way, especially at this juncture, to carry on local church meetings is to cook the groceries and to serve the saints with the proper cooking. It is not sufficient just to pick up the points of the messages, but to experience them. Even I myself like to go back and study the messages; whenever I do, I get the help. Do not think that by reading it over and over you&rsquo;ll get it. You will not get it, unless you practice it and experience it. This is what the churches need.</p>
<p>I do not oppose reviewing the messages, but I do not think that is sufficient. You can see the result. As I told the brothers in Taiwan, we must realize what the result is of our labor year after year. Then we have to consider. As Haggai says, &ldquo;Consider your ways&rdquo; (1:7). You labor, you sow much. How much do you reap? Why do we need to repeat the unfruitful work? We must consider, reconsider, our way. To review the messages is easy. From among the churches to have a few make the abstracts and then have a meeting to go over them is easy. I don&rsquo;t think a farmer would expect to reap much with this kind of labor. To reap requires heavy labor.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A SEED SOWN</h2>
<p>Brothers, I would fellowship with you and encourage you with this one thing. You must sow yourself like a seed in the church of which you bear a burden. You must sow yourself. To be an elder is like being a housewife and mother. If a mother wants her family to be built up, she forgets everything except them. This is what I mean by sowing yourself. You can also use the word sell yourself. When a young woman gets married, she sells herself to her husband; that is she sells herself to the family. She forgets everything except the family.</p>
<p>A housewife should not say she does not know how to cook, that she wants to invite someone to cook for her, for her family. No family or home could be built by hiring others to do the cooking. But today the churches like to invite speakers. They are eloquent, but, sorry to say, they may just tickle your ears. What is the result? Children may like to eat hamburgers bought from a fast-food place, but that kind of cooking will not build them up. They need the mother&rsquo;s cooking. It may not taste as good, but it is nourishing. We must build up the taste of the saints in the churches so that they will not care for the speakings, teachings, without the experiences of the central lane of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>Then by the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty I had to stay in my home town due to the invasion of the Japanese army. For over fifty months I stayed in Chefoo, with only one side trip to Tsingtao for two months in 1942. In those two months two hundred newcomers were baptized, thus laying a strong foundation for the church in Tsingtao. Then, six years later Brother Nee held a training. Some brothers who went to that training afterwards went to Tsingtao. They began preaching. In one day they baptized more than seven hundred. Their work was based upon the foundation of those two hundred who were baptized in 1942. When I went there, I purposely stayed two months, realizing that nothing could be accomplished in a week or ten days. It took two months for something to happen. Those two months were the only time within the fifty months that I was out of Chefoo.</p>
<p>I believe Brother Chang Wu-Chen would give me the freedom to say this. In 1939 he was not even a deacon. I brought him in as a learning deacon. Then after a time I asked him to come to the elders&rsquo; meetings, not as an elder but just to sit and watch and learn. That was what he did.</p>
<p>In those four years in Chefoo I took the lead in everything, including the cleaning of the rest rooms, which in China were terribly dirty. I took care of all of the meetings&mdash;the prayer meeting, the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, the elders&rsquo; meetings, and the service meetings, including the visitation and the shepherding. Quite often I went by bicycle to visit the saints in order to see their families and home life. I visited many special gospel cases. A number of families were brought in as a result.</p>
<p>I kept long hours. Before eight I went to the meeting hall to arrange the rooms and to give instructions as to how the serving ones should take care of the different matters. At noon I went home, had lunch, and took a little nap. About two o&rsquo;clock I went back and stayed at the meeting hall till dinnertime. After dinner at home I returned to the meeting hall for the meetings. Even if there was no official meeting, every night there was some meeting. These lasted till about ten. Then I would return home. This was my way of life every day. I had no day off, no vacation, for fifty months.</p>
<p>Then, when the Communists came to occupy Chefoo, all the leading ones left. This was our policy because we knew that was the best way to face the situation. As long as the leading ones were there, the church would have trouble because the Communists were after the leaders. Here is the point I want to make: Nearly all the leading ones who left Chefoo for other cities became either an elder or a deacon. Tens of brothers left Chefoo and went to Tsingtao or Shanghai. Chang Wu-Chen and Chu Shyu-Min are the two very evident cases; they were both produced in those four years. When I later went to Taiwan, these two were the greatest helpers to me to carry out the ministry in Taiwan.</p>
<p>It takes time to build up such a taste. When I was in Chefoo, even after one year the saints&rsquo; taste for other things was lost. They lost their taste for anything except the building of the local church. At that time I did not see much of the central lane. If I had seen it, I believe they would have lost their taste for everything other than the central lane.</p>
<p>I hope that all the churches on this earth today will lose their taste for any kind of speaking or doctrine other than the central lane. This does not mean my intention is to charge or request that all the churches repeat my message. If you think this way, that is your thinking. You bear the responsibility. That is not my thinking.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE MINISTRY</h2>
<p>But whatever you practice, whatever you experience today, must be the things of the New Testament ministry. This ministry is one. Paul did not have one ministry and Peter another. Especially after the training on the Epistles of Peter, you can see how much they were both one in the unique ministry. The coming training will be on John&rsquo;s Epistles. You will see that these three&mdash;Paul, Peter, and John&mdash;were one. They had one ministry, the ministry, the New Testament ministry. This does not mean that Peter used the same terminology and way of presentation as Paul. Their terminology and presentation differ. Especially John&rsquo;s differs. Yet they were all on the central lane. Now I understand Peter&rsquo;s word at the end of his two Epistles, where he said, &ldquo;Even as also our beloved brother Paul...wrote to you&rdquo; (2 Pet. 3:15). Fifty years ago I thought it was good of Peter to recommend that the saints read Paul&rsquo;s writings. Now, however, I have begun to understand in a deeper way. Peter meant that what he ministered in his two Epistles was the same as what Paul had ministered. Maybe what Paul wrote is hard for you to understand, but don&rsquo;t twist it; if you do, you are twisting the Scripture (v. 16). These two apostles ministered the same thing. Now I understand Paul&rsquo;s word in 1 Timothy, where he charged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to &ldquo;charge certain ones not to teach differently&rdquo; (1 Tim. 1:3). They might teach according to the Scripture yet different from the New Testament ministry.</p>
<p>What is the New Testament ministry? Paul told us in that very chapter: the economy of God (1 Tim. 1:4). What is the economy of God? Chapter three calls it the mystery of godliness (3:16). What is the mystery of godliness? It is God manifested in the flesh. This is the focus of God&rsquo;s economy; this is the central lane of the Lord&rsquo;s New Testament ministry.</p>
<p>I do have the full assurance that the Lord has given this ministry to us. From the first century apostles up till now, this ministry has never been as definitely and clearly commissioned to Christians as it is to us today. We do have the assurance to boast that we have surely seen what the Lord&rsquo;s New Testament ministry is. I can boast that I am one of the co-workers of the apostle. Because of this I was one with Brother Nee.</p>
<p>When I was with Brother Nee, I did not preach anything other than what I had heard and learned of him. It was not that I did not know other doctrines. If I had wanted to, I could have had a successful work by myself in northern China. But when Brother Nee asked me to Shanghai to be with the co-workers there, I went to the Lord and saw one flow. Only this one thing, brothers, has preserved me: to be always one with Brother Nee. Thank the Lord, He has preserved me even till today. After fifty years, I am still here. Many have come and gone. Some of those who left are still alive. If you consider their present situation, however, you will realize that not one is under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. They have no way to go on, because there is no way. There is only one way.</p>
<p>Even in this country, consider the ones who left us. How are they doing? I never spoke anything to tell the saints to oppose them or to be careful of them. My work, as I have said many times, has no wall. It has no defense. How about what happened in 1978? What is that today? Again, they have no way.</p>
<p>God is the unique source. There is only one God, one Savior, one Lord, one way, one testimony, one ministry, one flow, one throne, and one goal. Where are we? Praise Him! We are in the one way, the one flow, the one ministry with the one goal.</p>
<p>The opposers say I speak this way to threaten people not to leave. That is their devilish thinking. I have never had such a thought. My thought was loving, not threatening; I just wanted to warn you. Out of a loving heart I wanted to tell you the truth. I spoke this way with the brothers from Hong Kong. Look around you, I said. Even in Hong Kong, where is there a way? There is no other way. If you do not believe in this Lord Jesus Christ, you have no lord to believe in. If you don&rsquo;t worship this God (because you don&rsquo;t want to worship the same God as Witness Lee), try to find another god to believe in. You will not be able to find one. But human beings are stubborn. Once they leave, it is hard for them to come back. Very few have come back. Do you believe those who left have satisfaction? They may say that the way they are taking is satisfying, but I don&rsquo;t believe their words. With me, however much opposition I face, however heavy the burden is, I have the full satisfaction. I have no doubt that I am in the way.</p>
<p>If we see this, we will practice the matters of the central lane and experience them. We will live this. Then we shall use our meetings time after time, maybe four or five meetings a week, week after week, just for this one thing. It is like digging a well. You don&rsquo;t dig one spot, and then another, and another. What is the use of a thousand holes and not one bucket of water? You have to dig and keep on digging until water springs up. This is the way to work. This is the way to build a local church.</p><h2 class="head1">SACRIFICING TO PUT YOUR CHURCH FIRST</h2>
<p>Again I say, to take this way to care for the church means that you have to sacrifice a lot. You cannot consider yourself. I have recently spent many, many hours between the millstones being ground. My wife spoke with me after some of these grinding talks. She reminded me of my age. I told her I surely realize my age, but I have offered my entire life for the recovery. If there is a problem that I know is not solved, even if I lie down on my bed, I have no rest. That is more damaging to my health than to spend hours and hours talking with those involved to help them solve it. To give this help becomes my joy. I would rather sacrifice my life to keep the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This is my destiny. Don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t know how to take care of my health. If I had nothing to do for the Lord and were retired, I would surely take care of my health. But the churches around the world, especially the churches in the Far East, are my children, more precious even than my own children. How could I lie in bed resting, while they get drowned in the bottom of the ocean? I have to forget my health.</p>
<p>Brothers, I don&rsquo;t encourage you to sacrifice your health, your life, but in taking care of the church life do not consider your interest first. Set your interest aside. There is a slogan, &ldquo;Safety first.&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;The church first.&rdquo; And your local church first, of which you are one of the elders. Not your job, not your family. I don&rsquo;t mean that you shouldn&rsquo;t take care of your family, but I mean that the church should come first. Otherwise, brothers, I must predict that no church among us can be built up. I am pretty sure this prophecy will be fulfilled, unless you brothers who are elders sell yourselves not to the church but to the church where you serve. Always consider that church first. If you do, there will be no need for me to sit here talking to you. You will know how to learn. You will be able to figure out what is needed. Otherwise, we can only be the best of Christianity. We cannot have the real testimony on the central lane of the Lord&rsquo;s New Testament ministry.</p>
<p>Pray about this. And I beg you to pray for me. As the problems have come, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and with the brothers&rsquo; help I have borne the burden and the matters have been solved. I do realize, however, from another angle that this has been the enemy&rsquo;s attack, to keep me so occupied by one thing after another for the past month or so. I have lost the time when I would have been working on the notes, and my body has been somewhat exhausted. So pray for me. And pray for yourself, and pray for the church you take care of.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TROUBLES AND BLESSINGS</h2>
<p>Concerning the ministry station, I do want you to be clear about the relations and boundaries. Then we can all go on in a sweet, efficient way. It is His mercy that we have so many complications. Complications are a sign of the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. Children are a trouble, and they make life complicated for the parents. I have many children; I also have many brothers, both Chinese and American. I have also many churches and many co-workers. This means I have a lot of trouble. The same is true of the ministry station office. It is a blessing, but it also means I have a lot of trouble. Consider, however, without this office, how could my ministry be carried out? Yes, on the one hand, it is a blessing; on the other hand, it is a trouble. From the New Testament we know that Paul had these same complicated situations to take care of. My words to you are just for the carrying out of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S UNIQUE WAY</h1>
<p>In these days, whenever I have the time, I have been considering the Lord&rsquo;s recovery according to what I have seen all these past years. As you know, it began there in China some sixty years ago, in 1922. The first ten years I was not there, but later I heard the history. Then for the past fifty-one years I have been directly involved and have seen many of the things that have happened. What I fellowship with you tonight is based upon what I have seen and heard.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A WORD FOR THE FUTURE</h2>
<p>Why am I burdened to talk with you in this way? It is because of the present situation and the situation yet to come. You may wonder how we can consider our future situation when we don&rsquo;t know what it will be. Well, history does help us to visualize what may happen in the future. This is one factor. Another factor is that I am burdened to take care of some crucial matters, hoping to get them completed if the Lord wills. I want to concentrate my time and energy on these matters.</p>
<p>Because I do not have the time to visit the churches and help them directly, except in a limited way, I am burdened to put the things I have been considering into these practical talks and have them published. Then they will be useful not only for the present but also for the coming days. We don&rsquo;t know how long the coming days will be; only the Lord knows. But for as long as the Lord tarries, the recovery will be on this earth. Even though the scale of the recovery is small, it is nonetheless scattered throughout all the continents and is still spreading. We all believe this spreading will continue, even though slowly. With these future days and future new ones especially in mind, I feel there needs to be a basic vision or basic knowledge of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>Just five years ago a distraction came in which confused some dear ones who were concerned for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Since such a thing could happen in the past right before our eyes, how can we have the assurance that such a thing will not be repeated in the future? Thus, while the Lord still grants me the days, I would like to do as much as I can to put things clearly into writing. Then the dear ones who are in and who will be brought into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery can have a clear view about what it is.</p>
<p>What I would like to share I feel more free to say in these talks with you leading ones. I would not feel so free in a conference, speaking to a larger audience. These are not conference messages. Nonetheless, I want to have them printed for all the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, whether old or new, experienced or newly saved. I hope every one will have a copy to read now and later as well.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT A REFORMATION</h2>
<p>It is easy to think of the recovery as meaning a reformation. I think such an understanding of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today is inadequate. I would say that even the reformation at Luther&rsquo;s time was not an adequate recovery. While it may be considered as a part of the recovery, it is not what the Lord wants today. For today the Lord wants a recovery that is according to the complete revelation of the New Testament.</p>
<p>When we say the New Testament, we don&rsquo;t mean that the New Testament has nothing to do with the Old. The New Testament is the outcome of the Old. In a true sense, the New Testament includes the Old. To speak of a recovery according to the complete revelation of the New Testament is the same as to say that it must be according to the whole Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD AND HIS UNIQUENESS</h2>
<p>From the entire Bible we know that God is unique. He is the only God and He has a plan, which is also unique. Then, according to His plan, He has an economy, and this economy of His is also unique. Furthermore, in His economy there is His work, which is also unique. And to carry out His work, there is a way. This way is also unique. From this it is clear that what is revealed in the Bible is unique. God is unique. His plan is unique. His economy is unique. His work is unique, and His way to carry out the work is also unique.</p>
<p>In other words, as we have pointed out elsewhere, in the entire Bible there is only one line to carry out what God wants. Of course, there is another line, that of the evil work of God&rsquo;s enemy. Yes, there are two lines in the Bible, but one belongs to God&rsquo;s enemy. At the beginning of the Bible there are two trees and at the end, there is a city of water and a lake of fire. These two, the city of water and the lake of fire, are the consummation of the two trees. The tree of life will consummate in the city of water; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil will consummate in the lake of fire. Between these two ends, throughout the entire Bible, are these two lines.</p>
<p>As those who have been saved, called, and separated by God unto His economy, we are not in the enemy&rsquo;s line but rather in God&rsquo;s. That this line is one is clear even in the Old Testament, but it becomes even clearer in the New. There is the one line of the unique God, of His unique plan, of His unique economy, of His unique work, and of His unique way.</p><h2 class="head1">THE UNIQUE CHRIST</h2>
<p>In the New Testament we see firstly the unique Christ. When Paul wrote to the Corinthian believers, he asked them in a rebuking tone, &ldquo;Has Christ been divided?&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:13). Of course He has not. Christ is unique. His redemptive work is unique. The issue of His death and resurrection is also unique. This unique issue is the church, which is also unique.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH&mdash;UNIQUE UNIVERSALLY AND LOCALLY</h2>
<p>The church is the one Body of Christ. This Body&rsquo;s expression, wherever it may be, is also unique; this refers to the local church. Both the universal and the local church are unique. Even the way to carry out the churches is also unique. In the four Gospels not much is indicated of this, but in the Acts there is the unique way for the churches to be carried out. From chapters one through twenty-eight, one way is singled out. That way is by the Spirit. What is the Spirit? It is the pneumatic Christ. The way began from Jerusalem and then went on to Antioch, Ephesus, Corinth, other cities, and Rome.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOCUS OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>The Epistles show us the unique focus of God&rsquo;s economy. What is this unique focus? Forty or fifty years ago this focus was not as complete, as crystal clear, to me as it is today. You may say that Christ is the unique focus of God&rsquo;s economy. But, brothers, if you think back over all the trainings we have had on the Epistles, you should have an impression. The focus of God&rsquo;s economy is not merely Christ. Of course, it depends on how you define the term Christ.</p>
<p>Colossians 2:9 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; In one of our hymns we say, &ldquo;The fullness of God dwells in Thee&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> # 501, verse 2), but Colossians 2:9 says &ldquo;the fullness of the Godhead,&rdquo; not the fullness of God. Godhead means God Himself. The Godhead is triune. That the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ really denotes that the divine Trinity is dwelling in Christ in full. The fullness of the Trinity dwells in Him bodily.</p>
<p>Fullness, in New Testament usage, means more than riches. John 1:16 doesn&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;Of His riches we all received&rdquo;; it says, &ldquo;Of His fullness we all received.&rdquo; Ephesians 1:23 doesn&rsquo;t say that the church is the riches of Christ; it says it is His fullness. In fact, it says that the church is &ldquo;the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; The church is not only the fullness of Christ; it is also the fullness of God (Eph. 3:19). Fullness is greater than riches. You may have riches without having fullness. The fullness is the riches in full expression. When the riches are expressed in full, that expression is the fullness. I can illustrate it for you with a cup. A cup may hold a lot of water, but there is not the fullness of the water until the water overflows the brim. When this happens, there is not only the riches but also the fullness.</p>
<p>The expression in Colossians 2:9, the fullness of the Godhead, is a strong one, telling us that the fullness of the Trinity dwells in this One bodily. If we say that Christ is the focus of the New Testament, then, our understanding of Christ must include the realization that in this One is the fullness of the Trinity. It is such a Christ that is the focus of the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRINITY REVEALED</h2>
<p>Why is the Trinity not clearly revealed in the Bible until after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection? In Matthew 28:19, while He was charging His own to go and disciple the nations, He added in clear words, &ldquo;baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Before Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, the Trinity was not fully revealed to God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>John 7:39 says, &ldquo;The Spirit was not yet.&rdquo; The Spirit was not yet because Jesus at that time had not yet been glorified, resurrected. Something concerning the second of the Trinity was not yet accomplished, not yet glorified. Jesus, the second of the Trinity, was not yet resurrected, glorified. For Him to be glorified was for Him to bring His humanity, His part of the old creation, into resurrection. When He became flesh, He took humanity upon Him. That flesh, that humanity, was of the old creation and remained such until it was brought through death and into resurrection. When that part of His being which was of the old creation was brought into resurrection, Jesus was glorified. Until this glorification was accomplished, the second of the Trinity had not finished the process which He should go through. The process was not fully accomplished until His resurrection.</p>
<p>Let us come back to John 7:39. Because Jesus was not yet glorified, the Spirit was not yet. As the process of the second was not yet accomplished, so neither was that of the third. With Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, the process of both the second and the third was fully accomplished; thus, after His resurrection He could reveal the Trinity in full by speaking of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>If we go on from Matthew to the Epistles, we can see that the entire book of Ephesians is composed with the Trinity as its basic structure; every chapter, from one through six, is constructed in this way. (See note 14<sup>1</sup> on 2 Corinthians 13:14, Recovery Version, regarding the Trinity as revealed throughout the Bible.) Second Corinthians 13:14 also indicates the Trinity when it says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; Consider also the Trinity unveiled in the first few verses of Revelation. The entire Bible gives us a complete revelation of the divine Trinity. This revelation is the focus of the Epistles. Even Revelation is an epistle, written to the seven churches. The divine Trinity, then, is the focus of the Epistles.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CIRCUMFERENCE</h2>
<p>What is the circumference? It is the Body of Christ, the church, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNIQUE MINISTRY</h2>
<p>There is one more unique point to cover. In the New Testament in the first four books there is the one Christ. Then out of this Christ the apostles are produced. Then these apostles are the ones who bring the churches into being. One Christ produces the apostles, and the many apostles produce the churches. Now the final point is the unique ministry.</p>
<p>The ministry is one. In Acts 1:17 Peter says regarding Judas, &ldquo;For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.&rdquo; This is a strong indication that the twelve apostles had only one ministry. We may consider that the twelve each had their own ministry, but it is clear from this verse that they had only one ministry. That one ministry was to dispense the divine Trinity to produce the church, the circumference.</p>
<p>After the twelve apostles, more were added, especially Paul. Timothy and all the co-workers were also added. In 2 Corinthians 4:1 Paul says, &ldquo;Having this ministry, as we received mercy we do not lose heart.&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rdquo; refers to the apostles and their co-workers; they, plural, have received this ministry, singular. In the previous chapter it is clear that even the Old Testament ministry was one (2 Cor. 3:7-11). That ministry was one of condemnation and death. Now in the New Testament the ministry of righteousness and the ministry of the Spirit is also one.</p>
<p>Why is this so? It is because God is unique. His plan is unique. His work is unique. His way to carry out His work is unique. And the very instrument used for His way is the ministry. Thus this ministry is also unique. In the New Testament, there is the unique Christ, the unique way, and the unique focus to carry out the unique circumference, the church, by the unique ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Individual Aspect</h2>
<p>On the one hand the ministry is unique, but on the other hand there are individual ministries referred to (2 Tim. 4:5); the same word is used for both in Greek. It is the word used for the service of deacons (Col. 4:17). We all have our own service, but all our services should be part of the New Testament ministry. Not only an apostle, but even a deacon, serving for example in the business affairs of the church, is part of the ministry. In the Old Testament type, where the focus was on the tabernacle, the ministry there was also unique: caring for the tabernacle and carrying it from place to place. That ministry comprised the priests and the Levites. Most of the Levites took care of business matters. Such services were a type.</p>
<p>Nowadays there are the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and the teachers and shepherds. In addition, there are the elders, the deacons, and also many others who are neither gifted ones nor responsible ones yet who are serving the church. Each has his own service. Every one, even if he is not an elder or a deacon, as long as he serves in the church, has his part in the ministry, which is properly called the service. If we add all these services together&mdash;those of the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers, as well as the services of the elders, deacons, and all the other saints&mdash;we have the New Testament ministry. This inclusive ministry is unique.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Divisiveness of Any Other Ministry</h2>
<p>Let us look at the situation in Christianity. The Catholic Church has a ministry. The Anglican Church has another. The same is true of the Baptists, Presbyterians, and all the other denominations. Each one has its own ministry. The Catholic Church has thousands of priests, but they are all doing one thing. There are Jesuits, Dominicans, and Franciscans, yet all three groups are carrying out one objective, that is, to build up the Catholic Church. There is only one ministry among them. Yes, each one has his own service. Every Jesuit, every nun, every priest, has his own service, but all their services serve the purpose of the unique ministry of the Catholic Church. This principle is true even with a small denomination; each has its own ministry.</p>
<p>To have a separate ministry, then, is an indication of division. Paul said, &ldquo;I planted, Apollos watered&rdquo; (1 Cor. 3:6). These are one ministry. Different ministers work on one thing for one goal; thus their ministry is unique. It is not that Paul took care of the entire plantation. He only did the planting; Apollos did the watering. Of course, Peter did another part. But all they did was part of one ministry, that is, the ministering of the focus, the divine Trinity to produce the circumference, the Body of Christ. It is only one ministry.</p>
<p>What is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today? It is a recovery of the unique plan, the unique economy, the unique way, the unique word, and the unique focus by the unique ministry. I hope this is clear to all of us and even that it could be printed in a clear way for others who are not here and for the future.</p>
<p>In the past on the mainland of China I saw some who were in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery but who eventually began to do a separate work. This same thing also happened on the island of Taiwan. I still have some copies of the publications of some of these dissenting ones. They claimed that they saw the Antioch light, that the recovery was too old, that it was of Jerusalem, and that what they saw was something new of Antioch. They condemned James and even to some extent denied the Epistle of James. That &ldquo;Antioch line&rdquo; became a division.</p>
<p>Since the recovery came to the United States in 1963, there have been a few groups who were among us but who remained as a group until they left. There were those who said they saw the &ldquo;Ephesian line.&rdquo; This group still exists today. The second was with us like a drop of oil in water; then they left and have dispersed. A third group was with us for some years; they remain somewhere in the Midwest in another work. A fourth group was with us for a while, but they also stayed as a group until they left; they believed, among other things, that children should participate in the Lord&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>This survey, from the mainland of China to the United States, helps me to see what the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is. It is unique in everything. It has the unique God, the unique plan, the unique economy, the unique work, the unique way, the unique Lord, the unique focus, and the unique ministry.</p><h2 class="head2">The One Ministry of the Apostles</h2>
<p>Let us consider the prominent apostles like Peter, John, Paul, and James. Since last year my view has been much clearer than it was in the past. Formerly I had an unconscious understanding that Peter&rsquo;s ministry was not the same as Paul&rsquo;s. However, while working on the Life-study of Peter, and in these recent days on the notes for John&rsquo;s Epistles, I have found out that these three great writers of the New Testament were all carrying out the one ministry. Now that we have had the training on the Epistles of Peter, I think we can all see that though the terminology and presentation are different from Paul&rsquo;s, the ministry, or the focus of the ministry, is the same. In other words, they were all doing one work. Paul was not doing one work to carry out one objective and Peter another work to carry out a different objective and John a third work with a third objective. No, they were all doing one work to carry out one thing.</p>
<p>What is division? What is a denomination? It is the doing of another work, the carrying out of something else. This is not to say that Paul&rsquo;s preaching and teaching have the same terminology and presentation as Peter&rsquo;s. Nor does John have to preach and teach in the same way as Paul or Peter. All of them used different terminology and different ways of presentation, yet they were all doing the one work. They were all participating in the one ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Case of Selectiveness</h2>
<p>Years ago in New York the claim was made that they accepted all ministries. At the end of 1969 when I was invited there, I went to that brother&rsquo;s home and faced him. I told him, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t accept all ministries. At least, you don&rsquo;t accept my ministry.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;We accept all ministries selectively.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;What is this? If you accept all ministries selectively, that means you select, doesn&rsquo;t it? As long as you select, you don&rsquo;t accept all.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY AND THE UNIQUENESS</h2>
<p>There have no doubt been some great preachers and teachers raised up in today&rsquo;s Christianity, but they are for the most part in different ministries because they are working for different denominations, for different works. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, however, we are doing one work, carrying out one ministry. We are serving one Lord, worshipping one God. We are in His unique plan, in His unique economy, in His unique work, in His unique way. We minister His unique focus. While we participate in this unique ministry, we fully realize that each one of us has an individual service. Not only the so-called gifted ones, even all the saints have each his own service, like the Levites. A Levite had his own service, yet the ministry to care for the ark was unique. There was no ministry other than that one. All the services of the different Levites were just for the unique ministry of caring for the ark.</p>
<p>To me the picture is more than clear. From past experience we realize that there is a peril that some of the brothers gradually, even unconsciously, may get into a work that is different from the ministry&rsquo;s goal. It is not easy to stay in the unique focus, that is, in the focus of the divine Trinity. It is not easy to stay in the unique ministry. Nonetheless, the entire New Testament presents us this unique ministry to minister the Trinity as the unique focus and to produce the church as the unique circumference.</p>
<p>When I met Brother Nee, I realized that his work was in the same ministry as Paul&rsquo;s. Because of this, from the day that I met him I did everything as part of the one work. In the early days in China many among us didn&rsquo;t know this principle. All they saw was how one I was with Brother Nee in the work; they didn&rsquo;t realize the principle I took.</p>
<p>When we published the first issue of <em>The Stream,</em> the first message was on the one flow. I pointed out there this principle. I was one with Brother Nee because I saw that in the entire New Testament there is only one flow on this earth. To say &ldquo;one city, one church&rdquo; is right, yet this alone is not adequate to keep us in the genuine oneness. The &ldquo;Ephesian line&rdquo; would also set up one church, one city, but that is another line.</p>
<p>Our ministry is to carry out the divine Trinity, as all the apostles did. All the Epistles reveal this focus. Prophecies and the interpretations of the Old Testament are covered, but all these prophecies and interpretations are for the focus. The New Testament doesn&rsquo;t have prophecies apart from the focus. It does not interpret the Old Testament apart from the focus. The prophecies are defined, the Old Testament is interpreted, all in the way to carry out the focus, which is the divine Trinity.</p>
<p>Whatever we preach or teach in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery must be focused on the Trinity. Otherwise, what we preach and teach will unconsciously produce another work. Then such preaching and teaching will become a separate ministry. Only one thing can preserve our preaching and teaching in the one ministry: the unique focus.</p><h2 class="head1">SEEING AND BEING IN THE FOCUS</h2>
<p>Here is the burden. We brothers who are taking the lead in the churches must see this focus clearly. Otherwise, what we are doing here eventually will become a distraction to produce another work, and spontaneously there will be another ministry. Whatever we preach, whatever we teach, must be focused on this.</p>
<p>The hardest thing for us to do is to experience the things we ourselves preach and teach. We not only teach or preach, but we practice. Furthermore, we help the individual saints in every local church to practice these things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO PERILS</h2>
<p>If we are not in the focus and if we do not experience what we preach to others, we face two perils. One, sooner or later there will be divisions. Two, if we don&rsquo;t practice the focal points, the saints have no way to practice them. The things we teach will eventually become doctrines in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. There will be no reality. The recovery will be just empty. Then in the sphere of the so-called recovery there will be divisions and emptiness. The only thing that can keep us permanently and absolutely one is the unique ministry to minister the unique focus. The only thing that can keep the Lord&rsquo;s recovery full of reality is to practice what we now preach and teach and to help the saints in every locality to practice the same thing.</p>
<p>If we expect an increase either by evangelism or by the spreading of the doctrines we teach, we shall surely face these two perils. If we don&rsquo;t care for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery by paying heed to all these unique points, then we will care for the spreading of our work. To care for the spread of our work is dangerous. It will produce different works to build up different ministries. Then division will result. We can foresee this. Furthermore, if we don&rsquo;t pay full attention to practice these things in our daily life and to bring all the saints in our local church into these practices in their daily life, the churches will be empty. I am fearful and trembling of these two perils: the peril of different works being produced to cause division and the peril of emptiness. We will have the ground of one church, one city, and we will have the scriptural teachings, yet there will be no real experience of Christ in our daily life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS TO BE AN EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>We need to build up a local church in a very particular and fine way. It is not enough to bring new ones in, to have an increase; we must build them up by helping them to practice the focal things that we ourselves practice. We must be a pattern. The elders should not lord it over the flock but be an example, a pattern, of how to live Christ, how to practice the focal things (1 Pet. 5:3). This will create an atmosphere in the church which will influence all the saints to practice these focal things.</p>
<p>Such a living will also save us from being a movement. We grow in life and help the saints to grow in life, without paying much attention to the spread of the work. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that we do not preach the gospel or spread the truth. We have to preach the gospel. We have to spread the truth. But these things are not our goal. Our goal is to minister to others the divine Trinity as the unique focus. At the same time, we ourselves practice the one spirit with the Lord and live Christ.</p>
<p>In the Bible everything is unique. Have you noticed that Barnabas eventually was gone? He went away. He had a good start. Actually he brought Paul in, but eventually he left. There is no more word concerning him. This indicates that the Bible doesn&rsquo;t keep a record of two ways. According to the record of the Acts, there is only one way. Paul didn&rsquo;t do another work. His work was a part of the New Testament ministry, just as Peter&rsquo;s was.</p>
<p>You remember Paul&rsquo;s word to Timothy: &ldquo;I urged you...to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently&rdquo; (1 Tim. 1:3). To teach differently is to minister something other than God&rsquo;s economy, as Paul mentions in the next verse. Today on Christians&rsquo; bookshelves and in Christian bookstores there are many books on teachings, on doctrines, but there are very few books which are on the focus.</p>
<p>The perils of division and emptiness are crouching here. If we are not alerted by the revelation, it is easy for us to be ensnared either by one or by the other. We can easily be ensnared by emptiness and by the unconscious divisions.</p>
<p>We can be kept in the genuine oneness all the way to the end only by not doing another work. Watchman Nee never did a work other than Paul&rsquo;s. He was very careful about this. He was on guard to do only Paul&rsquo;s work. Just a little carelessness will bring us into this snare of division.</p>
<p>And if we don&rsquo;t practice the focal things experientially, spontaneously we will fall into the snare of emptiness. We may boast that our teachings are scriptural, that we don&rsquo;t have forms, rituals, or organization. It may be true that we don&rsquo;t have these things, but we don&rsquo;t have the reality either. What we have is just emptiness. This is quite serious, brothers. We have to be alerted to stay in the central lane, practicing all the focal things ourselves daily. We must also be burdened to help the saints in our locality practice these things, to grow in life that they might be genuinely and practically built up in the Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ADJUSTMENT NOT WHAT IS NEEDED</h2>
<p>If we get into these things and see the central vision, and preach and practice it, and help others to get into the practice of these things, spontaneously all the other things will be adjusted. Just to adjust is still empty. What we need is not adjustment but focus.</p>
<p>There is a natural tendency to want big numbers, good meetings, good service, a good appearance for <em>our</em> local church. If we are not on the alert, we will unconsciously fall into this natural tendency. We don&rsquo;t need to adjust these things. All we need to do is to pay full attention to the focus. I believe, brothers, that the only thing needed to preserve us in the recovery all the way to the end is to see all these unique things which I have mentioned. Just to see one church, one city is not adequate. As I said, that group practicing the &ldquo;Ephesian line&rdquo; also stresses one church, one city.</p>
<p>May the Lord bring us all and keep us all in the focus.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">INDIFFERENCE LEADING<br />
TO NARROWNESS AND DIVISION</h1>
<p>Prayer: We worship You that You have brought us all here tonight. How we treasure this time. Lord, grant that we may open to You. Again we need Your anointing; we need the utterance to fellowship about the church. We like to be one with You in this moment. Lord, we believe it is of You that we are here. O Lord Jesus, speak from Your heart to us, what You want us to do, the way You want us to take. Lord, we would like to take Your way. Thank You for Your cleansing blood. Thank You for Your presence all the time. Thank You for all the churches. Thank You for Your move among us. Thank You for the Spirit and the Word. Thank You, Lord, for Your forgiveness. How we thank You that we may take You as our sin offering and as our trespass offering, even as all the offerings. O Lord Jesus, we do enter into You, enjoy You, participate in You. Lord, tonight impart Yourself into us again; dispense more and more of Yourself into each one of us. Thank You, Lord.</p>
<p>My burden these days is that we should realize the danger there is that we may fall into those perils we talked about last time.</p>
<p>If we fall into emptiness, this emptiness always leads to division. It may not sound logical, but this emptiness actually works to bring forth the divisions. If we study church history, we can see that first indifference came in, then divisions.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD WANTING EAGER SEEKERS</h2>
<p>From the whole Bible we can see that God wants His chosen ones to be eagerly seeking Him. Among the sixty-six books there is one book of seeking, that is, the Song of Songs. No seeking is as strong as that between the female and the male. The Song of Songs illustrates how the Lord wants His chosen ones to seek after Him. The basic negative scene in the Old Testament is the indifference of the Lord&rsquo;s people to Him.</p>
<p>In the New Testament there is the same thing. When God became incarnate and lived on this earth, actually He didn&rsquo;t do that much work. What He did was to attract His chosen ones. In the four Gospels we can see how the Lord Jesus was like a magnet, attracting people to Himself. The Gospels show that the story between the Lord Jesus and His disciples was one of love. The Lord did not tell His disciples much what they should do for Him; He just kept attracting them to love Him. When the time of His death came, it was a test of the disciple&rsquo;s love toward the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PERIL OF INDIFFERENCE</h2>
<p>In the seven epistles in Revelation when the Lord rebuked the churches, the first one rebuked was Ephesus, and that rebuke was due to the loss of the first love (Rev. 2:4). The last one that was rebuked was Laodicea (Rev. 3:16). When we lose love, the result is lukewarmness. The lukewarmness is the product of indifference.</p>
<p>Indifference apparently is not important. If you go back to the world, or if you leave the church, everyone sees it. But you still remain in the church serving the Lord, taking care of the church. Nonetheless, you may have lost the first love and become indifferent. There is the danger.</p>
<p>The impact of the work for the Lord should be the zeal. If we lose our zeal, we don&rsquo;t have the impact. We may still do the same work, but there is emptiness because indifference has come in. The way we take care of the church, the way we work for the Lord, really doesn&rsquo;t mean much. The impact depends upon zeal. Without eagerness, we are through.</p>
<p>To the first church in Revelation the Lord&rsquo;s warning was that He would remove the lampstand (Rev. 2:5). To take away the lampstand means that the testimony will be gone. The warning to the last church was that He would vomit them out of His mouth (Rev. 3:16). Not only will the testimony be taken away; even you yourself will be given up by the Lord. He will spit you out; He will not keep you.</p>
<p>In between these two churches we can see all the evils mentioned. These evils came in because of this indifference, lukewarmness. None of us can have the assurance that we will escape this peril. It is very easy to fall into this situation. In fact, there is no need to fall into it; we may just be in it. Here we are in southern California. Probably all the churches are in a similar situation. Five years have gone by; the churches are established, the problems solved. Things are peaceful. We just go on according to our regular schedule. This kind of situation is dangerous because we may unknowingly get into a state of indifference.</p>
<p>According to history, quite often the Lord does something or allows something to stir things up. At present we have no trouble and no goal. Suppose we were in an atmosphere for migration. Migration might become the motivation for us to stop being indifferent.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LOSS OF ZEAL</h2>
<p>While things are quiet, there is a danger of losing the testimony. Even our own history in the past years has shown this. Some left&mdash;they fell away or were stumbled&mdash;but the ones who have remained have gradually become indifferent.</p>
<p>There is the same problem in the Far East. The work, the testimony, started on the China mainland with much zeal. It was spread by the same zeal. But today from my observation of the situation in the Far East, it seems the zeal is diminished. As I told the brothers there, I am very much concerned about this.</p>
<p>The churches of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the United States, even though they are much younger, are also in this danger. With the new churches the problem is not that great, but with the established churches, the danger is surely here.</p>
<p>This lukewarmness will no doubt issue in emptiness. By emptiness we mean a shortage of the experience of Christ. When we are devoid of Christ, we are short of the Spirit and short of life. Actually these three are one, yet we have to make them three items. Without the Spirit, we don&rsquo;t have the experience of Christ; if we don&rsquo;t have the experience of Christ, we don&rsquo;t have much life.</p>
<p>I feel very burdened about the present condition of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery on this earth. To my observation it seems that not many churches still have zeal. When some of you brothers came into the recovery, you came in with a zeal that was burning. Now your knowledge has increased, your experience has become more than in the past, but your zeal is less than it was when you first came in.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWLEDGE BUT NOT TRUTH</h2>
<p>We may have more knowledge, but this does not mean we have more truth. According to the New Testament revelation, truth is the issue of light. What is doctrine? What is truth? Knowledge without light is doctrine. Knowledge full of light is truth. Doctors of theology may have much knowledge of the Bible, but they may not have much light. The Life-studies may be just doctrine to you, or they may be truth. The difference is that when you have the knowledge with light, it is truth. Without the light, it is only doctrine. You can get doctrines without loving the Lord. You may go to a seminary or to a Bible college and gain a lot of knowledge, but you may not receive light because light is the Lord Himself. He never tells us that He is knowledge; He says He is the light (John 8:12) and the truth (John 14:6). If we don&rsquo;t love the Lord, we may come to the Bible, we may have morning watch, but what we read may be just knowledge without light. If we have the Lord&rsquo;s presence mingled in our knowledge, then that knowledge is the truth because the Lord&rsquo;s presence is the light. So you see, we may even lose the truth. No Christ, no light, no spirit, no truth (reality). Then what is there? Emptiness, just emptiness.</p>
<p>We must have a zeal to seek after the Lord. Then the Bible helps, the Life-studies help&mdash;help to get not doctrines but the truth, the real knowledge with light. Then we have the truth, the reality. We, the leading ones, should not put too many requirements on the saints. We ourselves have to take the lead. If we don&rsquo;t take the lead to be zealous after the Lord but expect others to be zealous, whatever we say becomes a doctrine, or a teaching, all with no impact.</p>
<p>Even in the Old Testament we have this verse: &ldquo;The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up&rdquo; (Psa. 69:9). The Old Testament prophets, like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel were all zealots. If they lost their zeal, they were no longer prophets; the word would not come to them. The word that came to the Old Testament prophets was truth. The fresh word out of their mouths was full of light. The speakings of the prophets were not doctrines without light; their word was full of light. Thus, it became truth.</p>
<p>Most Christians do not differentiate knowledge and doctrine from truth. From the second third of the last century to the first third of this century many Christian books came out with many truths, full of light. It has not been so in the past fifty years. Instead of truth, emptiness has filled the scene. This might possibly be the peril we may fall into.</p><h2 class="head1">DIVISION, THE FRUIT OF EMPTINESS</h2>
<p>Why does emptiness bring in division? It is because on the one hand you are empty and on the other hand you will not give up.</p>
<p>You are taking care of a church, and the church has become empty, and you have become empty. The reason the church has become empty is because you have taken the lead to be empty. Yet you won&rsquo;t give up. You still want to keep the church and keep things as they are. This desire to keep the church and to keep things as they are offers a chance for the ambitious ones to step in. In every age, in every stage, there have been ambitious ones. On the one hand the churches have become empty, and on the other hand they would not let go of what was in their hand; this situation has opened the door for the ambitious ones to step in.</p>
<p>The gifted ones at first are not that ambitious. But, because of your ability, you have accomplished something, and what you have done tempts you to be ambitious. If you had not succeeded in anything you did, you would not have thought about becoming great. Your successful work becomes a temptation. Then you will go on to do more, and the more successful you are the more you will be tempted by ambition. Then a division will come out. If all the churches are full of Christ, full of life, full of spirit, full of truth with light, I tell you there will be no opening for any ambitious ones to do anything.</p>
<p>There is a history of this. If the Christians in England two centuries ago had not been empty, I don&rsquo;t think John Wesley would have had that much opportunity to become great. A revivalist is raised up because of the lukewarmness of God&rsquo;s people. Their indifference offers an opportunity to the outstanding ones to take some action. Such action issues in division.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NARROWNESS, AN EVIDENCE OF POVERTY</h2>
<p>Along with this point, we must be aware that the more you are full, the broader your heart and mind are. The more you become empty or poor, the more narrow you are in your heart, in your concept. You will be exclusive, especially in your locality. Then you will take the position of assuming more authority. You will say, &ldquo;We are the elders. We don&rsquo;t agree with this brother, or with that thing. We don&rsquo;t agree with that brother doing what he is doing.&rdquo; Thus, you are not open to all the saints.</p>
<p>Such an attitude, you must know, will shut out much of the Lord&rsquo;s riches. When you are rich, full, you become greathearted; you are open to take others in. Some of the elders&mdash;forgive me for saying this&mdash;are to my observation very narrow. You are open only to yourself. You do not give others a chance. You care only for your own concepts, your own ways, your own doings. On the one hand, you may be excluding some saints who are there from participating; on the other hand, you may be shutting the door for more to come in. Do you know what the result will be? You will be dried up.</p>
<p>Of course, to embrace everyone blindly is foolish. But to take this as an excuse in order to carry out your narrow kind of practice will dry up and even kill the church life. There is such a danger.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STAYING TOO LONG IN ONE LOCALITY</h2>
<p>From our experience and observation we feel this danger arises when the elders are in one locality too long. I hope I have the proper utterance to express myself rightly and not to damage you. For an elder to be in one locality for too long a time raises this danger. You will become indifferent. You will become narrow. You will not embrace others. If you are zealous, you will not be like this. It is only when you become indifferent, lukewarm, and therefore poor, that you become narrow. You are not rich, yet you still want to keep your position; you want to keep things in the church just as they are. In order to do this, you become exclusive.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DRYNESS AND DIVISION IN THE HIGH PLACES</h2>
<p>The result is that the water will not flow to your place. The water means the blessing. The blessing will take another way. To have the blessing, you must be humble. Your elevation must be leveled. Why doesn&rsquo;t the blessing come? Why doesn&rsquo;t the water flow? It is because your place is too elevated. You have to lower yourself. You must cut down the elevation.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament a high place is a negative term. The high places were where idols were worshipped. Lukewarmness and indifference create the high place. You become dry. Even if the water would like to re-enrich you, it cannot stay. You have no reservoir to preserve even the rain water; there is no need to say that the river cannot flow up to your high place. All these troubles are of one source: the loss of zeal.</p>
<p>To my observation, some of the churches have become narrow already. The eldership cannot embrace in an inclusive way. You may say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t control things.&rdquo; But I don&rsquo;t mean that you control things. To control is one thing; to be narrow is another. Simply not to control is not sufficient. You need to include others. But a poor man cannot embrace others. To do so, you must be rich in Christ. You must be full of grace. It is not easy for the eldership not to control. It is even harder for the eldership not to be narrow. These are cause and effect, and cause and effect create a cycle. This is a serious danger.</p>
<p>The high places not only represent indifference. Every high place is a division. The people were all to go to Jerusalem, the center of oneness. The high places were divisions with idolatry. Don&rsquo;t think this is just the Old Testament history. It is also the New Testament story. Among Christians, the story is the same. The earth is full of high places. These places are dried up, full of narrowness because they are poor.</p>
<p>Zeal will kill the source of the indifference. Thus, regardless of how long you have been an elder in a local church, as long as you are zealous, there is no danger. When your zeal is gone, the danger is present.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>

<h1 class="title">AVOIDING FAMILY ENTANGLEMENTS</h1>
<p>The New Testament does not give us a clear record of the families of the apostles or of the elders. From Paul&rsquo;s words in 1 Corinthians 9:5, and also from Matthew 8:14, Mark 1:30, and Luke 4:38, we know that Peter had a wife; these are the only words in the New Testament concerning the families of the apostles.</p>
<p>Paul, however, speaks several times of his spiritual children. He referred to Timothy as his spiritual child (1 Tim. 1:2, 18), and also Titus (Titus 1:4) and Onesimus (Philem. 10). Peter also calls Mark his son (1 Pet. 5:13).</p>
<p>There must be a reason for this. I have considered this matter for some time. My conclusion, which I am going to tell you, is an understanding from my experience. I have never read anything concerning this matter, and I have been unable to find a biblical interpretation. The only way I have to understand this matter is by experience and observation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FAMILY INVOLVEMENT AN ENTANGLEMENT</h2>
<p>According to human affections, it&rsquo;s really hard for anyone not to have his family involved in his career. If you have a business or some kind of enterprise, it is easy for your family to get involved in it. Nonetheless, in spiritual things family involvement is always an entanglement. The relationship among the apostles and among the elders and even among the churches should be absolutely and purely in the spirit. I do believe this is the basic reason that in the early days of the church and the work, the elders and particularly the apostles didn&rsquo;t bring in their families. When the family is brought into the church leadership, or into the work, there is a peril that the thing would not be so pure.</p>
<p>I have seen a few places&mdash;praise the Lord, not many&mdash;where the co-workers brought their family into the relationship with other saints. In some places also I have seen where the elders brought their families into relationships with others. Eventually, with not one exception, wherever there was such an involvement, there was suffering and loss.</p>
<p>Let me give you a real illustration. There was a church in which an elder had contacts with the brothers and sisters. These contacts led to a relationship between his family and theirs. A number of these brothers with their wives were willing to help this elder in church affairs, but not in a pure way. Eventually, this elder&rsquo;s home became a center for this kind of relationship. They termed it fellowship, but actually they went far beyond the limits of fellowship.</p>
<p>Some wives don&rsquo;t like to have others come into their home frequently. They like to keep their home free of so many contacts. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that they don&rsquo;t love the brothers and sisters. They love them, yet they like to keep a distance. However, there are also some sisters&mdash;not too many&mdash;who like to have people coming into their home. They like their family to be like a market, with the more people the better.</p>
<p>I have seen this happen. In every place where relationships among families have been too close, the church in that place has suffered a great loss. Why? Eventually that family actually rules, controls, the leadership. Actually, it was not the family; it was the wife. That wife controlled the leadership. This has happened in some places. The scale was quite large in some places. The larger the scale of such a practice, the more the church eventually suffers.</p>
<p>The point is this. In the eldership we must bear the responsibility in a very pure way. There must be purity in the motive, in the intention, in the procedures, and in all the doings related to the leadership.</p>
<p>It is always good to draw a clear line between the leadership and your family. It is not easy. Because you are one of those taking the lead, things will come to your attention at home. Then your wife or children can easily get involved. For the long run, it is always profitable to draw a clear line.</p><h2 class="head1">NO FRIENDSHIPS</h2>
<p>In all the years I knew Brother Nee, I can testify that he never had any family friends among the saints. He only had fellowship with the brothers; he never had friendship, even with the co-workers and elders. Furthermore, he never brought his relatives into the church leadership or into the work. As Mrs. Nee later testified, before they were married Brother Nee told her, &ldquo;I am taking you as my wife; I am not marrying you as a co-worker.&rdquo; All the time I was there and saw the situation, Mrs. Nee never came into the work. She was a good sister, but she was not brought into the work. Nor was she even a deaconess in the church. Brother Chang knows this quite well.</p>
<p>This is a serious matter. Apparently to have the family brought into the work is a help to us. Actually it doesn&rsquo;t help. Eventually it will cause great suffering. In some places I have seen a family influencing and even controlling. In some cases it went as far as controlling other places.</p>
<p>After seeing Brother Nee&rsquo;s example, I myself did my best not to have personal friendships or family friends among the saints. I practiced this while I was in Chefoo; I was there for quite a long time, and I tried purposely not to have a family friend. After that I was in Shanghai, then in Taiwan, and then I came to this country. In all these places I have not made friends. Through all these years I have been with you, you can realize I don&rsquo;t have any family friends. We have practiced this purposely. A number of saints did show their love to us with the expectation that we would go to their homes frequently and that they in turn would feel free to come to our home to help with the cooking and other things. We purposely closed the door to this. I do not mean that we have not needed the help of the saints. Quite often we have needed some help; but we closed the door to any kind of family relationship.</p>
<p>It is hard to be pure, and it is hard to be in the spirit, as long as the family is involved. Our relationship should only be spiritual with the co-workers, with the brothers, and with the other saints. It should be absolutely pure, and purely in the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUCCESSION IN THE ELDERSHIP</h2>
<p>The Bible doesn&rsquo;t give us a hint as to who were the successors of the apostles or of the elders. This is contrary to our human thought. We would expect&mdash;if we are a prevailing elder&mdash;that eventually our son or sons would be our successors in the eldership. But the Bible gives no hint that this ever happened. The succession is altogether up to the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty. It is not up to our choice or our preference. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that we should not perfect our children to grow in life and to serve the Lord in the church. That is another matter. But if we want to build up our children to be our successors, this is against the spiritual principle.</p>
<p>The same is true concerning the matter of salvation. If we can educate our children to be saved, if we think we can raise them so that they get saved, then where is predestination? Of course, some have gone too far to the other extreme, saying that it is all up to the Lord&rsquo;s predestination so we don&rsquo;t need to do anything; if the Lord has not chosen our children, they will not be saved whatever we do. That is another extreme. We must do our best to raise our children well, and we must do everything we can to help them to know the Lord. But eventually what will be is up to the Lord&rsquo;s sovereign grace.</p>
<p>In the Bible there are two sides. On the one side, the New Testament charges us, especially the leaders in the church, to take good care of the family, to manage or rule our home well (1 Tim. 3:4-5). On the other side, we cannot see any hint as to who was the successor of Peter, or of John, or the other apostles. Thus, we must not hold the concept of building up our children to be our successors; that is not scriptural. Some have said that Timothy was Paul&rsquo;s successor. I tell you the truth, Timothy was not. There is no comparison between what Paul did and what Timothy did. Timothy didn&rsquo;t do the same as Paul in the Lord&rsquo;s New Testament ministry. So, according to the New Testament, there is no human successor to the workers or to the elders.</p>
<p>We must stand in the middle, not to this side nor to that side. We must do our best to take care of our children, to teach them, and to raise them in the knowledge of the Lord. Of course we have to do this. Yet we must leave the outcome to His sovereignty, to His mercy, and to His grace.</p>
<p>But my point is this, brothers: in the Lord&rsquo;s work and in the church leadership, we have only the relationship in the spirit. Between the brothers and us there should be only the genuine fellowship, not friendship.</p><h2 class="head1">NO HONEY</h2>
<p>These days I have been working on the three Epistles of John. The last one does say, &ldquo;The friends greet you&rdquo; (3 John 14). And the Lord Jesus did say, &ldquo;Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep&rdquo; (John 11:11). There was a kind of friendship. But that friendship was a spiritual friendship; it was not based on natural affection. What I mean is this: natural affection should be kept aside. This is typified by the word not to put honey in the meal offering (Lev. 2:11). Natural affection is not that evil, like leaven; it is something sweet. Well, there must be no honey in the Lord&rsquo;s work, no honey in the church leadership. The relationships should be pure; the fellowship should be genuine, in the spirit.</p>
<p>We must avoid honey, natural affection, especially in the church responsibility. Once our family comes in, there is a real impureness. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that our wives and children shouldn&rsquo;t come into the Lord&rsquo;s interest. They should. But the line should be drawn. Some sisters may come to your home to help with the cooking in some instance, but you must draw a line. If you don&rsquo;t draw a line, you will have trouble. Sometimes such relationships can lead into sinful things like fornication. Draw a line.</p>
<p>In human society there are always some who are fond of helping others. Since you are a leader, they would especially like to help you. Since you are a leading one in this kind of work in society, if they are allowed to help you, they feel honored. Don&rsquo;t take advantage of their offers to help. Do not allow this kind of thing to come in. It comes in mostly through the family.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DELICATE SURGERY</h2>
<p>I hope my word is clear to you all. It involves a lot of things. You have to understand it in a very clear-cut way. You have to be a surgeon. In doing surgery, you must be discerning in order to know which part to keep and which part to cut off. It is not that we reject all the brothers and sisters from coming to contact us. We need to have contact with the saints. In a positive sense, the elders should be those who are open to others, who easily contact others, and who are easily approachable. If you are not this way, you cannot effectively carry out your responsibility. Yet there is a peril. You must draw a line, allowing the relationship to go only so far. I can testify that many times the saints would have liked to have further contact with us, but we stopped it. If we had wanted to, we could have gone further. Then, however, they and we would both have fallen into a relationship which would not have been healthy to our spiritual life nor to the church life nor to the work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING NATURAL AFFECTION</h2>
<p>Suppose one of you brothers comes to fellowship with me. That is fine. But after many times of fellowshipping together, there will be the peril that the two families might get involved. His wife will come in, and so will my wife. Here is the peril. That is why we must draw the line. We can only go so far to have fellowship in the spirit; if we go further, we fall into natural affection.</p>
<p>The churches have been in the same localities for a long time. The longer we stay in the same place, the easier it is for all of us to become involved with certain families and to develop a natural affection for them. Even if you have saints staying with you, you have to draw a line. Do not let that hospitality bring in a kind of natural affection. Regardless of how long the guests are there with you, keep a distance. Otherwise, whatever you do for the Lord will be damaged by your natural affection. The only thing to be built up is the spiritual fellowship. There should be no natural affection, no friendship. We who are co-workers should be intimate brothers, yet still not friends.</p>
<p>All these years I have never built up a friendship with anyone. You might consider me a cold person. I may be; I don&rsquo;t know. Yet I do realize that the Lord has been preserving me from trouble. When I look into the past, I thank Him. If I had developed some friendships, I surely would have gotten into trouble and would have suffered because of it.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT THROUGH PRAYER</h1>
<p>&ldquo;And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, See, I have called by name Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all workmanship, to devise skillful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all workmanship. And I, behold, I have given with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of everyone that is wisehearted I have given wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you (lit.)&rdquo; (Exo. 31:1-6).</p>
<p>These verses, which we covered in a recent Life-study on Exodus, have a good point for us to consider. I would especially like to talk about verse 3.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD</h2>
<p>The elders or the leading ones in the church responsibility are those most in need of the constant infilling of the Spirit of God. No need to say to build the New Testament church, even to build the Old Testament tabernacle the record in Exodus stresses strongly the infilling of the Spirit of God. Yes, there is a difference between the New and the Old Testaments, yet in the reality of God&rsquo;s economy there is no difference. What we need today they needed in ancient times.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT&mdash;GOD REACHING US</h2>
<p>Actually the tabernacle was designed by God Himself. Yet&mdash;here is a basic principle&mdash;the tabernacle was not built by Him directly. It was built by His people, who were filled with Him, that is, with His Spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit of God is God Himself. Don&rsquo;t think of God as in the heavens and sending His Spirit down to earth to enter into the designers to do the work. It was not that way. Whenever God reached man, He was the Spirit. Even today what is the Spirit of God? It is God reaching us. When He reaches us the very reaching God is the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BURDEN</h2>
<p>What I would like to share with you brothers is this: to take the lead in the church life requires the infilling of God Himself. We need the infilling of the Triune God. As you know, the Spirit today is much, much richer than the Spirit of God in Old Testament times; but the principle is the same.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FIRST A WILLING HEART</h2>
<p>You may say that in the case of Bezalel and Oholiab, God initiated the matter of filling them with Himself. It may be so, but I have a doubt. I believe these two dear ones had a seeking heart. When they learned that God was going to have a dwelling place built on this earth, I believe that they began to have a heart to seek for wisdom to design what would be needed. No doubt Moses saw every part while he was on the mountain; the Bible says that God showed him the pattern (Exo. 25:40; Heb. 8:5). He saw the things, and he took down a record of the measurements. Even Moses himself, strange to say, did not have the wisdom to design what he had seen, what he had been charged with. It was Bezalel and Oholiab who received the wisdom to make the designs. I think their designs must have been checked by Moses. He must have said, &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s the same as I saw on the mount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two of them, I believe, began to have a heart of willingness to work for God&rsquo;s dwelling place and therefore sought the wisdom to design what was needed. In principle it is the same today in the church life. If you do not have a heart to seek after the Lord&rsquo;s mind, to pick up the burden for the church life, God has no way to initiate anything with you. God&rsquo;s initiation begins with your willingness.</p>
<p>This is why 1 Timothy 3:1 says, &ldquo;If anyone aspires to oversight, he desires a good work.&rdquo; This aspiring is no doubt the initiation God has worked out within you.</p><h2 class="head1">ABANDONING YOUR NATURAL CAPABILITY</h2>
<p>But suppose you are Bezalel: you have the willingness to do something for God&rsquo;s building. But you must realize that your natural capability has to be altogether abandoned. Your willingness is worthwhile, but your ability is worthless. God treasures your willingness, which He initiated, but your capability&mdash;what you can do, what you know&mdash;in God&rsquo;s estimation means nothing. If you will reject your ability, this abandonment will give God the ground to come in and fill you. First you need the willingness; then God needs your openness.</p>
<p>According to my observation, some of the elders by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy have had the willingness. But in the eldership they brought in their capability, their knowledge, their education, and their strength. This damages the entire job. On the one hand, willingness is really valuable; but on the other hand, the natural capability must be discounted, even entirely abandoned.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXAMPLE OF MOSES</h2>
<p>When Moses was young, he had the willingness to be used by God to do something for his people, who were under the tyranny of Pharaoh. Moses&rsquo; willingness was initiated by God, perhaps while he was still a teenager. But when he grew up, he went out and by his own hand killed an Egyptian. He acted from his own ability. God could not use him. Why? He had the willingness, but he didn&rsquo;t have the openness. God, as we all know, spent forty years to empty or unload him, until he was fully deprived by God and was absolutely empty. He became just a shepherd in the wilderness, thinking he did not know anything and could not do anything. But God came in. God came in to give the unique vision. As you know, he saw a bush burning but not consumed. That bush was Moses. The vision meant that God would use him, but that He would not burn the fire with Moses&rsquo; fuel. Whatever you have God will not use.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EMPTYING YOURSELF</h2>
<p>God will use only you, not what you have or can do. Therefore, you must empty yourself. To empty yourself means to have an absolute openness to God. The real openness to God means emptiness. You may say you are open, but you are filled. A jar may be open, but it may be filled with sand. You may say that you are open to the Lord. You may be open, but you are not empty. There has never been an unloading. What part of you needs to be unloaded? Your capability, your knowledge, your wisdom, your education. It is only when you are empty that God can come in to fill you. When God fills you, it is His Spirit who fills you.</p>
<p>We in the leadership of the church life do have the willingness. There is no problem with this point. The problem is that we are not emptied and therefore cannot be filled with the Triune God as the filling Spirit today. The problem is our education, our knowledge, our experience. Some of you have been in the leadership for over fifteen years; you have had many experiences. But even real experiences of the church life have to be emptied out. Every day, all the time, you and I in the leadership of the churches need to be freshly filled with the Triune God.</p>
<p>Do you believe that the Spirit of God filled Bezalel and Oholiab just once for all? I believe that all the time, every minute, they were being filled. In other words, they were really one with God. God cannot build His dwelling place by Himself; He can do it only through willing and empty vessels. Whether the church is living and fresh and enriched depends on this one thing: that we are being filled continuously with the Triune God. For this, dear brothers, we need firstly the willingness and secondly the emptiness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING CONTINUOUSLY</h2>
<p>The third thing we need is the instant, constant prayer. We must pray. If we are able to do things, we don&rsquo;t need to pray much. We have confidence, we have knowledge, we have a way, we have ability, we have strength: we are certain we can handle the situation. We need to empty ourselves, knowing that whatever we can do is not counted; it is not only rejected but even condemned by God. Whatever the old man can do is condemned by God. We have to realize this. Then we shall see our need of God and will pray constantly and instantly.</p><h2 class="head1">SETTING AN EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>Elders in the church are not a special class; they do not have a special rank. They are normal believers. They are not leaders, but they take the lead. They are patterns of all believers. In organized Christianity, in both Catholicism and Protestantism, bishops are considered to be of extraordinary rank; then elders and deacons are considered to be of lower rank. Such ranking is wrong. But this kind of human thought may have invaded us already; we may have in our understanding the thought that we have the rank of elders, that we are a special class. No! Elders are just normal believers; they simply set a pattern for the rest of the believers to follow.</p>
<p>Thus, when the Bible tells us that all believers should pray unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17), the elders should set an example. All that the New Testament charges the believers to do, the elders should do. Not all believers can fulfill all the charges, but the elders should. Since you are taking the lead, you should carry out all that is commanded by God; all believers may not be able to do this, but you should.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WILLING, EMPTY, PRAYING</h2>
<p>Do not think that your teaching in itself will help others. Nor can I trust in my teaching to help you. If you are short of willingness, short of emptiness, short of prayer, I cannot help you. Nor can you be of help to others. We all need these three things. &ldquo;Lord, by Your mercy I am willing. In Your grace I am empty. I am open to You with utter emptiness. I do not want to hold on to anything of my past experiences. I want to be fresh.&rdquo; All the time, unceasingly, pray to be filled with Him. Then you will experience wisdom, understanding, and knowledge coming to you like a tide. You will be under the flooding of divine wisdom, divine understanding, and divine knowledge. You will know how to contact the saints with the divine nature, how to supply them with Christ, how to build them up with the redemption of Christ and with God&rsquo;s judgment. You will also have an inner ability to build up the saints in transformation and in the church life; not just to build them in character, but to build them up as a dwelling place for God.</p>
<p>If talks like this are to be of help, they only avail when you are willing and empty and praying. If you are short of this constant prayer, I assure you that you will be very poor in the leadership. To be rich in the leadership, we need a willingness, an emptiness, and continuous prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MANY THINGS TO BE DROPPED</h2>
<p>We have brought many things into the leadership that we need to get rid of. The longer we have been in the leadership, the more of these things we unconsciously have. Yet we do not realize those things need to be condemned. If, however, we are willing to bear responsibility for the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place, and if we open to the Lord with complete emptiness and pray continuously, God will surely fill us up. Then we will discover all these things, and we will be enabled to let them go. We need a further, wider, deeper evacuation.</p>
<p>One of these things, which you have picked up through the years and which you must drop, is the way you are related to others. Your fellowship with the saints is not even. You have your choice, your preference: you like to fellowship with this one, and you avoid having fellowship with that one. Thus, your fellowship is biased, unhealthy, not genuine. Your personal taste, your personal preference, is hidden there. That is honey, which in typology was not to be added to the meal offering (Lev. 2:11). Sooner or later it will corrupt your leadership or the church life. What is needed is salt (Lev. 2:13).</p>
<p>In a doctrinal way it is easy to understand these things, but in practice it is only as you are open with complete emptiness to the Lord and praying continuously, that you will recognize how much honey you have brought in. You must put an end to that. Then you will know how much salt you need to add, and you will be able by exercising in a strong way to add the right amount of salt. Then your leadership will be pure, or purified, and there will be no corruption in it. Teaching cannot help much with this; only the very God who fills you can do this work.</p>
<p>I believe we have all had some experience of this. Whenever we have been emptied and are in a prayerful spirit, if we stand up in the church meeting, we are aware, and all the other saints are also aware, that we are living, fresh, and rich. Other times we may stand up and share a lot, but the congregation has the feeling that it is from the old man, that it is empty. When we contact others, we may speak the same word, talk about the same point, but sometimes there is a result and other times it is lifeless. It is when we are willing and empty and continuously praying that we have the wisdom to work in the divine nature and to minister to the needy ones the very Christ they need, not just minister in a general way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP OR DISCUSSION?</h2>
<p>When the elders come together, they should pray, not just discuss things. You like to call it fellowship, but maybe it is only a discussion. The elders need to pray: to pray their mind, their different understandings, into the oneness. Rightly speaking, you should pray yourselves into the spirit. When you are praying in the spirit, you have one mind; you are in oneness. Whenever you meet together, you should pray yourselves into the spirit.</p>
<p>Even in shepherding, in visiting others either the unsaved or the saints, we should be constantly in prayer. We have all experienced that if we pray continuously, when we go we do not speak what we thought we would. We find ourselves saying things we had no intention to say; what we say is new. By being in continuous prayer, our spirit is released, and we will find that we speak from our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SHORT OF PRAYER&mdash;SHORT OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The crucial lack is this continuous prayer on the part of all the elders, whatever the locality. You are short of prayer, so you are short of the Spirit. It is when you are fully condemned in your prayer that you receive wisdom and the real understanding of the Lord concerning the situation, concerning people, and concerning the church.</p>
<p>The Christian life is a life of prayer. Elders are not extraordinary Christians. To be a proper elder is to be a normal Christian. Many Christians are abnormal. Thus the elders should set up a normal pattern, giving the saints a normal lead. In this way the church can be built up. Try to practice this, looking to the Lord for His mercy and grace.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>

<h1 class="title">TRUMPETING THE ONENESS AND<br />
LIVING CHRIST</h1>
<p>While I was in Houston for the Chinese-speaking conference, I got quite a burden for the Chinese population, especially the Christians. It seems there is very little light; the sky is cloudy, foggy, and smoggy. I have heard that there are between twenty-five and thirty thousand Chinese in the Houston area. Most of these have come within the last ten years. Even among such a small population, there are some twenty-five to thirty Christian groups. It seems anyone is free and has the right to set up a group. I heard of a division that happened because a small number in a group wanted to put more emphasis on preaching the gospel. When the others in the group were not in agreement, those concerned about the gospel left and formed their own group. It was so easy. It seems there is no one to trumpet the oneness of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>I also have the impression from what I have heard that the activities of some of these Christian groups are mainly social. Probably a number of their attendants are not even saved. In such a place the church must be very strong and shining.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ONENESS</h2>
<p>We must blow the trumpet that the Body of Christ is one and that in any locality the expression of this Body as the church must also be one. There is no excuse for Christians to be divided.</p>
<p>Brothers, we ourselves need to learn, and then we need to train the saints in the recovery, how to preach this. We must point out that Christians should not be divided. Any division&mdash;big or small, old or new&mdash;is wrong. Catholicism, denominations, and free groups are all divisions. We must condemn division. But it is unwise to make a point of saying, without an adequate explanation to people, that only we who are on the local church ground are the churches and all who are not on this ground are not churches. We should avoid any talk that makes the sky cloudy by stirring up argument. We must learn to present the truth in a clear and prevailing way, leaving no loophole for the other side to argue or reject.</p>
<p>In presenting the truth, our understanding, expression, and wording must be strong. We should have long talks with outsiders about the oneness of the church. From Matthew 16:18 on to the book of Revelation we can point out that the church should be one. Upon this oneness we can challenge their divisions. Can they justify division? Why were they meeting with some others a short time ago and now there is a split? Why didn&rsquo;t they stay with that group? The church in Houston could even write a tract along this line and have the saints distribute it. Mail it as well. What is the use of vain complaining about divisions? You brothers, especially those from Houston, should do something. The Chinese saints in the church should do something. Pray together and write a tract. You may even print some posters and put them up in places where it is allowed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A TWOFOLD TESTIMONY</h2>
<p>What I saw and heard during the Chinese-speaking conference surely confirms my concern; that is, the recovery of the Lord must be strong and shining in two things. One is that the recovery is a recovery of God&rsquo;s genuine expression. The other is the excellency of Christ&mdash;His superiority, His glory, His riches, and His expression. These are not superficial truths.</p>
<p>Brothers, as the leading ones in the local churches, you all need to get into these truths, experience them, and be trained to preach them to others. But this presenting of the deeper truths must be common to all the saints. Not only the elders can do it; even the sisters can. We must endeavor to take care of this matter.</p>
<p>The New Testament shows us that all the believers are lights in the world (Phil. 2:15) and that every local church is a lampstand (Rev. 1:20). Wherever we are, we should shine. Individually and collectively we should shine. The sky is dark because the light doesn&rsquo;t shine. No matter how small our number is, even if there are only ten, our locality should be enlightened.</p>
<p>Just to meet on the ground, to pray in the spirit, and to live in the spirit I feel is not adequate. We must also sound the trumpet and shine forth the light. In the early years of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in China, the trumpet was loud; the testimony was clear. There was an atmosphere of spirituality. We were opposed, but the opposers could not deny that we had a high standard of spirituality. Though our numbers were small, we brought such an atmosphere into the community.</p>
<p>We must live a life full of Christ. When we say division is wrong, there should be weight to our words; the divisive ones should be able to see that we do have a measure of Christ. We are not speaking lightly, vainly. They know that we have given up the world and rejected ourselves and that we live Christ. We must be a living testimony; we should not be so quiet and so lacking in influence. We should be spiritually &ldquo;contagious.&rdquo; Paul, you know, was accused of being &ldquo;a pestilent fellow&rdquo; (Acts 24:5). The Jews implied that wherever he went, pestilence followed! I feel that Houston has no &ldquo;pestilence&rdquo;! You brothers in Houston, especially the Chinese, should be a strong pestilence. Go out to spread the truth. At the same time, you should live a testimony. This testimony is the testimony of Jesus; it is the embodiment of the Triune God; it is the lampstand.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h2>
<p>What is God&rsquo;s ordained way for Christians to have a meeting? It is one church, one city. The meeting that is set up must keep the oneness. To set up a meeting which does not keep the oneness is to increase division and confusion. What is confusion? Anything that is done contrary to God&rsquo;s ordained way is confusion. The only thing that keeps us from confusion is the way ordained by God.</p>
<p>I feel the churches in the recovery should accept a commission to sound the trumpet, declaring to those in darkness that division is not only unscriptural but altogether abominable. A division is an abomination in the eyes of God.</p>
<p>Some may argue, saying, &ldquo;Why do you condemn us? We love the Lord, we preach the gospel, we study the Bible, and we try to serve the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We can answer, &ldquo;Why do you do so many things to please God, yet you do not care about being one?&rdquo; You may mention John 17:21, &ldquo;That they all may be one,&rdquo; and Ephesians 4:1-3, where the first item in a walk worthy of God is to keep the oneness.</p>
<p>We need to study John 17:21-23 and Ephesians 4:1-6, and we need to train the saints. Perhaps in the prayer meeting we can take fifteen minutes to teach the saints how to sound the trumpet. At the Lord&rsquo;s table we can take a half hour to train the saints to speak on the oneness of the children of God. We ourselves need to learn to sound the trumpet, and we need to train all the saints to do so too. We should not be so quiet. We should be watchmen, alerting people, not letting them sleep so peacefully. There are many ways to do this, such as passing out tracts and making phone calls to those we know.</p>
<p>In addition, to support what we say, we need a life that is the testimony of Jesus. We should live a life that is of the highest standard. Then, even though our words are rejected outwardly, inwardly those who reject will respect us. They will recognize that our words carry weight, that we have a living testimony, that we are the lampstand. The church in a locality should be shining. It is this shining that will convince those who would otherwise reject.</p>
<p>Isaiah says, &ldquo;Ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not silence, and give him no rest&rdquo; (62:6-7). We are to bother the Lord, praying, calling on Him, asking Him to do something. Just as we give the Lord no peace, so we should give those in the divisions no peace. I surely would like it if, after one month&rsquo;s time, the entire Chinese community is discussing among themselves the matter of the oneness and the matter of the lampstand. I felt sad when I was in Houston. The Chinese there seem to be living in a backward country. It is dark; the spirituality is low. They seem to have no idea about spirituality. The church should be shining, trumpeting, speaking out, so that they have no peace.</p>
<p>If you ask about the Spanish-speaking and the English-speaking, I would say this should be true of them too. Brothers, we have the truth. We have the light. And we have the capital: the Spirit, the life, the church, and Christ. Why are we so silent?</p>
<p>We should live Christ before others, and every day we should preach the truth to them. We can tell them, &ldquo;You need Christ; you need to be regenerated.&rdquo; After a time they may be saved. If we just keep silent, the darkness will remain. If we rise up and sound the trumpet of the truth, the light will spread and the darkness will be scattered.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING</h1>
<h2 class="head1">A DEVELOPING MINISTRY</h2>
<p>I am grateful to the Lord that when I was young and seeking after biblical knowledge, He sovereignly brought me into touch with the Brethren teachings. That surely laid a good foundation for me. In 1932 I began to give three or four messages a week. In the first two or three years, my ministry of the Word was largely based on their teachings. Before too long, however, my messages began to improve. From the base of the Brethren teachings, I improved to the inner life. There was not too much difference, but at least I had a beginning of a change. Then I was helped by Brother Nee to see Christ and the church. That was a real turn in my life. From 1934, at the latest, my ministry of the Word was focused on Christ and the church. That ministry lasted eight or nine years and was much blessed by the Lord. One result was the revival that came in 1943.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Tree of Life</h2>
<p>Due to that revival I was persecuted. Christianity joined with the invading army of Japan to persecute me. The Japanese military police put me into prison for a month. Then I became sick. During the two and a half years which followed, I was ill and suffered much. At that time I began to see the tree of life. That was a fresh beginning in my ministry of the Word. As soon as I was well enough, I began to speak on the tree of life, on the two trees. The light came. The ministry in those years (1946 to 1948) served the Lord&rsquo;s purpose. Then in the spring of 1949 I was sent out from the mainland of China to the island of Taiwan, and I brought this light on the tree of life with me.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit</h2>
<p>After I got to Taiwan, I began to see another crucial point, that is, the Spirit. Of course, I knew the Spirit long before, but I didn&rsquo;t realize that the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God. Though I had stressed the importance of the experience of the Spirit, before 1950 I didn&rsquo;t see that the Spirit is the consummation, not just the third of the Trinity.</p>
<p>At first, however, I did not have the expression, &ldquo;the consummation of the Triune God.&rdquo; This particular term came to me not too long ago. But in 1950 I realized this without having the full expression. From that time in my ministry I had a great turn to the Spirit. If you check my writings in both Chinese and English, you will see that their focus in the past thirty-four years is actually the Spirit. By 1960 and 1961 my emphasis was altogether the Spirit. During that time I wrote over eighty hymns, most of which have been translated and are in our present hymnal. A good number of them are on the Spirit.</p>
<p>At the end of 1961 I came to the United States. The ministry of the Word in this country began with this focus on the Spirit. In the early years in nearly every conference and training I stressed two things: the ground of the church and the Spirit. I pointed out the Spirit from all the New Testament books. Then in 1969 at the conference in Erie, Pennsylvania, the light came concerning the seven Spirits. After that conference I went back to Los Angeles and we had a conference there, mainly on the seven Spirits.</p>
<p>The light has kept coming concerning the Spirit. If you trace from 1969 till now, within these fourteen years, you will see that the light has mostly been on the Spirit. Quite a number of new terms have come in during this time: the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God, the all-inclusive Spirit, the compound Spirit, the processed Spirit, and the Spirit of the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>In 1953 and 1954 I began to see that the Spirit includes both divinity and Christ&rsquo;s humanity, including His living on earth, the effectiveness of His death, and the power of His resurrection. I saw the compound ointment in Exodus 30. My messages were a shock to the co-workers. How could I say that there were elements in the Spirit? It was an altogether new thought to them.</p><h2 class="head2">Mingling</h2>
<p>Probably from 1950 the light began to come about mingling. In the inner life teachings of past centuries, the main word used to describe our relationship with God is the word union. However, through the experience of the divine revelation in the Bible concerning the Triune God being our life, I came to realize that our relationship with God is not just a union; it is a mingling.</p>
<p>Then I began to see that the thought was there in typology. In Leviticus 2:4 we are told that the meal offering was made of fine flour mingled with oil. When I first began to minister on the matter of mingling, I didn&rsquo;t realize the word was mentioned in typology; I thought it was a new term used in my message. It was later that I saw that mingling is found in typology.</p>
<p>When I was opposed for saying that we are mingled with God, I tried to find out why some opposed. In the early centuries there were some teachers who saw from the Bible, and I believe from their experience also, that there is such a thing as mingling. Because their teaching stirred up so much debate, however, the term was dropped and the word union was used all the time. I believe some of those who oppose us do so based upon this history.</p>
<p>The more I ministered on the matter of mingling, the more I got strengthened. The Lord being food and drink to us implies strongly the thought of mingling. Whatever you eat and drink mingles with your physical being. The eating of the tree of life and the drinking of the water of life from the throne of God illustrate God&rsquo;s mingling with His redeemed people to the uttermost for eternity. So, I fully believe that the thought of mingling is scriptural; there is the need for such ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF THE PAST MINISTRY</h2>
<p>The issue of these more than twenty years of ministering the Word with the focus on the Spirit is the matter of the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>Mingling is based upon dispensing. If God does not dispense Himself into us, there is no mingling. This dispensing is by the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In this dispensing, the Spirit as the very consummation of the Triune God is crucial. The Father is embodied in the Son; the Son is realized as the Spirit. All three, therefore, are consummated in the Spirit.</p>
<p>For what purpose is the Spirit the consummation of the Triune God? It is that He may dispense Himself into us. This dispensing is in accordance with His dispensation (Gk. <em>oikonomia,</em> arrangement or plan); it is not an accident. He does it according to His arrangement, His system, His household administration. God, according to such a dispensation, dispenses Himself all the time to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Means of Dispensing Himself</h2>
<p>To do this, God uses two means, two instruments. The first is outward: the Bible, that is, the Word. The second is inward: the Spirit, which is just God Himself. These are the two great gifts God has given us.</p>
<p>There are two sister portions by Paul in the New Testament. Ephesians 5:18 says that we should be filled in spirit. Colossians 3:16 says we should be filled with the Word (&ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly&rdquo;). These are sister portions, telling us we should be filled with the Spirit and with the Word.</p>
<p>To bring the saints under God&rsquo;s dispensing we must stress two things: the inward gift, that is, the Spirit, and the outward gift, that is, the Word, the Bible. Especially we who are leading ones in the churches must have adequate experience of the inward Spirit. Actually, the inward Spirit is simply the practical God within us. God could not be present and practical if He were not such a processed, all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, compound Spirit. If God has not become such a Spirit to us, then He is just objective, an external object; He is not practical, and we cannot experience Him.</p><h2 class="head2">John Fourteen</h2>
<p>The clearest writing in the New Testament regarding this, especially in John&rsquo;s writings, is John 14 through 17. Even after all the messages I have given in Stuttgart and New York concerning the divine dispensing as revealed in these chapters, I still feel the burden has not gone. Probably we need more messages.</p>
<p>In chapter fourteen the Lord begins by saying, &ldquo;I go to prepare a place for you...that where I am you also may be&rdquo; (vv. 2-3). Then He goes on to say that He is the only way to the Father (v. 6); in fact, He continues, He is in the Father and the Father is in Him (v. 10). We can express this relationship by saying that He and the Father coexist and coinhere.</p>
<p>Now the question is, for what purpose? The single purpose is that God may dispense Himself into His chosen people. To do this, He must be the Father. He must also be the Son. Eventually He must also be the Spirit. These are not three gods. God must be the Father as the source, the Son as the course (the means), and the Spirit as the reaching (the application, the entering in).</p>
<p>Thus, the Lord firstly told His disciples that He is in the Father and the Father is in Him; when He speaks, the Father does His works (v. 10). After this He said, &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter...the Spirit of reality...He abides with you and shall be in you&rdquo; (vv. 16-17). The background to the Lord&rsquo;s word here is that the disciples were concerned about His leaving them, because He had said He was going to the Father (v. 12). The Lord was telling them they did not need to be concerned about His absence. He would ask the Father to send them another Comforter who would be with them and also in them.</p>
<p>Then He continues, &ldquo;I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you&rdquo; (v. 18). His going was His coming. &ldquo;Yet a little while and...you behold Me; because I live, you shall live also&rdquo; (v. 19). What He means here is that because He resurrects, the disciples also will resurrect with Him and in Him. &ldquo;In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&rdquo; (v. 20).</p>
<p>When we put all these verses together, we can see the Father in the Son and the Son coming with the Father as the Spirit to be in us. For what purpose? For dispensing. This is a great thing. It is the real center of the Bible.</p>
<p>The dispensing comes about by the Spirit within and also through the Word without. Because the dispensing is invisible, intangible, and mysterious, we cannot apprehend it without the Word. Along with the Spirit, we need the Word. If we cannot apprehend, then we cannot experience. For our experience we need the apprehension. This apprehension is through the Bible, the Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD IN EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>Yes, the Spirit is within us. But if we don&rsquo;t have the revelation from the Word so that we apprehend this, we cannot experience His indwelling. We, the leading ones, must experience the inner Spirit, the indwelling Spirit, to the uttermost. We are too loose, too indifferent. Every day I find I must confess to the Lord that I have not applied the Spirit enough, that I haven&rsquo;t walked in the Spirit sufficiently. God as the Spirit is here within us right now, but we don&rsquo;t experience Him. Then when we minister, we don&rsquo;t have the riches; the riches are simply the experience of the bountiful Spirit.</p>
<p>We must also get into the Word to the uttermost. Because of our Christian background, we have understood the Bible in an altogether superficial way. We may love the Bible and study it, but we don&rsquo;t have the habit, the desire, the aspiration to dig into its depths. We must overcome the shallowness in studying the Word. Spend some time to study how the Lord expounded the Bible in the four Gospels. Consider His way: it is always deep. Paul the apostle was the same: his way of expounding Exodus and Leviticus in Hebrews is profound.</p>
<p>Experience the Spirit to the uttermost and get into the depths of the Word to the uttermost. Then you will surely have the riches to minister to the saints, and we shall have, using Paul&rsquo;s term, the full knowledge of the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR SKILL IN PRESENTING THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>We may know the truth, yet when we present it, we lack skill. When a question is raised by either an opposer or a seeking one, we should present the truth to him as it is indicated in the Bible. We are short of the skill to do this properly. With so much truth in the recovery, it should have a significant influence on America. We have seven thousand. Think how much cargo a big corporation could dispense if it had seven thousand salesmen. It seems, however, that we have a lot of cargo sitting in the warehouse! We know this cargo is there, but we don&rsquo;t know how to make use of it.</p>
<p>We should practice, then, these two things: the inner experience of the Spirit and the outer study of the Word. Exercise to pick up the skill to present the truth to others and to help the saints in our meetings and in our fellowship. We want to emphasize these two matters. Both of them are for the divine dispensation.</p>
<p>Without the divine dispensing, there will be no church. Christianity is not the church; it is only an empty shell. We will be the same if we don&rsquo;t have the divine dispensing within us daily. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, this dispensing must be the central thing, so that we are being continually filled with Him.</p></body></html>
