<p>Many brothers are still not willing to learn lessons. They lack resolution and perseverance. For example, we have heard about the skill to labor, observed how others labor, and we have labored; however, we still are not skilled, because our heart is not set to learn in a deep way. We know how to preach the gospel, but the way that we preach is not so effective. We may all know how to do something, but how much you know is different from how much I know. Different degrees of knowing make some workers skilled and others not as skilled. We all know how to preach the gospel, but some of us are determined to learn in a deep way and others are not.</p>
<p>Some workers do not have the skill to preach the gospel, give a message, lead the saints, or fellowship with the saints. Hence, their work is average. They are not effective when they minister the word, preach the gospel, or help the saints. We should not continue to labor in this way. Spiritual labor requires much skill. The workers who are most capable are the ones who are willing to spend much time and effort to learn. We should not think that we can gain something by taking shortcuts. We should never take shortcuts to learn a skill. The only way to learn a skill is to have a strong resolve and to persevere and endeavor to learn.</p>
<p>When I was at Honor Oak, I noticed that the believers were encouraged to be spiritual, but they were not given the opportunity to manifest their function in the meetings, they did not receive practical training, nor did they have the opportunity to serve. When the saints came together, they only listened to messages. Most of the time Brother T. Austin-Sparks spoke, and the rest listened. Brother Sparks has a portion from the Lord and renders much help to others, but he does not give others the opportunity to learn to serve.</p>
<p>I stayed with them for more than a month but did not meet many elders. It did not seem as if the elders have much work, because they met only once during that month. Brother T. Austin-Sparks asked me to speak in almost every meeting. He may have done this because we asked him to speak in every meeting when he was here. Before the meeting the elders met together and prayed on their knees for twenty to thirty minutes. Sometimes Brother Sparks also made arrangements for practical matters.</p>
<p>I observed brothers and sisters who have a heart to learn spiritual things, but they were not given the opportunity to serve. Some of them are called by the Lord and should go out to labor, but there are no arrangements for them to go, and they do not receive any confirmation. The answer they received was to seek the Lord further and see how He leads them. Eventually, they do not know what to do.</p>
<p>This is the reason that I released a message concerning the need to manifest our function for the building up of the church. I pointed out that instead of replacing the saints, the gifted members should perfect the saints to manifest their function. I also said that the gifted saints should not hold everything in their hands. They should give every saint an opportunity to practice. I emphasized many times the matter of giving everyone an opportunity to learn and practice. In our physical body every member requires exercise. A child begins to crawl when it is ten months old. Then he learns to stand and then to walk.</p>
<p>My last meeting with the whole congregation was a week before my departure. The meeting was open for everyone to ask questions. Brother Sparks was the moderator, and he encouraged the brothers and sisters to grasp the opportunity to ask questions. A brother said that they were taught that function comes from the growth in life; consequently, they were taught that there was no need to practice. He asked whether growth and practice were contradictory. This question indicated that there was a response to the messages that I had given concerning the building. In my answer I said that life is definitely needed. We can give a dog or a cat lessons on pronunciation, but a dog will always bark and a cat will always meow. A cat will always sound like a cat, and a dog will always sound like a dog. Neither can speak like a human. This is according to their growth in life.</p>
<p>I then gave another example and said that I am in my fifties and am quite experienced, but my English is not as fluent as an eight-year-old boy in England. This is not a matter of life but of training. If I grew up in a British family, I would speak excellent English, even though I am Chinese. My English is poor because I did not have the opportunity to practice.</p>
<p>Their reaction to my response indicated that my answer was different from what they were taught. After this illustration, I did not feel that it was necessary to speak further. My intention was to show that we would be limited in our work if we focused only on life and ignored practical training. We should never think that we are a slow learner and therefore cannot preach the gospel or give a message. Except for those who are born dumb, everyone is able to speak. How we speak depends on whether we are willing to make an effort to learn and practice.</p>
<p>Before I left Honor Oak I gave another message on the three <em>T</em> books, which are 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus. I said that there are two lines in the Epistles. One line, from the book of Romans to 2 Thessalonians, shows that Christ is our life and that the church comes out of Christ as a product of Christ. Even though we know that the church is out of Christ and is in Christ, we may not know how to take care of the church. We may know that there are elders in the church, but we may not know the function of the elders. We may also know that there are deacons in the church, but we may not know the function of the deacons.</p>
<p>This is the reason that there is a second line in the Epistles, the three <em>T</em> books, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus. The general subject of these three books concerns how we should conduct ourselves in the house of God. In 1 Timothy 3:15 Paul said, &ldquo;If I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God.&rdquo; In these three books the apostle presents the qualifications of the elders and how elders are appointed, the qualifications of the deacons and how they are chosen, and how to treat the saints of different ages.</p>
<p>These three books say that we should learn, practice, train, and teach. If we read these books, we will find the words <em>learn, closely followed my teaching, knowing from which ones you have learned them,</em> and <em>you have heard from me</em> (1 Tim. 2:11; 5:4; 2 Tim. 3:10, 14; 1:13; 2:2). Paul even charged Timothy to commit what he learned to faithful men who could teach others also (v. 2). Paul did not speak much concerning life or spiritual things in these three books. Instead, he spoke much concerning learning, teaching, exercising, and practical arrangements. He said, &ldquo;Exercise yourself unto godliness&rdquo; (1 Tim. 4:7). This is the second line of the apostle&rsquo;s fellowship in the Epistles.</p>
<p>We should not focus only on one line. We need to be filled with Christ, take Christ as everything, and see that the church is Christ. However, if we know only this line but not the second line, we will encounter problems. What should we do when we are filled with Christ, and how should we conduct ourselves in the house of God? We need the three <em>T</em> books to see the aspect of practical training. These books are full of arrangements, even concerning trivial matters. Paul said, &ldquo;The cloak which I left in Troas with Carpus, bring when you come, and the scrolls, especially the parchments...Be diligent to come before winter&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:13, 21). These are practical arrangements that are not the result of the growth in life. Timothy could be spiritual and speak of life, but here Paul said that he should bring the parchments. This proves that the divine life, without training, is not sufficient in the administration of the church. There must also be practical arrangements.</p>
<p>The apostle made many arrangements. He seemed to say, &ldquo;Timothy, find believers who are competent and teach them what I taught you so that they can teach others.&rdquo; This is an arrangement and a training. Hence, we should not trust only in the gifts of life. There is no problem with the divine life, but we do not have enough learning. We have not made sufficient effort to learn. Therefore, we should not say that we are not as talented as Brother So-and-so or Sister So-and-so and that we will give up because we lack spiritual gifts. If we are not willing to learn, our situation will definitely become worse over time. We were called by God and have consecrated ourselves to Him. Hence, we should be desperate to learn. If we do not learn and are not skilled in our work, we will cause the Lord&rsquo;s work to suffer loss.</p>
<p>Some workers in the past were not serious in their service; however, we must be serious and learn earnestly. After this trip abroad I have much feeling. Many elementary school students study until eleven o&rsquo;clock at night and get up in the morning earlier than their parents. By seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning they are ready for school, and they do not return home until six in the evening. It is not easy for elementary school students, because if they do not study hard, they will not pass the entrance examination for middle school. If the workers were as diligent as elementary school students, they would be more useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Elementary school students do not study hard of their own accord. They are forced to study hard. In contrast, we often shirk our responsibility with the excuse that we are not capable. We need to learn because we are not capable. If we are capable, we do not need to learn. We also need to learn because we do not understand. If we understand, there is no need to learn. Some workers could be very useful, but they do not have a heart to learn, to persevere, and to make an effort to be useful. If we want to learn something, we must persevere until we learn. We also need a will to suffer. We should not back down in the face of difficulty. Hence, it is not a matter of knowing how to do something but of whether we are willing to learn. We should never say, for example, that we cannot speak. If we are willing to learn, we will be able to speak.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BROKEN IN OUR DISPOSITION<br />
TO COORDINATE WITH OTHERS</h2>
<p>Some among us are not able to coordinate with others. This is a problem. Some of us have a mild disposition and some tolerance. We may not argue or quarrel with others outwardly, but this may not reflect our true inward condition. We are in the Lord&rsquo;s work, but we cannot work with others. When we cannot coordinate with others, the Holy Spirit has no way to work with us.</p>
<p>To not be able to coordinate is more serious than to not work. If we cannot coordinate with the saints, it is better that we do not work. If we want our work to receive the Lord&rsquo;s blessing, we must be in one accord with others. A brother may know that he is in discord when he works with the saints and bears responsibility with them. In this situation there will be no blessing, regardless of how hard he works. At the same time he will not be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. His usefulness will be annulled if he cannot coordinate with others. If this is our situation, we must seriously deal with ourselves until we can be in one accord with others.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some brothers cannot be subject to others. They are not satisfied when others are above them. This is also a problem. We cannot expect to always be above others. We must learn to be under others and to be in one accord with them. However, some workers always want to be above others. They are not satisfied when others are above them.</p>
<p>These points are all related to our usefulness in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. If I were beginning to serve, I would not understand these things. I do not know many things in the world, but to some extent I know how to serve the Lord. There is no situation in the service that I do not understand.</p>
<p>We all love the Lord, and it is important for every brother and sister to love the Lord. We also know the flesh and the cross. Hence, there is no quarreling among us. However, it is not enough merely not to quarrel. Our inner being is still not up to the standard, because we are not in harmony with others, and we cannot coordinate. As a result, our work is short of the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. This is the issue of not learning lessons.</p>
<p>We have to learn skills for our labor and also lessons of life. These are related to our usefulness in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. On the one hand, we must learn lessons to have a large heart, to have living faith, and to receive the Lord&rsquo;s commission. Then one aspect of our usefulness will not be limited. On the other hand, we need to learn the skills to give a message, preach the gospel, expound the Bible, fellowship with the saints, and visit them.</p>
<p>We should not waste our time and think that it is easy to serve full time. If we do not learn these matters, our work will not have results, and there will be no blessing. If we want to have results and receive the blessing, we need to learn these things. When we coordinate with others, we need to learn the lesson of being broken in our disposition. This does not mean that we play politics. That is what society does, but it is not our way. We should learn the lesson of being broken so that we can be gentle and meek. Then we will be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand, and our usefulness will increase with time.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> </body></html>
