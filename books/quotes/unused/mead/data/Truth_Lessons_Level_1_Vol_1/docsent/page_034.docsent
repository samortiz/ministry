   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From this lesson on we intend to look into the summary of the Old Testament step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this lesson we will examine the portion of the Old Testament from Adam to Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. IN ADAM IS SEEN GOD S REDEMPTION A. Receiving the Promise of God s Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Immediately after the fall, Adam and Eve realized that they had violated God s prohibition against eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They also realized that the result of their transgression was to be death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, they hid themselves from the Lord s presence, awaiting the sentence of death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, God came in, not to declare the sentence of death, but to preach the gospel, giving them a wonderful promise that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent Gen 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>B. Experiencing the Anticipated</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Redemption of God</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Besides receiving the promise of God s redemption, Adam also experienced the anticipated redemption of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The actual redemption was to be accomplished four thousand years later.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After their fall, Adam and Eve realized that they were sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, they tried to help themselves by making skirts of fig leaves to cover their nakedness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that they attempted to cover their sinful self with their own works.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before the fall man did not need blood to redeem him, but after the fall he needed the bleeding sacrifice to redeem him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, man s attempt to cover his nakedness with the product of the vegetable life can never work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The skirts that Adam and Eve made from fig leaves did not cover their nakedness in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Genesis 3:20, after Adam heard the glad tidings, he immediately called his wife s name Eve, which means living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He believed that he and his wife were going to live and not die.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because of Adam s believing, we see God s justification in verse 21.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After Adam believed in the glad tidings, God made coats of skins of the sacrifice for him and his wife and clothed them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The coats fully covered them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that God justified them Gen 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be justified means to be covered with the righteousness of God, which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Adam and Eve s being under the coats of the skins of the sacrifice signified that they had put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ as God s righteousness covered them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through the Substitution</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>of the Bleeding Sacrifice</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to make coats of the skins of the lambs, God probably killed the lambs in the presence of Adam and Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, the blood of the lambs was shed, for without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness Heb 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have been redeemed by the precious blood of God s Lamb, who was ordained by God for us before the foundation of the world 1 Pet 1:18-20 and was slain from the foundation of the world Rev 13:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ is the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, we can see a picture of the shedding of Christ s blood there in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without the shedding of blood, God cannot cover the fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the cross Christ was killed by the righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Through the shedding of His blood God can now cover us with Christ as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the garden of Eden Adam experienced the anticipated redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His putting on of the coats of skins was based upon the shedding of the blood of the sacrifice, for the sacrificial lamb became a substitute for sinful man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Through the Union of the Covering Skins</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Genuine substitution is based upon union.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Adam and Eve were sinful, and the lambs were killed and their blood shed for their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if the lambs and Adam and Eve had been separated from one another, the lambs could not have substituted for them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once Adam believed in the gospel, God covered him with a coat of lamb skins, and he became one with the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The sinner had become one with the substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is union.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Union brings about the effectiveness of substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once we participate in that union, whatever the substitute has accomplished is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ has done everything for us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since we are one with Christ, whatever Christ has accomplished on the cross becomes ours.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, when Adam and Eve put on the coats of skins made by God, this typifies that they had believed into Christ and become one with Christ.</S>
