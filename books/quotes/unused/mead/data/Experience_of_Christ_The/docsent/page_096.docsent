   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY ONE THING TO DO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Philippians 3:8-11 a number of matters are covered.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nevertheless, there is just one outstanding point to be conformed to the death of Christ so that, by any means, we may attain unto the out-resurrection from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For this, we first need the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By means of such an excellency, we shall be willing to count all things loss in order to gain Christ and be found in Him in a condition of not having our own righteousness out from the law, but having the righteousness that is God Himself lived out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then we shall experientially know Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We shall also be conformed to His death in order to arrive at the out-resurrection from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>EXPERIENCING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>IN THE PROCESS OF RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Arriving at the out-resurrection means that our entire being has been gradually and continually resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the day the Spirit of God came into us to regenerate our spirit, the process of resurrection began.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Firstly, God resurrected our deadened spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From that time onward, He has been working within us to resurrect every part of our being, our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, even our body will be resurrected and transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that we shall be fully resurrected out of our old being into the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is God's economy, God's intention, God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through this process Christ will be thoroughly wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is in this way that we experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Experiencing Christ is not merely a matter of enjoying His love, grace, or help.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To experience Christ is to have Christ wrought into our being to resurrect us out of our old being into the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the New Jerusalem comes with the new heaven and the new earth, every part of our being will be a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The way to become the new creation is to have our being processed in resurrection from the old creation to the new.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All of us are partly resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that another part is still unrenewed and yet remains in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we are in the process of resurrection to be renewed from the old creation to the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This process of resurrection enables us to participate in Christ and to partake of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The experience of Christ is not something so superficial as merely receiving grace, obtaining help, or enjoying love from the Christ in the heavens or from the Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To experience Christ is to be conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this death we are processed in resurrection from the old creation to the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually, the new creation will simply be Christ wrought into our being and enlarged in us.</S>
