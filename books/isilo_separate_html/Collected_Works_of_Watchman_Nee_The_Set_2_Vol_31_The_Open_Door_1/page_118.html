The main points of Brother Hwa's messages were on God's eternal, unchanging plan and how it is being carried out throughout the ages until it is realized. I spoke on Exodus and the believers' experience. Every morning during morning watch, I spoke of the things that happened before and after Moses was called. Thank and praise the Lord. He really loves us and wants to work with us. Hallelujah! Amen. Brother Huang Li-chuan and I held a ten-day conference from March 15 to 24 at the China Inland Mission in Rue-An. Brother Huang's messages explained John 4 in detail. We all received an abundance of new light. I preached on the two different principles in the Bible&mdash;the divine and the human. I still do not know of any results. We have no intention of thinking about it all the time. We have just put it into the Lord's hands. A few days after the work in Rue-An was over, Brother Hwa Shi-bin and Brother David Hsu were invited to work for five days in the independent church in that city. I heard that the results were good. When the conference was about to begin, there were some who vehemently opposed. Thank the Lord, they understood gradually and in the end completely welcomed them. There were also brothers from the Hsun-Dao Chapel in Tang-Kou who heard the brothers and were moved by what they heard. They have firmly invited them to work in their place. We are praying about this matter now to see what the Lord's mind is. Brother Hsu and Brother Hwa came to Fang-Yen-Hsia to rest after finishing the work in Rue-An. Yesterday (April 4) Brother Hwa left for Sha-Po to work there for three days. He will return to Fang-Yen-Hsia afterwards. Brother Hsu is now staying in Pei-Ling School. He will hold a five-day conference in Fang-Yen-Hsia starting tomorrow. Brother Hsu will be responsible for the preaching. Brother Hwa might go to Wenchow to stay for awhile. Brother Hsu plans to travel among the localities in Ping-Yang. He has not decided on how long he will stay. I hope you will pray for these matters.</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Chin-fa<br />April 5<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Letters from Brother Hsu Dah-weh,<br />Chekiang Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Since leaving Ning-Po in September of last year, I have been traveling back and forth in the upper river region of eastern Chekiang for six months. It has not been convenient for me to communicate with you because I have been traveling mainly in the high mountains or deep valleys where news does not travel and communication is difficult. I left Li-Shui by grace on the eighteenth and came to Yung-Jia. Here things are slightly more restful. Thank and praise the Lord. I read The Open Door and was comforted to know about the brothers' and sisters' travels. Brother Pan Huo-ling of Yung-Jia and Brother Chai Chi of Ping-Yang are both physically weak and need our prayers. For the past six months, God has placed me alone away from home. The lessons I have learned from such sufferings are very precious. Sometimes I am very lonely in spirit. Sometimes I even suspect that I have fallen away and have been forsaken by the Lord. Thank and praise the Lord! His unchanging love always encourages me on! It is late at night now. May the Lord teach me to go on faithfully. Please pray for me.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Hsu Dah-weh</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_117.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_119.html">Next</a> </body></html>
