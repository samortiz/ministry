   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Spreading to Judea, Samaria, and Galilee</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The establishing of the churches spread quickly from Jerusalem to Judea, Samaria, and Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Acts 9:31 says, "So the church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it was multiplied."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This verse speaks of Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, all of which were provinces in the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Judea was in the southern part of the Jewish land, Galilee was in the north, and Samaria was between the south and the north.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There were churches in all three of these provinces.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since at this time the church had spread only to the provinces of Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, and the word "whole" in 9:31 covers all the places where the church existed, the "church" in singular is used in the universal sense.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church here is spoken of in the universal sense although there must have been a number of churches in the various cities of these three provinces, which may be called churches in the local sense.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to verse 31, the church throughout the whole of Judea, Samaria, and Galilee had peace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church had peace inwardly although there was persecution outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, having peace in the midst of persecution, the church was being built up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The building up proceeded after the establishment of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are also told that the church in these provinces was going on in the fear of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although there were persecutions, the church was not in the fear of men.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, the church went on in the fear of the Lord lest the church offend the Lord by being subdued by persecution, or lest she offend the Lord in other things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to 9:31, the church was going on also in the comfort of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that the church was suffering affliction through the persecutions, in which she feared the Lord and enjoyed the comfort of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Jews considered Galilee a despised region and Samaria a region full of mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, 9:31 speaks of the church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that no matter how much Galilee was despised and Samaria was rejected by the Jews in Jerusalem, the churches raised up in those regions were all considered one church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the local sense, they were the churches, but in the universal sense, all these churches are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here we have a basic revelation concerning the oneness of the church universally.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>E. Reaching Antioch in Syria</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Acts 11:19-26 records the spread of the gospel to Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch through the scattered disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 26 refers to the church in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Barnabas found Saul, "he brought him to Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And it came about that for a whole year they were gathered in the church and taught a considerable number."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Church in Antioch</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Acts 13:1 opens with the words, "Now there were in Antioch, in the church that was there."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This clearly refers to the local church established in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Acts 14:26 and 27 say that Paul and Barnabas "sailed away to Antioch, from which they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And having arrived and gathered the church together, they declared all that God had done with them."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 27 does not say that they gathered the believers but that they gathered the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicates that the church in its essential meaning is a meeting, a congregation or assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There was such a church, such a congregation, in Antioch.</S>
