   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every Local Church Needing to Receive</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All Kinds of Genuine Believers in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every local church should receive all kinds of genuine believers in Christ Rom 14:1-6; 15:1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have no right to give up any believer, unless he is divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When a believer becomes divisive, he is divided from the church already.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But as long as a believer is not divisive, we should not give him up.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a believer prefers to keep the Sabbath whereas we take the Lord's Day, or if he eats only vegetables whereas we eat every kind of food, we still must receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must receive him because God has received him Rom 14:3 and because Christ has received him Rom 15:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must receive every believer in Christ according to Christ Rom 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not receive the believers according to their diet or according to our preference.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whether we like a particular believer or not, we have no choice but to receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Suppose you were born into a family of twelve brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You might like only yourself and one of your brothers and not like the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, the fact that the other ten are in the same family is not up to you; it is up to your parents.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They begot those peculiar ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, you have no choice but to receive them as your brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Likewise, in the church a particular brother may have certain characteristics that are offensive to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But we need to realize that our Father has begotten him and has received him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we give up this brother, we would give up our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, we must receive all kinds of genuine believers, not according to anything of ourselves but according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must receive them because they have Christ; Christ is in them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a church does not receive all kinds of genuine believers, it is divisive and becomes a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A Believer to Be Kept Away</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>from the Fellowship of a Local Church</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because of Only Three Things</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A believer can be kept away from the fellowship of a local church, that is, the fellowship of the Body of Christ, because of only three things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>a. Being Divisive</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first thing is being divisive, making divisions and causes of falling contrary to the apostles' teaching Rom 16:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Romans 14 Paul said that we must receive all kinds of genuine believers, whether they keep certain days or consider every day alike, whether they eat herbs or eat meat vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then, in chapter fifteen Paul said that we must receive genuine believers according to Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>5-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In these portions of the Word, Paul was very broadminded, very generous, and, in a sense, very liberal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But at the end of chapter sixteen Paul said, "Now I beg you, brothers, keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These two things the making of divisions and causes of falling have been and still are going on among us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, we need to keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to what we have learned of the apostles, and we must turn away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In dealing with the divisive ones, we must also take Paul's word in Titus 3:10, "A factious man after the first and second admonition refuse."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A factious person is a divisive and sectarian person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to Paul's word in Romans 16:17 and in Titus 3:10, after the first and second admonitions, we must reject such persons and turn away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To do this is to quarantine such persons.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To quarantine a person does not mean that we hate that person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If one member in a family became ill with a contagious disease, the rest of the family would need to quarantine him for the safety of the whole family.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Otherwise, the entire family would be affected.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Likewise, to practice Paul's word in Romans 16:17 and in Titus 3:10 is to quarantine the divisive members in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is not my teaching; it is my presentation of the holy Word to you.</S>
