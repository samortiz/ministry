   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Jesus is God, and He died on the cross not only as a man but also as God: The One who died on the cross was the One who had been conceived of God and born with God.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While the glory of His divinity was concealed by the shell of His humanity, He was pressed and constrained, longing to be baptized with the baptism of His death for the release of the glory of His divinity Luke 12:50.</S>
