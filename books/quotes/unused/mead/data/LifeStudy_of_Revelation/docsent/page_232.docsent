   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. To Be on a Great and High Mountain</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When John saw New Jerusalem, he was both in spirit and also carried away onto a great and high mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The great and high mountain is in contrast to the wilderness in 17:3.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To see Babylon, the great prostitute, John was carried to the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To see the Bride, the New Jerusalem, he was carried to a great and high mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to be uplifted to a high mountain that we may see God s dwelling place for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order for John to see the churches, it was sufficient to be on the island of Patmos.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the New Jerusalem is vastly higher than the churches, and in order to see it, John had to be carried to a high mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The New Jerusalem is a mountain city, and we must be on a mountain in order to see it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to be in the spirit and to get to a high mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the way to see the vision of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We also need to know what the New Jerusalem is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of God s building work throughout the centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Beginning with Adam and continuing for nearly sixty centuries, God has been doing a great deal of building.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The issue of this work will be the New Jerusalem, God s eternal habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have seen that the time from Adam until the end of the millennium is divided into four dispensations: the dispensation of the Patriarchs, from Adam to Moses; the dispensation of law, from Moses to Christ; the dispensation of grace, from Christ s first coming until the restoration of all things at Christ s second coming; and the dispensation of the kingdom, from Christ s second coming to the end of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During these dispensations God has been carrying out His building work, and He will continue it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Most Christians, however, do not care for God s building; they care only for their human religion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Praise the Lord that we have been rescued from that pitiful situation!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now we are not in a human religion; we are in the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Presently this building is the churches, and eternally it will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are in the churches and we are on our way to the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thank the Lord that we have such a clear view of the New Jerusalem, our ultimate destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>IN THE NEW HEAVEN AND THE NEW EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verse 2 John says, And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The New Jerusalem is a living composition of all the saints redeemed by God throughout all generations.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is the Bride of Christ as His counterpart John 3:29 and the holy city of God as His habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the city, the heavenly Jerusalem Heb 12:22 , which God has prepared for us and which Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob longed after Heb 11:10, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is also the Jerusalem which is above and which is the mother of us all Gal 4:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This New Jerusalem will come down out of heaven to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verses 2 and 10 both say that New Jerusalem comes down out of heaven from God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God s intention is not to have an eternal habitation in heaven; He desires to dwell on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although religion dreams of going to heaven, God desires to come down to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even today, God s best habitation is not heaven; it is the church on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today God has two dwelling places the heavens and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God dwells in heaven with His angels, and He also dwells on earth with His children.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you were the Father, would you prefer to stay with the angels, the servants, or with your children?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the servants lived in a mansion and the children lived in a poor cottage, would you prefer to live in the mansion or in the cottage?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Certainly you would prefer to be with your children in the cottage.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is the same with God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How He desires to dwell in the church!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although the appearance of the church is not marvelous or splendid, the children of God are there, and God enjoys being with them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, the poor cottage of the church will be transformed into the New Jerusalem, which will be far more splendid than any mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>New Jerusalem will be an immense city, twelve thousand stadia in length, breadth, and height v. 16 . Twelve thousand stadia is approximately one thousand three hundred and sixty miles, the distance from San Diego to Seattle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The distance from the east coast of the United States to the west coast is about three thousand miles.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, the length of the New Jerusalem will be almost half that of the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What a tremendous city this will be!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It will be about seven million feet high.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This city, which is far more wonderful than we could ever imagine, will actually come down from heaven to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Of course, the earth at that time will be the new earth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>1, 24, 26 .</S>
