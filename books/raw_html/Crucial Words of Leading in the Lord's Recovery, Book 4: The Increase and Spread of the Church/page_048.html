	 <h2 class="head2">Thoroughly Examining the Information Cards</h2>
<p>In order to recover these brothers and sisters, our initial plan is to thoroughly examine the existing information cards. Among the fifty thousand names in the church in Taipei, about ten thousand of the addresses are accurate. Of this number, there are approximately five to six thousand saints who participate in the church life regularly and about six thousand more who come to an occasional meeting. Thus, we have accurate address information for these saints. The information regarding these six thousand saints who occasionally meet has been distributed to each small group; this is a very good situation. We need to begin by recovering the brothers and sisters who seldom attend meetings but whose whereabouts are known. This involves a work of visitation and restoration.</p>
<p>We also need to locate the nearly forty thousand saints whose whereabouts are unknown. This is very time consuming, and we are in the process of looking for a way that the churches in Taiwan can coordinate with each other in order to find these saints. We have begun by distributing these information cards to each small group so that they can at least go to the addresses that are listed on the cards. This is a way for us to begin to restore these saints.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Receiving the Burden to Go Out and Visit</h2>
<p>The key to recovering these saints is for the brothers and sisters who regularly meet in the small groups to receive a burden. Without a burden, it will be difficult to move; with a burden, there will be grace. We need a burden to visit eight or nine, not just one or two. On average, each saint needs to be willing to contact at least eight. This is a great and difficult task. Nevertheless, I want to encourage you with one statistic: when the number of saints attending the meetings increases to forty thousand, approximately one out of every thirty people in Taipei will be one of our brothers and sisters. This will make it quite easy for us to penetrate every social level with the gospel. We will have brothers and sisters in every trade and profession, whether accountants, business owners, army generals, university professors, homemakers, or taxi drivers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Strengthening the Testimony<br />
and Praying Desperately</h2>
<p>Our testimony needs to be strengthened. The saints who are wandering outside are scattered and not enjoying the riches of our family. They are truly like the prodigal son who could not find even carob pods to eat (Luke 15:13-16). But in the Father&rsquo;s house, in God&rsquo;s house, which is the church, the food is plentiful. Therefore, we must be compassionate toward them and bring them home to enjoy the riches in the Father&rsquo;s house with us.</p>
<p>Before going out, we need to pray thoroughly. I can absolutely testify to the effectiveness of prayer. In 1932, when the Lord raised up the church in Chefoo, I could see the effectiveness of our prayer every day. The Lord would bring people in ways that were quite wonderful. We have to believe that our concern matches the Lord&rsquo;s concern on the throne; in fact, His concern has touched us to be concerned for others. Thus, we must receive a burden to pray. In the beginning we may not know the names of the ones who need to be restored. We may only know that there are forty to fifty thousand who need our prayer. We can tell the Lord, &ldquo;Remember these saints.&rdquo; I believe that if two to three thousand pray daily, the Lord will hear our prayer.</p>
<p>Along with prayer, we will distribute the information cards according to geographic regions, and we will encourage the saints to fellowship in the small groups. For instance, we can say to one another, &ldquo;This sister has not been to a meeting for a while. Do we know a sister who is close to her and who could go and visit her?&rdquo; If no one knows her, we could ask, &ldquo;Is there anyone who is willing to receive a burden to go to her?&rdquo; Since each card contains details related to age, family situation, parents, and children, we will be able to fellowship about a saint&rsquo;s particular condition. With such fellowship, some will receive a burden to go and visit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRINCIPLE OF VISITING</h2>
<p>Visiting dormant saints needs much consideration. If we do not do it properly, we will drive them further away. If our visiting will only drive them further away, it would be better not to visit them. When saints ask me what they should do when they visit, it is difficult to give a specific answer because I have found that my ways do not always work.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Praying and Learning Spirit</h2>
<p>Consider the example of boxing. A teacher may teach boxing in the classroom in one way, but when it comes to the actual boxing match, the teacher&rsquo;s instructions may not work. In a boxing match, one has to make adjustments according to the actual situation. Consequently, the most important matter in visiting is to have a praying and learning spirit, saying, &ldquo;O Lord, only You can restore this one.&rdquo; None of us can do this in ourselves. Those with no experience will certainly face difficulties, but even those with experience cannot rely on what they have learned in the past, because every person&rsquo;s situation is different. We must look to the Lord, praying, &ldquo;Have mercy on me. I can do nothing. Give me the wisdom and the words I need to speak.&rdquo;</p>
