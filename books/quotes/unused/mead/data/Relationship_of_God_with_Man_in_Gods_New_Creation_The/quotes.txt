[1]  John 1:14 tells us that the Word became flesh; that is, God was incarnated to be a man.
[2]  We have seen that Christ was born to be a human child, a man-child, yet He is called Mighty God.
[3]  The Jews, the Hebrews, do not worship a God who is mingled with man, because they consider that Jesus Christ was merely a man and was not God.
[4]  Verses 9-10a of this chapter say, You are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.
[5]  Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.
[6]  Furthermore, Christ is mentioned interchangeably with the Spirit of Christ, indicating that the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself.
[7]  These three titles the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ refer to one person, because the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself.
[8]  It is wrong to think that the time when God mingled with man was when we received Him as our Savior and that before then He was only God.
[9]  The second thing that we should know as Christians is that the Spirit whom we received from God is not only a Spirit of the divine nature but also a Spirit of the human nature.
[10]  Now we need to ask why it is that man was created according to Christ.
[11]  Most Christians consider that we were created to serve and worship God.
[12]  As human beings, we were created and made according to Christ not mainly to worship or serve Christ, nor to do good things to please Christ, but to receive Christ, to contain Christ, and to be filled with Christ.
[13]  God made us out of dust to be vessels of honor to contain Christ, who is God.
[14]  We have seen that man is tripartite, of three parts, and that the soul and the spirit must be divided.
[15]  Now let us consider the respective functions of the body, the soul, and the spirit.
[16]  In the previous chapter we saw that our human spirit within us is the recipient or receiving organ for us to receive God in Christ.
[17]  John 4:24 says, God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit.
[18]  Just as our stomach is the proper organ for us to receive, store, and digest food, our spirit is the right organ for us to receive God, contain God, and even store God.
[19]  For this reason, in John 4:24 the Lord Jesus tells us clearly that God is Spirit and that if we are going to contact Him and worship Him, we must do this in our spirit.
[20]  The new creation is something very different; it is God Himself as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, with the human nature, mingled with us, the creatures; it is a mingling of human beings with the Triune God-man.
[21]  How do we know that we have Christ within us?
[22]  Many times we may have argued with the Lord.
[23]  Thus far we have seen what God is, what man is, and what the new creation is.
[24]  In the foregoing chapter we pointed out that the new creation is simply the mingling of God with man.
[25]  Through His incarnation He brought God into man, and by His death, resurrection, and ascension He brought man into God.
[26]  We should not think that the Lord Jesus, who was God, came and put man upon Himself, that He died and resurrected in order to terminate man, and that today He is no longer a man but only the almighty God.
[27]  God is the Spirit who was already mingled with man before we received Him, and we are persons with a spirit for us to receive this wonderful God.
[28]  The mingling of God with man has a definite purpose.
[29]  Since a son is the expression of his father, God s predestinating us unto sonship, that is, His predestinating us to be sons of God, simply means that He foreordained us to be the expression of God.
[30]  They lack the divine revelation that God s eternal purpose is to mingle Himself with us so that we will be conformed to the image of Christ to be the full expression of God Himself.
[31]  God s intention is to mingle Himself with us so that we may be one with Him to become His expression.
[32]  In this chapter we will begin to consider the way that God mingles with man, that is, how He accomplishes this matter.
[33]  Although it is correct to say that He accomplishes this mingling through the Spirit and by Christ s death on the cross, the main thing we must stress is that God s way to mingle Himself with us is by life.
[34]  In the record of Genesis chapters one and two, God created man in His own image 1:26 , using the dust of the ground to form man s body and God s breath of life to form man s spirit, with the result that man became a living soul 2:7 .
[35]  Let us consider how we can experience Christ as life in a practical way.
[36]  It is not adequate to say that Christ changes our life or that He gives us a new life.
[37]  Therefore, we may have the terminology that Christ is our life without knowing the reality or the way to experience Him as life.
[38]  This means that when we open ourselves to the Lord and give the Spirit of Christ, who is the Spirit of life, the ground to work within us, we first sense something shining as light within us.
[39]  TO BE MINGLED WITH MAN 2 THE LAW OF LIFE 1 GOD S ETERNAL PLAN, CENTRAL THOUGHT,
[40]  The way for God to be mingled with us is the way of life.
[41]  This portrays the way that God mingles Himself with us, and this mingling is the central thought of God.
[42]  You may think that you should be a good man; however, God s thought is not that you should be a good man but that you should be a God-man, a man who is mingled with God as one.
[43]  However, few realize that the divine life, the eternal life, that we received at the moment we believed in the Lord Jesus is God Himself in Christ as the Spirit.
[44]  Concerning the law of life, Jeremiah 31:33 says, I will put My law in their inward parts and write it upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.
[45]  In this verse we see that the relationship between God and us is based on the law that He puts within our inward parts and writes upon our hearts.
[46]  This law is the basic matter for the relationship we have with God.
[47]  Jeremiah 31:33 is a most basic verse in the Scriptures: But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares Jehovah: I will put My law in their inward parts and write it upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.
[48]  In order to have God as our God and to be a people to God, we must realize and understand the matter of law, because it is based on law that God is God to us and we are a people to God.
[49]  After the incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of Christ, the Triune God-man came down on the day of Pentecost to present Himself to us that we may receive and accept Him as our Savior, our Lord, our God, our life, and our everything.
[50]  On the day of Pentecost the Triune God-man poured Himself out as the Holy Spirit.
[51]  Today in the Holy Spirit there is not only the divine nature but also the human nature.
[52]  Andrew Murray s book The Spirit of Christ refers to the Spirit of the glorified Jesus.
[53]  Andrew Murray writes, When poured out at Pentecost, He came as the Spirit of the glorified Jesus, the Spirit of the Incarnate, crucified, and exalted Christ, the bearer and communicator to us, not of the life of God as such, but of that life as it had been interwoven into human nature in the person of Christ Jesus.
[54]  The Holy Spirit has come down to present such a wonderful One, the Triune God-man, to us as our Savior, our Lord, our God, our life, and our everything for us to receive.
[55]  TO BE MINGLED WITH MAN 4 THE LAW OF LIFE 3 THE LAW OF LIFE BEING
[56]  The Lord is so willing to be our God and to have a relationship with us that He has made a covenant, that is, a contract, an agreement, with us.
[57]  Because He is man as well as God, He has not only the divine nature but also the human nature.
[58]  Now this One is life within us, and this life works in us as a regulating law not in a miraculous way but in a very ordinary way, even in a very human way.
[59]  Today Christ, who is the Lord, the almighty God, and the all-inclusive Head, is living within us as life, working and moving in us in a gentle, quiet, normal, and human way.
[60]  TO BE MINGLED WITH MAN 5 THE ANOINTING Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:27; Heb 8:10-11 THE ANOINTING BEING
[61]  We have seen that the law within us is the law of life, the living law, the Triune God Himself with all His fullness living within us.
[62]  In these chapters we have seen three main items: the light of life, the law of life, and the anointing.
[63]  The Lord Jesus Christ today is the all-inclusive One.
[64]  If He were merely God, the Lord, and the Savior to us, there would be no need for Him to come into us.
[65]  Prayer: Lord, we ask You to help us and strengthen us while we are speaking something concerning Yourself and the way to experience You as life.
[66]  In a previous chapter we saw that Christ, the Son of God, is called the Father Isa 9:6 , and that He as the Lord is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17; cf.
[67]  We have also seen that His Spirit is not only the Spirit of the divine life but also the Spirit of the human nature interwoven with the divine nature.
[68]  Today in the Holy Spirit of the wonderful God-man there is not only divinity but also humanity.
[69]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE SUPPLY OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT CHRIST BEING LIFE TO US
[70]  This is based on Hebrews 8:10, which says, For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me. The law mentioned here is not the law in letters written on outward tablets of stone, but the law of life in spirit written in our hearts.
[71]  Romans 8:2 says, The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.
[72]  The law that has freed us is the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, and this law of life is of four great items: the Spirit, life, Christ, and Jesus.
[73]  We have also seen that the law of life is nothing other than Christ Jesus Himself as life to us Col 3:4 .
[74]  Christ is the embodiment of God, and He enters into us as the Spirit of life 2 Cor 3:6b, 17 .
[75]  Although the supply of the Spirit is bountiful and all-inclusive to meet all our needs, we still need to realize that the Spirit works within us in a quiet, gentle, normal, ordinary and human way.
[76]  What he experienced was not merely the Holy Spirit of God but the Spirit of Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit of God in whom are the elements of Christ s human nature, the effectiveness of Christ s death, and the power of Christ s resurrection.
