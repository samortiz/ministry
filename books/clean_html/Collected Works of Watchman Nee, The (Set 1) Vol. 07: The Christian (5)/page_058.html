<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BODY OF MOSES</H2><P>Question: What is the significance of the angel contending for the body of Moses in Jude 9? (Lee)</P><P>Answer: This happened after the death and burial of Moses (Deut. 34:8, 6). Deuteronomy 34:6 seems to indicate that Moses was not in his sepulcher for long. No other passage can be linked to this place. I myself believe that only the transfiguration on the Mount in Matthew 17 is related to this. Actually, this is the only incident recorded after Moses' death. Satan wanted to stop Moses from putting on his body to appear on the Mount of Transfiguration. Hence, Michael contended with him, according to the nature of his work, which Daniel 12:1-2 shows has to do with resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LIVING CREATURES AND THE ELDERS</H2><P>Question: Do the living creatures in Revelation 4:6 represent all living creatures? Who do the twenty-four elders represent? Why is the number twenty-four? (Lee)</P><P>Answer: Yes, the four living creatures represent all living creatures. The twenty-four elders are the kings and priests among the angels. Their sitting on the throne and their crowns show that they are kings. Their ministering by the incense altar in white garments shows that they are priests. Twenty-four is the number for the divisions of the priesthood (1 Chron. 24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RESURRECTION<br>PRIOR TO THE SEVENTH TRUMPET</H2><P>Question: You have said that the rapture is the transformation and the taking up of the living persons. But the two preachers are raptured after they are resurrected. Does that not mean that there will be a resurrection before the blowing of the seventh trumpet (Rev. 11:12)?</P><P>Answer: That is right. The two preachers are special and have nothing to do with the Christians.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RAPTURE AFTER THE SEVENTH TRUMPET</H2><P>Question: You have said that after the seventh trumpet, there will still be a minority of believers on earth. Once they are ready, they will be raptured also. What is the proof of this?</P><P>Answer: The proof of this is in Revelation 11:18, which tells us that by that time there will still be Christians talking about the Lord's coming. In typology, there are the firstfruits, the harvest, and also the gleanings (Lev. 23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SCROLL</H2><P>Question: Some have said that the scroll mentioned in Revelation 5 signifies the grant deed of a redeemed inheritance. This sounds plausible. What do you think? (Lee)</P><P>Answer: Yes. However, we cannot say this so directly. We will know what the scroll says when it is opened in the future. This scroll is the book of the God who pre-ordained history and who executes what He has ordained according to His wisdom and power. It is not only a prophecy, but the fulfillment of prophecies. The judgment of the world, the redemption of the world, and the ruling of Christ are all contained in this book.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LOCUSTS</H2><P>Question: Are the things that will come out of the abyss in Revelation 9:1-11 what you have described in The Christian, Issue No. 1? (Lee)</P><P>Answer: Yes, because ordinary locusts do not have kings (Prov. 30:27). However, the locusts in verse 11 have kings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FOUR MESSENGERS</H2><P>Question: What does Revelation 9:14 refer to? (Lee)</P><P>Answer: Nothing. The river Euphrates is the boundary of the ancient Roman Empire. It has to do with the revival of the Roman Empire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LITTLE SCROLL</H2><P>Question: Is the little scroll in Revelation 10 the same as the scroll in Revelation 5? (Lee)</P><P>Answer: No. The scroll in chapter five is sealed, whereas the scroll in chapter ten is open. Moreover, the scroll in chapter ten is "little," whereas the scroll in chapter five is new. Hence, one can know it only when he unrolls it (i.e., when he has the revelation). The scroll in chapter ten is open already (i.e., God has revealed it already). All that it takes is to eat it and digest it. The scroll in chapter ten is the prophecies in the Old Testament.</P>
