   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Immediately after Joseph returned, he had his brothers sit before him, "the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth" 43:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The brothers wondered at one another.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Certainly they should have realized by this indication that this ruler was Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There must have been particular features in Joseph's countenance that they could have recognized, even after twenty-two years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If they had put all the indications together, they would have said, "This is Joseph."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They should have remembered that Joseph was taken to Egypt, and they should have realized that this man was Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 34 says, "And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There must have been a purpose in Joseph's giving Benjamin a portion five times greater than that of the other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His intention must have been to indicate to his brothers that he was Joseph and that he loved his younger brother.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If I had been there, I would have had the boldness to ask the man if he was Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, none of his brothers did this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, they had no discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>With respect to our knowing the Lord it is exactly the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord showed Himself to us and we saw Him, yet we did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He did many things for us with a good intention, but we were frightened by what He did.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everything He did was motivated by love, but we had evil thoughts regarding it all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Joseph had a loving intention in inviting his brothers to his home for a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But they had the evil thought that he was planning to seize them and make them slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 18 says, "And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The money and the donkeys were veils that kept Joseph's brothers from recognizing him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The donkeys meant a great deal to them, but they meant nothing to Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Later, when Joseph sent his brothers back to get his father, he sent chariots with horsemen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Their money and their donkeys meant something to them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These were all they had.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They were also afraid of being taken as slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord may be directly in front of us and He may have done a great deal for us, but we cannot recognize Him or what He has done.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, we are afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Joseph's brothers should have realized that the ruler of world would not have cared about their donkeys.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we came to Christ and then into the church life, we might have wondered about our money, our security, or our family.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Joseph's brothers were poor.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But they were under the rich care of the ruler of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If I had been there, I would have said, "Forget about the money and the donkeys.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I want only Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I love him."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In knowing the Lord, we are all as foolish as Joseph's brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead of considering Him, we consider ourselves, our money, and our donkeys.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Joseph's brothers should have turned their eyes on Joseph and looked at him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If they had done so, they would have realized that the man resembled Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But for them to look at Joseph, they had to forget their money.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, they kept their eyes on their money and might have said to one another, "Don't you realize this is a lot of money?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must be careful not to lose it."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I doubt that Joseph's brothers set their eyes on his countenance adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If they had done so, they would have recognized him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Levi might have said to Reuben, "I am quite sure this man is Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Let us not be afraid, but be bold and ask if he really is Joseph."</S>
