   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE COMMISSION OF THE GOSPEL BEING TO REPRODUCE CHRIST FOR HIS INCREASE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 15 shows us how the many grains are built up together as a corporate increase.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In chapter twelve we see the way to produce the increase, and in chapter fifteen we see the way of building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verses 1 through 5 say, "I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Abide in Me and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me. I am the vine; you are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may have the wrong concept that the fruit spoken of by the Lord refers to certain manifestations of life, such as the fruit of the Spirit mentioned in Galatians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In these days, however, the more I consider this chapter, the more I am becoming clear.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 15:16 shows us the real meaning of fruit in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This verse says, "You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we read this verse carefully, we can realize that fruit does not refer to the manifestations of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To bring forth fruit is to produce, to have an increase.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This refers to the genuine outreach of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is to impart Christ into people, causing them to become the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this chapter, fruit is the outflow of Christ into people, thus making them the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Consider a fruit tree.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The fruit on the branches of the tree are the increase of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Fruit is not merely meekness, humility, or a kind of good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is the overflow of the inner life to produce an increase of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Fruit trees are reproduced by the seed of the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Within all the fruit on the branches of the tree there are seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When these seeds fall into the earth, they produce more trees.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Originally there was only one tree, but after a certain time, there are many trees.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the end of Matthew the Lord gave us the commission to go to the nations to preach the gospel 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Mark there is a similar word: "Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation" 16:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Likewise, Luke ends in the same way 24:47-49 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Gospel of John, however, does the Lord's speak there concerning the preaching of the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is there, but in a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Matthew, Mark, and Luke, it seems that the preaching of the gospel is a movement, a certain kind of activity or work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is only in the Gospel of John, the Gospel of life, that the preaching of the gospel is not a work or activity; it is an outflow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That is why in John 15:16 the Lord chose and set the disciples to go forth and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is to preach the gospel for the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must go forth to produce Christ, to have Christ reproduced, multiplied, and increased thirtyfold, sixtyfold, or a hundredfold.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the "great commission."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this book it seems that there is no such commission for gospel preaching, but in actuality there is the real commission of gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not in a way of work, activity, or movement, but it is in the way of life, in a way of the outflow of the inner life.</S>
