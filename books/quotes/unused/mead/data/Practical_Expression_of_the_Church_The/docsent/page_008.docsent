   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE EXPRESSION OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the expression of Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But how can the church be expressed?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is expressed through the church, but how is the church expressed?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must see the expression of the church which is the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>WHERE IS THE CHURCH?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many people talk about the church as the expression of Christ, but after a little consideration we will ask, "Where is the church?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we say that the church is the expression of Christ, then where is it?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When people speak about the church as the expression of Christ, it sounds nice, but we must put nice things into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you were to talk with me, I would reply, "Brother, it sounds good, but how can I get into it?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is marvelous that the church is the expression of Christ, but I would like to be in it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Tell me where it is."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we were to ask this practical question to so many teachers who teach concerning the church as the expression of Christ, we would put them into the corner.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Immediately, they would become embarrassed and entangled.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They would be confused and find it difficult to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church as the expression of Christ is so heavenly, so spiritual, and so wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But we want to get into it; we want to have it!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since it is so heavenly and so wonderful, where is it?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Where can we find such a wonderful thing?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The teachers may tell us that it is too spiritual and that it is not something of this earth, but in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If this is the case, it is impossible for the church to be in any locality on this earth, and we must conclude that we will have to wait for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, there is no reason for us to have the church today, and it is needless to talk about the things of the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we must wait for eternity, it is unnecessary to care for the church now.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>LOCAL CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You see, this is the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>People have seen just one aspect, but not the other.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Regarding the church there are two terms in the Bible: "the church of God" 1 Cor 10:32 , and "the churches of God" 1 Cor 11:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Is the church one, or many?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church of God is universal, but the churches of God are expressed in so many localities.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church is the expression of Christ, but how can the church be practically expressed?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only by the local churches, i.e., by one church in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As the expression of Christ, the church is universally one, but it is expressed in many, many local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church could never be expressed without the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every local church is the practical expression of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why in Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus mentioned the building of the church upon the Rock.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But in Matthew 18:15-20, the Lord said something about the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church mentioned in Matthew 18 must be a local church, because it is a place where we can go.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord said that if you have some problem with a brother, go to him first.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If he listens to you, the problem is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if he does not, you must bring one or two with you to witness to him, expecting him to listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If he still does not listen, then you are to bring the problem to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Of course, this must be the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It could not be the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We could never bring a problem to the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Suppose you have a problem with a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do you have a church to go to?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Is there a place in your locality where you can go?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If not, there is no practical expression of the church in your city.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What is the practical expression of the church which is the expression of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Without local churches, there is no possibility for the church to be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Without local churches, the church only becomes a kind of term; it becomes something in the heavens, something in the future, something for us to look forward to, but not so real and practical today on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But according to the Bible it is not so.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the Bible the church is exceedingly practical.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Matthew 18 the Lord Jesus tells us that if we have a problem with a brother and it cannot be solved with two or three brothers, we must bring it to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is no doubt that this is the local church in practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then in the Book of Acts, we immediately see the first expression of the church on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Acts 8:1 says, "the church which was at Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It does not say the church in the heavens, but the church at Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is a local church, and this local church is the expression of the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In Acts 13:1, there is "the church at Antioch."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is another expression of the church, another local church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now we can see one church with at least two expressions: one is at Jerusalem, the other at Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All local churches are the expressions of the one universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As we continue through the New Testament, we see "the church at Cenchrea" Rom 16:1 , "the church at Corinth" 1 Cor 1:2; 2 Cor 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Bible never says the churches in one place, but always the church at a certain place e.g. the church at Jerusalem, the church at Antioch, the church at Cenchrea, and the church at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Every local church is an expression of the one church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The church is one, but the expressions of the church many.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>And these many expressions of the church are the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>"The churches in Judaea" Gal 1:22; 1 Thes 2:14 , "the churches of the Gentiles" Rom 16:4 , "the churches of Syria and Cilicia" Acts 15:41 , "every church" in every place 1 Cor 4:17; Acts 14:23 , "the churches of God" 1 Cor 11:16 , "the churches of Christ" Rom 16:16 , "all the churches of the saints" 1 Cor 14:33 , and "all churches" 1 Cor 7:17 mentioned in the New Testament all refer to the local churches, which were the many local expressions of the one universal church in the first century on this earth both in the Jewish world and in the Gentile world.</S>
