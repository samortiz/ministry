   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SETTING UP MEETINGS ACCORDING TO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PRACTICAL NEED IN EACH LOCALITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I hope that every meeting hall will have a general big meeting every Lord s Day morning as well as a meeting for teaching Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I also hope that Truth Lessons will be taught in classes according to the different levels of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is best for the bread-breaking meetings to be held in the districts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to our present situation, we cannot have the bread-breaking meeting in every home even though the saints in the initial church life broke bread from house to house Acts 2:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The early church broke bread from house to house every day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They probably remembered the Lord before every meal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that time the believers were very zealous for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our practice of having the bread-breaking meetings on the Lord s Day is also according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even though Acts 2:46 speaks of the saints breaking bread every day in their homes, 20:7 shows that the saints came together to break the bread on the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It gradually became a pattern in the early church life to hold the bread-breaking meeting on the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some of the older responsible brothers may have difficulty getting used to the change in our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Previously a new one could partake of the table only after he had been formally introduced, and we would never allow anyone to casually break bread in his home or even hold a separate bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such matters were practiced only after the elders fellowshipped and prayed and then made a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are making a great turn that is difficult for the older brothers to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the one hand, we are making a turn; on the other hand, we are not making a turn.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The truth cannot be changed, but we can make changes in our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, we are Chinese, and we used to wear Chinese gowns, but we made a change and we now wear Western suits.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In spite of the change in our clothing, we have not made a change in our person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As another example, in the early days of the Republic of China, children in the countryside wore their hair in long braids.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Later with the change in the environment, they cut off their braids.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, the children were still the same even though their hairstyle changed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It does not matter whether we have the bread-breaking meeting in the meeting halls or in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not make any rules about this matter; instead, the saints in each locality must consider their situation and do what is best.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One brother fellowshipped that because the saints in his area live far apart from each other, few saints are able to gather and break bread together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, they have no choice but to have table meetings in small groups according to where the clusters of saints live.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When they began meeting in this way, the number of saints in the table meetings actually increased.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is what it means to arrange things according to the local situation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do not need to have the same practice in every locality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This also applies to the prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the one hand, if the brothers and sisters gather to pray in many different places, the prayer may not be strong, and there may not be many saints in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the other hand, if we all meet together to pray, there will be too many people in the meeting, and not everyone will have the opportunity to function.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we must examine our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can pray in smaller districts and come together for a large corporate prayer meeting once a month.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not have any regulations concerning the prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, the many meeting halls in the church in Taipei do not need to have their meetings at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Each meeting hall should be allowed to set the times for its meetings according to the need of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Concerning splitting the small group meetings, some small groups have not reached the stage of maturity, so these groups should not be split.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, this should not be taken as an excuse to continue meeting according to our habit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The goal of these meetings is to give all the brothers and sisters the opportunity to speak and function by shepherding one another, recovering the dormant saints, and bringing in new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to this principle, if a group is split before it reaches the desired goal, the saints will scatter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is best to wait until a group matures before splitting it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>OPENING OUR HOMES FOR MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>BEING THE BEST WAY TO RECEIVE THE BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I want to exhort all the brothers and sisters to open their homes for the saints to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the best way for believers to receive the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We belong to the living Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should, therefore, be for the Lord s interests on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All the saints in the Lord s recovery truly love the Lord and want to make Him happy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, we must exhort one another by pointing out that the best way to receive the blessing is to open up our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we open our homes, our families will be blessed, and our relatives, friends, and neighbors will also receive a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There are several patterns in the New Testament of believers meeting in homes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the day of Pentecost the new believers met together in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We believe that they did this to gain the benefit, not just to meet a need.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If there had been no need or benefit, they would not have had this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the day of their salvation, they heard Peter s message, were baptized, and then opened their homes to meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They must have met in their homes to receive the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In Acts 10 there is the example of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even before Cornelius knew the Lord Jesus or heard the gospel from Peter, that is, before he was saved, he had a meeting in his home.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Cornelius prayed frequently because he had received the Old Testament Scriptures from the Jews and knew something concerning the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Based on these facts we believe that he probably sat with his family members to discuss God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This was a home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When the angel appeared to Cornelius and told him to invite Peter, Cornelius obeyed the angel vv.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>5-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He then prepared his home and invited his relatives and intimate friends before Peter arrived v. 24 . Cornelius had a proper group meeting in his home before he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After Peter came and preached the gospel, all the members of the household of Cornelius were immediately saved.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There was no church near the house of Cornelius, but that does not mean that they did not meet together after Peter left.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What did they do without any so-called older or leading brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must believe that Cornelius was the leading brother.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This means that Cornelius was the elder.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Cornelius was also the deacon, he was the one who visited and cared for the others.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the pattern in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Every believer should be like Cornelius after his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We believe that the house of Cornelius, his family members, did not stop meeting after they were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the early days of the church life there was the atmosphere of opening the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Another example is Lydia, a seller of purple-dyed goods, whose whole house was saved and baptized 16:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In addition to being saved and baptized, she also opened up her home for meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Hence, before leaving Philippi, Paul went to her house and saw the brothers v. 40 . Paul did not remain in Philippi to care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This household was saved before there was a church in Philippi; therefore, they must have begun meeting in their own home.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>As another example, in Philippi Paul preached the gospel to the jailer and his household.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>After hearing the gospel, the jailer and his household were baptized on the same day, and they were joyful vv.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>30-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Paul, however, did not remain with them.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I believe that the household of this jailer continued to meet even after Paul left.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I also believe that the church in Philippi began in this household.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the New Testament the church in Philippi is a good church.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Thus, the small group meetings are very important.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Any church that begins with small group meetings will definitely be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Although we are saved, we will still be cold at times.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>A weekly meeting in our home will help us and restrict us.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It will be a preservation and blessing to us.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This meeting will help every member of our family.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>On the day that the meeting is in our home, we will be restrained from arguing freely.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This is a preservation because it helps a husband and wife to respect each other.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>There are many benefits when we open our home for a home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We have lost many opportunities to receive the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We also owe a huge debt to our friends, neighbors, and relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If we open our home for a meeting, after a period of time everyone will know that we have a meeting, and they will come to see what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If we do not have a meeting in our home, even though we have been saved for three to five years, our friends, neighbors, and relatives will only know that we always go to the meeting hall, particularly on Saturdays and Sundays.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>They will not know what we do at the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>However, if we have a meeting in our home, everyone will eventually know that we have a meeting, and they may unexpectedly find us meeting together when they come to visit us.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In this way they will hear the word of the gospel and receive salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>There are only blessings and benefits when we open our homes for meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We will not suffer any loss.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We can also learn to sing hymns in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The new brothers and sisters do not know how to sing the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If we also do not know how to sing the hymns, when we have a meeting in their homes, we will only be able to read the hymns, not sing them.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Today all the schools in Taiwan teach music using simplified notation.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>This should make it easy for us to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If we are willing to learn, we will eventually be able to sing the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>To meet the need of the home meetings, it is good to have a few extra Bibles in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>It is possible that our children will read the Bible while they are playing.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>They might read the sentence Let no one despise your youth 1 Tim 4:12 and be influenced by it, because they are astonished that the Bible contains such a sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>They may also read the portion that says, Allow the little children and do not prevent them from coming to Me Matt 19:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Even though they are playing, the Lord can use this to impress them with His love for them.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Hence, it is good to have extra Bibles in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Even if the meetings in our homes do not seem so good, we will receive the blessing when we open our homes for the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Some brothers and sisters are very busy with their jobs, but they should still have a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>According to the Old Testament principle, God does not want His people to labor seven days a week.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>God wants His people to labor for six days and have one day of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>On the day the children of Israel rested, they considered God.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Initially, people in the Old Testament considered God only as their Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>After the children of Israel left Egypt, God commanded them to keep the Sabbath Exo 20:8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>On the Sabbath day the Israelites did not remember God merely as their Creator; they also remembered Him as their Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>They considered how He saved their ancestors out of the land of Egypt by bringing them across the Red Sea, through the wilderness, and into the good land of Canaan to enjoy the riches of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>The Israelites considered all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>This was very profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Today a person can work only ten to twelve hours in a day.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>If a person works too long, it is not good for his health.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>We all must have a time of relaxation to alleviate our worries, or to take a walk, and, in the words of the unbelievers, to have some entertainment and recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>When the unbelievers have entertainment and recreation, they tend to go astray and bring in numerous sinful things.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>We do not want to see this happen among us.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>We should go to meetings on the Lord s Day to enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>This is genuine and proper recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>In addition, we can open our homes one evening a week to allow the saints to relax and be comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>We should not take anything else as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>We should read the Bible, discuss the truths of the Bible, speak of the Lord Jesus, and give testimonies, and we can play the piano to accompany our hymn singing.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>This is the way of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Whether for the sake of the church or for our proper human living, we should have one evening a week to open our home for the Lord and let our friends and neighbors know that we are Christians who fear God.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Every week we should spend one evening at home.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Instead of being occupied with business, we should speak about the things of the Lord with those in our family.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>There is no need for religious rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>When I was young, there was also a meeting in my home, but the meetings we had were religious and formal.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>We do not want religious rituals; rather, we want to sing the hymns freely, discuss the Bible, and speak of the Lord to our friends and relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>This is normal and worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>We can open our homes from 7:00 to 11:00 P.M. and tell our friends and relatives to come at any time during these four hours.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>If we will practice this, one home can bring at least one friend or relative to the Lord in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Even if the people who come to our meetings do not receive salvation, at least we will no longer be indebted for their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>However, if we do not practice this, when we go to meet the Lord, He will ask us whether we preached the gospel to our relatives, and we will not be able to say anything in response.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>We will not be able to settle accounts with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>ALL THE DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>WORKING TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>FOR THE SPREAD OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>The home meetings are the base for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>Initially there is one household in a home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>The home meeting forms a group when the number of households gradually increases to two or three.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>This is the most profitable way to build the church.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>People do not receive salvation because we have not shown them the treasure that is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>If we invite our friends and relatives to visit us in our homes, their hearts will be touched.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>Even though they might not say anything, they will remember us when they encounter difficulties, or they may even come to us for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>This will give us many opportunities to speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>During the sixty years of my serving the Lord, I have never seen a place as suitable as Taiwan for the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>All the conditions in the environment in communication, education, and the economy are prepared for His work.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>We simply need to open our homes and regularly invite people to come so that we can preach the Lord Jesus to them.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>I believe that if we practice this for one year, our numbers will triple or quadruple, not just double.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>We must endeavor to advance.</S>
