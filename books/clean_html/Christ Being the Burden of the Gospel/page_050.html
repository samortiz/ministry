<h2 class="head2">The Psychological Aspects of Man</h2>
<p>Not only does our body argue for the existence of God, but our heart does as well. Paul says, &ldquo;That which is known of God is manifest within them, for God manifested it to them&rdquo; (Rom. 1:19). These words clearly point to an experience within man&rsquo;s heart. The existence of God is supported by the tendencies in man&rsquo;s heart. For every inward need in man, there is a corresponding supply outside of him. For example, the appetite for food within man is met by the supply of a variety of foods outside of man. From the beginning of human existence, man has engaged in a search to know God. This tendency to seek God proves that there is God. Even those who deny God with their words will call on God spontaneously when they are weak, when they face insurmountable obstacles, or when they are physically weak. They spontaneously seek God because in their hearts they know that God exists.</p>
<p>Power, position, wealth, knowledge, and pleasures cannot satisfy man&rsquo;s needs. The only true satisfaction for man is God. Spiritual needs cannot be satisfied with material things. A person who is spiritually hungry will be satisfied only when he receives God. Man needs fresh air, and he will be satisfied when he breathes fresh air. Man also needs God, and he will be satisfied when he contacts God.</p>
<p>God exists. Our conscience testifies of this. Some are willing to say that there is no God because they do not feel an immediate need for God. This is a common situation among young people. Sooner or later, however, we are all confronted with our need for Him. We may not feel a need for God when we are young, but we will feel a need when we get older. Someone who is young and strong can have a hard heart that fools him into thinking that he does not need God. One day, however, when he realizes his limitations and weaknesses, he will realize his need for God. Often, saying that there is no God reflects only a temporary state of mind. The more that one says that there is no God, the weaker and more fearful he becomes. In contrast, the more one says that there is a God, the stronger and more powerful he becomes, because God has both strength and power.</p>
<p>People who have God are quite bold. Generally speaking, a twenty-year-old may say that there is God, but his assertion may not be very bold. When he reaches the age of thirty, he will be much bolder, and as each year passes, he will become bolder and bolder. When he reaches fifty to sixty years of age, his speaking about God will be loud and quite forceful.</p>
<p>In contrast, one who says that there is no God is quite forceful in his speaking when he is twenty years old. When he reaches the age of thirty, he will still have some strength to deny God&rsquo;s existence, but as each year passes, he will be less and less bold. When he reaches fifty to sixty years of age, he will begin to be afraid and to wonder if God truly does not exist. He will also begin to worry about what will happen to him if God does exist. These two examples are related to the testimony of man&rsquo;s conscience concerning the existence of God.</p>
<p>There was once a father and a son who were atheists. One day the father was feeling quite sick, and his heart began to soften toward God. Sensing this, his son asked him to hold on more firmly to his atheistic belief, but the father answered, &ldquo;What can I hold on to? There is no strength in holding on to such a belief.&rdquo; This is another example of man&rsquo;s conscience testifying that there is a God.</p>
<p>The universe and the human body are strong arguments for the existence of God. Moreover, our conscience also testifies that there is a God. Dear friends, there is proof all around us. Why are you still hesitating?</p>
