   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>7 Out of the Evil Age,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Crooked Generation, That Is, the Religious World,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Judaic Religion, the Religious Fold,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>into Christ and the Church</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Finally, the believers have been transferred out of the evil age, the crooked generation, that is, the religious world, the Judaic religion, the religious fold, into Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Galatians 1:4 says that Christ gave Himself for our sins, that He might rescue us out of the present evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although Christ was crucified for our sins, the goal of His crucifixion was to rescue us out of the present evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the context of the book of Galatians, the present evil age in 1:4 refers to the religious world, the religious course of the world, which at Paul s time was the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is confirmed by Galatians 6:14 and 15, where circumcision is considered part of the world the religious world to which Paul was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1:4 Paul emphasizes that the purpose of Christ s giving Himself for our sins was to rescue us, to pluck us out, from the Jewish religion, the present evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is to release God s chosen people from the custody of the law Gal 3:23 , to bring them out of the sheepfold John 10:1, 3 , according to the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The fact that Christ gave Himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil religious age indicates that He died in order to rescue us from Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John 10 we see that Christ as the good Shepherd entered into the fold in order to bring His sheep out of the fold and into the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fold in John 10 signifies the law, or Judaism as a religion of the law, in which God s chosen people were kept and guarded in custody until Christ came.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, Christ came as the Shepherd to bring the sheep out of the fold to the pasture, where they may feed on His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, Christ died on the cross not only for the sins of His sheep but also to bring them out of the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In John 10:16 the Lord Jesus said, I have other sheep which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The one flock signifies the one church, the one Body of Christ Eph 2:14-16; 3:6 , brought forth by life, which the Lord Jesus imparted into His members through His death John 10:10-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fold is Judaism, and the flock is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ has brought us out of the fold into the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today, in the sight of God, the various denominations, sects, and independent groups are folds.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A well-known hymn speaks of the grace that brought me to the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ has not brought us to the fold;</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He has brought us out of the fold and into the flock, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whereas the fold is a place, the flock is a living entity composed of all the living members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All those who believe in Christ are His sheep in His one flock under Him as the one Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The transfer that has been accomplished concerning us includes the matter of being transferred out of the religious fold into the one flock.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Acts 2:40 Peter testified and entreated, saying, Be saved from this crooked generation!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This crooked generation refers to the perverted Jews in this age who rejected God s Christ Acts 2:36 and were considered by God as the present evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For the crooked Jews to be saved from their present evil age requires a genuine repentance of their crookedness toward God and a real turn to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This indicates that they need to turn to God not only from their sins but also from their generation, their Jewish society, including their Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The result of such a salvation is an entrance into a new generation the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, the saved ones will be separated from Jewish society unto the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To be saved this way implies to be saved from God s condemnation and eternal perdition unto God s eternal purpose and His pleasure Eph 3:11; 1:9 .</S>
