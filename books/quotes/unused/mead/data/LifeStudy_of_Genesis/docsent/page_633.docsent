   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>LIVING THE KINGDOM LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Joseph's life under the heavenly vision was the life of the kingdom of the heavens described in Matthew 5, 6, and 7.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the constitution of the heavenly kingdom revealed in these chapters in Matthew, our anger must be subdued and our lust conquered Matt 5:21-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we claim to be the kingdom people, yet we cannot subdue our anger or conquer our lust, we are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead of being in the kingdom, we are on the seashore.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are those giving vent to our anger and indulging in lust.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But all the kingdom people subdue their anger and conquer their lust.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the kingdom life today, kings are being trained.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We, the kingdom people in the kingdom life, are being trained to be kings, to be Josephs, to be the reigning aspect of the mature life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For this, we must subdue our anger and conquer our lust.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What a wonderful picture Joseph's life is of our experience today!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Day by day, we are subduing our anger and conquering our lust.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead of agreeing with our anger or cooperating with our lust, we reject our anger and condemn our lust, because we are the reigning aspect of the mature life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have the constitution of Christ within us, and we are being prepared to reign as kings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>ENJOYING</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE LORD'S PRESENCE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A life such as Joseph's always has the presence of the Lord 39:2-5, 21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Wherever the presence of the Lord is, there is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you have the presence of the Lord, the authority of the Lord will be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, in captivity Daniel had the Lord's presence; therefore, the Lord's authority was with him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even a child in a family may have the Lord's presence and therefore be the genuine authority in that family.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the case of Joseph, Potiphar, an officer in Pharaoh's palace, was in control of things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, however, Potiphar was under Joseph's control because Joseph had the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Also consider Joseph's experience in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although there was a ruler over the prison, eventually this ruler was not the actual ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, Joseph, a prisoner who had the presence of God, became the ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Both in Potiphar's house and in the prison Joseph became king.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Wherever the constitution of Christ goes with the presence of God, there will be the reigning part.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the coming kingdom it will be this part that will be the co-kings with Christ in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, the reigning aspect of the mature life is a life that always enjoys the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The authority in this universe is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Wherever His presence is, there is authority, the ruling power.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As long as we have the Lord's presence, we have authority, even if we are in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although we may be prisoners, we shall eventually become rulers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We shall rule wherever we are.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This indicates that we are the reigning aspect of the mature life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A. Prospered by the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the presence of the Lord, Joseph was prospered by Him 39:2-3, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Where the presence of the Lord is, there is not only the Lord's authority, but also prosperity brought about by the Lord's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>While Joseph was undergoing ill-treatment, he enjoyed the prosperity that came to him under the Lord's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>B. The Favor with the Lord's Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the Lord's presence, Joseph was favored with the Lord's blessing wherever he was.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord's blessing always accompanies prosperity under His sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When Joseph enjoyed prosperity, he and those who were involved with him were blessed 39:4-5, 22-23 .</S>
