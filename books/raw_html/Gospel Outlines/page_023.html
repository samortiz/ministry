<h1 class="title">THE ELECTION OF GRACE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Gen. 25:21-26; Rom. 9:10-13<br />
Grace is the gospel. Election is also the gospel.</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>God&rsquo;s salvation is not of works<br />
<span class="normal">This gospel message is to correct men&rsquo;s wrong concept of placing emphasis on good works.</span>
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>First point out that everyone has a concept that men&rsquo;s work counts before God, and that men&rsquo;s work can please God. Nearly all religions rely on works for God&rsquo;s reward.</li>
	<li>The Bible reveals to us that God&rsquo;s salvation has nothing at all to do with men&rsquo;s works. The revelation of the Bible is contrary to men&rsquo;s thinking. Use the story of Jacob as an illustration. Jacob was a saved one. God had determined to grant him salvation before he was even born, much less before he could perform any works. This proves that God&rsquo;s salvation is not of men&rsquo;s works.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s grace is free&mdash;Romans 4:4
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Make it clear that grace does not require man to pay a price.</li>
	<li>Make it clear that works require a price; it takes effort.</li>
	<li>Works are contradictory to grace. The two do not go together. This means that it is either grace without works, or works without grace.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Salvation is all of grace
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Point out that salvation is all of God&rsquo;s grace, which is something God freely gives to men.</li>
	<li>Mention that salvation includes forgiveness, justification, obtaining life, living a holy life, inheriting a heavenly inheritance, and eternal blessings. All these are the elements of God&rsquo;s salvation, which God gives to men freely because of His grace.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s election
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s election is for God&rsquo;s salvation. Whoever receives God&rsquo;s salvation is one of God&rsquo;s elect. Election is the procedure, whereas salvation is the purpose. So God&rsquo;s election is for God&rsquo;s salvation.</li>
	<li>Salvation is by grace, and election is also by grace. Use Jacob&rsquo;s story as an illustration. Jacob was saved by God, and he was elected by God. It was all of God&rsquo;s grace and not of his own works.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Receiving God&rsquo;s election
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s election is made known to us through the gospel. Through the gospel God announces to us that God has chosen us.</li>
	<li>To believe the gospel is to receive the election, and to reject the gospel is to reject the election. The fact that God allows you to hear the gospel now means that God has stretched forth His hand to choose you. The question now is whether you believe the gospel or reject it.</li>
	<li>To believe the gospel you must repent, confess, and receive Christ as your Savior.</li>
	<li>All those who receive Christ are the elected ones, and by their receiving they become the saved ones.</li>
	</ol></li>
