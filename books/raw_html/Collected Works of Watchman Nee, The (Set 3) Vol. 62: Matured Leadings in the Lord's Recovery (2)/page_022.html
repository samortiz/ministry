<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">DEMONSTRATION ON<br />HOW TO CONDUCT A BIBLE STUDY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:February 20, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong<br />Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee<br />Scripture Reading:Rom. 1:1</h1><h2 class="head1">ROMANS 1:1</h2><h2 class="head2">"Slave," "Separated," "the Gospel of God"</h2><p>Romans 1:1 says, "Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, a called apostle, separated unto the gospel of God." In ancient custom and law, a slave was a person owned by his master. The master had absolute right over his slave. He could even dictate whether the slave should live or die. Paul was such a slave of Christ. He was bought by Christ, not merely hired by Him as a servant. Paul was also a called apostle. This is like a doctor, who is called to heal. Paul was "separated" specially for the gospel of God. The expression unto the gospel of God implies propagation and defense. Paul not only preached the gospel with his mouth; his entire being was separated unto the gospel. Even his tent making was for the gospel. Whether or not he preached with his mouth was a separate issue; the main thing was that his entire being was for the gospel.</p><p>Henry Alford maintained the King James translation of servant instead of slave. He said that slave implies someone without any freedom of his own. But an apostle is one who is called by God in a particular way; he possesses the highest office. The word apostle, or "sent one," is not used in a general sense; it carries a higher and more special meaning. The twelve apostles, plus James the brother of the Lord, as well as Paul, had received such a title. Only those who are specially called by God can be called an "apostle."</p><p>Paul said that he was the least of the apostles, one chosen by the grace of God (1 Cor. 15:9-10). He was separated by God in a special way, even from his mother's womb (Gal. 1:15). Paul was separated unto the gospel of God. The expression the gospel of God tells us that this gospel is of God. The word God is a possessive noun qualifying the gospel; it is not in apposition to the gospel. This gospel comes from God. This means that salvation comes absolutely from grace.</p><p>Simply speaking, Paul, as a slave, had no liberty of his own. Like it or not, he belonged to God. This calling was not a common calling. If it were, everyone would have had such a calling. As soon as a person believes in the Lord, he is a called saint (Rom. 1:7). This is the common calling, but Paul's calling was special. We can see how special his calling was from Acts 9 (vv. 3-19). Finally, this gospel is the gospel of God. This means that the very nature of this gospel is of God.</p><p>H. C. G. Moule said that Paul took Jesus Christ as his absolute master. This is the reason he adopted the title "a slave of Jesus Christ." He said that the word slave denotes two things: one who is bought with a price, and one who surrenders himself. The gospel of God in a particular sense is the gospel of Christ, for only in Christ is God truly revealed (John 17:3).</p><h2 class="head2">"Jesus Christ" versus "Christ Jesus"</h2><p>The expression Jesus Christ is used only eight times in this book. In Acts it is used over ten times, and in the Gospels it is used five times. In the Epistles, most of the time the expression used is Christ Jesus. Jesus and Christ are two different names of the Lord during two different periods of His life. Jesus is the name the Lord took as a man on earth. Christ is the name the Lord took in resurrection when He was exalted and confirmed by God. Jesus Christ refers to the fact that Jesus, the One who once lived on earth, is now exalted and confirmed by God (Acts 2:36). This speaks of His living on earth and His glorification on the throne. The expression Christ Jesus emphasizes Christ, the One who has received the glory. This Christ has the name Jesus appended to it, showing us that the glorified Christ is the very Jesus who was once a man. In the entire New Testament, we only see the expression in Christ Jesus, never in Jesus Christ. We can only be in Christ, not in Jesus. Even if we were able to live at the time that the Lord Jesus lived on earth and even if we were able to live like Jesus, we could never have gone to the cross and borne man's sins. If we were in Him while He was on earth, we would have partaken of the redemptive work of the cross. This is contrary to the truth. Everything was done by Him alone on our behalf. We have not done anything for Him. God has put us in Christ. We are in Christ Jesus through the Holy Spirit. When the Bible speaks of the Lord Himself, it uses the expression Jesus Christ, and when it speaks of our position in Christ, it uses the expression Christ Jesus.</p><p>There are two schools of thought regarding the translation of Romans 1:1. One renders Jesus Christ, while the other renders Christ Jesus. Those who translate Christ Jesus think that Paul first saw the glory of Christ and then willingly became a slave of Christ to "preach...Christ Jesus as Lord" (2 Cor. 4:5a). But those who translate Jesus Christ say that Paul was emphasizing his being a slave of Jesus, not a slave of Christ. Men despise Jesus Christ, but Paul was willing to be His slave. He considered himself a slave of Jesus Christ, bought by Him through His redemption, death, and shedding of blood. Paul's declaration was his honoring and exaltation of this Jesus Christ. As far as Paul was concerned, he knew the excellency of Christ already. He was clear about His excellency and His glory, but now he wanted others to know the excellency of the man Jesus. His preaching was not only to make known "Christ Jesus as Lord," but himself "as your slaves for Jesus' sake" (2 Cor. 4:5b).</p><p>Moule argued against Alford, saying that the word servant should be slave, meaning someone bought and someone who submits willingly. On the one hand, Christ bought Paul with His own blood unto Himself. On the other hand, Paul willingly submitted and offered himself to be a slave of Christ. We are slaves of Christ in both of the above senses.</p>
