This fellowship will be the release of the crystallization of the entire Bible. The first verse of the Bible, Genesis 1:1, says, &#8220;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.&#8221; Then Revelation 22:21, the last verse, says, &#8220;The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen.&#8221; This concluding verse is based upon the revelation of the New Jerusalem. At the beginning of the Bible, God is revealed. At the end of the Scripture, the New Jerusalem is revealed as the consummation of God&#8217;s move. This is the whole Bible. The summarized content of the whole Scripture is God at the beginning and the New Jerusalem at the end. We need to be impressed with these two things: God and the New Jerusalem.<p>The Bible has been studied, taught, and interpreted for nearly twenty centuries by thousands of teachers. We thank God for this. What they have seen we inherit, so today we are standing on the shoulders of all the foregoing teachers of the Bible. In this sense, we can &#8220;touch the heavens&#8221; easier than they could. Today the Bible is open to us, from the first page to the last page. It is as clear as crystal. I am burdened and trying to release what we have seen in the past seventy years in a brief and crystallized way.<p>God&#8217;s revelation and God&#8217;s move cover the entire Bible. In this first message we want to stress five things: the Triune God, His word, His revelation, His vision, and His move.<h2 class=head1>I. THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Triune God Being the Source of the Divine Revelation</h2><p>The Triune God is the source of the divine revelation. With Him there is no beginning, but He is the beginning of all things. The Triune God is self-existing and ever-existing.<h2 class=head2>B. Revealed as the Triune God in the Divine Revelation throughout the Whole Scriptures</h2><p>This self-existing and ever-existing God is revealed as the Triune God. This was a great discovery of the church fathers. Although the Bible does not use the word triune, the church fathers saw the fact that God is triune in the divine revelation throughout the whole Scriptures. In Matthew 28:19 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; After the Lord&#8217;s speaking in many books, from Genesis to Matthew, He suddenly spoke of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. If we had been there, we would have been shocked. We might have asked, &#8220;Lord, I never heard about these three. Who is the Father? Who is the Son? Who is the Spirit?&#8221; They are the composition of the Triune God. God is triune; He is three, yet one.<p>The first verse of Genesis says that in the beginning God created. The word for God here is in the plural. Then in Genesis 1:26 God said something to Himself. He said, &#8220;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.&#8221; At the end of chapter three God said, &#8220;The man is become as one of us&#8221; (v. 22). The word us shows that God is plural. He is one, but three; He is triune. The Lord told us at the end of Matthew that we are to baptize people into the name (singular) of the three (plural). There is one name for the Triune God.<h2 class=head1>II. THE TRIUNE GOD&#8217;S WORD</h2><p>This Triune God is so great and purposeful. He has His purpose and His desire. According to His desire, He made a plan, an eternal economy. In the New Testament, especially in the Epistles of Paul, this economy is strongly stressed. Paul in 1 Timothy 1:3-4 told Timothy to charge certain ones not to teach other things, only the economy of God. There is an economy of God in the whole universe. In order to carry out His economy, God has to speak.<h2 class=head2>A. The Speaking God</h2><p>The Triune God is a speaking God (Heb. 1:1-2). What if there were no speaking of God in the universe? If God had not spoken, we would not exist. The Bible says that every created thing came out of the word of God. In Hebrews 1:1-2 Paul said that our God is a speaking God. He has been speaking through the prophets in different ways, and now He is still speaking through His Son. His Son, Jesus Christ, is the Word of God. When someone is ministering the word of God in the Spirit, apparently it is he who is speaking, but actually it is Christ, the Son of God, speaking. This minister of the word is nothing, but out of his lips something comes from One who is everything. God is still speaking today.<h2 class=head2>B. The Triune God&#8217;s Speaking Becoming His Written Word-the Holy Scriptures</h2><p>Second Timothy 3:16 says that all Scripture is God&#8217;s breathing. God is breathing, exhaling. His spoken word was taken down to be the written word, which is the holy Scripture. God&#8217;s word was not only spoken but also written. Thank God that for nearly twenty centuries this spoken and written word has also been interpreted, taught, to God&#8217;s people.<h2 class=head1>III. THE TRIUNE GOD&#8217;S REVELATION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Triune God&#8217;s Word Containing and Conveying His Divine Revelation</h2><p>Outside of the holy Scriptures, there is no further revelation of God. God&#8217;s revelation, from the beginning to the ending, is contained in His word and conveyed to us through His word. If you are going to have God&#8217;s revelation, you have to come to the Scriptures, from Genesis to Revelation. Thus, the end of the book of Revelation warns us not to add anything or cut off anything from the word of God (22:18-19). This is blasphemy, a big sin. The holy Scripture has been completed. The Mormons&#8217; founder, Joseph Smith, claimed that he received some revelation in addition to the Bible. That is demonic. Anyone who claims to have a revelation other than the Bible&#8217;s revelation is blasphemous to God.<h2 class=head2>B. Through His Spirit</h2><p>The word of God becomes the revelation of God through His Spirit (Eph. 1:17). The Bible has been printed in many different languages. The content is the same to everyone, but how can we receive revelation from the Bible? A late Chinese philosopher who was an ambassador to the United States read the Bible, but he received only the letter of the written word. Many Christians have done the same thing. This is wrong.<p>When we come to the Bible, we have to prepare ourselves. We are getting ourselves prepared to read the word of God, not a newspaper or any secular book. First, we should come to God saying, &#8220;God, I am sinful; forgive me. I am mistaken; forgive me. I do not love You; forgive me. Even I do not fear You; forgive me.&#8221; We have to make a thorough confession of our sins. Then right away we enter into fellowship with God, and that fellowship is nothing less than God the Spirit. God&#8217;s fellowship is God&#8217;s Spirit. When we are in the Spirit of God, we are in fellowship with God. When we are outside the Spirit of God, we are not in the fellowship.<p>We must confess all of our sins to make ourselves pure and clean, without any hindering thing between us and God. Then we are in God&#8217;s fellowship. At that time we are in the Spirit of God, and when we come to the Bible, it is different. This is what we have learned-to study the Bible in the Spirit, in God&#8217;s fellowship.<p>Then we have to pray-read, not just read, the Word. As we read Genesis 1:1 we should pray, &#8220;God, thank You. In the beginning You created the heavens. O created the heavens! Created the heavens!&#8221; Learn to pray-read. Throughout the centuries, all the devoted lovers of the Lord and students of the Bible practiced pray-reading in fact, though they did not have the term pray-reading. Some in the past pointed out that we have to read the Bible prayerfully. To read the Bible prayerfully is to pray-read.<p>We teach the practice of pray-reading based upon Ephesians 6:17-18. We receive the word of God by means of all prayer, by different prayers-by shouting, by quietness, by singing, etc. I cannot tell you the tremendous amount of benefit I have received from pray-reading. In Ephesians 3 Paul said, &#8220;I bow my knees unto the Father...that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith...that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God&#8221; (vv. 14-19). When I read these verses long ago, I could understand only a little. Eventually, I realized that Christ&#8217;s making His home in our hearts is His building. Without building, how could there be a home? The only way through which I could get the help to understand these verses was by pray-reading them. There is much truth concerning these verses in the Life-study of Ephesians, and today I can give many more messages on them. A lot of verses in the Bible are beyond our understanding. We must pray-read the word in order to enter into their spiritual significance.<p>When we pray-read the word, the Spirit gives us the revelation (Eph. 1:17). Through our reading the word prayerfully, the Spirit makes the word a revelation.<h2 class=head1>IV. THE TRIUNE GOD&#8217;S VISION</h2><p>Now we need to see how the Triune God&#8217;s vision can come to us.<h2 class=head2>A. By the Divine Light Shining over the Divine Revelation</h2><p>When the divine light shines over the divine revelation, the divine revelation becomes the divine vision (Acts 26:19). A vision is a view whereby we may see something. If a person&#8217;s eyes are covered by a thick veil, there may be some wonderful scenery in front of him, but he is not able to see it. He cannot see because he has no vision, but when the veil is taken away he can see.<p>Many Christians read the Bible with a veil. This is why Paul said that we should look unto Christ with an unveiled face (2 Cor. 3:18). In 2 Corinthians 3 Paul said that when the sons of Israel read the books of Moses, they have a veil upon them and see nothing (vv. 13-15). Paul then said that whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away and that wherever the Spirit is, there is freedom (vv. 16-17). This means that when we are veiled, we are bound; we are imprisoned; we do not have freedom. When the veil is gone, we are released. This freedom comes from the Spirit of God. It is by the Spirit of God that we look unto the Lord with an unveiled face to be transformed into His image through the Lord Spirit.<p>We need to learn to come to the Bible every day by coming to God. We should confess our sins to make a clear situation so that we can have fellowship with God in the Spirit. Then we should read His word by pray-reading. Every day we will receive revelation; the Spirit will also shine over the revelation, and we will receive a vision. There is a progression from the word to revelation and from revelation to vision.<h2 class=head2>B. The Spirit of Revelation Giving Us the Sight to See the Vision and Understand It with His Wisdom</h2><p>In Ephesians 1:17 Paul asked the Lord to grant us a spirit of wisdom and revelation. When the Spirit shines over the revelation, the vision is here. Without the light, we cannot receive the vision, even if the veil is taken away. The veil should be gone; and the light should come. Furthermore, we need the sight. If we are blind, we will not be able to see anything, even if the veil is removed and the light is here. We need the revelation, the light, the vision through the light, and the sight. Then the veil is gone, the vision is here, and we have the light with the sight. We also have the understanding of the vision through the Spirit&#8217;s wisdom.<h2 class=head1>V. THE TRIUNE GOD&#8217;S MOVE</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Triune God Moving in His Divine Revelation and according to His Divine Revelation</h2><p>God moves all the time in and according to His divine revelation. In the age of Noah, God told Noah to build an ark to save him and his family. Noah spent his days working on that ark. No doubt, at that time there were many mockers who mocked what Noah was doing (cf. 2 Pet. 3:3-6). Noah could have told them, &#8220;God told me that the whole earth will be flooded, so we need an ark to save us.&#8221; The people would not believe him. Eventually, only eight members of Noah&#8217;s family entered into the ark. All others were destroyed by the flood. In Noah&#8217;s age, the move of God was to make an ark according to God&#8217;s revelation.<p>Then at Abraham&#8217;s time God told him to come out of his father&#8217;s land and immigrate to the good land. God&#8217;s word was for Abraham to stay in the good land, which would be his inheritance. At Moses&#8217; time God revealed to him that he should bring the law of God to God&#8217;s people and build up the tabernacle. These are examples in the Old Testament of the Triune God moving in and according to His divine revelation.<p>Now consider the New Testament. Peter was a fisherman whom the Lord called and attracted. Then the Lord gradually gave him revelation so that he came to know what the Lord would do in the New Testament age. It was the same with the apostle Paul. What the Lord wants to do in the New Testament age is to save many sinners who were chosen by God to be the members of Christ, to have the church built, and to have the Body of Christ produced from the building up of the churches. This Body of Christ will consummate in the New Jerusalem, and the New Jerusalem will be God&#8217;s eternal enlargement, expansion, and expression forever. This is the revelation of the entire New Testament.<p>Today we are at the end of the New Testament age. We should do what God is doing according to His revelation. He is moving and working in His revelation. This is why we have to know the Bible. Millions of Christians read the Bible, but they do not have the revelation or the vision. They do not know what God is doing today, so they establish things which are not in and according to the revelation of God. Thus, what they are doing is not in the move of God. Today we thank the Lord that we have seen the vision of God&#8217;s revelation, and we know how God is moving. We must be in His move.<h2 class=head2>B. For the Accomplishment of His Eternal Economy</h2><p>The Triune God&#8217;s move is for the accomplishment of His eternal economy (1 Tim. 1:4; Eph. 1:10; 3:9).<h1 class=series>THE TRIUNE GOD&#8217;S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO</h1><h1 class=title>THE SEQUENCE OF THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE BIBLE</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:1; Mal. 4:5-6; Matt. 1:1; Rev. 22:20-21</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The Old Testament-a figurative portrait of God&#8217;s eternal economy:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>In types-Genesis to Deuteronomy:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Unveiling the Triune God embodied in Christ as the center and circumference of His eternal economy.</li>		<li>Unveiling this Christ as the blessing and everything to the Triune God&#8217;s chosen people.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>In history-Joshua to Esther:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Unveiling the Triune God&#8217;s move in His chosen people to possess, inherit, and enjoy His promised all-inclusive Christ as the good land.</li>		<li>Unveiling the failures of His chosen people as a warning to His New Testament chosen people.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>In poetry-Job to Song of Songs:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Unveiling that the Triune God should be man&#8217;s pursuit as his perfection, and this God was incarnated to be a man in the flesh to be His Anointed, who is His delight and has been exalted by Him and who should be received, treasured, and exalted by His chosen people.</li>		<li>Unveiling that all things in the human life under the sun are vanity of vanities and Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God is the unique satisfaction to God&#8217;s chosen people.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>In prophecy-Isaiah to Malachi:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Unveiling that the Triune God embodied in Christ will come to be the God-man (Isa. 7:14; 9:6) to accomplish redemption (Isa. 53) for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s eternal economy according to the preceding three categories of the books in the Old Testament.</li>		<li>Unveiling that the accomplishment of the processed and consummated Triune God in Christ will consummate in the new heaven and new earth-Isa. 65:17; 66:22; 2 Pet. 3:13; Rev. 21:1.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><p>A concluding note:<br>All the above points present us a vivid portrait of the all-inclusive Christ in and for God&#8217;s eternal economy in the Old Testament. In types, we see that Christ is the centrality and universality of God&#8217;s eternal economy and the divine blessing to all God&#8217;s chosen people. In history, we see that the all-inclusive Christ is the God-promised good land that all God&#8217;s chosen people should take, possess, inherit, and enjoy to the uttermost, even to the level of kingship. In poetry, we see that Christ is the unique perfection for God&#8217;s chosen people to pursue after and the unique satisfaction for God&#8217;s chosen people to obtain and enjoy. In prophecy, we see that the Triune God has become a God-man to accomplish His full redemption for the fulfillment of His eternal economy which will consummate in the new heaven and new earth.</p></ol><p>God is speaking, and His speaking is for His moving. He moves by His speaking. For instance, He spoke, &#8220;Let there be light,&#8221; and light was there (Gen. 1:3). The previous message was concerning the Triune God, His word, His revelation, His vision, and His move. Now we want to see what the Bible unveils by considering the sequence of the arrangement of the Bible.<p>The entire Bible presents a picture that in the universe there is One who is. This One is God. He is triune, and He has been speaking throughout the generations. He has moved and is still moving in and according to His speaking. This move will consummate in the New Jerusalem. In its essence the Bible speaks about the Triune God and the New Jerusalem. This is simple but all-inclusive. The Bible begins with the Triune God, and it consummates with the New Jerusalem.<h2 class=head1>I. THE OLD TESTAMENT-A FIGURATIVE PORTRAIT OF GOD&#8217;S ETERNAL ECONOMY</h2><p>The Bible is of two parts, the Old Testament and the New Testament, but why is this so? We may say that the first part of the Bible, the Old Testament, presents a shadow, and the New Testament presents the reality. A person is the reality of his shadow. Now I would like to use a new term to describe the entire Old Testament. This new term is figurative portrait. The Old Testament is a figurative portrait of God&#8217;s eternal economy. A portrait, a picture, is a shadow. The Old Testament is a portrait but in figure.<p>The Bible unveils that the Triune God has a desire. He has a purpose, so He made a plan, an economy. He made this economy in Himself and in His Son, Christ. His economy concerns His coming to be born through incarnation, to live on this earth, and eventually to die an all-inclusive death on the cross. Then He entered into resurrection to release Himself as the divine life so that this life can be dispensed into many people chosen by Him before the foundation of the world to make these ones God-men. He is the unique God in His Divine Trinity, but through His incarnation, living on earth, death, and resurrection, He has made the many thousands of His chosen people the same as He is in life and in nature but not in His Godhead. They are the many God-men to be the members of the Body of Christ, and this Body is the organism of the processed, consummated Triune God to consummate in the New Jerusalem for His enlargement, expansion, and expression forever. This is a brief definition of God&#8217;s economy.<p>The figurative portrait of God&#8217;s eternal economy presented in the Old Testament spans thirty-nine books, but it is only in four sections-in types, in history, in poetry, and in prophecy. The section of types is of five books, from Genesis to Deuteronomy. The section of history is of twelve books, from Joshua to Esther. The section of poetry is of five books, from Job to Song of Songs. The section of prophecy is of seventeen books, from Isaiah to Malachi. There are five major prophets and twelve minor ones. Thus, the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament can be divided into three &#8220;fives&#8221; and two &#8220;twelves.&#8221; There are five books of types, twelve of history, five of poetry, five of the major prophets, and twelve of the minor prophets. The twelve minor prophets are from Hosea to Malachi. We want to see the intrinsic significance of these four sections of the Old Testament.<h2 class=head2>A. In Types-Genesis to Deuteronomy</h2><p>The types from Genesis to Deuteronomy unveil the Triune God embodied in Christ as the center and circumference of His eternal economy. They also unveil this Christ as the blessing and everything to the Triune God&#8217;s chosen people.<h2 class=head2>B. In History-Joshua to Esther</h2><p>The twelve books of history from Joshua to Esther unveil the Triune God&#8217;s move in His chosen people to possess, inherit, and enjoy His promised all-inclusive Christ as the good land. They also unveil the failures of God&#8217;s chosen people as a warning to His New Testament chosen people. God&#8217;s chosen people in the Old Testament became altogether a failure in God&#8217;s move. The record of this in the Bible is a warning to us, the church people today in the New Testament.<h2 class=head2>C. In Poetry-Job to Song of Songs</h2><p>The poetry in the Old Testament is only of five books: Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs. They unveil that the Triune God Himself, not ethics or morality, should be man&#8217;s pursuit as his perfection. This one sentence covers the central, intrinsic revelation of Job. The Psalms unveil that this God was incarnated to be a man in the flesh to be His Anointed, who is His delight, who has been exalted by Him, and who should be received, treasured, and exalted by His chosen people. Ecclesiastes unveils that all things in the human life under the sun are vanity of vanities, and Song of Songs shows that Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God is the unique satisfaction to God&#8217;s chosen people. Thus, we should pursue God as our perfection, and we should pursue after Christ as our satisfaction. God should be our perfection, and Christ can be our satisfaction.<h2 class=head2>D. In Prophecy-Isaiah to Malachi</h2><p>The seventeen books of prophecy from Isaiah to Malachi unveil that the Triune God embodied in Christ will come to be the God-man (Isa. 7:14; 9:6) to accomplish redemption (ch. 53) for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s eternal economy according to the preceding three categories of the books in the Old Testament. They also unveil that the accomplishment of the processed and consummated Triune God in Christ will consummate in the new heaven and new earth (Isa. 65:17; 66:22; 2 Pet. 3:13; Rev. 21:1).<h2 class=head2>E. A Concluding Note</h2><p>All the above points present us a vivid portrait of the all-inclusive Christ in and for God&#8217;s eternal economy in the Old Testament. In types, we see that Christ is the centrality and universality of God&#8217;s eternal economy and the divine blessing to all God&#8217;s chosen people. In history, we see that the all-inclusive Christ is the God-promised good land which all God&#8217;s chosen people should take, possess, inherit, and enjoy to the uttermost, even to the level of kingship. In poetry, we see that Christ is the unique perfection for God&#8217;s chosen people to pursue after and the unique satisfaction for God&#8217;s chosen people to obtain and enjoy. Then in prophecy we see that the Triune God has become a God-man to accomplish His full redemption for the fulfillment of His eternal economy which will consummate in the new heaven and new earth.<p>Isaiah prophesied about the new heaven and new earth for Christ to be the centrality and universality in the entire new heaven and new earth as illustrated by the New Jerusalem. In the four sections of the Old Testament Christ is revealed as the centrality and universality of God&#8217;s economy.<h1 class=series>THE TRIUNE GOD&#8217;S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE THREE</h1><h1 class=title>THE SEQUENCE OF THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE BIBLE</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>The New Testament-the practical fulfillment of God&#8217;s eternal economy:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Matthew to John unveil that the Triune God has been processed and consummated to be the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Through His incarnation to become the God-man.</li>		<li>Through His human living to live the God-man&#8217;s life.</li>		<li>Through His all-inclusive death to redeem His lost creation and to release His divine life.</li>		<li>Through His resurrection to dispense Himself into His redeemed chosen people as their life and everything.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Acts unveils the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit spreading Himself as the reality of Christ, who is the embodiment of God, for the producing of the churches of God.</li>	<li>Romans to Revelation unveil the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit building up the churches into the organism of the consummated Triune God as the Body of Christ, by transforming them into the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal enlargement and expression of the consummated Triune God.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>In this message we want to see the second part concerning the sequence of the arrangement of the Bible. The first part covered the Old Testament. The second part covers the New Testament.<h2 class=head1>II. THE NEW TESTAMENT-THE PRACTICAL FULFILLMENT OF GOD&#8217;S ETERNAL ECONOMY</h2><p>We have seen that the Old Testament is a figurative portrait of God&#8217;s eternal economy. The New Testament is the practical fulfillment of God&#8217;s eternal economy. The Old Testament is a portrait, and the New Testament is a fulfillment. A portrait is a picture, a photo. People may say that they have seen someone on a videotape, but actually they have not seen that person. They have seen his photo, his portrait. Later they may be glad to see the real person whom they saw on the video. The Old Testament is like a video. The New Testament is the real thing. It is not a portrait, but a fulfillment. The person in the fulfillment is exactly the same as his photo. There are twenty-seven books in the New Testament in three sections: the Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles. The Gospels are of four books; the Acts is one book; and the Epistles are of twenty-two books.<h2 class=head2>A. Matthew to John</h2><p>Some Christians would say in general that the four Gospels tell us the detailed history of Christ, including His being born of a virgin, His death on the cross, and His resurrection. Others may say that the Gospels reveal Christ in a fourfold way: in Matthew as a king, in Mark as a slave, in Luke as a man, and in John as God. Although this thought is very high, we want to go further to see the central, intrinsic revelation of the four Gospels. This revelation from Matthew to John is that the Triune God has been processed and consummated to be the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. The Triune God has been processed through incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection. He was also consummated to be a life-giving Spirit. At the end of the four Gospels, on the day of His resurrection, He came back to His disciples, breathed into them, and said, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; (John 20:22). After His resurrection, Christ is in us as the Spirit. In 1 Corinthians 15:45, Paul said that the last Adam, the embodied God, God embodied in a man, became the life-giving Spirit. Some opposers have argued that this does not mean that Jesus Christ is the Spirit. They said that 1 Corinthians 15:45 says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit, not the life-giving Spirit. But whether the article is definite or indefinite does not matter. If I say, &#8220;Here is a man,&#8221; or, &#8220;Here is the man,&#8221; a man is still a man. There is no difference. There is not another Spirit who gives life besides the Holy Spirit.<p>The Triune God has been processed through His incarnation to become the God-man, through His human living to live the God-man&#8217;s life, through His all-inclusive death to redeem His lost creation and to release His divine life, and through His resurrection to dispense Himself into His redeemed chosen people as their life and everything. Thus, the processed, consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is dispensed into His chosen, redeemed people to be their life and everything. The general teaching in today&#8217;s Christianity says only that Christ is the Redeemer, not that Christ is our life and everything.<h2 class=head2>B. Acts</h2><p>Acts unveils the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit spreading Himself as the reality of Christ, who is the embodiment of God, for the producing of the churches of God. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we received Him into us as the Spirit. Actually that Spirit is Christ, the reality of Christ.<h2 class=head2>C. Romans to Revelation</h2><p>Now we come to the last section of the New Testament, the twenty-two Epistles from Romans to Revelation.<p>In the four Gospels the church is mentioned only twice, in Matthew 16:18 and 18:17, but the Body of Christ is not mentioned. Acts speaks of the churches, but also does not mention the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is mentioned only in the Epistles. Actually, the first twenty-one Epistles unveil the Body of Christ, whereas Revelation reveals the New Jerusalem as the consummation of the Body of Christ. Romans 12:5 is the first verse in the entire New Testament that mentions the Body of Christ. This indicates that all the Epistles are for the Body of Christ. Other Epistles that speak of the Body of Christ are 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, and Colossians. These four books-Romans, 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, and Colossians-are the master books of the New Testament. If these books were taken away, the New Testament would become empty.<p>Romans to Revelation unveil the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit building up the churches into the organism of the consummated Triune God as the Body of Christ, by transforming them into the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal enlargement and expression of the consummated Triune God.<p>When we tell people what the New Testament unveils we should tell them what we have spoken of above concerning its three sections as the practical fulfillment of God&#8217;s eternal economy. It would be very good if we were able to recite the three definitions of these three sections.<h1 class=series>THE TRIUNE GOD&#8217;S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>THE WAY TO RECEIVE REVELATION FROM THE HOLY WORD AND SEE VISION THROUGH REVELATION</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 6:17-18; 1:17-18; Acts 26:16-19; 16:9-10; 1:8; 10:17-20</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The way to receive revelation from the holy Word:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To read the holy Word and apprehend its contents in facts:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To be familiar with the text.</li>		<li>By the help of the original text-Hebrew and Greek.</li>		<li>By learning to know the types-figures and shadows.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>To receive the divine revelation by exercising our spirit to contact the Lord through pray-reading-Eph. 6:17-18:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Not by our natural understanding ability.</li>		<li>Not by our fanciful imaginations.</li>		<li>But by the spirit of wisdom and revelation-Eph. 1:17.</li>		<li>Through much prayer in contacting the Lord.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>The way to see vision through the divine revelation:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Through the enlightenment of the divine light-Eph. 1:18b.</li>	<li>By contacting the Lord through the reviewing of the divine revelation in our spirit.</li>	<li>By having the spiritual sight-Eph. 1:18a.</li>	<li>The divine vision is mostly concerning God&#8217;s move-Acts 26:16-19; 16:9-10; 1:8; 10:17-20.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>In this message we want to see the way to receive revelation from the holy Word and see vision through revelation.<h2 class=head1>I. THE WAY TO RECEIVE REVELATION FROM THE HOLY WORD</h2><h2 class=head2>A. To Read the Holy Word and Apprehend Its Contents in Facts</h2><h2 class=head3>1. To Be Familiar with the Text</h2><p>To receive revelation from the holy Word, we must read the Word and apprehend its contents in facts. If we want to receive revelation from Genesis 1, we first have to read this chapter with our understanding and with our memory to apprehend the contents. We have to know that Genesis 1 is a record of God&#8217;s creation. Eventually, God created man and put this man in front of the tree of life. These facts are very important.<h2 class=head3>2. By the Help of the Original Text- Hebrew and Greek</h2><p>To apprehend the facts we need the help of the original text in Hebrew and Greek. No translation of the Bible is perfect. This is why, if possible, we should study Hebrew, the Old Testament language, and Greek, the New Testament language. We can also use the help of certain word studies of the Old and New Testaments.<h2 class=head3>3. By Learning to Know the Types</h2><p>We also need to learn to know the types-figures and shadows-in the Bible. The Old Testament is full of types. Nearly everything in Genesis 1 is a type of Christ. Romans 5:14 tells us that Adam is a type of Christ. The Song of Songs, a short book of eight chapters, is full of figures and shadows. In this book Christ is the henna flower (1:14), the myrrh (v. 13), and the apple tree (2:3). Eventually, Christ came to be the vine tree (John 15:1), and ultimately the tree of life (Gen. 2:9; Rev. 22:2).<h2 class=head2>B. To Receive the Divine Revelation by Exercising Our Spirit to Contact the Lord through Pray-reading</h2><h2 class=head3>1. Not by Our Natural Understanding Ability</h2><p>First, we need to read the holy Word to apprehend its contents. To read is by our mind. Then we need to receive the divine revelation, not by exercising our natural understanding ability, but by exercising our spirit to contact the Lord through pray-reading (Eph. 6:17-18). When I came to the United States to minister the word in the early sixties, many people told me that they had never before heard about the human spirit. That shocked me. If we do not know that we have a spirit or how to exercise, to use, our spirit, we cannot receive revelation from the holy Word. Without the exercise of the spirit, the holy Word remains only in letters, in facts, but it cannot be a revelation to us. But if we exercise our spirit, the written Word becomes the spiritual word, the word which is the Spirit, to be received not by our mind but by our spirit.<p>We have to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord because the Lord Himself is the Word (John 1:1). The Word, which is God, is God&#8217;s breathing, the Spirit (2 Tim. 3:16; Eph. 6:17). We must exercise the spirit to contact the Lord through pray-reading. Exercising our spirit, contacting the Lord, and pray-reading must be added together.<p>The term pray-read is based upon Ephesians 6:17-18, which says that we are to receive the word of God, which word is the Spirit, by means of all kinds of prayer, praying at every time in spirit. In these verses, we have the word, the Spirit of God, and our spirit exercised in pray-reading. Revelation comes from receiving the word, not just by the mind to understand it, but by the spirit exercised to contact the Lord through pray-reading it. When we pray-read, we have to exercise our spirit. Then we will receive revelation.<h2 class=head3>2. Not by Our Fanciful Imaginations</h2><p>We receive the divine revelation not by our natural understanding ability or by our fanciful imaginations. Some Christians, especially those who are Seventh-day Adventists, understand parts of the Bible by exercising their imagination. Mrs. White, who established the Seventh-day Adventists, told people a specific date on which Christ would return. Some of them prepared to receive Christ on that date, but He did not come. She also wrongly taught that Christians should keep the Sabbath day of the Old Testament.<h2 class=head3>3. By the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation</h2><p>We cannot receive the divine revelation through such fanciful imaginations. Instead, we receive it by the spirit of wisdom and revelation, spoken of in Ephesians 1:17. The spirit here is the mingled spirit, the divine Spirit mingled with the human spirit. Thank God that today in the universe there is not only the divine Spirit or only the human spirit but also the mingled spirit. God and man can be mingled together as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). Basically, the way to receive revelation is by the mingled spirit, that is, by the divine Spirit indwelling the human spirit. This mingled spirit is called the spirit of wisdom. This is for our understanding. If we have a revelation, we need the wisdom to interpret and understand it.<h2 class=head3>4. Through Much Prayer in Contacting the Lord</h2><p>To receive revelation from the holy Word we also need much prayer in contacting the Lord. Just as walking is the best way to exercise our legs, prayer is the best way to exercise our spirit. Nothing exercises our spirit as much as prayer does. The more prayer we have over the word, the more the light comes. Through prayer, we touch the word, the Spirit of God, and our spirit. The Spirit of God is Christ, and Christ is God. God, the word, the Spirit, Christ, and our spirit are blended together through prayer so that we can receive revelation.<h2 class=head1>II. THE WAY TO SEE VISION THROUGH THE DIVINE REVELATION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Through the Enlightenment of the Divine Light</h2><p>We must have the revelation first. Then that revelation under the enlightenment of the divine light (Eph. 1:18b) becomes a vision.<p>In order to illustrate this, let us consider the vision in chapters five and six of Song of Songs. In this book we can see that the lover of Christ, through living in Christ&#8217;s ascension as God&#8217;s new creation in resurrection, becomes mature and rich in life to be a garden to Christ (5:1). She also becomes the sanctuary of God in the heavens (6:4). Thus, she is a garden to Christ on the earth and a sanctuary of God in the heavens. The garden stresses the riches of Christ&#8217;s life with all kinds of beautiful trees and fragrant spices. The sanctuary of God in the heavens indicates that Christ&#8217;s life also has a building element.<p>The sanctuary in the heavens has a veil separating it into two parts; the outer part is the Holy Place, and the inner part is the Holy of Holies, where God Himself is. We may live in the sanctuary of God, yet still not be living within the veil, in the Holy of Holies. So there is a calling of Christ asking us to live within the veil where God is. The Holy of Holies is both God Himself and our spirit.<p>When the seeker enters within the veil, she becomes like the heavenly bodies, the moon and the sun, to be the shining of God&#8217;s light in the universe (6:10a). She also becomes a terrible army (v. 10b) to fight the spiritual warfare seen in Ephesians 6. Ultimately, she becomes a Shulammite (S.S. 6:13). The name Shulammite is the feminine form of Solomon, indicating that she has become Solomon&#8217;s duplication. Thus, the seeker and lover of Christ becomes five things: the garden, the sanctuary of God, the heavenly bodies, the terrible army, and the Shulammite. The New Jerusalem is the real and consummate Shulammite. This is the vision we can receive through being enlightened by the divine light.<p>We have to become a garden with the riches of Christ&#8217;s life for His enjoyment. Then we must become a sanctuary of God to be God&#8217;s building. We also have to pass through the dealing of the cross so we can live within the veil in God&#8217;s Holy of Holies. Then we become like the shining heavenly bodies. We are not only sanctified but also heavenly like God is. Such ones are God&#8217;s overcomers. These overcomers are a terrible army to fight down all the enemies of God as seen in Ephesians 6. This will usher in the New Jerusalem, typified by the Shulammite. The New Jerusalem, on the one hand, is God&#8217;s dwelling place, and on the other hand, is Christ&#8217;s wife, the Shulammite. The wife of Christ and Christ are joined together to be the New Jerusalem for God&#8217;s expression. That is the consummated Shulammite. By this we can see that the Song of Songs covers the entire New Testament.<h2 class=head2>B. By Contacting the Lord through the Reviewing of the Divine Revelation in Our Spirit</h2><p>I received the vision in Song of Songs 5 and 6 through reviewing the divine revelation again and again by contacting the Lord. We are one with the Lord in our spirit, so we must review the divine revelation in our spirit with the Lord. Then the light shines to bring us the vision. Otherwise, at most we can have only revelation but no vision. After we review the divine revelation again and again in our spirit with the Lord Himself, more light comes, and the vision is here for us to see.<h2 class=head2>C. By Having the Spiritual Sight</h2><p>We need the ability to see the vision, and the seeing ability is the sight. Paul prayed in Ephesians 1:18 that the eyes of our heart would be enlightened that we might see. We need not only the light but also the sight. There may be some wonderful scenery in front of us, but without the light, we cannot see a vision of this scenery. When the light comes, the vision is here. But if we do not have the sight, we will still not be able to see. We need the revelation plus the light plus the sight. The light comes from God; the sight is within us. The revelation plus the divine light with our sight brings us the vision.<h2 class=head2>D. The Divine Vision Being Mostly concerning God&#8217;s Move</h2><p>The book of Acts shows that the divine vision is mostly concerning God&#8217;s move. Paul saw a heavenly vision, and in this vision God charged Paul to move to preach the gospel to the Gentile world (Acts 26:16-19). Paul also saw a vision of a Macedonian calling him. Right away he moved from Asia across the sea to Macedonia, the southeastern part of Europe (16:9-10). That was a move. In Acts 1 the Lord told the disciples that they would receive the Spirit to witness for Him from Jerusalem through Judea and Samaria to the uttermost part of the earth (v. 8). Acts 10 records the vision which Peter received while he was praying (vv. 9-16; cf. 17-20). In that vision God charged Peter to move to the Gentiles through an Italian centurion named Cornelius. This shows that the vision we receive from the Lord will cause us to move. We move according to the vision we have seen.<h1 class=series>THE TRIUNE GOD&#8217;S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIVE</h1><h1 class=title>ILLUSTRATIONS OF RECEIVING REVELATION FROM THE HOLY WORD AND SEEING VISION THROUGH REVELATION</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Gen. 1</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The facts:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>God created the heavens and the earth, and the earth became waste and void-vv. 1-2a.</li>	<li>God restored and remade the universe by His Spirit, His word, and His light-vv. 2b-31:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>On the first day light came to divide the light (day) from the darkness (night)-vv. 3-5.</li>		<li>On the second day God made the firmament to divide the waters from the waters-vv. 6-8.</li>		<li>On the third day God gathered the waters under the heavens together unto one place, the dry land emerged, and the grass, herbs, and fruit trees were brought forth-vv. 9-13.</li>		<li>On the fourth day God made the stronger lights-sun, moon, and stars-vv. 14-19.</li>		<li>On the fifth day God created the aquatics in the seas and the birds in the air-vv. 20-23.</li>		<li>On the sixth day God made the beasts, the cattle, the insects, and the creeping things, and lastly, He created man in His image and after His likeness to rule over all His created things-vv. 24-31.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>Revelation:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>God&#8217;s creation was made according to His will for the accomplishment of His economy (Rev. 4:11; Eph. 1:10).</li>	<li>God&#8217;s creation is His testimony for man to know Him and seek after Him (Psa. 19:1-2; Rom. 1:20; Acts 14:15, 17; 17:24-27).</li>	<li>God&#8217;s creation was through Christ (John 1:3; Col. 1:16), the embodiment of the Triune God, as the Spirit who is His reality, as the Word of God which is the definition of God (John 1:1), and as the light.</li>	<li>The dry land typifies Christ resurrected, emerged, from the waters of death to produce all kinds of life:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The plant life typifies the rich expression of the unsearchable riches of the life of Christ:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>In its beauty for man&#8217;s sight (Gen. 2:9), in its fragrance (S.S. 1:12-13), and in its nourishing man and animals (Gen. 1:29-30).</li>			<li>In Christ being the trees (Gen. 2:9; Exo. 15:23-25; S.S. 2:3; Ezek. 34:29; Isa. 11:1; John 15:1, 5; Rev. 22:2), the flowers (S.S. 1:14), the food for man (John 6:9, 13; Matt. 14:19-20; 15:36-37, 26-27; Rev. 2:7, 17), and the offerings to God (Lev. 2:1-3, 14).</li>			</ol></li>		<li>The animal life in the sea typifies the riches of the life of Christ:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>In the power that overcomes death (salt water) in His living.</li>			<li>In feeding man with His riches (John 6:9a; 21:9).</li>			</ol></li>		<li>The animal life in the air typifies the riches of the life of Christ:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>In Christ as the eagle for carrying God&#8217;s redeemed to His destination (Exo. 19:4; Deut. 32:11-12; Isa. 40:31; Rev. 12:14).</li>			<li>In Christ as the turtledoves or pigeons for offering to God for the sins of God&#8217;s people (Lev. 1:14; 5:7).</li>			</ol></li>		<li>The beasts and the cattle on the land typify the riches of the life of Christ:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>In Christ as the lion (Gen. 49:8-9; Rev. 5:5) to fight for God&#8217;s economy.</li>			<li>In Christ as the sheep and oxen for offering to God for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s full redemption (Lev. 1:2-3, 10; 3:1, 6, 12; 4:3; 5:6; John 1:29; 1 Pet. 1:19; Rev. 5:6-8, 12-13; 12:11; 21:9, 23; 22:1, 3).</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	<li>Man typifies Christ (Gen. 1:26-28; Rom. 5:14; 1 Cor. 15:45; Psa. 8:4-8; Heb. 2:6-9):		<ol class="decimal">		<li>As the head of all creation (1 Cor. 11:3).</li>		<li>As God&#8217;s expression in God&#8217;s image and likeness (Heb. 1:3; 2 Cor. 4:4; Col. 1:15).</li>		<li>Representing God to rule over all things created by God (Gen. 1:28).</li>		</ol></li>	<li>God&#8217;s creation is centered on life to reach the goal of expressing and representing God.</li>	</ol></li><li>Visions:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>A vision to see that God created the heavens and the earth in order according to His purpose so that the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy (Job 38:7).

THE FACTS</h2><p>First, we must be familiar with the facts of the contents of the Bible.<h2 class=head2>A. God Creating the Heavens and the Earth</h2><p>The facts in Genesis 1 begin with God creating the heavens and the earth, and the earth becoming waste and void (vv. 1-2a).<h2 class=head2>B. God Restoring and Remaking the Universe by His Spirit, His Word, and His Light</h2><p>God restored and remade the universe by His Spirit, His word, and His light (vv. 2b-31). On the first day light came to divide the light, day, from the darkness, night (vv. 3-5). On the second day God made the firmament to divide the waters from the waters (vv. 6-8). On the third day God gathered the waters under the heavens together unto one place, the dry land emerged, and the grass, herbs, and fruit trees were brought forth (vv. 9-13). On the fourth day God made the stronger lights-sun, moon, and stars (vv. 14-19). On the fifth day God created the aquatics in the seas and the birds in the air (vv. 20-23). On the sixth day God made the beasts, the cattle, the insects, and the creeping things, and lastly, He created man in His image and after His likeness to rule over all His created things (vv. 24-31). These are the facts recorded in Genesis 1. Anyone who can read carefully can get these facts. But the Bible is more than a book of facts. It is a book of revelation. Thus, we have to learn how to receive revelation through the facts of the Word.<h2 class=head1>II. REVELATION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. God&#8217;s Creation Being according to His Will</h2><p>Genesis 1 reveals that God&#8217;s creation was made according to His will for the accomplishment of His economy (Rev. 4:11; Eph. 1:10).<h2 class=head2>B. God&#8217;s Creation Being His Testimony</h2><p>Genesis 1 also reveals that God&#8217;s creation is His testimony for man to know Him and seek after Him (Psa. 19:1-2; Rom. 1:20; Acts 14:15, 17; 17:24-27).<h2 class=head2>C. God&#8217;s Creation Being through Christ</h2><p>Genesis 1 shows that God&#8217;s creation was through Christ (John 1:3; Col. 1:16), the embodiment of the Triune God, as the Spirit who is His reality, as the Word of God which is the definition of God (John 1:1), and as the light. The Spirit, the Word, and the light were the instruments used by God to create the heavens and the earth. Christ is the Spirit, the reality of God; Christ is the Word, the speaking of God; and Christ is the light, the shining of God. Furthermore, the Spirit is of life, the Word is of life, and the light is of life.<h2 class=head2>D. The Dry Land Typifying Christ Resurrected, Emerged, from the Waters of Death to Produce All Kinds of Life</h2><p>In Genesis 1 the dry land emerging on the third day typifies Christ resurrected, emerged, from the waters of death to produce all kinds of life.<h2 class=head3>1. The Plant Life</h2><p>The plant life typifies the rich expression of the unsearchable riches of the life of Christ in their beauty for man&#8217;s sight (Gen. 2:9), in their fragrance (S.S. 1:12-13), and in their nourishing man and animals (Gen. 1:29-30). The plant life also typifies the rich expression of Christ&#8217;s life in Christ being the trees (Gen. 2:9; Exo. 15:23-25; S.S. 2:3; Ezek. 34:29; Isa. 11:1; John 15:1, 5; Rev. 22:2), the flowers (S.S. 1:14), the food for man (John 6:9, 13; Matt. 14:19-20; 15:36-37, 26-27; Rev. 2:7, 17), and the offerings to God (Lev. 2:1-3, 14). Christ fed five thousand with five loaves and two fish. The loaves are from the plant life, so that is the food for man. Also, the meal offering is made of fine flour of wheat for God&#8217;s people to eat as their food in their fellowship with God.<h2 class=head3>2. The Animal Life in the Sea</h2><p>The animal life in the sea typifies the riches of the life of Christ in the power that overcomes death (salt water) in His living. The water in the sea is salt water, but the fish still can live in it. That is a picture of Christ&#8217;s life in us, showing that we can live in this world against all the salt, the things of death. The animal life in the sea also shows the riches of Christ&#8217;s life in feeding man with His riches (John 6:9a; 21:9).<h2 class=head3>3. The Animal Life in the Air</h2><p>The animal life in the air typifies the riches of the life of Christ in Christ as the eagle for carrying God&#8217;s redeemed to His destination (Exo. 19:4; Deut. 32:11-12; Isa. 40:31; Rev. 12:14) and in Christ as the turtledoves or pigeons for offering to God for the sins of God&#8217;s people (Lev. 1:14; 5:7).<h2 class=head3>4. The Beasts and the Cattle on the Land</h2><p>The beasts and the cattle on the land typify the riches of the life of Christ in Christ as the conquering lion (Gen. 49:8-9; Rev. 5:5) to fight for God&#8217;s economy and in Christ as the sheep and oxen for offering to God for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s full redemption (Lev. 1:2-3, 10; 3:1, 6, 12; 4:3; 5:6; John 1:29; 1 Pet. 1:19; Rev. 5:6-8, 12-13; 12:11; 21:9, 23; 22:1, 3). John the Baptist declared that Christ was the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.<h2 class=head2>E. Man Typifying Christ</h2><p>Man typifies Christ (Gen. 1:26-28; Rom. 5:14; 1 Cor. 15:45; Psa. 8:4-8; Heb. 2:6-9) as the head of all creation (1 Cor. 11:3) and as God&#8217;s expression in God&#8217;s image and likeness (Heb. 1:3; 2 Cor. 4:4; Col. 1:15), representing God to rule over all things created by God (Gen. 1:28). Without the plant life, the animal life, and the human life, the earth would be waste and void. The earth&#8217;s beauty and riches are dependent upon all the different kinds of life.<h2 class=head2>F. God&#8217;s Creation Being Centered on Life</h2><p>God&#8217;s creation is centered on life to reach the goal of expressing and representing God. The Spirit, the word, and the light refer to life. The resurrected Christ is typified by the dry land producing all kinds of life. Eventually out of the dust of this land, God created a man in His image and after His likeness to represent and express Him.<h2 class=head1>III. VISIONS</h2><h2 class=head2>A. God Creating, Satan Rebelling, God Judging, and God Restoring</h2><p>We need a vision to see that God created the heavens and the earth in order according to His purpose so that the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy (Job 38:7). The morning stars and the sons of God here refer to the angels. After God&#8217;s original creation, God&#8217;s enemy Satan rebelled against God (Isa. 14:13-14; Ezek. 28:15-18), God judged the universe defiled by Satan&#8217;s rebellion (Job 9:5-7), and the earth became waste and void (Gen. 1:2). Then God restored the condemned universe mainly to restore the land, typifying Christ as the center of God&#8217;s economy, for the producing of all kinds of life for the accomplishment of His economy (Gen. 1:1-5).<h2 class=head2>B. Christ Typified by the Land as the Centrality and Universality of God&#8217;s Economy</h2><p>We need a vision to see that Christ, typified by the land, as the centrality and universality of God&#8217;s economy, resurrected, emerged, from the waters of death to produce, according to the riches of His life, lives in different aspects, typified by the plant life, the animal life in the sea and in the air, the beasts and cattle on the land, and the life of man to be one with God, expressing and representing God (Gen. 1:6-28).<h2 class=head2>C. The Triune God Making Man God&#8217;s Man for Producing the Body of Christ</h2><p>Finally, we need a vision to see that the Triune God, in Christ as His embodiment, made man God&#8217;s man, one with Him to be multiplied and duplicated for producing the Body of Christ as His enlargement and counterpart, as illustrated in the next chapter, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem (Gen. 1:26-28).<h1 class=series>THE TRIUNE GOD&#8217;S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIX</h1><h1 class=title>ILLUSTRATIONS OF RECEIVING REVELATION FROM THE HOLY WORD AND SEEING VISION THROUGH REVELATION</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Gen. 2</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The facts:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>God ordained the seventh day to be the Sabbath as a repose-vv. 1-3.</li>	<li>God created man in three parts-v. 7:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>A body made with the dust.</li>		<li>A spirit made with God&#8217;s breath of life for man to receive God.</li>		<li>A soul as the issue of the spirit meeting with the body.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>God put man into a garden in front of the tree of life, and by the side of the tree of life there was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which was prohibited to be eaten by man-vv. 8-9, 15-17.</li>	<li>From the place where the tree of life was, a river flowed out into four heads, and at the flow there were gold, bdellium, and onyx stone-vv. 10-14.</li>	<li>None of the living creatures created by God was qualified to be a mate to match man as his wife-vv. 18-20.</li>	<li>Jehovah caused man to sleep and took one of his ribs with which He built a wife to match man to be one body with him-vv. 21-25.</li>	</ol></li><li>The revelation:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The Sabbath, as a repose, divides God&#8217;s creation into two sections:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The first section was without the life of God.</li>		<li>The second section is centered on the life of God.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>God particularly made a spirit for man that man may receive Him as life and everything.</li>	<li>The tree of life signifies God as life to man that man could be completely like God in His appearance, life, and nature but not in His Godhead.</li>	<li>After God created man with a spirit, God put this man into the garden in front of the tree of life.

Instead, my intention is to use Genesis 1 and 2 as an illustration to instruct us in how to read the Bible properly. First, we need to get the facts from the record of the Bible. Today the Bible has been translated into more than one thousand languages and has become accessible for nearly everyone to read and receive its facts.<p>Furthermore, learning the Hebrew and Greek languages, the original languages with which the Bible was written, can help us to better understand the real meaning of the Bible. The translation of the Bible from the original languages is not an easy task. A popular Chinese translation translates the word spirit, the human spirit, as &#8220;spirit-soul&#8221; or &#8220;spirit-heart.&#8221; This means that the translators thought that man&#8217;s spirit, soul, and heart are the same thing. Such wrong translation leads people astray from the proper understanding of the Bible. This is why we must find out the real meaning of the facts according to Hebrew and Greek. Many Bible scholars and theological teachers understand the biblical languages, but they also make the mistake of saying that spirit and soul are synonyms. Paul, however, said in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 that God sanctifies us in our spirit and soul and body. The three nouns with two conjunctions strongly show that man is of three parts.<p>We have seen that we first need to get the facts from the Bible, but then we need to go on to receive revelation. Once we receive the revelation, we need to go further to see the vision. In these few messages, I have the burden to present illustrations of how to do this. Now let us consider the illustration from Genesis 2 of receiving revelation and vision through revelation.<h2 class=head1>I. THE FACTS</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Ordaining the Seventh Day to Be the Sabbath</h2><p>Genesis 2 tells us that God ordained the seventh day to be the Sabbath as a repose (vv. 1-3). The Sabbath is a separating repose between God&#8217;s creation work of six days and the eighth day.<h2 class=head2>B. God Creating Man in Three Parts</h2><p>Genesis 2:7 shows that God created man in three parts with a body made with the dust, a spirit made with God&#8217;s breath of life for man to receive God, and a soul as the issue of the spirit meeting with the body.<h2 class=head2>C. Putting Man into a Garden in Front of the Tree of Life</h2><p>God put man into a garden in front of the tree of life, and by the side of the tree of life there was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which was prohibited by God to be eaten by man (vv. 8-9, 15-17).<h2 class=head2>D. A River with Precious Materials</h2><p>From the place where the tree of life was, a river flowed out into four heads, and at the flow there were gold, bdellium, and onyx stone (vv. 10-14).<h2 class=head2>E. None of the Living Creatures Being Qualified to Match Man</h2><p>God brought all the created things to man to see what man would call them, so Adam named all the living things. None of the living creatures created by God was qualified to be a mate to match man as his wife (vv. 18-20).<h2 class=head2>F. Jehovah Building a Woman</h2><p>Jehovah caused man to sleep and took one of his ribs with which He built a wife to match man to be one body with man (vv. 21-25).<p>These are the facts of chapter two, but what do they mean? Why was there a repose, a Sabbath? Why is man&#8217;s spirit not mentioned in the account of God&#8217;s creation before the Sabbath? Genesis 1 says that God created man in His own image and after His own likeness, but it is not until Genesis 2, after the mentioning of the Sabbath, that man&#8217;s spirit is mentioned.<h2 class=head1>II. THE REVELATION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Sabbath, as a Repose, Dividing God&#8217;s Creation into Two Sections</h2><p>I was taught from my youth that the Sabbath was given to us by God so that we may remember that He is the Creator of the heavens and earth. But we need to see the real spiritual significance of the Sabbath. The Sabbath divides God&#8217;s creation into two sections. The first section was without the life of God. The life of God is not mentioned in Genesis 1. We see man only with the image and likeness of God but not with the life of God.<p>The second section of the account of God&#8217;s creation in Genesis 2 is centered on the life of God. The most striking item in Genesis 2 is the tree of life. A number of years ago, there was a famous teacher of the Bible who said that the tree of life is over today. But the tree of life is not over, because it is mentioned in Revelation as a reward to the overcomers (2:7) and as the eternal life supply for God&#8217;s redeemed in the New Jerusalem (22:2). The Sabbath divides the first section of God&#8217;s creation without the life of God from the second section with the life of God. This is the spiritual significance of the Sabbath.<p>After God&#8217;s creating work of six days, He had a repose on the seventh day, the Sabbath. Then on the eighth day everything is centered on the life of God, because God put the man whom He had created before the tree of life. The eighth day is the day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection. Our eighth day in the New Testament is from the day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection until the New Jerusalem. We all need a repose, a Sabbath, like Paul had on the road to Damascus when the Lord stopped him and brought him into the eighth day of Christ&#8217;s resurrection.<h2 class=head2>B. God Particularly Making a Spirit for Man</h2><p>God particularly made a spirit for man that man may receive Him as life and everything. Genesis 1 tells us that God created many things, but He did not give the details of His creation. But in chapter two He gave us a clear record with details. God created the body for man with the dust, and God breathed into him the breath of life. The Hebrew word for breath in Genesis 2:7 is the same word for spirit in Proverbs 20:27, which says that man&#8217;s spirit is the lamp of Jehovah. The soul is the issue of the spirit meeting with the body. God created man with a spirit so that man could receive Him as life and as everything.<h2 class=head2>C. The Tree of Life</h2><p>The tree of life signifies God as life to man so that man could be completely like God in His appearance, life, and nature but not in His Godhead. The tree of life is a figure signifying God as life. In the Gospel of John the Lord said, &#8220;I am...the life&#8221; (14:6a), and He also said that He is the vine tree (15:1). He is the life and He is the tree, so He is the tree of life. Revelation 2:7 says, &#8220;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life.&#8221; Then at the end of the Bible, the tree of life grows in the flow out of God&#8217;s throne to supply the entire New Jerusalem. This is the clear revelation.<h2 class=head2>D. God Putting Man in Front of the Tree of Life</h2><p>After God created man with a spirit, God put this man into the garden in front of the tree of life. This picture indicates that God wanted man to receive the tree of life.<h2 class=head2>E. The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</h2><p>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan as God&#8217;s enemy in God&#8217;s creation, implying that Satan is composed of knowledge and evil as well as good. This indicates that there is an opposer to God in the universe. God is to be life to man but Satan is to be knowledge, evil, and good to man which leads to death. God prohibited Adam from partaking of the tree of knowledge. If Adam had partaken of the tree of life, he would have received life, but instead he partook of the other tree and received death.<p>Satan tempted Eve with knowledge, causing her to doubt God&#8217;s word by asking, &#8220;Has God said...?&#8221; (Gen. 3:1). Eve was hooked because she answered him and was brought into the realm of the tree of knowledge. Such knowledge is a terrible thing. Many times the most learned ones are the hardest ones to convince about Christ. It is easier for a simple, uneducated person to get saved.<p>When the young people hear this word, they may wonder whether or not they should go to college. In 1977 I gave messages on the Life-study of Genesis in which I encouraged the young people to get the highest education. Many young people were helped by those messages which were concerning Hiram, the skillful builder of the pillars in God&#8217;s temple. In those messages however, I pointed out that after we gain our education it must be buried so that it can be useful in resurrection for God&#8217;s building (see Messages Eighty-five and Eighty-six of Life-study of Genesis, pp. 1093-1120). The apostle Paul received the highest education, being brought up at the feet of a learned rabbi named Gamaliel (Acts 22:3). After he was saved by the Lord, Paul&#8217;s education and capacity came up in resurrection to be used by the Lord for the building up of His Body.<h2 class=head2>F. The Flowing River</h2><p>The river that flowed out from the place where the tree of life was, signifies that the Spirit of God flows out of God as the river of the water of life with four heads to reach the four directions of the earth.<h2 class=head2>G. Gold, Bdellium, and Onyx Stone</h2><p>The gold, bdellium, and onyx stone at the flow of the river are precious materials for God&#8217;s building-the Body of Christ consummating in the New Jerusalem (1 Cor. 3:9; Rev. 21:18-21). Bdellium is a pearl made not from the oyster but from the resin of a tree. First Corinthians 3 says that we are God&#8217;s building built with gold, silver, and precious stones; furthermore, we should not build God&#8217;s building with wood, grass, and stubble (vv. 9-12). At the end of the Bible in Revelation, there is a city built with three precious materials-gold, pearls, and precious stones. Gold is the base, pearls are the gates, and precious stones are the wall and foundations. This shows that through the flow of the Holy Spirit, we are transformed into precious materials for God&#8217;s building, that is, the New Jerusalem. This is a great revelation.<h2 class=head2>H. No Living Creature and No Man Being Qualified to Match Christ</h2><p>None of the living creatures created by God in the first section of His creation was qualified to be the wife of man, signifying that no living creature and also no man are qualified to match Christ as His counterpart. Adam was a type of Christ (Rom. 5:14). He was seeking a wife, just as Christ was seeking the church to be His wife, His counterpart. But nothing in the old creation can match Christ to His counterpart. To match Christ we must have Christ&#8217;s life.<h2 class=head2>I. God Taking a Rib out of Man with Which He Built a Wife for Man</h2><p>God caused man to sleep and took a rib out of him with which He built a wife for man, signifying that Christ died according to God&#8217;s will and that from His side flowed His blood for redemption and His Spirit of life for life dispensing, through which His Body is built up and becomes one with Him in His life, nature, and expression, but not in His Godhead, as fully unveiled in the New Jerusalem. The King James Version says that God made the rib taken out of the side of Adam into a woman. The word made is a wrong translation. In Hebrew it says that God built a woman.<p>God caused Adam to sleep. That means God decided by His will to let Christ die. Then when Christ died on the cross, His side was pierced. From Adam&#8217;s side a rib came out, whereas from the side of Christ, blood and water came out (John 19:34). Blood signifies redemption. Water signifies the dispensing of the Spirit. The rib, according to the New Testament, signifies Christ&#8217;s unbroken life. When He was on the cross, the soldiers came to break His legs, but when they saw that He had already died, they did not do it. John 19:36 says, &#8220;For these things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled: &#8216;No bone of His shall be broken.&#8217;&#8221; Jesus&#8217; resurrection life is unbreakable. Eve is a prefigure of the New Jerusalem, which is built with the Lord&#8217;s resurrection life released out of Him.<h1 class=series>THE TRIUNE GOD&#8217;S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>ILLUSTRATIONS OF RECEIVING REVELATION FROM THE HOLY WORD AND SEEING VISION THROUGH REVELATION</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><h1 class=title>THE GREATEST AND HIGHEST VISION</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:1, 26-28; 2:7-25</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Covering the entire economy of God-Gen. 1-2.</li><li>God&#8217;s creation is for Him to be one with man.</li><li>In the first section of His creation God created man only in His image and after His likeness outwardly, without the life of God inwardly.</li><li>The second section of His creation begins with His making man a spirit and putting man in front of the tree of life.</li><li>Making a spirit for man and putting man in front of the tree of life indicate that God wanted man to receive Him as the tree of life to be man&#8217;s life and everything.</li><li>From the place of the tree of life, a river flowing and producing gold, bdellium, and onyx stone indicates that the flow of the life of God in the believers transforms them to be the three kinds of precious materials for the building of the Body of Christ as God&#8217;s eternal goal-1 Cor. 3:12; Rev. 21:18-21.</li><li>None of the living creatures was qualified to be Adam&#8217;s counterpart, wife, indicating that no natural life is qualified to match Christ as His counterpart.</li><li>God caused Adam to sleep, opened his side, took one of his ribs out of him, and built it into a woman who was fully qualified to be his counterpart, indicating that God put Christ to death and from His pierced side flowed blood for redemption and water for dispensing of life to produce the church to match Christ as His counterpart.</li><li>The rib of Adam taken out of him signifies the unbreakable life of Christ (John 19:33, 36) which flows as the living water of life.</li><li>This greatest and highest vision unveils God&#8217;s new creation as the second section of His creation in resurrection, out of His old creation as the first section of His creation in nature. It equals the entire revelation of the entire Bible, from God&#8217;s creation (Gen. 1), through His incarnation to present Himself as the tree of life to all the fallen people for the producing of the church, through His death, resurrection, and transforming work for the building up of His organic Body to match Him as His counterpart, unto the consummation in the New Jerusalem as a couple of the redeeming God and the redeemed people for God&#8217;s enlarged expression for eternity with the divine glory manifested in humanity.</li><li>God&#8217;s moves in all the ages are motivated by all the contents of this greatest and highest vision.</li></ol><h2 class=head1>I. COVERING THE ENTIRE ECONOMY OF GOD</h2><p>It is very hard to receive revelation and even harder to see a vision from Genesis 1 and 2, the first two chapters of the Bible. But the Lord in His mercy has opened up this part of His Word to us for many years. The vision in these two chapters is the greatest and highest vision. No vision is greater or higher than this vision, which covers the entire economy of God.<h2 class=head1>II. GOD&#8217;S CREATION BEING FOR HIM TO BE ONE WITH MAN</h2><p>God&#8217;s creation is for Him to be one with man. This is the first item of God&#8217;s economy strongly revealed in Genesis 1. Genesis 1 is a long chapter telling us how God created many things. Eventually, He created man in His own image and after His own likeness (v. 26). This indicates that God, in His economy, through creation, wants to be one with man. This is the first point of the greatest and highest vision. Genesis 1 contains only one major point, that is, in God&#8217;s creation, His intention is to be one with man.<h2 class=head1>III. MAN BEING IN GOD&#8217;S IMAGE AND AFTER GOD&#8217;S LIKENESS BUT WITHOUT THE LIFE OF GOD</h2><p>In the first section of His creation, God created man only in His image and after His likeness outwardly, without the life of God inwardly.<h2 class=head1>IV. THE SECOND SECTION OF GOD&#8217;S CREATION</h2><p>The second section of God&#8217;s creation begins with His making a spirit for man and putting man in front of the tree of life (Gen. 2:7-9). This second section is a picture of God&#8217;s new creation, which starts with man&#8217;s spirit and with the tree of life, signifying that God is to be taken by man through man&#8217;s spirit, that man may have God&#8217;s divine life. At the end of the first section of God&#8217;s creation, there was a repose, a Sabbath. Then the second section of God&#8217;s creation, which becomes God&#8217;s new creation, begins with two things: man&#8217;s spirit and God as life to be received by man through his spirit.<h2 class=head1>V. GOD DESIRING TO BE MAN&#8217;S LIFE AND EVERYTHING</h2><p>God&#8217;s making a spirit for man and putting man in front of the tree of life indicate that God wanted man to receive Him as the tree of life to be man&#8217;s life and everything.<h2 class=head1>VI. THE FLOW OF THE LIFE OF GOD IN THE BELIEVERS TRANSFORMING THEM INTO PRECIOUS MATERIALS FOR THE BUILDING OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p>From the place of the tree of life, a river is flowing and producing gold, bdellium, and onyx stone (Gen. 2:10-12). This indicates that the flow of the life of God in the believers transforms them to be the three kinds of precious materials for the building of the Body of Christ as God&#8217;s eternal goal (1 Cor. 3:12; Rev. 21:18-21).<p>There are only three places in the Bible which mention three kinds of materials: Genesis 2, 1 Corinthians 3, and Revelation 21. Genesis 2 speaks of gold, bdellium (pearl), and onyx stone, a precious stone. First Corinthians 3 says that we must be careful how we build up God&#8217;s building. We have to build it with gold, silver, and precious stones (v. 12). Eventually, at the end of the Bible, the consummation of God&#8217;s building is the New Jerusalem built with gold, pearl, and precious stones.<p>This is a great vision to show us that after man receives God&#8217;s life, this life flows in and out of man as a river of living water to produce transformed material. Man has been regenerated in his spirit by receiving God as life, but his soul remains in the old creation of God. This soul has to be transformed into precious material. Gold signifies God&#8217;s divine nature, pearl signifies Christ&#8217;s redeeming and life-releasing death and His life-imparting resurrection, and precious stones signify the work of the transforming Spirit.<p>The New Testament stresses transformation. First, the New Testament shows us the regeneration of man&#8217;s spirit to receive God as life. Then following this the New Testament stresses that we need to be transformed in our mind (Rom. 12:2). This indicates that transformation transpires in our soul to make us a new man. Our soul was an old man of the old creation, but after our spirit has been regenerated, our soul is then transformed from the old creation into the new creation to be a new man.<h2 class=head1>VII. NO NATURAL LIFE BEING QUALIFIED TO MATCH CHRIST</h2><p>None of the living creatures was qualified to be Adam&#8217;s counterpart (Gen. 2:20), indicating that no natural life is qualified to match Christ as His counterpart. The man of the old creation has nothing to do with Christ, especially to be Christ&#8217;s counterpart, Christ&#8217;s wife.<h2 class=head1>VIII. PRODUCING THE CHURCH TO MATCH CHRIST AS HIS COUNTERPART</h2><p>God caused Adam to sleep, opened his side, took one of his ribs out of him, and built it into a woman who was fully qualified to be Adam&#8217;s counterpart (Gen. 2:21-22). This indicates that God put Christ to death and from His pierced side flowed blood for redemption and water for dispensing of life to produce the church to match Christ as His counterpart (John 19:34). This is a very crucial point and a great type. Adam did not find anyone to match him to be his counterpart, so God caused Adam to sleep, opened up his side, took out one of his ribs, and built this rib into a woman. Genesis 2:22 in the Hebrew does not say that God made a woman of this rib but that He built this rib into a woman. This woman is fully described in the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem will be Christ&#8217;s wife, Christ&#8217;s counterpart.<h2 class=head1>IX. THE UNBREAKABLE LIFE OF CHRIST</h2><p>This wife came from Christ&#8217;s side, which was pierced to flow out blood and water. The living water typifies Christ&#8217;s resurrection life, which is also typified by the bone, the rib, in Genesis 2. Nothing can break the Lord&#8217;s resurrection life. The Lord&#8217;s side was pierced on the cross, but not one of His bones was broken (John 19:33, 36). Only Christ&#8217;s life is unbreakable, just as His bones were not broken. All other lives are breakable. The rib of Adam taken out of him signifies the unbreakable life of Christ, which flows as the living water of life.<h2 class=head1>X. UNVEILING GOD&#8217;S NEW CREATION</h2><p>This greatest and highest vision unveils God&#8217;s new creation as the second section of His creation in resurrection, out of His old creation as the first section of His creation in nature. The first section is the old creation, so it is in nature, natural. But the second section refers to the new creation of God in resurrection. Everything in the new creation has passed through death and resurrection. Eve was produced through Adam&#8217;s sleep, signifying death, and through Adam&#8217;s rib, signifying resurrection. This shows that the church comes out of Christ&#8217;s death plus Christ&#8217;s resurrection.<p>The greatest and highest vision equals the entire revelation of the entire Bible, from God&#8217;s creation (Gen. 1) through His incarnation to present Himself as the tree of life to all the fallen people for the producing of the church, through His death, resurrection, and transforming work for the building up of His organic Body to match Christ as His counterpart, unto the consummation in the New Jerusalem as a couple of the redeeming God and the redeemed people for God&#8217;s enlarged expression for eternity with the divine glory manifested in humanity. We should notice that in the previous long sentence, there are the words from, through, and unto. The Bible&#8217;s record begins from God&#8217;s creation. Then the record of the Bible goes on through God&#8217;s incarnation, death, resurrection, and transforming work for the building up of Christ&#8217;s Body. This is unto the New Jerusalem.<p>The Old Testament in Genesis speaks of God&#8217;s creation. The following thirty-eight books of the Old Testament are full of types and prophecies of Christ and the church. The main prophecies concerning Christ are in Isaiah, which says that a virgin will bring forth a son whose name will be called Immanuel (7:14). This is a prophecy of Christ&#8217;s incarnation. Isaiah 53 gives us a clear, detailed record of Christ&#8217;s death. At the end of Isaiah 53, there is a short section referring to Christ&#8217;s resurrection (vv. 10-12). Isaiah also refers to the new heaven and new earth where the New Jerusalem will be (65:17; 66:22). Eventually, all the types and prophecies are fulfilled through the coming of Christ in the New Testament to carry out His eternal economy.<p>Genesis 1 and 2 present not just the facts of God&#8217;s creation, not just revelations from God&#8217;s creation, but a big vision, the unique vision, the greatest and the highest vision of God&#8217;s entire economy. God&#8217;s entire economy comprises two parts: God&#8217;s old creation and God&#8217;s new creation. The old creation occupies only Genesis 1. The picture of God&#8217;s new creation starts from Genesis 2 with God making a spirit for man and putting man in front of the tree of life. Then the life of God flows out of the regenerated believers to transform them into precious materials for the building of God. The building of God is of two parts. First there is the Body of Christ as the origin, and second, the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation.<p>According to Genesis 1 and 2, God&#8217;s economy comprises only four main things. The first is God&#8217;s creation, the old creation. The second is God&#8217;s making man a spirit with which man can receive Him as the tree of life to be man&#8217;s life. The third is the flowing river which signifies that the life of God flows out of the believers to produce three kinds of precious materials for God&#8217;s building as God&#8217;s goal. The fourth is that nothing natural is qualified to be Christ&#8217;s counterpart. Only the life that comes out of Christ is built into a wife to match Christ as His counterpart. This building is a woman, built with Christ&#8217;s unbreakable resurrection life for God&#8217;s eternal enlargement and expression. Eventually, the building of God is the New Jerusalem. On the one hand, the New Jerusalem is built with the precious materials in the flow of God&#8217;s life. On the other hand, the New Jerusalem is built with Christ&#8217;s unbreakable resurrection life. This is the greatest and highest vision in the Bible, and this is God&#8217;s economy.<h2 class=head1>XI. GOD&#8217;S MOVES IN ALL THE AGES</h2><p>God&#8217;s moves in all the ages are motivated by all the contents of this greatest and highest vision.<h2 class=head1>THE FACTS AND THE RECORD</h2><p>God made Adam out of the dust of the ground, and made a spirit for him on the sixth day. Genesis 1 also says that on the sixth day God created man and woman. But we also need to see that the Bible is a particular book even in the way that it records things. The facts are one thing in the Bible, whereas the record is another thing. Quite often God counts on the record, not just on the facts, to unveil something.<p>As an illustration of this, let us consider the case of Melchisedec in Hebrews 7. This chapter says that he was without father, without mother, and without genealogy (v. 3). Surely the Melchisedec in Genesis 14 had a father and mother, but in God&#8217;s record nothing is mentioned about his father, his mother, or his genealogy. This is because God wanted to use him to typify Christ as the One from eternity. The record in Genesis 1 and 2 is similar to this because God wants to use the two sections of the record of His creation to show us something. The creation of Adam&#8217;s spirit and the building of Eve were recorded not in the first section of the old creation, but in the second section, which displays the new creation. This is very meaningful.<h1 class=series>THE TRIUNE GOD&#8217;S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE EIGHT</h1><h1 class=title>THE TRIUNE GOD&#8217;S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; Rev. 21:1-2</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The facts:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>God was incarnated to be a man in the flesh-John 1:1, 14.</li>	<li>The man Jesus experienced the human living on earth for thirty-three and a half years.</li>	<li>Jesus was crucified to accomplish God&#8217;s redemption for man-Matt. 27:33-50; Eph. 1:7; Heb. 9:12.</li>	<li>Christ resurrected from among the dead on the third day after His crucifixion-Matt. 28:1-7; Acts 10:40; 1 Cor. 15:4b.</li>	<li>In the evening on the day of His resurrection the resurrected Christ came to breathe the Spirit, whom He had become, as breath into His believers-John 20:19-22.</li>	<li>Christ ascended to the heavens, was enthroned, and received the crown of glory (Luke 24:51; Acts 1:9; 2:33; Heb. 2:9); He has been made Lord, Christ (Acts 2:36), the Ruler of the kings of the earth (Rev. 1:5), and the Savior (Acts 5:31), and also has been established by God to be the Minister of His new covenant (Heb. 8:2), the High Priest (2:17; 4:14; 7:26; 8:1), and the Mediator and guarantee of the new covenant (8:6; 9:15; 7:22).</li>	<li>In His ascension the ascended Christ poured out the Holy Spirit as a violent wind upon His believers-Acts 2:1-2.</li>	<li>Christ sent out the apostles and disciples, upon whom He had poured out the Spirit, to different places to preach the gospel and establish churches.</li>	<li>The gifted ones among the believers build up the Body of Christ through the transforming Spirit.</li>	<li>The coming back of Christ will end the church age and bring in His kingdom, the millennial kingdom (Rev. 11:15), in which He and His overcoming saints will be priests of God to serve God and kings to rule over the nations (20:4, 6).</li>	<li>In His coming back Christ will judge the saints and give His kingdom as a reward to the saints justified by Him (2 Cor. 5:10); He will marry the justified, overcoming saints as His spouse, who will be led by Him as His overcoming army to defeat Antichrist, Antichrist&#8217;s partner-the false prophet-and the nations who follow them in rebelling against God (Rev. 19:7-9, 11-16); He will cast Antichrist and the false prophet into the lake of fire (vv. 19-21); in the meantime, Satan will be bound for a thousand years and cast into the abyss (20:1-3), and then the millennial kingdom of Christ will begin (vv. 4-6).</li>	<li>At His coming back to the earth, Christ will be on the throne of His glory to judge the nations (the living-Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1) who remain at that time-some as goats will be condemned to perish eternally and some as sheep will be justified to enter into eternal life-Matt. 25:31-46.</li>	<li>At the end of the millennial kingdom, Satan will be released and will deceive the nations again to rebel against God; the nations will be devoured by fire from heaven, and Satan will be cast into the lake of fire-Rev. 20:7-10.</li>	<li>After the millennium, Christ will be on His great white throne to judge all the dead throughout the generations and cast them into the lake of fire-Rev. 20:11-12, 15.</li>	<li>The new heaven and new earth will come, in which the holy city, New Jerusalem, is manifested-Rev. 21:1-2.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>In this message we want to begin to see the Triune God&#8217;s revelation and His move in the New Testament. The Bible is the Word of God that conveys to us God&#8217;s revelation. Most Christians know this in a general way, but they do not know how to convert the Word of God into revelation. Even more, they do not know how these revelations can become visions to us for us to move with God. The Bible presents stories to us which are full of facts. We should not merely read the stories, but get the facts. Matthew 1 presents the genealogy of Christ, showing the coming of Christ to mankind. We must see this fact as a basis in order to see the revelation and the vision from Christ&#8217;s genealogy. I have done my best in this message to simplify the facts of the New Testament into fifteen categories. These fifteen main categories are the fifteen facts which are the real content of the New Testament.<h2 class=head1>I. THE FACTS</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Incarnation</h2><p>The first category of the New Testament is that God was incarnated to be a man in the flesh (John 1:1, 14).<h2 class=head2>B. Human Living</h2><p>Second, the man Jesus experienced human living on earth for thirty-three and a half years. This man is a God-man. God as a man experienced the human life. He was God, yet He became a man to live as a man for thirty-three and a half years.<h2 class=head2>C. Crucifixion</h2><p>Jesus was crucified to accomplish God&#8217;s redemption for man (Matt. 27:33-50; Eph. 1:7; Heb. 9:12). After thirty-three and a half years of human living, Jesus died on the cross to do one marvelous thing, that is, to accomplish God&#8217;s redemption according to God&#8217;s economy for man.<h2 class=head2>D. Resurrection</h2><p>Christ resurrected from among the dead on the third day after His crucifixion (Matt. 28:1-7; Acts 10:40; 1 Cor. 15:4b).<h2 class=head2>E. Breathing the Spirit into His Believers</h2><p>In the evening on the day of His resurrection the resurrected Christ came to breathe the Spirit, whom He had become, as breath into His believers (John 20:19-22). On the same day in which He resurrected, Christ came back to His disciples. He did not teach them, but He breathed Himself into them as the breath of life.<h2 class=head2>F. Ascension</h2><p>After Christ breathed Himself as the breath into His disciples, He ascended to the heavens, was enthroned, and received the crown of glory (Luke 24:51; Acts 1:9; 2:33; Heb. 2:9); He has been made Lord, Christ (Acts 2:36), the Ruler of the kings of the earth (Rev. 1:5), and the Savior (Acts 5:31), and also has been established by God to be the Minister of His new covenant (Heb. 8:2), the High Priest (Heb. 2:17; 4:14; 7:26; 8:1), and the Mediator and guarantee of the new covenant (Heb. 8:6; 9:15; 7:22). The things which transpire with the ascended Christ in the heavens are much more than what transpired with Him on earth. He was qualified to be such a man because He was God becoming that man. That was the unique qualification of Jesus. Who was Jesus? He was God! In His ascension He was enthroned, crowned, appointed, and established to be many items with many statuses.<h2 class=head2>G. Pouring Out the Holy Spirit</h2><p>In His ascension the ascended Christ poured out the Holy Spirit as a violent wind upon His believers (Acts 2:1-2). After He was appointed, anointed, to be many items, the first thing He did was to pour out the Spirit upon His believers as the power from on high, as the violent wind. The Spirit as the gentle breath was given to the disciples in the night of His resurrection, but on the day of Pentecost, He poured out the Spirit of power upon them. This Spirit is nothing less than the Triune God upon His believers to empower them to carry out what Christ wants them to do.<h2 class=head2>H. Sending Out the Apostles and Disciples</h2><p>After He poured out the Spirit of power upon His apostles and disciples, Christ sent them out to different places to preach the gospel and establish churches.<h2 class=head2>I. The Gifted Ones</h2><p>The gifted ones among the believers build up the Body of Christ through the transforming Spirit. After the formation of the churches among the believers, there are some gifted persons. They perfect all the seeking saints to be qualified to build up the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:11-12).<h2 class=head2>J. The Coming Back of Christ</h2><p>The first major item of Christ&#8217;s work was His coming to be a man to accomplish His earthly ministry. The second major item was His ascending to the heavens to be appointed, anointed, and established by God to work out God&#8217;s economy. This is His heavenly ministry. In His heavenly ministry, Christ poured out the Spirit as the Spirit of power. Then He produces and builds up the church as His Body, His organism. After Christ&#8217;s heavenly ministry is His second coming. The coming back of Christ will end the church age and bring in His kingdom, the millennial kingdom (Rev. 11:15), in which He and His overcoming saints will be priests of God to serve God and kings to rule over the nations (20:4, 6). He comes back to bring His kingdom down to the earth and make it a kingdom of one thousand years. He and His overcomers will be priests serving God and kings to rule over all the earth with all the nations.<h2 class=head2>K. Judging the Saints, Marrying the Overcomers, Defeating Antichrist, Binding Satan, and Bringing In the Millennial Kingdom</h2><p>In His coming back Christ will judge the saints and give His kingdom as a reward to the saints justified by Him (2 Cor. 5:10); He will marry the justified, overcoming saints as His spouse, who will be led by Him as His overcoming army to defeat Antichrist, Antichrist&#8217;s partner-the false prophet- and the nations who follow them in rebelling against God (Rev. 19:7-9, 11-16); He will cast Antichrist and the false prophet into the lake of fire (vv. 19-21); in the meantime, Satan will be bound for a thousand years and cast into the abyss (20:1-3), and then the millennial kingdom of Christ will begin (vv. 4-6).<p>At the beginning of His kingdom, the first thing He will do will be to judge us, His believers, to discern the overcomers who can be justified by Him. Christ will give to those who are discerned as the overcomers the kingdom of a thousand years as a reward. This is the kingdom reward. At the same time, Christ will marry the overcomers, and they will be His bride to fight with Him against Antichrist, the false prophet, and all the rebellious nations. Christ and His overcomers, that is, the Husband and the bride, will defeat Satan&#8217;s crew- Antichrist, the false prophet, and their followers from the nations. Antichrist and the false prophet will then be cast into the lake of fire, leaving one enemy, one big rebel, Satan. Satan will be bound for a thousand years and put into the bottomless pit, which is called the abyss. At that time on this earth there will be no more Satan. Then this earth will become Christ&#8217;s kingdom.<h2 class=head2>L. Judging the Nations</h2><p>At His coming back to the earth, Christ will be on the throne of His glory to judge the nations (the living-Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1) who remain at that time-some as goats will be condemned to perish eternally and some as sheep will be justified to enter into eternal life (Matt. 25:31-46). The Bible in the New Testament tells us that Christ has been established by God to judge the living and the dead. At the beginning of the thousand-year kingdom, Christ will judge the living nations to discern who are the sheep, the good ones, and who are the goats, the bad ones. The goats will go to the lake of fire to be with Antichrist, and the sheep will be sent into the sphere of eternal life. They will become the nations living outside the New Jerusalem as the New Jerusalem&#8217;s subjects.<h2 class=head2>M. The End of the Millennial Kingdom</h2><p>At the end of the thousand years, God in His economy will allow Satan to be released to accomplish something for God. He will deceive some of the nations again to rebel against God; the nations will be devoured by fire from heaven, and Satan will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:7-10). That will close the millennial kingdom.<h2 class=head2>N. Judging the Dead</h2><p>After the millennium, Christ will be on His great white throne to judge all the dead throughout the generations and cast them into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:11-12, 15). In this way Christ will clear up the entire universe. Christ will sweep everything negative and rebellious into the universal trash can, the lake of fire.<h2 class=head2>O. The New Jerusalem</h2><p>The new heaven and new earth will come, in which the holy city, New Jerusalem, is manifested (Rev. 21:1-2). The New Jerusalem will be the center of the new heaven and new earth in eternity.<p>The fifteen categories listed above are the major facts of the New Testament. In conclusion the New Testament with its facts is the biography of Christ. This wonderful person was God becoming a man. This Man lived on earth and then died and resurrected. He breathed Himself as the gentle breath into His believers. Then He ascended to the heavens. There He was appointed, anointed, and established by God to be many items to carry out God&#8217;s economy to produce the church and build the church into the Body of Christ. After He finishes His heavenly ministry, He will come back to judge the believers, to determine who the overcomers are. If we are the overcomers, He will justify us to give us the reward of the kingdom, and He will marry us as His wife to form an army to fight with Him against all the negative persons on the earth-Antichrist, the false prophet, the fallen nations, and Satan. Eventually, Christ will judge the dead at the great white throne. In this way He will clear up the entire universe and make it a new heaven and new earth by what He has consummated through His two ministries, the earthly ministry and the heavenly ministry. The ultimate consummation of these two ministries will be the New Jerusalem.<p>The New Testament is the biography of a Person whose story begins in eternity past and ends in eternity future. In eternity past He is by Himself as the Triune God, but in eternity future He will be with His companion, His wife. The Triune God in eternity future will have a wife, a counterpart, as the consummation of the Body of Christ to match Him.<h1 class=series>THE TRIUNE GOD&#8217;S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE NINE</h1><h1 class=title>THE TRIUNE GOD&#8217;S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>The revelations:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The Triune God&#8217;s incarnation is to bring God into man, mingling God with man and making God one with man both in the divine life and divine nature (but not in the Godhead) and in the human life and human nature-John 1:14; 1 Tim. 3:16.</li>	<li>The human living of the man Jesus on earth is to express God in man through His divine attributes expressed in the human virtues of Jesus.</li>	<li>The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To terminate the old creation with all its involvements-Satan, the world, sin, the old man, and the law with its ordinances-Heb. 2:14; John 12:31; John 1:29; Rom. 6:6; Eph. 2:15.</li>		<li>To release the divine life from Jesus&#8217; human shell for the dispensing of the divine life into the believers of Christ-John 12:24.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Christ&#8217;s resurrection from among the dead after His crucifixion is:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To designate (uplift) His humanity into the divine sonship, producing Him to be the firstborn Son of God-Rom. 1:4; Acts 13:33.</li>		<li>To make Him, the last Adam, the life-giving Spirit-1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>		<li>To regenerate all the people chosen by God, making them the children (sons) of God, members of Christ for the constitution of the organic Body of Christ-1 Pet. 1:3; John 1:12; Rom. 8:16; 12:4-5.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Christ, as the embodiment of the consummated Triune God, in the evening of His resurrection, breathed Himself as the pneumatic Christ into His believers as the gentle breath. This indicates that the entire consummated Triune God as the consummated all-inclusive Spirit has been wrought into the believers of Christ as their life and everything. This is the consummating step of Christ&#8217;s ministry on the earth, that is, to have the consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit of life join together with the believers&#8217; spirit as one wonderful mingling spirit (1 Cor. 6:17); the divine Spirit indwells the human spirit (2 Tim. 4:22) and the two work together as one spirit (Rom. 8:16):		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The New Testament as the biography of Christ unveils to us that Christ as the Christ of God, the Messiah of God (John 1:41), the anointed One of God (Dan. 9:26, lit.), the appointed One of God, fulfills God&#8217;s commission to Him with a threefold ministry.</li>		<li>The threefold ministry of Christ is in three stages:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>In the first stage it is His earthly ministry, which begins in His incarnation and ends in His breathing of Himself into His believers as the Spirit of life to bring His believers into an organic union with the processed and consummated Triune God-Matt. 28:19.</li>			<li>In the second stage it is His heavenly ministry, which begins with His outpouring, in ascension, of the processed and consummated Triune God, embodied in Himself, as the Spirit of power to form the churches and ends with the building up of His organic Body.

THE REVELATIONS</h2><p>In the previous message we saw the facts concerning the Triune God&#8217;s revelation and His move in the New Testament. In this message we want to see the revelations concerning these facts.<h2 class=head2>A. The Triune God&#8217;s Incarnation</h2><p>The Triune God&#8217;s incarnation is to bring God into man, mingling God with man to make God one with man both in the divine life and divine nature (but not in the Godhead) and in the human life and human nature (John 1:14; 1 Tim. 3:16).<h2 class=head2>B. The Human Living of the Man Jesus</h2><p>The human living of the man Jesus on earth is to express God in man through His divine attributes expressed in the human virtues of Jesus. This is the real revelation of Jesus as a man living on this earth. The phrases through His divine attributes and expressed in the human virtues of Jesus are priceless. The reality is the divine attributes, and the expression is the human virtues. God has many attributes, and all of these attributes are the items of what God is. God is love and light. Love and light are two of God&#8217;s attributes. With God they are the attributes. With man they are the virtues. Christ lived out God&#8217;s attributes expressed in His human virtues.<h2 class=head2>C. The Crucifixion of Jesus Christ</h2><h2 class=head3>1. To Terminate the Old Creation with Its Involvements</h2><p>The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is to terminate the old creation with all its involvements-Satan, the world, sin, the old man, and the law with its ordinances (Heb. 2:14; John 12:31; John 1:29; Rom. 6:6; Eph. 2:15). From my youth I was told only that Jesus was crucified and died for my sins. But according to the New Testament revelation, the crucifixion of Jesus Christ implies many things. The entire old creation with all of its involvements was crucified on the cross.<h2 class=head3>2. To Release the Divine Life</h2><p>The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is also to release the divine life from Jesus&#8217; human shell for the dispensing of the divine life into the believers of Christ (John 12:24). Jesus said He was like a grain of wheat, and God&#8217;s divine life was contained within the shell of this grain, the shell of Christ&#8217;s humanity. The cross broke this shell to release the divine life so that this divine life could be dispensed into Christ&#8217;s believers.<h2 class=head2>D. Christ&#8217;s Resurrection</h2><h2 class=head3>1. To Designate (Uplift) His Humanity into the Divine Sonship</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s resurrection from among the dead after His crucifixion is to designate (uplift) His humanity into the divine sonship, producing Him to be the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 1:4; Acts 13:33). We have to learn to speak this kind of language when we go out to preach the gospel.<h2 class=head3>2. Making Him the Life-giving Spirit</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s resurrection is to make Him, the last Adam, the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b).<h2 class=head3>3. To Regenerate All the People Chosen by God</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s resurrection is to regenerate all the people chosen by God, making them the children (sons) of God, members of Christ for the constitution of the organic Body of Christ (1 Pet. 1:3; John 1:12; Rom. 8:16; 12:4-5). According to 1 Peter 1:3 we were regenerated when Christ was resurrected.<h2 class=head2>E. Christ Breathing Himself as the Pneumatic Christ into His Believers as the Gentle Breath</h2><p>Christ, as the embodiment of the consummated Triune God, in the evening of His resurrection, breathed Himself as the pneumatic Christ into His believers as the gentle breath. This indicates that the entire consummated Triune God as the consummated all-inclusive Spirit has been wrought into the believers of Christ as their life and everything. After Christ resurrected from the dead, in the evening He came back to His disciples. He did not teach them anything. Instead, He breathed into them, and this breath was the Holy Spirit. In resurrection He is not the Christ in the flesh, but the pneumatic Christ. Through resurrection He became the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). After He breathed Himself as the Spirit into the disciples, they had the consummated Triune God in them. This is the consummating step of Christ&#8217;s ministry on the earth, that is, to have the consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit of life join together with the believers&#8217; spirit as one wonderful mingling spirit (1 Cor. 6:17); the divine Spirit indwells the human spirit (2 Tim. 4:22) and the two work together as one spirit (Rom. 8:16).<h2 class=head3>1. The New Testament Being the Biography of Christ</h2><p>The New Testament as the biography of Christ unveils to us that Christ as the Christ of God, the Messiah of God (John 1:41), the anointed One of God (Dan. 9:26, lit.), the appointed One of God, fulfills God&#8217;s commission to Him with a threefold ministry.<h2 class=head3>2. The Threefold Ministry of Christ Being in Three Stages</h2><h2 class=head4>a. His Earthly Ministry</h2><p>The threefold ministry of Christ is in three stages. In the first stage it is His earthly ministry, which begins in His incarnation and ends in His breathing of Himself into His believers as the Spirit of life to bring His believers into an organic union with the processed and consummated Triune God (Matt. 28:19).<h2 class=head4>b. His Heavenly Ministry</h2><p>In the second stage it is His heavenly ministry, which begins with His outpouring, in ascension, of the processed and consummated Triune God, embodied in Himself, as the Spirit of power to form the churches and ends with the building up of His organic Body. This has produced the overcomers and will consummate in the New Jerusalem.<h2 class=head4>c. His Kingdom Ministry</h2><p>In the third stage it is His kingdom ministry, which begins with His judgment of the believers at His judgment seat and ends with His judgment of all the dead at the great white throne. The kingdom ministry clears up the negative things in the universe. In His kingdom ministry, Christ gets rid of all the opposers of God, including Satan, to establish a kingdom on this earth with all His overcomers as His co-kings to reign over the nations on this earth.<h2 class=head3>3. Consummating God&#8217;s Eternal Economy</h2><p>All the ministries of Christ in the three stages consummate God&#8217;s eternal economy in the New Jerusalem as the center of the new heaven and new earth.<h1 class=series>THE TRIUNE GOD&#8217;S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TEN</h1><h1 class=title>THE TRIUNE GOD&#8217;S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>The revelations:	<ol class="upper-alpha" start="6">	<li>The ascension of the consummated Christ as the embodiment of the consummated Triune God brought Him from the earth into the heavenly sphere, where He was enthroned to be appointed as so many items of His status for His qualification to carry out, in His heavenly ministry, what He has consummated in His earthly ministry:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>As the God-appointed Redeemer to apply His redemption to the repentant sinners-Rom. 3:24; Eph. 1:7.</li>		<li>As the God-ordained Ruler of the kings of the earth and the Savior to execute His full salvation in life to the believers for their regeneration-Rev. 1:5; Acts 5:31.</li>		<li>As the God-established Minister to minister all His unsearchable riches with heaven to His believers for their growth in life-Heb. 8:2.</li>		<li>As the God-ordained Mediator of the new covenant to execute what He has accomplished in the new covenant to the believers-Heb. 8:6; 9:15; 12:24.</li>		<li>As the God-ordained surety of the new covenant to guarantee the sure fulfillment of the new covenant to the believers-Heb. 7:22.</li>		<li>As the God-ordained High Priest to take care of the believers as God&#8217;s people in His loving sympathy and intercession for them that they may be saved to the uttermost-Heb. 4:14-15; 7:25.</li>		<li>As the God-established good Shepherd to shepherd God&#8217;s people as His flock throughout their Christian life on this earth-John 10:11, 14, 16; 1 Pet. 2:25; 5:4.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>In His heavenly ministry the ascended Christ first poured out the Holy Spirit as a violent wind upon His believers as the Spirit of power for the producing and formation of the churches-Acts 2:1-2.</li>	<li>In His heavenly ministry the ascended Christ as the Head of His Body sent out the apostles and disciples to preach the gospel and establish the churches.</li>	<li>In His heavenly ministry the ascended Christ as the Head of His Body builds up His Body by the transforming Spirit through the gifted ones among the believers:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The consummation of the earthly ministry of Christ is to have the consummated Triune God wrought into the believers that they may become a people of God who have the organic union with the processed and consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit in their regenerated spirits.</li>		<li>The consummation of the heavenly ministry of Christ is to build the believers, who have the organic union with the processed and consummated Triune God, into His organic Body through the churches, which are composed of the believers, who have the organic union with the Triune God.

The New Testament as a biography of Christ is composed of His three ministries: His ministry on the earth, His ministry in the heavens, and His ministry in the kingdom. In the first ministry, the earthly ministry, He consummated one major thing, that is, to impart the Triune God into His redeemed. Through incarnation He came to be a man, to bring God into man. Then on this earth He lived a life to express God in His divine attributes through Christ&#8217;s human virtues. He died an all-inclusive death to clear up all the negative things. Then He resurrected to be designated the Son of God with His humanity uplifted into the level of divine sonship (Rom. 1:4; Acts 13:33). Through that resurrection He was born to be the firstborn Son of God. Also, as the last Adam, He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), indicating that He was going to impart the consummated God as the life-giving Spirit into His redeemed. In resurrection He also regenerated all God&#8217;s chosen people to be God&#8217;s sons (1 Pet. 1:3).<p>In this way He brought the consummated Triune God into man, making man one with the Triune God. Here is an organic union, an organic union in the divine nature and in the Spirit. God was consummated to be the life-giving Spirit, and also God regenerated His chosen people&#8217;s spirit. This life-giving Spirit indwells the human regenerated spirit of God&#8217;s chosen people. Thus, God was not only brought into man but man was also brought into God, making man and God, God and man, one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). This was consummated in John 20, when Christ came back to His disciples in the night of His resurrection to breathe Himself as the Spirit into them (v. 22).<p>After His resurrection Christ ascended to the heavens. He became the Minister of the heavenly ministry. In His heavenly ministry He consummates a major thing, that is, to build up the regenerated believers into His Body. First, God gains a people to be joined to Him and be one with Him. Second, He builds up the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head2>F. Christ&#8217;s Heavenly Ministry</h2><p>The ascension of the consummated Christ as the embodiment of the consummated Triune God brought Him from the earth into the heavenly sphere, where He was enthroned to be appointed as so many items of His status for His qualification to carry out, in His heavenly ministry, what He has consummated in His earthly ministry.<p>In His heavenly ministry He is the God-appointed Redeemer to apply His redemption to the repentant sinners (Rom. 3:24; Eph. 1:7). He is the God-ordained Ruler of the kings of the earth and the Savior to execute His full salvation in life to the believers for their regeneration (Rev. 1:5; Acts 5:31). He is the God-established Minister to minister all His unsearchable riches with heaven to His believers for their growth in life (Heb. 8:2). All the unsearchable riches of Christ bear the flavor and the nature of the heavens; they are dispensed into the believers for their growth in the divine life.<p>Christ is the God-ordained Mediator of the new covenant to execute what He has accomplished in the new covenant to the believers (Heb. 8:6; 9:15; 12:24). He made the new covenant through His death and resurrection. But He needs to be the Mediator of this new covenant to execute it in reality. Christ is also the God-ordained surety of the new covenant to guarantee the sure fulfillment of the new covenant to the believers (Heb. 7:22). He is the God-ordained High Priest to take care of the believers as God&#8217;s people in His loving sympathy and intercession for them that they may be saved to the uttermost (Heb. 4:14-15; 7:25). In His heavenly ministry, Christ is also the God-established good Shepherd to shepherd God&#8217;s people as His flock throughout their Christian life on this earth (John 10:11, 14, 16; 1 Pet. 2:25; 5:4). Daily, hourly, and moment by moment we have a great Shepherd, the Chief of the shepherds, taking care of us like a shepherd taking care of his flock.<h2 class=head2>G. Pouring Out the Holy Spirit</h2><p>In His heavenly ministry the ascended Christ first poured out the Holy Spirit as a violent wind upon His believers as the Spirit of power for the producing and formation of the churches (Acts 2:1-2). This is different from His breathing Himself into the disciples as the life-giving Spirit. The Spirit as the gentle breath is the inward Spirit. On the day of Pentecost He poured out Himself, the consummated God, as a violent wind, upon His believers.<h2 class=head2>H. Sending Out the Apostles and Disciples</h2><p>In His heavenly ministry the ascended Christ as the Head of His Body sent out the apostles and disciples to preach the gospel and establish the churches. When He poured out the Spirit upon His believers, that produced gifted persons. These ones are sent out to preach the gospel, to save sinners, and to raise up the churches.<h2 class=head2>I. Building Up His Body</h2><p>In His heavenly ministry the ascended Christ as the Head of His Body builds up His Body by the transforming Spirit through the gifted ones among the believers. On the one hand, He is the Head of the Body in the heavens. On the other hand, at the same time, He is the transforming Spirit to transform all the believers into the new creation.<h2 class=head3>1. The Consummation of the Earthly Ministry of Christ</h2><p>The consummation of the earthly ministry of Christ is to have the consummated Triune God wrought into the believers that they may become a people of God who have the organic union with the processed and consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit in their regenerated spirits.<h2 class=head3>2. The Consummation of the Heavenly Ministry of Christ</h2><p>Christians today altogether mix up the earthly and heavenly ministries of Christ and the different works of these two ministries. Therefore, their teaching is not so clear. We have to learn to teach these two ministries clearly.<p>The consummation of the heavenly ministry of Christ is to build the believers, who have the organic union with the processed and consummated Triune God, into His organic Body through the churches, which are composed of the believers, who have the organic union with the Triune God. This building up of the Body of Christ produces the overcomers whom Christ will marry, and they as the bride of Christ will become the army of Christ for Christ to carry out His upcoming kingdom ministry. This building up of the Body of Christ also consummates the ultimate consummation of God&#8217;s eternal economy-the New Jerusalem as God&#8217;s expansion and expression in eternity.<p>The building up of the Body of Christ produces the overcomers. In the seven epistles to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the Lord calls for the overcomers seven times. This indicates that His building up of the Body is to produce the overcomers. These overcomers will be awarded at Christ&#8217;s judgment seat with the kingdom, and they will be married to Christ as His bride to match Him and to fight with Him. We have to see that the building up of the Body of Christ accomplishes two things. First, it produces the overcomers to bring in the kingdom. Second, it consummates the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. So the upcoming kingdom and the upcoming New Jerusalem both depend upon the overcomers produced by the building up of the Body of Christ. This is why we pay so much attention to the building up of the Body of Christ.<p>In His kingdom ministry, Christ will defeat all of God&#8217;s opposers and clear up the negative things on earth. The overcomers, after being married to Christ to be His bride, become His army to fight against all the opposers of God. The kingdom ministry depends upon the earthly ministry and the heavenly ministry. The earthly ministry is to produce a people joined to God organically. In the heavenly ministry, Christ builds up the Body of Christ. Today we should not remain in the earthly ministry of Christ without going forward into His ministry in the heavens to have the Body of Christ built up with His heavenly unsearchable riches.<p>All the facts of the New Testament show us Christ&#8217;s three ministries: His earthly ministry, His heavenly ministry, and His kingdom ministry to clear up the whole earth and to make the earth the kingdom of God for one thousand years. Then the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem will come into being. This is the crystallization-study of the entire New Testament.<h1 class=series>THE TRIUNE GOD&#8217;S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ELEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>THE TRIUNE GOD&#8217;S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(4)</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>The revelations:	<ol class="upper-alpha" start="10">	<li>The last five items of facts, from I.

His newly married bride, as His armies, will fight together with Him (19:14; 17:14). Christ and His bride-army will defeat Antichrist and his followers and cast Antichrist and the false prophet into the lake of fire directly (19:19-21). In the meantime, Satan will be bound for a thousand years and cast into the abyss (20:1-3). Then the millennial kingdom of Christ will begin (vv. 4, 6).</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The second thing that Christ will do in His kingdom ministry is to judge, on the throne of His glory, the nations (the living-Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1) who remain at that time: some as goats will be condemned to perish eternally and some as sheep will be justified to enter into eternal life-Matt. 25:31-46.</li>	<li>At the end of the millennial kingdom, Satan will be released and will deceive the nations again to rebel against God; the nations will be devoured by fire from heaven, and Satan will be cast into the lake of fire-Rev. 20:7-10.<br>	Note: Through all the above judgments Christ will clear up all the opposers of God from this earth; this consummates His kingdom ministry.</li>	<li>After the millennium, Christ will be at His great white throne to judge all the dead throughout the generations and cast them into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:11-12, 15). Thus, Christ will clear up the entire universe, preparing the way for the new heaven and new earth to come.</li>	<li>The new heaven and new earth will come, in which the holy city, New Jerusalem, is manifested for God&#8217;s eternal enlargement and expression-Rev. 21:1-2.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>We have covered the earthly ministry and the heavenly ministry of Christ. Now we come to the kingdom ministry. In the earthly ministry, Christ wrought the processed Triune God into His believers, making them a group of God&#8217;s chosen people joined to God in the organic union of His life. This ministry was concluded in John 20:22, when Christ in His resurrection came back to His disciples and breathed Himself as the life-giving Spirit into them. Afterward, He ascended to the heavens, and now in the heavens in His ascension He accomplishes His heavenly ministry to raise up the churches and to build up the Body of Christ.<p>For the accomplishment of God&#8217;s economy, there is still another part of His ministry. This is the kingdom part of Christ&#8217;s ministry. The kingdom was a great thing God promised to His people. But according to the Old Testament terms, the coming kingdom of Christ which He will bring to the earth for one thousand years, will be an age of restoration. All of God&#8217;s creation, due to Adam&#8217;s sin, became fallen, rotten, and corrupted. Such a fallen universe needs a restoration to bring it back to God&#8217;s original created situation (cf. Isa. 11:6-9). Although this is a part of Christ&#8217;s kingdom ministry, this is not what our focus should be.<p>The kingdom ministry of Christ is to deal with all His human opposers. This earth is full of the human opposers of Christ. Eventually, Antichrist will be the concluding issue of these human opposers. He and his armies, the nations, will fight directly with Christ. God&#8217;s Christ is the One appointed by God, but Antichrist is the opposing one raised up by Satan. Satan will raise up a false Christ, Antichrist, to oppose God&#8217;s anointed One, Christ.<p>The angelic powers do not deal with these human opposers. That is not according to God&#8217;s principle. According to God&#8217;s principle, Satan is an angel and belongs to the angelic opposing party, so God would not use any human to deal directly with Satan. It must be an angel. But Antichrist and his armies are all human opposers, so Christ must have a group of human beings to be His army (Rev. 17:14; 19:13-14). These human beings will be the overcomers.<p>Christ wrote epistles to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3 to call out the overcomers. A number will answer that call. In Christ&#8217;s second coming, He will gather all His believers to the judgment seat which He will set up in the air. Christ will then judge all the believers to discern who the overcomers and the defeated Christians are. Then He will award His overcomers with His kingdom, to enjoy the co-kingship with Him in which they will rule over the nations and participate in His joy. The kingdom will be a great joy to the Lord. He will have been despised by His human opposers for two thousand years, but eventually He will gain a group of human beings to stand with Him, and these human beings are the overcomers.<p>Christ will discern the overcomers and award them with His kingdom for them to enter into His co-kingship and joy. Then He will marry all the overcomers collectively as His bride, His counterpart, who will be exactly the same as He is to match Him. This bride matching Christ will be Christ&#8217;s army to fight with Christ not against Satan but against Christ&#8217;s human opposers: Antichrist, the false prophet, and all the nations. At this time Satan will be bound, not by any human but by an angel. The angelic opposer of Christ needs an angel to bind him and put him into the abyss for one thousand years (Rev. 20:1-3). This will clear up the opposers of Christ from this earth, and give Him the way to set up His kingdom to rule over all the remaining nations for one thousand years.<h2 class=head2>J. The Last Five Items of Facts Reveal to Us Christ&#8217;s Kingdom Ministry</h2><p>The last five items of facts (from I. J. to I. N.) reveal Christ&#8217;s kingdom ministry, beginning from the coming back of Christ to Christ&#8217;s judgment at the great white throne over all the dead. These facts are full of revelations, but most people see only the facts. I hope that we would pray, &#8220;Lord, all the facts related to Your second coming bear revelations, and I need to see them. Show me these revelations.&#8221; In this message I am not presenting the facts but the revelations.<h2 class=head2>K. In the Kingdom Ministry of Christ, the First Thing That Christ Will Do Is to Judge His Believers at His Judgment Seat</h2><p>The first thing which Christ will do in His kingdom ministry is to judge His believers at His judgment seat (2 Cor. 5:10).<h2 class=head3>1. Rewarding His Overcoming Believers</h2><p>He will reward His overcoming believers with His kingdom that they may enter into the millennial kingdom to partake of Him as the tree of life (Rev. 2:7) and to share His joy and His kingship (Matt. 25:21, 23; Rev. 20:4, 6). In Revelation 2:7 Christ promised those who overcome that He will give them to eat of the tree of life. The enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life in the kingdom is a reward. But the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in eternity will be a common enjoyment to all the believers.<h2 class=head3>2. Disciplining His Defeated Believers</h2><p>Christ will discipline His defeated believers with the punishment in the millennial kingdom that they may be put away from His glory and enjoyable presence to a place of darkness for their discipline (Matt. 25:30) that they may mature in His life for them to participate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth after the kingdom age.<p>Who will you be? Will you be the overcoming saints or the defeated believers? I am doing my best to be an overcomer, but whether or not I will make it depends upon His discernment, His judgment. Paul said that although he was conscious of nothing against himself, he was not justified in this, because we have to wait until the Lord comes to judge (1 Cor. 4:4-5). That judgment will be at the judgment seat of Christ in the air. Thus, before us today there is a warning and a reward.<p>Today&#8217;s Christianity never touches such a point. They only help you to be saved and to do good and to try to be right with God and with man. They never open up the Word to show that there will be a time for Christ&#8217;s kingdom ministry. Only the overcoming ones will join the Lord in a positive participation in His kingdom ministry. Who will be an overcomer? No one can say definitely that he is or is not an overcomer. But day after day we should do our best to live a God-man&#8217;s life, which will make us the real overcomers of Christ. If we do not live a God-man&#8217;s life, we surely are defeated believers.<p>A God-man&#8217;s life is a life that is conformed to the death of Christ by the enjoyment of His power of resurrection (Phil. 3:10), and a life that lives Christ and magnifies Christ by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (1:19-21a). Such a life qualifies us to be the overcomers. Day by day I check with myself concerning whether I am conformed to the death of Christ in certain things. Sometimes I have to say, &#8220;Lord, forgive me; in this matter I didn&#8217;t bear the cross. In this matter I didn&#8217;t allow the cross of Christ to break my self-center. Lord, I am too self-centered.&#8221; With us nearly everything is self-centered; nearly everything is &#8220;me.&#8221; Even in the church life, everything is &#8220;me.&#8221; In the work, everything is &#8220;me.&#8221; In the leadership, everything is &#8220;me.&#8221; &#8220;Me&#8221; is always first. This is not a life that is conformed to the death of Christ. If we do not live such a life, we cannot participate in His power of resurrection, nor do we know the bountiful supply of the Spirit of the suffering Jesus and the glorified Christ.<p>The above points from the book of Philippians are crucial. Paul said that whether he lived or died meant nothing to him as long as he could magnify Christ. Then he told us that to magnify Christ needs us to live Christ, and to live Christ needs us to participate in the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Are we living such a life today, a life of a God-man, so that we can be qualified as His overcomers?<h2 class=head3>3. Marrying His Overcoming Believers as His Bride</h2><p>Christ will marry His overcoming believers as His bride (Rev. 19:7-9). He will recognize only His overcoming believers in the coming age. He will erase your name out of the book of life if you are a defeated believer, not for eternity, but for one thousand years of discipline (see Rev. 3:5 and note 3-Recovery Version). To do this is not to reject your eternal security. You are eternally secured. But for a period of time, for one thousand years, your name will be erased from the book of life. As Christians we are saved ones whose names are written in the book of life today and for eternity. But if we do not live an overcoming life today, our names will be erased from the book of life for one thousand years.<p>The Lord said, &#8220;Everyone who confesses in Me before men, the Son of Man will also confess in him before the angels of God; but he who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God&#8221; (Luke 12:8-9). To be secured, saved eternally, is of God&#8217;s grace. But to be disciplined for one thousand years is according to God&#8217;s righteousness. Look at your living today. Could the righteous God justify you?<p>Today thousands of believers do not know anything concerning the thousand-year kingdom of Christ with the possibility of reward or discipline. But this light has been shining among us for about seventy years. This light was brought to us through Brother Watchman Nee. I learned of him and have also put out some books on the kingdom (see A Brief Definition of the Kingdom of the Heavens and The Kingdom).<p>D. M. Panton said that many promise you a ticket into the thousand-year kingdom. But when you go to the gate of the kingdom, the gatekeepers will tell you that your ticket means nothing and that you cannot enter. Even to enter into the New Jerusalem, you have to pass through the eyes of the angels through whom the law was ordained (Rev. 21:12; Gal. 3:19). You must be a person in Christ with His two layers of secretion, the secretion of His redeeming and life-releasing death and the secretion of His life-dispensing resurrection, to make you a real pearl. Then the angels who ordained the law will justify you and let you in.<h2 class=head3>4. Defeating Antichrist</h2><p>In His kingdom ministry Christ will defeat Antichrist with his partner, the false prophet, and the nations who follow them in rebelling against God in the war at Armageddon (Rev. 19:11-16). His newly married bride, as His armies, will fight together with Him (19:14; 17:14). Christ and His bride-army will defeat Antichrist and his followers and cast Antichrist and the false prophet into the lake of fire directly (19:19-21). These two will be the first who will be thrown into the lake of fire, even before Satan. In the meantime, Satan will be bound for a thousand years and cast into the abyss (20:1-3). Then the millennial kingdom of Christ will begin (vv. 4, 6). In the millennial kingdom, Christ will reign with all His overcomers as His co-kings, and all the kings will enjoy the same joy that Christ does. This is mentioned by the Lord Himself in the parable given in Matthew 25:14-30. This message needs a lot of study. Otherwise, we will not be able to receive the light and see the revelation.<h2 class=head2>L. Judging the Nations</h2><p>The second thing that Christ will do in His kingdom ministry is to judge, on the throne of His glory, the nations (the living-Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1) who remain at that time: some as goats will be condemned to perish eternally and some as sheep will be justified to enter into eternal life (Matt. 25:31-46). When Christ comes back, the first good people in His eyes will be His believers. Then He will judge them to discern the overcomers and the defeated ones. Later, He will judge the nations who are left after the war at Armageddon to discern who are the sheep, the good ones, and who are the goats, the bad ones. He will throw the goats into the lake of fire. Then Christ will send the good ones, the sheep, into eternal life, not the life itself but into the blessing of the eternal life, to be the nations who will remain around the New Jerusalem. The nations who remain around the New Jerusalem will be these sheep.<p>Christianity&#8217;s theology teaches differently from this. They teach that the sheep are saved ones and the goats are false ones. One day if those of us in the recovery are faithful to the Lord, the truths, the real theology, in the Lord&#8217;s recovery will defeat all the theology in today&#8217;s Christianity and expose it to the uttermost. As a little slave of the Lord burdened to speak for Him, I must tell people the truth. I must be honest and faithful to what my Lord has shown me. What we have seen depends upon the foregoing faithful interpreters of the Bible. They have passed on their seeing to us and this has become our seeing. Thus, the recovery&#8217;s theology is the genuine theology of all the foregoing faithful interpreters.<h2 class=head2>M. The End of the Millennial Kingdom</h2><p>At the end of the millennial kingdom, Satan will be released and will deceive the nations again to rebel against God; the nations will be devoured by fire from heaven, and Satan will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:7-10). The rebellious nature of fallen man will remain in man until the end of the millennial age. At the end of the kingdom, God temporarily will release Satan, who will seduce the nations again to fight against God. Then they will be devoured by fire from heaven, and Satan will be cast into the lake of fire.<p>Through all the above judgments Christ will clear up all the opposers of God from this earth; this consummates His kingdom ministry. Without such a kingdom ministry, how could the earth created by God be cleared up to be good for God&#8217;s kingdom? There is the need of such a kingdom ministry of Christ to clear the earth from all the opposing factors of man plus Satan.<h2 class=head2>N. After the Millennium</h2><p>After the millennium, Christ will be at His great white throne to judge all the dead throughout the generations and cast them into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:11-12, 15). Thus, Christ will clear up the entire universe, preparing the way for the new heaven and new earth to come.<h2 class=head2>O. The Holy City in the New Heaven and New Earth</h2><p>The new heaven and new earth will come, in which the holy city, New Jerusalem, is manifested for God&#8217;s eternal enlargement and expression (Rev. 21:1-2).<h1 class=series>THE TRIUNE GOD&#8217;S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWELVE</h1><h1 class=title>THE TRIUNE GOD&#8217;S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(5)</h1><h1 class=title>THE VISIONS AND GOD&#8217;S MOVE</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="3"><li>The visions and God&#8217;s move:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The revelations:<br>	From the incarnation of Christ through His human living on the earth, His crucifixion, and His resurrection, the early disciples saw the historical facts of Christ&#8217;s work. At the time of Christ&#8217;s resurrection, they all got to see the intrinsic spiritual significances of these things, which all became revelations to them, as Christ indicated in John 14:20.

In this vision Christ firstly charged His disciples to go out, based upon what they had seen, to preach repentance for the forgiveness of sins (Luke 24:45-47). At the end of His stay with the disciples, He charged them to be His witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth (Acts 1:8), and then before His ascension He charged the disciples to go and disciple the nations and teach them all that He had commanded them based upon the revelation that all authority had been given to Him in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18-20). After His ascension into the heavens, on the day of Pentecost, the first thing He did as the initiation of God&#8217;s move on the earth to establish the churches was to pour out the Spirit of power (Himself as the consummated all-inclusive Spirit) upon the disciples (Acts 2:1-4, 17, 33).</li>	<li>The Lord&#8217;s move:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>After the Lord showed the early disciples the revelations of His earthly ministry, based upon which He presented them a vision for His move:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>They joined the Lord with His first move for the carrying out of His New Testament economy in raising up the church in Jerusalem among the Jews-Acts 8:1.</li>			<li>Based upon the same revelations and visions, the Lord, through the Jews&#8217; persecution in Jerusalem, moved most of the early believers to bring the gospel to Judea, Samaria, and even to Africa through the eunuch of Ethiopia (Cush, eastern Africa), in the Lord&#8217;s move-Acts 8:1, 4-5, 26-39.</li>			<li>Based upon the same revelations, the Lord gave the vision to Peter that the Lord wanted him to move on together with Him to spread His New Testament economy to the Gentiles as a beginning from the house of Cornelius, a Roman centurion-Acts 10:1-33.</li>			<li>Then the Lord gave a further vision to the apostle Paul and the other four prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch, that they should go, in moving together with the Lord for the carrying out of His New Testament economy, to evangelize all of Asia Minor.

We have seen adequately God&#8217;s revelations from the facts in the New Testament. Now we are on the visions and God&#8217;s move.<h2 class=head1>III. THE VISIONS AND GOD&#8217;S MOVE</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Revelations</h2><p>The revelations of the New Testament begin from the incarnation of Christ. The incarnation of Christ is God becoming a man. These revelations continue through His human living on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, His crucifixion, and His resurrection. Through this process, the early disciples saw the historical facts of Christ&#8217;s work, but they did not have the revelation. They saw Jesus Christ as a man manifesting God in His humanity, but they did not see the revelation of God in His economy.<p>Today many Christians who read the four Gospels know only the stories. They see the facts, but they do not know the intrinsic spiritual significance, the revelation. Is the Bible just a book of facts to you? Or have all the facts recorded in the Bible become revelation from God to you? The intrinsic revelation of the birth of Christ is God becoming a man and God being brought into man. We need to see the difference between the revelations and the historical facts recorded in the Bible.<p>At the time of Christ&#8217;s resurrection, the early disciples got to see the intrinsic spiritual significances of these things, which all became revelations to them. On the day of resurrection, they realized that the buried Christ was gone, and they began to enter into the intrinsic revelation of what they had seen in His earthly life. They were with Him for about three and a half years and saw Him doing many things, but they did not understand the intrinsic significance of His doing. But on the day of resurrection, the situation changed. The resurrection opened their eyes.<p>Christ indicated that the disciples would receive revelation on the day of His resurrection in John 14:20: &#8220;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&#8221; There are three ins in this verse. The Son is in the Father, we are in the Son, and the Son is in us. The disciples did not know this before the Lord&#8217;s resurrection. But &#8220;in that day,&#8221; the day of resurrection, they knew it. In a general way, in that day means &#8220;in resurrection.&#8221; This is not just a matter of the actual day but a matter of the fact. In resurrection the disciples would realize that the Son is in the Father, one with the Father; that they are in the Son, one with the Son; and that the Son is in them, one with them. These three parties are altogether mingled as one. Many Christians believe in the Bible, but how many realize that Christ is one with the Father, that they are one with Christ, and that Christ is one with them? This one revelation can revolutionize all of Christianity.<p>After His resurrection Christ stayed with the disciples for forty days (Acts 1:3). The main thing He did in those forty days was to bring them into the spiritual realization of the revelations of what He had done from His incarnation to His resurrection. On the day of Pentecost, Peter would have even more realization that Christ was in him as the One who is in the Father and the Father in Him. The preposition in is meaningful to the uttermost.<p>Peter, James, and John were Galilean fishermen called by the Lord to follow Him. They followed Christ and saw many things but understood nothing. Then the Lord told them that He was going to die and be resurrected on the third day (Matt.  20:17-19). James and John, though, were concerned about sitting on His right and on His left in His coming kingdom (vv. 20-21). They and the other disciples did not understand what the Lord meant concerning His dying and resurrecting.<p>But on the day of Pentecost, Peter was clear. He had not only the revelation but also the vision. The vision is that we have to go to proclaim all the revelations, and Peter did this for many years. Peter&#8217;s doing was the move of God. He saw not only the revelation but also a vision, a scenery in this universe. Then he was motivated to start preaching. From that time this fisherman from Galilee became the first preacher of Christ.<p>God began to move on the day of Pentecost because all the early disciples were motivated. All of the one hundred twenty could preach Christ and prophesy concerning Christ. They all became &#8220;crazy,&#8221; like drunkards (cf. Acts 2:12-17). A drunkard knows only how to talk ceaselessly. The one hundred twenty on the day of Pentecost were like this. They were talking ceaselessly about Christ as the very God. If we do not talk to people about Christ, this means that we have not seen either the revelation or the vision of what God is doing in the universe. But I hope that we will see the scenery of what God is doing in this universe and begin to talk ceaselessly about Christ to others. Then we will be in God&#8217;s move. God is moving, but if we do not join this moving, God has no way to move. After seeing the revelation and the vision, we begin to move, and our move is God&#8217;s move. When we move, God moves.<p>One day I saw a vision that all the revelations which I had seen should be preached in the United States. In 1958 I was invited to visit England and Denmark. As I was passing through the United States, I received a vision that the Lord&#8217;s recovery with all its truths should come here. From that day I was looking to the Lord concerning His move to the United States. Eventually, I got into this move and came here.<h2 class=head2>B. The Visions</h2><p>After the forty days, before Christ went to the heavens, based upon what He had shown the disciples as revelations, an issue came out, that is, the vision. In this vision Christ firstly charged His disciples to go out, based upon what they had seen, to preach repentance for the forgiveness of sins (Luke 24:45-47). At the end of His stay with the disciples, He charged them to be His witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth (Acts 1:8), and then before His ascension He charged the disciples to go and disciple the nations and teach them all that He had commanded them based upon the revelation that all authority had been given to Him in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18-20). After His ascension into the heavens, on the day of Pentecost, the first thing He did as the initiation of God&#8217;s move on the earth to establish the churches was to pour out the Spirit of power (Himself as the consummated all-inclusive Spirit) upon the disciples (Acts 2:1-4, 17, 33). This was God&#8217;s move, but His move was going on with Peter&#8217;s move and with the move of the one hundred twenty.<h2 class=head2>C. The Lord&#8217;s Move</h2><p>The revelations in the Lord&#8217;s earthly ministry began from the incarnation and consummated with His resurrection. Then He ascended and that began another ministry, His heavenly ministry.<h2 class=head3>1. Based upon the Revelations of His Earthly Ministry, the Lord Presenting to the Disciples a Vision for His Move</h2><h2 class=head4>a. His First Move in Raising Up the Church in Jerusalem</h2><p>After the Lord showed the early disciples the revelations of His earthly ministry, based upon which He presented them a vision for His move, they joined the Lord with His first move for the carrying out of His New Testament economy in raising up the church in Jerusalem among the Jews (Acts 8:1). The first thing accomplished in God&#8217;s move with Peter&#8217;s move was to set up a church in Jerusalem. This was altogether new to the Jews.<h2 class=head4>b. Moving Most of the Early Believers to Bring the Gospel to Judea, Samaria, and Even to Africa</h2><p>Based upon the same revelations and visions, the Lord, through the Jews&#8217; persecution in Jerusalem, moved most of the early believers to bring the gospel to Judea, Samaria, and even to Africa through the eunuch of Ethiopia (Cush, eastern Africa), in the Lord&#8217;s move (Acts 8:1, 4-5, 26-39). The Lord raised up a persecution by the Jews to drive all of the Jewish believers out of Jerusalem. Eventually, one of them even met a eunuch from Ethiopia, and through him God&#8217;s move went to Ethiopia.<h2 class=head4>c. Giving the Vision to Peter to Spread His New Testament Economy to the Gentiles</h2><p>Based upon the same revelations, the Lord gave the vision to Peter that the Lord wanted him to move on together with Him to spread His New Testament economy to the Gentiles as a beginning from the house of Cornelius, a Roman centurion (Acts 10:1-33). From the Jews the Lord moved to the Gentiles through Peter. The Lord showed Peter a vision but Peter hesitated. Peter, of course, was a Jew, and he told the Lord that from his youth he had never eaten anything unclean. But in the vision from the Lord, the Lord told him, &#8220;The things that God has cleansed, do not make common&#8221; (v. 15). Peter had to contact the Gentiles with the gospel to follow God&#8217;s move. Then God would move in his move. The church was raised up in the house of a centurion of the Roman Empire, Cornelius. This was the Lord&#8217;s move accomplished by His move within Peter&#8217;s move.<h2 class=head4>d. Giving a Further Vision to Paul to Evangelize All of Asia Minor</h2><p>Then the Lord gave a further vision to the apostle Paul and the other four prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch, that they should go, in moving together with the Lord for the carrying out of His New Testament economy, to evangelize all of Asia Minor. Paul and his co-workers did this by three gospel trips (Acts 13:1-14:28; 15:40-18:22; 18:23- 21:17). Through those gospel trips, Paul evangelized Asia Minor and established churches in city after city.<p>By the Lord&#8217;s move shown in the above four points the Lord covered Asia and Africa and initiated His church among the Gentiles.<h2 class=head4>e. Giving Paul a Further Vision of the Macedonian Call to Direct His Gospel Trip to Europe</h2><p>The Lord gave Paul a further vision, the vision of the Macedonian call (Acts 16:6-10), to direct his gospel trip from Asia to eastern Europe. Then he evangelized eastern Europe, leaving Illyricum not touched (Rom. 15:19). Then by his fourth gospel trip he covered Rome through his Roman exile. Paul had a gospel trip by being exiled. In his exile he did not consider himself a prisoner. Rather, he considered himself a preacher of Christ, a spreader of Christ, a spreader of all the things he had seen as revelations and visions from God. God was sovereign, putting him into exile. Eventually, that exile became Paul&#8217;s last gospel journey. By this he brought the gospel more strongly to western Europe, leaving Spain not touched, although he expected to cover that land which, according to the map at that time, was considered the uttermost part of the earth (Rom. 15:24, 28).<h2 class=head3>2. Being Motivated by the Triune God&#8217;s Revelations and Visions</h2><p>All the saints should be motivated by the Triune God&#8217;s revelations and visions to join with Him for His move to accomplish His New Testament economy on the earth. Today almost all the countries of this world, except the Muslim countries, have been evangelized. Nearly every place is filled with Christians. Since this is the case, what are our revelation and our vision today? Our revelation and vision have been greatly uplifted in the last three years because we have seen the high peaks of God&#8217;s revelation. These are mainly concerning God becoming a man so that man may become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead. This is the center of the high peaks of the divine revelation among us.<p>Today our vision is to go to tell the high-peak truths to the Christians. This is what we have been doing in Russia for the past few years. We need to enlighten those in Christianity with the high peaks of the divine revelation. There is a hot market for these high peaks today. Wherever we go today, we will be greatly welcomed if we can speak these high peaks.<p>All the groups in Christianity have been stranded on their own sands, like a boat stranded on sands in shallow water. The Catholic Church is stranded on their sands of superstitions. Most of the Protestant churches are stranded on the sands of superficiality. They are not deep; they are too shallow, on the surface. Nearly all the Protestant churches are stranded in their kind of lukewarm theology.<p>Many seeking Christians, dear brothers, in the denominations are seeking something higher, deeper, and richer than what they have heard and possess. They are tired of shallow things. If we tell them the high-peak truths, they will wake up. At first, they may oppose but gradually they will find the truth. Then what shall we do? We have to learn the high peaks of God&#8217;s present revelation and learn to speak these things. We have to go, and we have to speak. I believe that the high peaks of today&#8217;s revelation will become the hottest market among today&#8217;s Christians.<p>Of course, to do such a high mission work, we have to be prepared to encounter all kinds of difficulties. But I took Psalm 84:6 as a blessing in these kinds of hardships: &#8220;Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a place of springs; yea, the early rain covereth it with blessings&#8221; (Heb.). The valley of Baca is the valley of tears. The ones mentioned in Psalm 84 passed through a way full of tears, sufferings, but they made it a place of springs. The brothers who went to Russia can testify that they took a pathway through the valley of tears, but their stay there for the past four years has made Russia a place of springs with the early rains of blessing. I would encourage all of us to pick up this high commission: to go out with the high peaks of the divine revelation and with God&#8217;s up-to-date vision to move with God for His high peaks of the divine revelation that will consummate His eternal economy.<p>In this series of messages we have seen the Old Testament and the New Testament facts. Then we have seen the revelations based upon the Old Testament facts and the new revelations based upon the New Testament facts. We have also seen the visions with God&#8217;s move in the Old Testament and the New Testament visions with God&#8217;s move in the New Testament. This move consummates many things on this earth through the Lord&#8217;s heavenly ministry to establish many churches and to build up the Body of Christ. But many have been stranded on the sands of superstition, superficiality, and lukewarm theology. How can this situation be rescued? The only way is for us to see the high peaks of God&#8217;s revelation and to see that God&#8217;s vision in the New Testament is to bring forth all these high peaks of God&#8217;s revelation to all the Christians.</body></html>
