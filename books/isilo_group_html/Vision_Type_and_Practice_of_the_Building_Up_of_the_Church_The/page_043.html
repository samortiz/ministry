<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING OF LOVE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:17-19; 4:16; Col. 3:10-15</h1>
<p>Ephesians 3:17-19 says, &ldquo;That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&rdquo; This passage speaks of five key points.</p>
<p>The first point is Christ making His home in our hearts through faith. There are many portions in the New Testament that speak of the Lord being in us or of the Holy Spirit being in us, but it is difficult to find a portion that speaks of the Lord being in our hearts or of the Holy Spirit being in our hearts. Ephesians 3:17 says that the Lord makes His home in our hearts. This verse does not say that the Lord is in us in a general way. Rather, it says that the Lord is in us in a specific way; He is making His home in our hearts.</p>
<p>The second point is that we are being rooted and grounded in love. The Chinese Union Version translates this portion as &ldquo;your love is rooted and grounded.&rdquo; However, the Greek text does not refer to our love but to the Lord&rsquo;s love. It is because Christ makes His home in our hearts that we can be rooted and grounded in His love.</p>
<p>The third point is to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth, length, height, and depth are. Who knows how broad is the breadth, how long is the length, how high is the height, or how deep is the depth? Nevertheless, because Christ makes His home in our hearts and because we are rooted and grounded in His love, we are able to apprehend what the breadth, length, height, and depth are.</p>
<p>The fourth point is to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ. When we apprehend what the breadth, length, height, and depth are, we will realize that there is something immeasurable in the universe, which is the love of Christ.</p>
<p>The fifth point, the issue of points one through four, is that we will be filled unto all the fullness of God.</p>
<p>We have seen that the building of God is God building Himself with man. God the Son, Jesus Christ, enters into us to be our life so that by this life we can be fully mingled with Him as one. In the Holy Place the bread of the Presence is the bread of life, the golden lampstand is the light of life, and the golden incense altar is the fragrance of the resurrection life. Within the Ark in the Holy of Holies are the hidden manna as the hidden life supply, the two tablets of law that signify the law of life, and the budding rod that signifies the acceptance of the resurrection life. These typify Christ as our life. In the Holy Place and in the Holy of Holies wood overlaid with gold typifies man mingled with God, humanity mingled with divinity as one. The deeper we experience the building of God, the more we will experience Christ in everything and be mingled with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROCESS OF BUILDING<br />
BEING A MATTER OF LOVE</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the practice of building up the church from Ephesians. No other book in the Bible covers the building up of the church as thoroughly as the short book of Ephesians. This book presents the church as the Body of Christ, which is coordinated together through building, and as the dwelling place of God, which is established through building (1:22-23; 2:22). In addition, chapters 2 through 4 are concerning the believers being built up together. Therefore, if we want to know how to build up the church, we need to pay close attention to this book.</p>
<p>There are five key points in Paul&rsquo;s prayer in Ephesians 3:17-19. The first key point is concerning Christ making His home in our hearts, and the last key point is concerning our being filled unto all the fullness of God. Hence, this portion of the Scriptures begins with Christ making His home in our hearts and ends with our being filled unto all the fullness of God. The purpose of Christ making His home in our hearts is for us to be filled unto all the fullness of God, that is, to allow God&rsquo;s riches to be constituted into our being so that we may be filled with the element of God to become His expression. This is the building of God and man and the mingling of God and man.</p>
<p>Points two through four are concerning the process of being built and mingled with God. In this process we need to be rooted and grounded in love, to apprehend the immeasurable breadth, length, height, and depth, that is, the universal dimensions of Christ, and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ. Hence, the process from Christ making His home in our hearts until we are filled unto all the fullness of God is a matter of love. The first point is concerning Christ, and the last point is concerning our becoming the fullness of God. The remaining three points are concerning our being rooted and grounded in love, apprehending the breadth, length, height, and depth of Christ, and knowing the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, all of which are a matter of love.</p>
<p>Although God&rsquo;s building is His mingling of all that He is with us so that His riches become our element, the process of building is a matter of love. God is building His dwelling place in love. The dwelling place of God, the Body of Christ, is built up in love.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision, Type, and Practice of the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 43</div><br></body></html>
