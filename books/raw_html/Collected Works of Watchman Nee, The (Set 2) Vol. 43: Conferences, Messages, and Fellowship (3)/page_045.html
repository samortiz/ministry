<h2 class="head1">THE BLOOD DEALING WITH SINS BEFORE GOD,<br />AND THE FLESH DISPENSING LIFE INTO US</h2><p>We have seen that there are four aspects to the death and resurrection of Christ. First, there is the blood; second, there is the crucifixion; third, there is the flesh; and fourth, there is the bearing of the cross. Two days ago we saw the difference between crucifixion and the blood. Today we will consider the difference between the flesh and the blood. You may recall that in Exodus 12, God ordered the Israelites to kill the lamb and to put the blood on the doorpost and the side posts. When He came to the house and saw the blood, He passed over that house, and those in the house were spared. Hence, the blood is absolutely for God. Immediately after the Passover, the Israelites went into the wilderness with their staff in their hand. Once the blood of redemption is applied, one should begin his journey onward. Once a person is saved, he should leave the world behind and run the race of the kingdom. As soon as the blood is applied, he should set out on his journey.</p><p>But how can we have the strength for our journey? How can we escape Egypt? Here we see God's second provision. The blood removes man's sins before God. God demands the blood because He condemns sin. The blood is absolutely for God. After the lamb is slain, however, there is not only blood but also flesh. God said that the flesh had to be cooked and eaten before the Israelites would have the strength to go into Canaan. The blood is for God, while the flesh is for us. The blood is presented to God, while the flesh is cooked for us. The blood satisfies God's righteous requirement, while the flesh becomes our strength for our walk and inward life. Suppose you took some meat last night. Today the meat has become your life. The meat of yesterday has become you today. The flesh becomes our strength, our energy, and our life; we live by the flesh. The blood is objective, while the flesh is subjective. The blood is for God objectively. Through the blood God has forgiven our sins. The flesh is for us to take subjectively. Through the flesh we have the strength for our journey onward.</p><p>The problem in the church today is that believers have only received forgiveness through the blood; they have not received the strength of the flesh to take them on the way. God has given us not only a redeeming Christ, but also an indwelling Christ to be our life. This is signified by the flesh in the Bible. The blood is on the doorpost and the side posts. Eating the flesh is receiving Christ into us and having Him live for us. Many people have already experienced the forgiveness of their sins. But they continue to be weak and defeated; they are not yet on the way. The blood has been applied, but the flesh has not been eaten. This is why there is weakness. Hence, a man must not only receive forgiveness through trusting in the blood of Christ, but he must also eat His flesh. In the eyes of God, those who do not eat His flesh cannot satisfy God's heart. God's life is not a weak life.</p><p>Two years ago I asked a group of Christians in Kaifeng what kind of life is described in the Bible. One sister argued that no one could be free from the love of money, anxiety, temper, or criticism. She said that no one in the world could do this. That is right. No one in this world can do this. But God has not asked us to do it. God's intention is not for us to live a man's life; He wants us to live God's life. God has no intention to ask us to do what we cannot do. A man can only live a man's life and can only do what a man can do. However, God has given us His own life. We have God's life within, and this life can perform what we otherwise cannot perform. We can only ask whether or not we are allowing this life to live within us.</p><p>Many people have great assurance about their salvation, but in their experience they are very weak. They have trusted in the blood of Christ, but they have not eaten His flesh. They are as weak in this world as any worldly one. This is not God's purpose; He intends for man to have His holy, victorious, and sanctified life. God does not want us merely to be humans; He wants to put His life within us and accomplish everything that we cannot accomplish by ourselves. In other words, He wants us to accomplish God's work and live God's life. The whole matter rests in whether or not we have eaten the flesh.</p><h2 class="head1">AT THE TABLE, FIRST THE BREAD, THEN THE WINE</h2><p>Why does the Bible call the Lord's supper the breaking of the bread and not the drinking of the cup? In calling it the breaking of the bread, the act of drinking is included. The bread symbolizes the life of Christ, while the cup symbolizes the redemption of Christ. The cup removes our sin before God; it takes care of Adam's fall. The bread signifies the Lord's life, that is, the life of God Himself. The fruit of the tree of life in Genesis 2 is God's goal. The bread is God's goal. God intends for the bread to become man's life. His goal is the bread, not the cup. Although God needs the cup, the goal is not the cup; it is merely a remedial step. The bread brings us God's goal. This is why the supper is called the breaking of the bread. The cup signifies redemption, while the bread signifies the Lord's life. The cup signifies the first aspect of Christ's death, while the flesh signifies the second aspect of His death. We covered the second aspect of Christ's death yesterday. This death releases God's life. The Bible calls this release the breaking of the bread. We are sinners, and the blood of the Lord washes us of our sins. Why do we not drink the cup first at the Lord's supper? When we were saved, the first thing we did was drink the blood, but the Bible tells us that we should first eat the bread. This shows us that God's goal is for man to take in the Lord's life. The blood is secondary and remedial. This is why the breaking of the bread comes first. It represents an aspect of Christ's death which is much higher than that represented by the blood.</p><p>I hope that we can see God's goal. I feel that the greatest problem among God's children is that they pay too much attention to redemption and not enough attention to God's goal. Redemption merely deals with the sin problem; it is not God's original goal. Before God created man, He already had a plan and purpose. God did not create man and then leave him alone. After He created man, He wanted him to receive His life. This is why God puts the bread before the cup. This is the teaching of the Bible, and we should obey it. Today many church leaders do not understand redemption. This is very poor. But taking care of redemption alone is not sufficient, because redemption is not God's goal. As important as it is, the forgiveness of sins can never match the experience of receiving Christ's life into us as our life.</p>
