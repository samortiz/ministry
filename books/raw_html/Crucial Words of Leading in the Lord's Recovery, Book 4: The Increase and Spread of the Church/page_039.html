	 <h2 class="head2">Gifts Functioning in the Aspect of Ministry<br />
for the Supply of Truth and Life</h2>
<p>Our concept about the order of the various functions in the administration of the church is completely the opposite of what is shown in verse 28. At the beginning of this verse the apostle Paul uses the words <em>first, second,</em> and <em>third,</em> but he does not use sequential numbering in the second half of the verse because he is speaking of two categories of service. The first category, which includes apostles, prophets, and teachers, is unrelated to the administration of the church; it is related entirely to supplying truth and life (Eph. 4:11). The second category, which includes helps and administrations, is related to the administration of church affairs.</p>
<p>Therefore, gifts function in the aspect of ministry, which is related to the supply of truth and life. These three gifts&mdash;apostles, prophets, and teachers&mdash;supply truth and life, although there are differences in their various functions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Offices Functioning<br />
in the Aspect of Administration<br />
for the Overseeing and Leading of a Local Church</h2>
<p>Offices function in the aspect of administration, which is related solely to overseeing and leading the church. The elders oversee and lead the church; this is purely a function related to administration (Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:1-3).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Apostles Being Gifts for the Universal Church and<br />
Appointing Elders and Deacons</h2>
<p>Apostles are gifts to the universal church. In the Bible we cannot find a local church that has its own apostle, because an apostle functions to supply all the members of the universal church. However, an apostle also appoints elders and deacons (Acts 14:23; 1 Tim. 3:1-13). Thus, apostles first supply truth and life and then appoint elders and deacons.</p>
<p>In terms of office, there are apostles and then elders and deacons, and in terms of gift, there are apostles and then prophets and teachers. The apostles serve in both the aspect of office and the aspect of gift. However, whether in terms of office or gift, the function of the apostles is universal, not local.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Prophets and Teachers<br />
Being Gifts to the Local Churches,<br />
Releasing the Revelation of God<br />
and Supplying the Mystery of the Truth</h2>
<p>Prophets and teachers are gifts to the local churches. Hence, Acts 13:1 says, &ldquo;Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers.&rdquo; The Scripture text here does not mention apostles. In the gatherings of the local churches, there are prophets and teachers. Thus, prophets and teachers are gifts to the local churches for the release of the revelation of God and the supply of the mystery of the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">There Being Only Prophets and Teachers<br />
in the Meetings of a Local Church,<br />
Not Apostles, Elders, or Deacons</h2>
<p>There are only prophets and teachers in the meetings of a local church. Prophets are referred to in 1 Corinthians 14:4-5. Verse 26 which speaks of each one having a psalm, also speaks of having a teaching and having a revelation. Teaching comes from teachers, and revelation comes from prophets. Prophets are different from teachers. A prophet is inspired by the Spirit and receives revelation from God; hence, the word that is released is a revelation. In the New Testament a prophet mainly speaks for God and speaks forth God through the revelation of God. Sometimes, however, a prophet can be inspired to give a prediction (Acts 11:27-28). In 1 Corinthians 14 the main function of a prophet is not to predict but to speak for God. Prophets speak for God. The word of the prophet is not an ordinary teaching; it is a word based on revelation from God.</p>
<p>The teachings of a teacher are mainly for the defining of doctrine, such as the truth related to justification by faith and sanctification. The teachers need to learn to give a clear explanation of justification, sanctification, and so forth. This is like a chief justice of a country who gives a clear judicial interpretation of the law. Teachers define doctrines and truths according to the revelation in the Word; they define the meaning of such things as regeneration, the mingling of God and man, the principle of incarnation, and the economy of God. Prophets receive revelation, whereas teachers define the meaning of doctrines concerning divine truth. In a meeting of a local church, there are prophets and teachers but not apostles, elders, and deacons. This does not mean that there are no elders and deacons in a local church, but no one functions as an apostle, elder, or deacon in a <em>meeting</em> of a local church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Elders and Deacons Attending the Meetings<br />
of a Local Church Not as Officers but as Brothers</h2>
<p>When an elder comes to a church meeting, he should attend the meeting as a brother, not as an elder. This is because there are no elders, deacons, or apostles in the meetings of a local church. Even when an apostle attends a meeting, he should attend as a brother. We need to be clear about this. Clearly, the Bible speaks of elders who teach (1 Tim. 5:17), but this function of teaching in a local church can be likened to a parent who privately tutors his children at home. This is different from teaching in a school. The elders&rsquo; teaching of the saints in a locality is similar to parents teaching their children at home, and the teaching in a church meeting is similar to the teaching in a classroom. The elders&rsquo; teaching is in the pattern of parent&rsquo;s teaching, and the teaching in a meeting is more in the pattern of a schoolteacher&rsquo;s teaching. Even if the elders have a burden to speak a word in a meeting, it should still be like the teaching that comes from a parent who is tutoring his children at home.</p>
<p>This difference between these two types of teaching is often manifested when an elder goes from one locality to another. Although he seems to be able to teach the saints in one locality, he has difficulty teaching saints in another locality. However, anyone who has the genuine gift of teaching will be able to teach wherever he goes because teaching is his profession. Many fathers can help their children learn mathematics at home, but this does not qualify them to be a mathematics teacher in a high school; there is a difference. A person can have some knowledge of mathematics, history, and geography, but this does not qualify him to be a teacher.</p>
<p>Those who teach in the meetings of the church should be like teachers who teach students in school. However, when the elders teach, their teaching should be like the guidance of a parent who is teaching his children at home. There are two kinds of elders in a locality: those who can administrate with respect to general affairs, and those who can teach through shepherding. Some elders are good at administrating the general affairs of the church, and others labor in word and teaching (v. 17). These two kinds of elders can be compared to the parents in a family; while the mother tutors her children in mathematics, history, and English, the father is responsible for the management and governance of the family.</p>
