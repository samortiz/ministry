   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Kings 7:17 says, "And nets of checkerwork, and wreaths of chainwork, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here we see that the network and the chainwork on the two capitals were seven on each.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates that all the complicated situations are temporal, not eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the crossing, breaking, and suppressing are temporary, yet they are complete, for they are in the number seven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One day, all this will be over, and there will be no more checkerwork and chainwork.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead of network and an entwined wreath, we shall have a golden crown.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that the Triune God is hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That the pillars are twelve cubits in circumference and capitals four cubits in diameter implies the presence of the number three.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The number three, the Triune God, is real but invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In every situation the Triune God is real, but He is hidden.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The brass, the lily, and the pomegranates are all on the two pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This reveals that death, resurrection, and the expression of life are all a testimony in God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today, we are here with this testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All these points are crucial, and I hope that you will spend time to pray and fellowship about them until they get into you and become your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then we shall know what a pillar is and how we can become a pillar.</S>
