   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Going Up to Jerusalem according to Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:1 and 2 Paul said, Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus with me also.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And I went up according to revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As recorded in Acts 15, this happened after a number of churches had been raised up in the Gentile world by Paul s preaching see Acts 13 and 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This also indicates that Paul s preaching of the gospel to raise up the Gentile churches had nothing to do with the believers in Jerusalem and Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1:18 Paul speaks of going up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 2:1 and 2 we see that after a period of fourteen years, he went up to Jerusalem again, according to revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not only Paul s gospel but also his going up to Jerusalem was according to the Lord s revelation, not according to any organization or system.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His moves and activity were according to the Lord s instant leading.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This again indicates that his preaching of the gospel was not according to man s teaching, but according to the Lord s direct revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From Paul s experience of going up to Jerusalem after fourteen years according to revelation, we learn that it is often more difficult not to go to a certain place than it is to go there.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, it is easy for me to make the decision to fly to London.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But to refrain from doing so for fourteen years may not be easy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This requires that I be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because Paul was restricted, he did not go to Jerusalem apart from revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, at a certain time, according to revelation, he went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas and Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul s visit to Jerusalem refers to the time of Acts 15.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Judaizers had caused a great deal of trouble by telling the Gentile believers that they had to be circumcised in order to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They were making circumcision a condition of God s eternal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This issue was extremely serious.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to revelation, Paul went up to Jerusalem to deal with the source of the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul did not go to Jerusalem to receive revelation or learn some new teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, he went there according to revelation to deal with the source of a serious problem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this matter Paul also is a pattern for us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should learn from his example not to go anywhere or to take any action in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the contrary, we must be restricted by the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever we go to a certain place, we should move according to revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>B. Privately Laying the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Which He Preached before Those of Reputation</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 2:2 Paul also says, I laid before them the gospel which I proclaim among the nations, but privately to those of reputation, lest somehow I should be running or had run in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In doing this, Paul also was restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we were going up to Jerusalem in that situation, we probably would have gone up with a great deal of fanfare.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Perhaps we would have sent out advertisements telling people that the apostle to the Gentile world was coming.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the way practiced in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Announcement of the coming of a well-known preacher or evangelist is made in advance in order to assure a large crowd.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul, in contrast to the way of today s Christianity, presented his gospel privately to certain ones.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This indicates that he went up to Jerusalem privately with no intention of speaking before a large congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He simply wanted to contact the leading ones, the apostles and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is according to the record of Acts 15, which corresponds to the account in Galatians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>C. Not Even Titus Compelled to Be Circumcised</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In verse 3 Paul goes on to say, But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This indicates that Paul in his move for the Lord s testimony did not care for the observance of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul deliberately refused to have Titus circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul s purpose was to keep the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since in Christ circumcision is over, to circumcise a believer would cause the truth to be blurred.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, Paul did not compel Titus to be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Judaism was built upon the God-given law with three pillars: circumcision, the Sabbath, and the holy diet.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All three were ordained by God Gen 17:9-14; Exo 20:8-11; Lev 11 as shadows of things to come Col 2:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Circumcision was a shadow of the crucifixion of Christ in putting off the flesh as signified in baptism Col 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Sabbath was a type of Christ as the rest for His people Matt 11:28-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The holy diet symbolized the distinction between persons called clean and unclean, those whom God s holy people should contact and those they should not contact Acts 10:11-16, 34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since Christ has come, all the shadows must be over.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, the observance of the Sabbath was abolished by the Lord Jesus in His ministry Matt 12:1-12 , the holy diet was annulled by the Holy Spirit in Peter s ministry Acts 10:9-20 , and circumcision was counted as nothing in the revelation received by Paul in his ministry Gal 5:6; 6:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Furthermore, the law, the base of Judaism, has been terminated and replaced by Christ Rom 10:4; Gal 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, the entire Judaism is gone.</S>
