He wanted them to know of the affliction which befell him in Asia. What was the nature of this affliction? It was the affliction of being under pressure. To what degree were they pressed by this pressure? They were pressed beyond their power, to the point that they despaired even of living. This was the outward condition. And what was the inward feeling? It was the same. He said that they "had the response of death" in themselves. The final outcome was this: "We should not base our confidence on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead; who has delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver us; in whom we have hoped that He will also yet deliver us" (vv. 9-10).</P><P>We have paid special attention in our Lord's Day morning messages to the principles of spiritual life. Today we will talk about the relationship between pressure and power, or we may say, between compression and power. Brothers and sisters, Christians pay considerable attention to the matter of power. Among spiritual believers, even more attention is paid to the matter of power. They often ask whether or not a certain person has power and whether his power is great or small. Wherever we are, we hear this kind of talk.</P><P>We want to consider the biblical teaching concerning the relationship between pressure, or compression, and power. First I want to say that pressure and power are directly proportional one to the other. Where there is pressure, there is power. If a Christian does not know pressure, he cannot know power. Only those who have experienced the stress of pressure can understand power. The more pressure one experiences, the more power he has, and the more he understands power.</P><P>Before I explain the spiritual relationship between pressure and power, I want to point out their relationship in physical terms, so that we can understand the spiritual principle from physical things. Have you ever seen how water boils on the stove? You must have seen how boiled water is sold in a boiled-water shop. Water is boiled from morning until evening, all year round. The shop is always filled with steam, but the steam is not very useful because it does not have much power. On the other hand, if you look at a boiler on a train engine or ship, you can see an intense fire under the boiler. The water in the boiler is boiling, but the steam cannot easily escape because the boiler is made of very thick steel. The steam is kept inside the boiler and gradually accumulates. Because of the external pressure and the fact that no steam is allowed to escape, the steam is pressurized to become a source of power. When the power of this steam is released through a small hole, it can drive trains and ships forward with great speed. In both cases we have steam. But why is there such a great difference in the power they produce? In the boiled-water shop, the steam is useless, but in a train or a ship, it is useful. In one case the steam is not compressed; it is scattered and, therefore, useless. In the other case the steam is compressed; it is not scattered, and when this compressed steam is released from one outlet, it becomes a source of great power. Brothers, this principle is not only true in physics; it is also true as a spiritual law. Whenever there is no pressure, there is no power. Only pressure can produce power.</P><P>If a Christian wants to understand what power is, he must first understand what pressure is. Pressure or stress was always upon the apostles. They were pressed daily, were under tension daily, and bore heavy burdens daily. Furthermore, they were continually occupied so that they could neither live quietly nor peacefully. This, however, was the means by which God bestowed power upon them. The apostles were pressed so much that their power multiplied to the point that it became unmatched by anyone else. Pressure forced them to rely upon God. Brothers, how much pressure is upon you? You can only measure your power by your pressure. The pressure of the boiler determines the power of the steam. There has never been a believer whose power was greater than the pressure he experienced. If a believer wants to measure how much power he has before God, he should know that his power is only equal to the pressure he experiences. This law is never violated.</P><P>Many times believers pray, "God, please give me power." Do they know what they are praying for? If God responds to their prayer, He will cause them to be pressed, because God knows that the power of life can only be produced from the pressure of life. A life that is pressured is a life that has power. A life without pressure is a life without power. A life with great pressure is a life with great power. A life with a little pressure is a life with little power. The power I am referring to here is the power of life and not the power of anything else.</P><P>Now we want to take a look at some spiritual matters to prove the accuracy of the principle that pressure is power.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_066.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_068.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 10: The Present Testimony (3) &nbsp; pg 67</div><br></body></html>
