<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">CONSECRATION<br />AS REVEALED IN ROMANS 12</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: Friday evening, February 10, 1950<br />Place: Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong<br />Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:1-5</h1><h2 class="head1">INTRODUCTION</h2><p>In Paul's Epistle to the Romans, the first fifteen verses of chapter one are an introduction. The first section of his letter begins from verse 16 and goes through the end of chapter eleven. Chapter twelve begins the second section. In chapters one to eight of the first section, Paul shows us the riches we have obtained in Christ. In chapters nine through eleven, a contrast is made between the riches we have received and the riches the Israelites once received. From chapter twelve onward, Paul begins to exhort us to do something. In the first eight chapters, he repeatedly tells us what Christ has done for us and what the Spirit has done for us. He does not emphasize what we as Christians should do. In the first eleven chapters, Paul speaks of what the Triune God has accomplished for us. Since God has done so much, we should do something also. If we do not do anything in return, we are being unreasonable and ungrateful. At the very beginning of chapter twelve, Paul uses the word therefore. This indicates that he is continuing his previous discussion and relating it to what a believer should do. He says that we should present our bodies a living sacrifice to God. We may not be able to do much, but the least we can do is present our bodies a living sacrifice.</p><p>At the minimum, a Christian must see what Christ has done for him and what the Holy Spirit has done for him. Chapters one through seven tell us what Christ has done for us. Chapter eight tells us what the Holy Spirit has done for us. Chapters nine through eleven tell us what God's sovereignty and authority have done for us. In chapter twelve Paul tells us that all these works are based on God's compassion. The words compassion and mercy are the same word in the original language. God's compassion is the same as His love and mercy.</p><h2 class="head1">PRESENTING OUR BODIES<br />THROUGH THE COMPASSIONS OF GOD</h2><p>Paul says that since God loves us so much and is so merciful and gracious to us, we should consecrate ourselves. Anyone who wants to serve God must first touch His mercy and grace. If a man has not seen God's love and mercy, he will feel that it is a hard task to present his body to do something for God; he will feel that this is harder than making bricks for Pharaoh. Once a man sees God's mercy, however, it is a reasonable thing for him to present his body.</p><p>The first reaction of a man who has obtained mercy from God is consecration. Once a man touches God's love and mercy, he no longer can live for himself. Before he receives mercy and light, his possessions, his life, and his self are most precious to him. Once he touches God's love and mercy, however, he no longer treasures these things. Once we experience God's mercy, we will look back at ourselves under God's great shining and ask Him, "What should I do? What do You want from me?"</p><h2 class="head1">THE POWER OF CONSECRATION<br />COMES FROM GOD'S SHINING</h2><p>Before Paul believed in the Lord, he was a persecutor of the Lord's disciples. He obtained letters from the high priest to put into bondage those who called on the name of the Lord (Acts 9:1-2, 14). How proud and arrogant he was when he was riding on his horse to Damascus! Just as he was about to enter Damascus, a light from heaven shone on him, and he was struck down. Such a proud and arrogant person never would have consecrated himself if he had not touched God's great love and mercy. But as soon as the light shone, he no longer could sit comfortably; he had to come down from his throne. Paul immediately asked, "What shall I do, Lord?" (22:10). If we have not touched God's mercy, consecration is the hardest thing on earth. Everyone in the world loves himself; there is no one who does not treasure his own life and possessions. However, consecration is easy once we are brought before God's great love and compassion.</p>
