It is not that God will not give life to you; it is that you are not willing to have life! Therefore, while you are sitting here, if you have just a little desire to be saved, a tiny will to have eternal life, a tiny sensation to be released from sin, or a small wish to go to heaven, you will have it because God wants and wishes you would be this way. If you ask, you will have life. What does God want? God wants all men to have life. Do not be afraid. There is no problem on God's side; the problem lies on your side.</P><P>Once there was a man who met a gospel preacher in London. He said to the preacher, "Are you the one who preached in Paris before? Do you know that I have believed in Jesus?" The preacher said, "It is very good that you have believed." The man then said, "I believed in Jesus because of one word that you said." The preacher asked, "Which word was that?" He said, "You said that heaven's door is latched on the outside." Oh, the door latch of heaven were on the outside! You can only blame yourself if you do not enter. If the door latch of heaven were on the inside, you would not have any way to enter even if you wanted to enter. Then if God was happy, He would open it; but if He was not happy, He would close it, and you would have to knock on the door from the outside. But the door of heaven is latched on the outside! God has no problem; it all depends on your willingness to enter in.</P><P>Finally, let me tell you a story. There was a professor at Oxford University in England who was a Christian. He had many sons, and they all studied at Oxford. Every evening his house had a family worship meeting. His fourth son, the worst one, always found some excuse to skip the family worship. He would either leave right before the meeting started or would come home right after the meeting ended. One day he came home, and the meeting was not yet finished. The whole family was praying. He thought, "Let me go and see what they are praying." He became angry after he heard his mother's prayer; she said, "O God, my fourth son is a prodigal somewhere outside. He likes to play around and spend money, and he has no fear of You." The son became angry and said in his heart, "My mother did not pray for my oldest brother or my other brothers; she only prayed for me! I cannot stay in this house any longer!" He immediately ran upstairs and packed all the things in his room. He took some of his father's money and left a note to his parents, saying, "Since you do not consider me good enough to be your son, I do not want to be your son. I am leaving. Goodbye." Then he left the house. First, he stayed in a big hotel. When his money was about to run out, he moved into a friend's house. The friend said, "You can stay in my house, but not for long. Even though we are classmates, your father is my teacher. It would not be good if he found out about this." Eventually, he had no alternative but to move out of his friend's house into a small hotel. His money began to run out, and he soon did not have enough for food, clothing, or shelter. Then he decided to go home. Since it was too embarrassing to go home during the day, he waited until a little past midnight before he went home. He tried to climb through the window when he arrived, but all the windows were closed. Reluctantly, he tried the front door. To his surprise the door opened when he pushed; it was not even latched. He ran upstairs directly to his own room. When he pushed open the door, he was surprised to see his father sitting there, facing the door. He was still quite stubborn and immediately thought of something, saying, "Why is someone so careless? The front door is not even locked." His father took off his glasses and held the son's hand and said, "My son! Ever since the day you left home-for over a year-the front door has never been closed." Brothers and sisters, this is a father's heart! The door was not left open for a month or half a year; it was left open all the time. This is a father's love! Many times we think that we are sinners and that God may not want us. But friends, let me tell you that He has never closed the door. There is no problem on God's side. All the problems are on your side. If there is a sinner who will come to God and say, "I am a sinner; I have misunderstood You, but You are still willing to accept me," he will be saved.</P><P>The Lord Jesus once spoke a parable about the prodigal son. When he was a great way off, his father saw him, had compassion on him, ran, fell on his neck, and kissed him. This expresses God's heart. God is calling you home today. Jesus has died for you, and the Holy Spirit has come. No one sitting here needs to go to hell. You do not need to go to hell. But if you do not accept the Lord, there is no other way. I hope you can remember that God is love! If you will say to God, "I am a sinner. I am willing, and I want to accept You," you will be saved. Then God will rejoice, and you will also rejoice together with Him. God is love!</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> </body></html>
