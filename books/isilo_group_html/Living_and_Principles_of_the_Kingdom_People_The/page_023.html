<h1 class="title">THE PRINCIPLES OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE<br />
IN DEALING WITH OTHERS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 7:1-12</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the sixth section of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching in Matthew 5 through 7, which concerns the principles of the kingdom people in dealing with others. In the previous chapters we looked at the key points in the first five sections of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching. The Lord&rsquo;s word is concise, but every point touches our specific condition. Hence, the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens is not a theory or doctrine. The Lord examines our inward and outward condition, and He requires us to bring every detail of our living under His ruling by forsaking and denying the self and by living according to the life of God. God wants to rule in our heart in matters related to our attitude toward God, our attitude toward others, and our attitude toward ourselves. In order to do this, our flesh must be terminated. This is the way to practically live in the kingdom of the heavens as kingdom people.</p>
<p>The way that we deal with others and contact them is also important. We need to know the principles of the kingdom of the heavens that are involved in dealing with others. Hence, after speaking concerning material riches, the Lord unveiled the principles of the kingdom people in dealing with others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT JUDGING OTHERS</h2>
<p>Concerning the principles of the kingdom people in dealing with others, the Lord first spoke of how the kingdom people should view others. In Matthew 7:1 the Lord said, &ldquo;Do not judge.&rdquo; Our judgment of others is the expression of our view of others. Our view is inward, but our judgment is outward. If we have a certain view inwardly, we will spontaneously judge outwardly. The Lord does not want us to judge others; He does not want us to have opinions concerning others.</p>
<p>Most people share a common problem; they automatically form an opinion of others. This leads them to evaluate and criticize others. This common weakness is not allowed by the ruling of the heavens. Isaiah 42:19 says, &ldquo;Who is blind except My servant, / And as deaf as My messenger, whom I will send? / Who is as blind as the one at peace with Me, / And as blind as the servant of Jehovah?&rdquo; This describes the Lord when He was on the earth. Like a blind and deaf man, He was not sensitive to the things around Him. Those who are under the ruling of the heavens do not like to touch the affairs of others. The kingdom people are deaf and blind to persons, matters, and things that they encounter. It is hard for them to form an opinion of others.</p>
<p>In order for us not to judge others, we must not have an opinion of them. If we do not form opinions about the people we contact, we have learned a lesson before God. Those who are fleshly and live according to their temper form opinions of the people they contact, and this inevitably leads to judging. However, if we live in the Lord&rsquo;s presence and are restricted by the Spirit, we will not want to observe or to know the affairs of others. We will not form an opinion or have a feeling about those whom we contact; we will have a feeling only concerning someone who is under our care. Without opinions, it is hard for us to judge others.</p>
<p>Not judging others is not merely a matter of wanting to be delivered from the self. Those who are under the ruling of the heavens cannot judge others, because they want to avoid God&rsquo;s judgment. In Matthew 7:2 the Lord said, &ldquo;With what judgment you judge, you shall be judged.&rdquo; This reveals that in the future God will judge us according to how we judge others today. If we judge others harshly, God will judge us harshly.</p>
<p>Whenever we judge others, we need to be reminded that the judgment with which we judge others today will be the judgment with which the Lord will judge us in the future. If we want to avoid judgment in the future, we must not judge others today. If we do not want to fall under God&rsquo;s judgment in the future, we must not pass judgment on others today.</p>
<p>In verse 3 the Lord said, &ldquo;Why do you look at the splinter which is in your brother&rsquo;s eye, but the beam in your eye you do not consider?&rdquo; In other words, when we see others&rsquo; wrongdoings, we should realize that there are greater wrongdoings in us. Only when we remove our wrongdoings can we see others&rsquo; wrongdoings clearly. Hence, before we judge and condemn others, we must first judge and condemn ourselves. When we judge ourselves, our view will be clear.</p>
<p>Verses 1 through 5 reveal that we should not criticize or judge others carelessly. If we judge others carelessly, we will fall into two dangerous situations. The first danger is that we will bring judgment upon ourselves. The second danger is that our judgment may be incorrect and inaccurate. In order to avoid these two dangerous situations, we must be under the heavenly ruling in order to be delivered from the self.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Living and Principles of the Kingdom People &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
