   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAN'S UNDERSTANDING OF SIN AND SINS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before we were saved, we did not feel the evil of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before we became Christians, all that we felt was the evil of the many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even after we became Christians, what saddened us were our many sins, not sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The many sins made us feel terrible, not sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even though we are saved now, we may still lie or lose our temper, and we may be jealous and proud, or be inadvertently loose with others' possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, these individual sins bother us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What do we do?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We go before God and ask for forgiveness for each of these items.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may say, "O God, I have been bad today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have sinned again.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Please forgive me."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you did twelve wrong things yesterday, you felt sorry inside.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But if you have done only two wrong things today, you feel happy within.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You feel that you have committed far fewer sins today, that there are fewer sins in you now.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But let me remind you that this is only the initial stage of a Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During this period of time, we feel sorry only for the many sins that we commit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After we have been Christians for many years, we realize that what saddens and bothers us are not the many sins, but sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the end, we find out that it is not the things that we do that are wrong, but our person that is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not the things that we do that are evil; it is our person itself that is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One comes to realize that all the things that he has done are but outward matters and that the real evil thing is his person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is a natural principle inside us that causes us to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The outward things can be of many categories.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can call them pride, jealousy, filthiness, or any other names.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There can be all kinds of sins outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But within us there is only one principle, and it is something that craves sins.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is an inclination within us toward sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is something in our being that craves these outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why the Bible makes these outward sins plural in number; they are realized item by item.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Pride is one, lying is another, and fornication is yet another.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Pride is different from murder, and lying is different from fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But there is only one thing which inclines us to sin, which controls and entices us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The reason that we sin is that there is a law within us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It constantly directs us toward the outward sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This sin is singular in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It does not denote our conduct; rather, it denotes our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This sin is in our nature, and we need to be freed from it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since God's salvation for man is complete, He must deliver us from the many sins and He must also deliver us from sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If God only delivers us from the many sins, without delivering us from sin, then God's salvation cannot be said to be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since there are two things with us, the sins and the sin, we need a twofold salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the one hand, we need to be delivered from the many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the other hand, we need to be delivered from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the following pages we will see how in accomplishing His complete salvation through the redemption of Christ, God delivers us both from sins and from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I can clarify my point with an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The many sins are like the fruit of a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They exist individually, and a tree can bear one or two hundred of them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is how sins are.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sin, on the other hand, is like the tree itself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What we the sinners see with our eyes is the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We realize that the fruits are bad, but we do not see that the tree is just as bad.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The fruits are bad because the tree is bad.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is how God teaches us to understand the problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the beginning He shows us the individual sins.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the end, He shows us ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At the beginning we need forgiveness because we have committed sins.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But after a while we realize that we need to be freed because we are sinners.</S>
