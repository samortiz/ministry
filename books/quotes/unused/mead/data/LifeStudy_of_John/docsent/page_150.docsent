   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Name Father</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Slightly Mentioned in the Old Testament</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While the names God and Jehovah are fully revealed in the Old Testament, the name Father is not fully revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is only slightly mentioned in such places as Isaiah 9:6; 63:16; and 64:8.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is the revelation behind the name Father?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Father is the name for the relationship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I say, my Father, I mean that I have His life and that I was born of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Old Testament does not unfold the revelation that God is a begetting Father who will regenerate countless persons.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is in the New Testament that the Lord reveals God as the Father who regenerates many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is the source of life; hence, He is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is His intention to bring forth innumerable sons by regenerating them with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God is the Father because He begets many people with His life, making them His children and His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the book of Matthew the Lord taught His disciples to call God Father, saying, Our Father who is in the heavens Matt 6:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we call God our Father, we must realize that He is our genuine Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is not our father-in-law, and we are not His adopted children.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our Father is our Father in life, our genuine Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We call Him Father because we were born of Him and have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How sweet it is to call God our Father!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Both Romans 8:15 and Galatians 4:6 speak of crying, Abba, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Throughout the world, little children use a double title, such as Papa, or Mama, when addressing their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To say Pa or Ma is not very intimate.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But Papa or Mama is intimate.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Among every race the children call their fathers Papa, Baba, or something similar.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If I were not born of my father, yet I had to call him Papa, it would be very awkward.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It would even be awkward to address your father-in-law in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It would not be so sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One day a newly-saved person came to Brother Nee and asked him why Romans 8:15 and 16 say that crying, Abba, Father, is a witness that we are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brother Nee immediately asked this young brother if he was married.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When he replied that he was, Brother Nee said, When you first visited your wife s parents after you were married, what did you call your father-in-law?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The young brother answered, In a very reluctant way I called him Papa.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then Brother Nee inquired, When you are calling your own father, do you address him in such a reluctant way?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The brother said, Certainly not.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I call upon my father, it is so sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Brother Nee asked him why he called his wife s father Papa reluctantly, he said, Because he is not my father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then Brother Nee said, That s right.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He s not your father.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So it s really difficult to call him Papa.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God is not your father-in-law; He is your Father, your Father in life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because God is our Father in life, it is so sweet to call upon Him, saying, Abba, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you sense this sweetness, you know that you are His child and that He truly is your Father in life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Son Having Come and Worked in the Father s Name</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ came as the Son of God in the Father s name 5:43 and worked in the Father s name 10:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the Father s name means in the reality of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As the Son is one with the Father 10:30 , so He came and worked in the Father s name, that is, in the Father s reality.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Son Manifesting the Father to His Believers</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As the Son is one with the Father, so, when He was with the believers, He manifested the Father to them in what the Father is.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When they saw Him, they saw the Father 14:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Father is expressed in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>e. The Son Making the Name Father</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Known to the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 17:26 the Lord said, And I have made Your name known to them, and will make it known.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In what way did the Son make the Father s name known to the believers?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It was not by teaching but by imparting life into the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The best way to make a father known to a little boy is to impart that father s life into the boy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is much more difficult for an adopted son to know his father than it is for a son who is actually born with a certain man s life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have the Father s life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because we are the same in life and nature as the Father is, it is easy for us to know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As the Son of the Father, the Lord Jesus came to impart life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Since the Father s life has been imparted into us, spontaneously the Father is made known to us by life, not by teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In life we know the Father.</S>
