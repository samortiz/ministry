   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE TWELVE THE CHURCH IN PERGAMOS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>EATING FOR TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we come to the third church, the church in Pergamos 2:12-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we have pointed out, the name of each of the seven cities is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Greek Pergamos means marriage, implying union, and fortified tower.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As a sign, the church in Pergamos prefigures the church which entered into a marriage union with the world and became a high fortified tower, equivalent to the great tree prophesied by the Lord in the parable of the mustard seed Matt 13:31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When Satan failed to destroy the church through the persecution of the Roman Empire in the first three centuries, he changed his strategy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He sought instead to corrupt her through Constantine s welcoming her as the state religion in the first part of the fourth century.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through Constantine s encouragement and political influence, multitudes of unbelieving ones were baptized into the church, and the church became monstrously great.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since the church is a spouse to Christ as a chaste bride, her union with the world is considered spiritual fornication in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I. THE SPEAKER</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>HE WHO HAS THE SHARP TWO-EDGED SWORD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 12 says, These things says He who has the sharp two-edged sword.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this epistle, the Lord as the speaking Spirit declares that He is the One with the sharp two-edged sword.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such a worldly church is qualified to receive the Lord s judgment in His sharp word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE CHURCH S MARRIAGE TO THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the epistle to the first church, the Lord advised the church in Ephesus to repent and to recover her first love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must believe that His advice was heeded, for the second church, the church in Smyrna, truly loved the Lord and suffered persecution and became a suffering church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the facts of history, during the first three centuries, the church suffered a great deal as the Roman government tried its best to damage her.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, the enemy, Satan, realized that persecution did not work very well.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, being the subtle one, he changed his strategy from persecuting the church to welcoming her.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the early part of the fourth century, Constantine the Great accepted Christianity and made it a state religion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From that time onward, Christianity became a type of Roman state church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This welcoming of the church by the Roman Empire ruined her, because it caused the church to become worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we all know, the church has been called out of the world and has been separated from the world to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, by being welcomed by the Roman Empire, the church went back to the world and, in the eyes of God, even married the world.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God considers this type of worldly union to be spiritual fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Due to this marriage, the church lost her purity and became worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because the church had entered into union with the world, many worldly things came into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Worldly things are related to idol worship, for worldliness is always associated with idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church in Pergamos firstly became worldly and then idolatrous.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Satan saturated her with the world and with idols.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As a result, the church became absolutely different from what God intended her to be.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God desires a church which is outside of the world, having nothing to do with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church must be a golden lampstand, the pure expression of the Triune God, and must have no connections with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But after the Roman Empire had made the church a worldly religion, she became altogether impure, worldly, and idolatrous.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A. Where Satan Dwells</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verse 13 the Lord said of the church in Pergamos, I know where you dwell, where Satan s throne is.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Satan s dwelling place is the world.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since the church has entered into union with the world and has become worldly herself, she now dwells where Satan dwells in the world.</S>
