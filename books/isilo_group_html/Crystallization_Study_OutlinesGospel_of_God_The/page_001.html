<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Most Christians have a limited, superficial, and mistaken view concerning the gospel, and they preach a gospel that is low and superficial; this should not be the situation in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery&mdash;John 3:16; 8:32; 14:6; 17:17; 18:37; Eph. 3:8; 1 Tim. 2:4.</li>
<li>The gospel is &ldquo;veiled in those who are perishing&rdquo;&mdash;2 Cor. 4:3-4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In principle, anything such as philosophy, religion, or cultural traditions that hinders people from apprehending the gospel of Christ is a veil&mdash;3:14-15.</li>
	<li>On Mount Zion God &ldquo;will swallow up / The covering that covers up all the peoples, / Even the veil that veils all the nations&rdquo;&mdash;Isa. 25:7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Today the people on earth are covered with a veil that keeps them from seeing God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;2 Cor. 3:15; 4:3-4; 1 Tim. 1:4.</li>
		<li>In the restoration God will take away this covering; then all the people will see something concerning God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;Eph. 3:9; 2 Cor. 3:16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The gospel of God is the totality of the divine truths&mdash;Eph. 1:13; Col. 1:5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The truth is the gospel, and our preaching of the truth is the preaching of the gospel&mdash;Eph. 1:13; 1 Tim. 2:4, 7.</li>
	<li>The gospel of God includes all the divine truths; the expression <em>the divine truths</em> refers to the New Testament economy of God, which is the gospel&mdash;Gal. 2:5, 14; Eph. 3:9; 6:19.</li>
	<li>The entire New Testament is the gospel; because the New Testament as the gospel is typified by the Old Testament, we may say that the gospel actually includes the entire Bible&mdash;Luke 24:27, 44-45; John 5:39, 46.</li>
	<li>The gospel includes all the truths in the Bible; the entire Bible is the gospel of God&mdash;Eph. 1:13; Col. 1:5; 1 Thes. 1:5; 2 Thes. 2:13-14; 1 Tim. 2:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The truth is the gospel, and the light of the truth is the light of the gospel&mdash;Mark 1:1, 14-15; John 8:12, 32.</li>
		<li>To preach the truth is to preach the high gospel, because the real gospel preaching is the speaking of the truth&mdash;Mark 1:14-15; John 18:37.</li>
		<li>If we would spread the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today, we must bear the burden to diligently study the truth to the extent that we can expound the truth and announce the truth&mdash;2 Tim. 2:15; 1 Thes. 2:4; Matt. 28:19-20; Mark 16:15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The gospel of God is the fulfillment of the Old Testament&mdash;1:1, 14-15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In order to know what the gospel is, we need to read the Old Testament and be enlightened concerning the revelation that is given there&mdash;Luke 24:44-46.</li>
	<li>The gospel is the fulfillment of the promises, prophecies, and types and the removal of the law; this is the full definition of the gospel&mdash;Matt. 17:2-8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The gospel is the fulfillment of the promises, such as:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The gospel is the fulfillment of the promise that the seed of the woman would crush the head of the serpent&mdash;Gen. 3:15.</li>
			<li>God promised that Abraham&rsquo;s seed would be a great blessing to all mankind, for all the nations would be blessed through this seed&mdash;22:17-18.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The gospel is the fulfillment of the prophecies, such as:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ was the One born in Bethlehem&mdash;Micah 5:2.</li>
			<li>Christ was the One wounded because of our transgressions&mdash;Isa. 53:5.</li>
			<li>Christ was the One raised from the dead on the third day&mdash;Hosea 6:2.</li>
			<li>Christ was the One begotten as the firstborn Son of God&mdash;Psa. 2:7.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The gospel is the fulfillment of the types, such as:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Lord&rsquo;s action in making coats of skin for Adam and his wife is a type&mdash;Gen. 3:21.</li>
			<li>Other types include the ark (7:13), the passover (Exo. 12:3-13), the manna (16:31), the cleft rock (17:6), the tabernacle (25:9), Joshua (Josh. 1:1-2), David (1 Sam. 16:13), and Solomon (1 Kings 6:1).</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The gospel is the removal of the law&mdash;Rom. 10:4:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The gospel annuls the custody of the law&mdash;Gal. 3:23-26; John 10:1-9.</li>
			<li>For Christ to be &ldquo;the end of the law&rdquo; means that He has completed and terminated the law&mdash;Rom. 10:4:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Christ came to fulfill the law; by fulfilling the law He terminated the law&mdash;Matt. 5:17.</li>
				<li>2) The result of Christ&rsquo;s terminating the law is that God&rsquo;s righteousness is given to everyone who believes&mdash;Rom. 3:21-26.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Christ, the unique One, is the fulfillment of the entire Old Testament; the fulfillment of the promises, prophecies, and types and the removal of the law are a living person, Jesus Christ&mdash;Matt. 17:2-8; Rom. 10:4; Heb. 1:1-3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The gospel of God is the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery&mdash;Rom. 16:25:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We are established according to the pure and full gospel of God; Paul&rsquo;s gospel is the full gospel, including the teaching concerning Christ, the Body, and the local churches&mdash;1:3-4; 2:16; 3:23-26; 12:4-5; 16:1, 4, 16, 25.</li>
	<li>The gospel is the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery&mdash;v. 25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The gospel of God is a proclamation, an official public announcement; the Lord Jesus and the apostles proclaimed the gospel&mdash;Matt. 26:13; Mark 1:14; 16:15; Rom. 1:15; 10:15; Col. 1:27-28; cf. Rev. 14:6-7.</li>
		<li>The gospel is the proclamation of Jesus Christ&mdash;Acts 8:5, 12; 9:20; 17:18.</li>
		<li>The proclamation of Jesus Christ is according to &ldquo;the revelation of the mystery&rdquo;; this mystery is mainly of two aspects&mdash;Rom. 16:25:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The mystery of God is Christ, who is in the believers as their life and everything for His Body&mdash;Col. 2:2; 1:26-27; 3:4-11; Rom. 12:4-5.</li>
			<li>The mystery of Christ is the church as His Body to express His fullness&mdash;Eph. 3:4-6; 1:22-23.</li>
			</ol></li>
