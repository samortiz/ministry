   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN EXPERIENCING DEATH AND ASCENSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE SPIRIT OF RESURRECTION Scripture Reading: Rom 6:5, 13; 8:11; Acts 2:33, 36; Eph 1:20-22.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that God and everything of God, that is, all that God is, has, has passed through, has accomplished, and has attained, are all stored in the Holy Spirit and have entered into us through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, if we want to touch God and everything of God, we must touch the Holy Spirit, because God Himself and all that He has accomplished have been aggregated in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>DEATH, RESURRECTION, AND ASCENSION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>BEING CONNECTED</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we touch the Holy Spirit, we live in resurrection, and only when we are living in resurrection will we have various spiritual experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These spiritual experiences are spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In other words, we have spiritual reality when we are in resurrection and have spiritual experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are at least five elements in the Holy Spirit the divine element, the human element, the element of death, the element of resurrection, and the element of ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although death, resurrection, and ascension are three elements, they are connected together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Just as we cannot separate death from resurrection, so we cannot separate resurrection from ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Most Bible readers know that death is closely connected to resurrection and that resurrection is closely followed by ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is impossible to have resurrection without ascension; ascension and resurrection are connected.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, death, resurrection, and ascension are closely connected.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE DEATH IN ROMANS 6 AND</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE RESURRECTION IN ROMANS 8 BEING CONNECTED</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Romans 6 speaks particularly about the death of Christ, but when Christ s death is mentioned, resurrection is also mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 5 says, For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once we mention death, we have to mention resurrection, because resurrection and death are connected.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that all those who experience the death of Christ are those who are raised from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The living of such ones is the living of those who are raised from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, the issue of the death in chapter six is man being brought into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then chapter eight shows us that resurrection is in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This chapter particularly speaks of living in the Holy Spirit and shows us that to live in the Holy Spirit is to live in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 9 says, If indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This Spirit is the Spirit of the One who raised Christ Jesus from the dead, the Spirit of resurrection v. 11 . Hence, when we live in the spirit, we live in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is the Spirit of resurrection who raised us up and who not only resurrected our spirit but also brought our whole being into the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In other words, the Spirit of resurrection not only causes every part of our soul to be in the spirit, but one day He will even give life to our mortal bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore we have to see that Romans 8 talks about the Holy Spirit and resurrection and that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can see that chapter eight follows chapter six.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Chapter six speaks of death, and chapter eight speaks of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The death in chapter six is connected to the resurrection in chapter eight.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, death and resurrection are closely connected to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We cannot touch Christ s death without touching Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we touch Christ s death, we are in Romans 6, and at the same time, we are also in the resurrection in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Death and resurrection are closely connected to each other.</S>
