You can only obtain the overcoming life; you cannot attain the overcoming life. To obtain means to receive, but to attain means that there is a long way to go. Did you have to strive and struggle for your salvation? No. You experienced salvation as soon as you received. In the same way, victory is obtained. It is not attained through struggling and striving. To obtain means to have something immediately. Let us look at 1 Corinthians 15:57: "But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ." Thank God that victory is not something that we attain through much labor. Victory is given by God. God has given it to us, and all we have to do is stretch out our hands to take it.</p><p>Mr. Trumbull was a very spiritual man. He realized that the overcoming life is a miracle. Once he testified to an elder that his temper disappeared from the time that he had received the Lord Jesus as his life; even the desire to lose his temper had disappeared. The elder said, "I believe this is true in you, but it is not a reality for me." Later Mr. Trumbull invited the elder to pray together with him. Afterwards the elder testified, "In my entire life I never experienced what I experienced that evening. It was a miracle! There was no wrestling and no strenuous work. The urge was gone, and even the desire was gone. It was wonderful. It was nothing less than a miracle." Not long afterwards, he wrote a letter to Mr. Trumbull telling him of an evil power at the place where he worked. In the past he would have tried to suppress himself, but from the time he prayed with Mr. Trumbull, he did not have to suppress himself anymore; even the desire to suppress himself was gone.</p><p>There was once an Anglican preacher in England by the name of Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;. One day his daughter died. When he returned home from the funeral, he wondered what message he would deliver the next day, which was Sunday. He picked the text 2 Corinthians 12:9 as the subject of his sermon, which says, "My grace is sufficient for you." He knelt down and asked God to bless the subject. While he was praying, he asked himself, "Is the grace of God sufficient for me? If God's grace is not sufficient for me, how can I say to others that His grace is sufficient? My daughter has died and I feel sad, heartbroken, and hurt. This means that God's grace is not sufficient for me. I cannot lie." He thought about changing the subject, but there was no time. He could only pray, "God, help me to experience Your sufficient grace. May Your grace be sufficient for me." He prayed for a long time, but nothing seemed to work. Then he glanced casually at a verse on the mantel. The verse had been placed there by his mother while he was at the funeral. The verse was 2 Corinthians 12:9, "My grace is sufficient for you." The words "My" and "you" were blue, the words "is sufficient" were red, and the rest were black. Suddenly he was enlightened by the Lord. He said to himself, "The Lord says that His grace is sufficient for me. Yet I am saying that His grace is not sufficient for me." He began to confess his sin to the Lord, saying, "God, You have said that Your grace is sufficient. Yet I am still praying for Your grace to become sufficient for me." As he was confessing, he was also praising and thanking God for the sufficiency of His grace. Soon he was filled with joy and thanksgiving. The next day, when he stepped onto the podium, he delivered the best message of his entire life. When others asked about the secret of his message, he answered that he saw what faith is after his daughter's funeral. Faith is not asking God to fulfill His promises. Faith is praising and thanking God for what He has spoken. From that time he experienced a great change in his life.</p><p>When God's life comes into us, it enables us to live a life on earth that is just the same as the one His Son lived in Nazareth. God is raising up a new race&mdash;those who have God's Son as their life and who live out the life of His Son. Philippians 4:13 says, "I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me." The Lord in you is empowering you. You have to see that nothing is too difficult for you because the One within you is empowering you. This One is omnipotent. The Lord does not want you to be an ordinary person; He wants you to live a life that God lives, to speak what no man can speak, to do what no man can do, to experience what no man can experience, and to face what no man can face. When Christ lives in you, you can live such a life.</p><p>I want to say one word that may offend some people. Many people who go to church are quite dispensable. Whether or not they are around does not mean much, and whether or not they are gone does not mean much either. God can never use such people, because they have not lived the overcoming life. They cannot testify to the world of the life of Christ and cannot help others overcome. We have to ask the Lord to enlighten us and show us the characteristics of the overcoming life. Thank God that our salvation is a full salvation. God has not only saved us from the judgment of sin, but also from the bondage of sin. God's way of salvation is for Christ to suffer sin's punishment on our behalf, to crucify our old man with Him, and to release His life and dispense it to us. Today He dwells within us. His indwelling constitutes our overcoming life.</p><p>Thank the Lord that His throne is in the heavens as well as in man's heart. Thank the Lord that He lives in the heavens as well as within us. He can accomplish God's desire within us. All the great and difficult commandments in the Bible are not for man to keep. They are meant for the Lord to keep. The harder the commandments are, the more they prove that only the Lord can fulfill them. Miss Barber once wrote the following words in her Bible beside the passage in Matthew that says we should love the Lord our God with our whole heart, soul, and will: "Lord, I thank You for this commandment." She knew that the Lord was the One who could accomplish this. The commandments in the Bible can only be fulfilled by Christ. Thank and praise the Lord. Christ is our life, and He is our victory.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_078.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_080.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 42: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (2) &nbsp; pg 79</div><br></body></html>
