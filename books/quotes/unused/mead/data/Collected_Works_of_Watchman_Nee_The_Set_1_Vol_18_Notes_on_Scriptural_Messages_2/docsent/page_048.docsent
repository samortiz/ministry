   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PAUL'S PATTERN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The same is true with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is why he could say, "Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ" 1 Cor 11:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As far as knowledge is concerned, even God feared that Paul's knowledge would become too great.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, He allowed the messenger of Satan to buffet him and press him down so that he might not be exceedingly lifted up.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul was caught away into Paradise and heard unspeakable words words which were not allowed for a man to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It seemed as if God had shown him too much.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Within him, there were still many things that he did not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are still many questions which we would like to ask him today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He knew the mysteries, all kinds of mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He mentioned "the transcendence of the revelations" 2 Cor 12:7 that he received and that he was not inferior to the super-apostles in anything v. 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Concerning faith, he said, "For we walk by faith, not by appearance" 2 Cor 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He said that he once fought with wild beasts at Ephesus 1 Cor 15:32 and despaired even of living 2 Cor 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet through God who raises the dead v. 9 , he was able to find the good end. He could perform works of wonders and heal sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was a prophet and not afraid of snake bites.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When he was on a ship and everyone abandoned hope of being saved, even when no one had food for a long time and there seemed to be nothing that anyone could do, he was still able to calm everyone down.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He could do this because of what he said: "I believe God that it shall be so, even in the way in which it has been spoken to me" Acts 27:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was his life of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not only did he have knowledge and faith, but he was also excellent in life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He could say, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me" Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He could truly say, "For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain" Phil 1:21 and "Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body" 2 Cor 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the same time, he was very zealous in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was truly zealous.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He went from Jerusalem and round about to Illyricum, preaching the gospel of Christ everywhere he went.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He said, "But now I no longer have place in these regions" Rom 15:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brothers, have you ever preached in a region until there was no longer any place to preach in that region?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul said this as if he knew every face there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While he was on the road, he preached the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While he was at sea, he preached the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While he was in prison, he preached the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even while he was under bondage in Rome, his testimony became manifest among the whole Praetorian guard and to all the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that even his guards received the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These guards were originally posted there to keep a watch on Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But they became locked up by the Christ whom Paul preached; they had become the prisoners of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>My intention is not just to speak on the Lord's commands, nor on Paul's experience, but to draw your attention to one thing: a Christian ought to be a four-sided person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every Christian must pay attention to these four things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not only should we have zeal, but faith as well.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not only should we grow in knowledge, but in life as well.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If any one of the four things are missing, there will be an imbalance.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Please analyze the experiences of Paul when you read the New Testament again, and see if zeal, faith, knowledge, and life are the four characteristics of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are only speaking in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why we say that there are only these four points.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the Lord's commands, we should not only be encouraged to have zeal and faith, but we should also grow in knowledge and life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today I will speak a little more about faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sadly, the church has become desolate and lost its eyes for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have a perfect Lord, but there are so many different kinds of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I am not talking about differences in terms of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some have tempers, while others have pride.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The devil can create a hundred different kinds of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The differences I am talking about are the differences in the good things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Brothers, when you contact others, do you not feel that there are many different kinds of virtues?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>EXAMPLES OF ONE-SIDEDNESS</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once I met a Western missionary preaching in Kweichow.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was very zealous for the Lord in China.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although he was a university graduate and a capable man, he was willing to give up everything in order to preach the gospel in inland China.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>During the Boxer Rebellion, he was preaching the gospel in China.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He had many virtues and was very powerful in preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Yet his virtues were all one-sided in the matter of zeal; he was lacking in the other aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I also met a missionary in Shanghai who was very good at memorizing the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He could memorize the Scriptures verse by verse and expound them with much light.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>His knowledge was very good, but in the matter of faith in God, he was lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When he was sick, he was hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When he caught a cold, he would have to find a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As far as his knowledge was concerned, he could speak about faith.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But he had no assurance of what faith actually was.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At the same time, his life did not match his knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I knew another Western missionary who was as gentle as a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whenever you prayed with her, she would carry you away with her gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>She never lost her temper.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Wherever she was, God's presence was there.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>She indeed had considerable growth in life, but she did not have much knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>She was also strong in faith, though faith was not her special characteristic.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>She also had zeal, but her zeal was not as strong as her growth in life.</S>
