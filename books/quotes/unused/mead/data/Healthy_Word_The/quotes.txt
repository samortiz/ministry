[1]  Experiencing Christ as the Way, the Reality, and the Life
[2]  The Elements of the Word Being Christ, the Death of Christ, and the Resurrection of Christ
[3]  THE REALITY, AND THE LIFE Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4, 14, 17; 8:32; 14:6
[4]  The book of John may be familiar to us, yet we can never exhaust the riches in this deep book.
[5]  In our experience we first gain the Lord as our life, then we have the reality, and the reality eventually becomes the way.
[6]  When we are at the Lord s table, if we do not see the Body of Christ, Christ the Head, and the death and resurrection of Christ, we have only doctrine.
[7]  If we have seen the truth, the reality, of the Lord s table, we will touch the reality of the Body of Christ in our spirit when we participate in the physical symbols, and through the Body we will realize and enjoy Christ the Head.
[8]  The truth of the reality of the Body of Christ, Christ as the Head, and the death and resurrection of Christ is conveyed in the doctrine of the Lord s table, but we are not destined by God for the doctrine.
[9]  Every doctrine is a shell; the reality, the truth, is the content.
[10]  For instance, we may learn all the verses concerning sinners needing God s forgiveness.
[11]  When we participate in the table, we should realize deep in our spirit that we are participating in the Body of Christ, of which Christ is the Head, and that we are enjoying and sharing in the all-inclusive and all-accomplishing death of Christ as well as His resurrection.
[12]  We need to see that Christ today is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit in our spirit and that our Christian life is simply to live this Christ.
[13]  Every morning, before we do anything else, we need to ask the Lord to keep us in Him.
[14]  If we pray like this, we will live Christ we will live by Him as our life.
[15]  We preach Christ not by any way; we preach Christ by Christ Himself as the unique way.
[16]  Question: I recently met some brothers who are in the same profession as I am.
[17]  In John 14:6 the Lord said, I am the way and the reality and the life.
[18]  The Greek word for reality in this verse may also be translated as truth cf.
[19]  The unique and living way to preach the gospel is simply to live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ.
[20]  As the children of God, we need to know, realize, apprehend, experience, hold on to, and practice the truth.
[21]  The Lord said, This cup is the new covenant established in My blood, which is being poured out for you Luke 22:20 .
[22]  The cup of the Lord s table is not only a doctrine; it implies the truth.
[23]  For example, the cup of salvation is the portion of God s salvation Psa 116:13 , and the cup of blessing is the portion of God s blessing 1 Cor 10:16 .
[24]  Negatively, the cup of God s wrath is the portion of God s wrath Rev 14:10 .
[25]  Question: Although Christ is the unique Head, we do have leading brothers and elders in the churches.
[26]  CHAPTER THREE THE HEALTHY WORD Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 1:10; 4:6; 6:3; 2 Tim 1:13; 3:16; 4:3; Titus 1:9; 2:1; 1 Cor 1:18; Phil 2:16 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BIBLE The Bible Being the Embodiment of God,
[27]  There are four great things that are real and living yet altogether mysterious, invisible, abstract, and intangible: God, Christ, the Spirit, and the divine life.
[28]  Without the Bible, God is altogether untouchable, but through the Bible we can touch God.
[29]  Any time we come to the Bible with an open heart, even before we open the book, we have the sense that we have come into the presence of God.
[30]  We sense that we are in the presence of God when we come to the Bible, because the Bible is the embodiment of God, Christ, the Spirit, and the eternal life of God.
[31]  Although the Bible is available to everyone today, regrettably, not many Christians apply the Bible in a practical way to their daily living.
[32]  If we, the children of God, apply the holy word of our heavenly Father practically to our daily living, we will witness the transformation of our life, and we will influence our family, friends, neighbors, and relatives.
[33]  CHAPTER FOUR GOD S ECONOMY Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 1:3-5, 7; Eph 3:2; Col 2:8; John 15:1
[34]  The two Epistles to Timothy were written by the apostle Paul during a time of the church s degradation.
[35]  In order to see what God s economy is, we need to consider each instance in which the word economy is used in the New Testament.
[36]  To Teach Things Other Than God s Economy Producing Questionings
[37]  Different teachings produce questionings, but the teachings that minister Christ do not cause questionings.
[38]  The teaching of the law was according to the Old Testament and was therefore scriptural, yet it was different from God s New Testament economy, which is to dispense Christ as the life supply to God s children that the church might be built up.
[39]  Although teaching the law is according to the Scriptures, it is different from God s economy, and it therefore produces questionings rather than building up the church.
[40]  CHAPTER FIVE THE MYSTERY OF GODLINESS Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 3:15-16; 2:2b, 10; 4:7-8; 6:3, 5-6, 11; 2 Tim 3:5, 12; 2:16 GODLINESS BEING THE MANIFESTATION
[41]  It is not that Christ s daily walk merely bore the likeness of God; rather, God Himself was manifested in Christ in His living.
[42]  We know that the manifestation of God in the flesh refers to both Christ and the church, because Christ is the Head, and the church is His Body.
[43]  The manifestation of God in the flesh should not be limited to church meetings but should also be found in all the areas of our daily life, such as our family life, marriage life, school life, and professional life.
[44]  First Timothy 2:2b says, That we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all godliness and gravity.
[45]  In all godliness means that there should be the manifestation of God in every aspect of our life.
[46]  AND THE IMPERATIVE WORD Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 1:10b; 4:6, 12; 6:3, 11; 2 Tim 1:7, 13; 2:1, 22; 4:3, 22; Titus 1:9; 2:1 THE BIBLE BEING GOD-BREATHED
[47]  Second Timothy 3:16 says, All Scripture is God-breathed.
[48]  This verse is unique in defining the Bible as God s breathing.
[49]  The word in the Bible is not simply an utterance; the Bible is the breath and even the breathing of God.
[50]  We also need to see the elements of the healthy word.
[51]  In like manner, the healthy word is composed of three elements Christ, His death, and His resurrection.
[52]  The words of the faith, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, the word of the truth, and the words of the Scriptures always contain these three elements.
[53]  Anytime we pray-read a portion of the Bible, we will receive Christ, the killing power of His death, and His resurrection power.
[54]  If we pray-read John 1:1, 4, and 14, we will receive the riches of Christ as the Word, who was in the beginning with God, who is God, in whom is life, who became flesh to be our Savior and Redeemer, and who is full of grace and reality.
[55]  A particular characteristic of the two Epistles to Timothy is that they contain many imperative words.
[56]  One such word is 2 Timothy 2:1, which says, You therefore, my child, be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.
[57]  This word was written because the church was in degradation, and Satan was telling the children of God, You cannot make it.
[58]  THE TRANSMISSION OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 1:12, 15a, 19; 2:9, 16-17; 3:4, 10-11; 1:27; John 6:63; 2 Tim 3:16-17
[59]  In this chapter we will consider who and what Christ is.
[60]  Christ is not only a person of many aspects, but He is also many things and matters.
[61]  It is difficult to fully describe who Christ is, and it is even more difficult to describe what Christ is.
[62]  Colossians 3:10-11 says, The new man...where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.
[63]  Whenever we come to the Bible with a sincere heart and an open spirit, we immediately touch Christ as the Spirit.
[64]  Often when we come to the Bible, we have a deep sense that we have entered into the presence of God.
[65]  The Bible is not only the word of God but also God s breath and even God s breathing.
[66]  John 1:1 mentions two great items God, and Christ as the Word.
[67]  Moreover, God is Christ v. 1 , God is the Spirit 7:39 , Christ is the Spirit 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17 , Christ is life Col 3:4 , and the Spirit is life John 6:63; 1 Cor 15:45; Rom 8:2 . Thus, God, Christ, the Spirit, and life are all one.
[68]  The Bible as God s breath 2 Tim 3:16 conveys God, Christ, the Spirit, and life into our being, just as a wire conveys electricity into a building.
[69]  THE PILLAR AND BASE OF THE TRUTH Scripture Reading: John 1:17; 8:32; 14:6, 17; 17:17; 1 Tim 3:15; 2 Tim 2:15 TRUTH BEING NOT DOCTRINE
[70]  First Timothy 3:15 says that the church is the pillar and base of the truth.
[71]  The Spirit is the reality of Christ, the reality of Christ s death, and the reality of Christ s resurrection.
