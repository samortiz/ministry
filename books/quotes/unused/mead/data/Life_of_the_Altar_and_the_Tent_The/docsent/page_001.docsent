   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LIFE OF THE ALTAR AND THE TENT Scripture Reading: Gen 12:7-8; 13:3, 4, 18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The life of a Christian is the life of the altar and the tent.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The altar is toward God while the tent is toward the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In His presence, God requires that His children have an altar and on the earth that they have a tent.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>An altar calls for a tent, and a tent in turn demands an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is impossible to have an altar without a tent, and it is also impossible to have a tent without a return to the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The altar and the tent are interrelated; they cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE LIFE OF THE ALTAR</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Genesis 12:7 says, "The Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this verse we see that the altar is based on God's appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Where there is no divine appearance, there is no altar.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No one can offer himself to God unless he has first met God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Unless God has appeared to a man, he cannot offer his all to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Consecration is not the result of man's exhortation or persuasion but of God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No one can voluntarily offer up all he has on the altar if God has not first appeared to him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By nature, no one can offer himself to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even when a man does want to offer himself to God, he finds that he really has nothing to offer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some have said, "I want to give my heart to the Lord, but my heart will not agree."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man cannot come over to God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, when man meets God, consecration takes place spontaneously in his life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you catch sight of God just once and touch God just once, you are no longer your own.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God is Someone who cannot be touched lightly!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once a man touches God, he can no longer live for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to realize that the power to offer oneself to God comes through His appearance; it comes from His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who talk about consecration are not necessarily consecrated themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not everyone who preaches consecration or understands the doctrine of consecration is a consecrated person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only those who have seen God are consecrated persons.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God appeared to Abraham, and the immediate issue was that Abraham built an altar to God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus appeared to Paul on the road to Damascus, and Paul immediately asked, "What shall I do, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Acts 22:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A turning point in our spiritual life does not come through our decision to do something for God; it does not come as a result of our resolving to do this or that for God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It comes when we see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we meet God, a radical change takes place in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can no longer do what we did in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we meet God Himself, we have the power to deny ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The matter of denying one's self ceases to be optional when we have met God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His appearance makes a person unable to go on by himself; it forces him to not live by himself anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God's appearance brings with it inexhaustible power.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such an appearance will alter the whole course of a person's life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For a Christian, the power to live for God is based on his vision of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Oh!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not our decision to serve the Lord that enables us to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not our will to build an altar that produces an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>An altar is built when God comes to a man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thank the Lord that He does not have to say anything when He appears.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet many times, He chooses to say something when He appears.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When God appeared to Abraham, He said to him, "Unto thy seed have I given this land" Gen 15:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God's appearance brings us into a new inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It brings the realization that the Holy Spirit has been given to us as an earnest of the inheritance which we shall later possess in fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The part that we have received today in the Holy Spirit will be ours in full in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When God's plan is fulfilled, we will enter the full inheritance.</S>
