   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST BEING CRUCIFIED ON THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Christ died as the Lamb of God, He died for us; that is, He died on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is somewhat objective, because it implies that He died on the cross by Himself, apart from us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, He also died in the likeness of the flesh of sin, meaning that He died in the likeness of a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates that He identified Himself with us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The fact that He died in the likeness of the flesh of sin means that He died in our likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is not objective, but subjective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He joined Himself to us the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He even put us, the sinners who are the flesh of sin, upon Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, He died in our likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then, when Christ died on the cross as the brass serpent, He brought the Devil with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, we need to realize that the Devil whom Christ brought to the cross is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the day of man s fall, the Devil, Satan, as the personification of sin, entered into man Rom 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From that day until now, Satan as sin has been dwelling in our flesh, in our sinful nature Rom 7:18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, when Christ died in our likeness, He brought the Devil with Him to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hallelujah, Christ died in the flesh!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since Satan was in the flesh, when Christ died in the likeness of our flesh, the Devil died with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In His death He brought the Devil with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, Hebrews 2:14 says that through death Christ destroyed the Devil, the one who has the might of death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Christ was crucified in the likeness of the flesh of sin, He crucified Satan in the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then, as the last Adam, Christ died with all of us, that is, with the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As the last Adam, the last of mankind, He brought all mankind to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, Romans 6:6 says that our old man has been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then, as the first item of all creation, He died on the cross not only with us, the sinners, but with all the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hebrews 2:9 says that in dying on the cross, Christ tasted death on behalf of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this way He redeemed and reconciled all the creation to God Col 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then, as the Peacemaker, Christ died on the cross with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to Colossians 2:14, when Christ died on the cross, God nailed the ordinances of the law to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, Ephesians 2:15 says that on the cross Christ abolished the law of commandments in ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One of the strongest ordinances in the law was the ordinance of circumcision, which required all the Jewish males to cut off a part of their flesh Gen 17:10-13; Lev 12:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Another strong ordinance was the requirement to keep the Sabbath Exo 20:8-11; 31:13-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The third major ordinance in the law was the keeping of the dietary regulations recorded in Leviticus chapter eleven.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to these regulations, certain animals were considered clean and could be eaten by the Israelites, while certain other animals were considered unclean and could not be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is because of these regulations that the devout Jews, even today, do not eat pork.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To them the meat of the swine is a most unclean thing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Circumcision, Sabbath-keeping, and the keeping of the dietary regulations are the three main ordinances which separate the Jews from the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, when the Lord Jesus went to the cross, He brought all these ordinances with Him, and they were all nailed to the cross by God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, the separation between the Jews and Gentiles has been taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Finally, as the grain of wheat, the Lord Jesus died with the human shell.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every kind of seed has a certain shell.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Within that shell life is concealed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ is God, and God is the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This divine life, which is God Himself, was concealed in Christ s humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ s humanity was a shell in which the divine life was concealed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When He went to the cross to die, that human shell was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The human shell was broken and the divine life concealed within that shell was released.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Let us count how many items were with Christ when He was crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Actually, the number of items is countless.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First, Christ was crucified with our sin, and second, with our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The third item was the flesh of sin, which is simply we, the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The fourth item was the old serpent, Satan, and the fifth item was the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ was also crucified with the old creation, including the heavens, the earth, the birds, the cats, the dogs, the turtles, and all created things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They all shared in Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All creation was crucified with Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to Matthew 27:51, at the moment Christ died, the veil in the temple was torn.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the veil cherubim, the living creatures, were embroidered 2 Chron 3:14; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>1:5, 10; 10:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the veil was torn, the living creatures were also torn.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This indicates that when Jesus died as the first item of God s creatures, all the creatures died with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Furthermore, the ordinances of the law were also included in Christ s crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>These ordinances include the habits and customs of all the different peoples on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Every nation has its own habits and customs.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For example, the Orientals use chopsticks to eat their food, while the Europeans and the Americans use forks.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, we need to realize that both chopsticks and forks were nailed to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hallelujah, in the church there are no Chinese chopsticks and no American forks!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This means that in the church life there are no Chinese and no Americans.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the church life there is only the all-inclusive Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Although I was born in China, I do not consider myself as Chinese, nor do I consider you as Chinese, Japanese, American, or Korean.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We are all children of God, and we are all brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the church there are no Chinese, Japanese, Americans, or Koreans.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>According to tradition, the Japanese wear kimonos and the Chinese wear long gowns.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, we all need to realize that the Japanese kimono and the Chinese long gown have both been crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Eventually, the human shell, our very humanity, was crossed out on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The cross has terminated everything, including the Devil, Satan.</S>
