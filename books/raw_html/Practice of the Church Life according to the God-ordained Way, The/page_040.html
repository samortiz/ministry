<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>13. Of the Abiding in Christ, the Fellowship<br>with the Lord, and the Leading of the Spirit<br>14. Of the Infilling of the Essential Spirit<br>and the Outpouring of the Economical Spirit<br>15. Of the Living and Walking<br>by and according to the Spirit<br>16. Of Praying and Interceding<br>17. Of the Reading, the Studying,<br>the Understanding, and the Receiving of<br>the Enlightenment from the Bible<br>18. Of the Obedience and Submission to God<br>and the Breaking of the Outer Man</H2><P>We may have obeyed God, but we may never have submitted to Him. We must have the experience of obedience and submission to God and the breaking of our outer man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>19. Of the Knowing and Experiencing<br>of the Body of Christ</H2><P>This is a great lesson for us to experience.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>20. Of the Church Life in a Locality</H2><P>Many Christians do not have a local church life. We must have the experience of the church life in a locality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>21. Of the Practice<br>of the God-ordained Way in Its Four Steps</H2><P>The practice of the God-ordained way in its four steps should be our experience. The first step is to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel. To preach the gospel is to get sinners saved to be members of the Body of Christ. The second step is to nourish and feed the new believers in the home meetings. The third step is to perfect the saints through the group meetings. Here we do not say small group meetings, but group meetings. The word small is not needed. Actually, the group meetings should not be that small. The home meetings may be small, with two or three persons taking care of a new one. But the group meetings should take care of a group of believers. The fourth and last step of the God-ordained way is prophesying in the church meetings for the building up of the church, consummating in the organic building up of the Body of Christ. We should endeavor to build up the local church. Eventually, this building up will consummate in the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>22. Of the Watchfulness and Readiness<br>for the Pre-tribulation Rapture and<br>the Expectation and Preparation<br>for the Secret Appearing of the Lord<br>as the Morning Star</H2><P>For the practice of prophesying, we should have the experience of the watchfulness and readiness for the pre-tribulation rapture and the expectation and preparation for the secret appearing of the Lord as the morning star. The morning star appears before the sun rises. We must get ourselves ready for the secret appearing of the Lord as the morning star.</P><P>We should endeavor to learn all of the foregoing items of truth and the experiences of life. This learning will enrich our speaking, and we will prophesy in the heavens, from the heavens, and with the heavens. To gain all of these items requires time and labor. But we should not be disappointed; rather, we should be encouraged and burdened to get into all these things. In a sense, all of these items are like subjects in graduate school. In the 1940s I was working in Chefoo. One of my former classmates, who was a Christian, came to stay with me. He told me that if someone were to meet with us for four years, he would have a degree in theology. This should be our situation in the church life. We need to learn all the truths and the experiences of life enumerated in this message.</P>
