<P>[At that time Brother Nee wrote the following hymn:</P><P CLASS=HBODY>How vast, immense, and measureless<br>The love of Christ to me!<br>How else could such a wretch as I<br>Be blessed so graciously?</P><P CLASS=HBODY>To bring me back unto Himself,<br>My Lord His all did spend;<br>So I would gladly bear the cross<br>And follow to the end.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>My all I have forsaken now,<br>This blessed Christ to gain;<br>Now life or death is no concern&#151;<br>What else can me restrain?</P><P CLASS=HBODY>My dear ones, wealth, ambition, fame&#151;<br>What can they offer me?<br>My gracious Lord for me was poor;<br>For Him I poor would be.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>My precious Savior now I love,<br>Him only would I please.<br>For Him all gain a loss becomes,<br>And comfort holds no ease.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Thou art my comfort, gracious Lord!<br>I've none in heav'n but Thee.<br>And who but Thee is there on earth<br>With whom I love to be?</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Though loneliness and trials come,<br>My griefs I'd rise above.<br>This only would I ask Thee, Lord:<br>Surround me with Thy love!</P><P CLASS=HBODY>O gracious Lord, I now beseech,<br>Guide me through every stage;<br>Stand by and strengthen me to go<br>Through this dark, evil age.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>The world, the flesh, and Satan too,<br>Do tempt my soul apace;<br>Without Thy love and strength'ning power<br>I may Thy name disgrace.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>The time, dear Lord, is running short;<br>From earth my soul set free.<br>When Thou dost come, I'll sing with joy,<br>Hallelujah to Thee!]</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>In the following week, people began to be saved. Brother Weigh, who was my classmate, can testify to the fact that up to this time I had been very particular about my dress. I used to wear a long silk gown with red dots. But on that day, I removed my refined clothing and shoes. I went to the kitchen, made some paste, and with a bundle of gospel posters in my arms, went to the street to post them on the walls and to distribute gospel tracts. In those days in Foochow, Fukien, this was a pioneer act.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>From my second school term in 1922, I began the gospel work, and many of my schoolmates were saved. I prayed daily for those whose names were in my notebook. From 1923, we began to borrow or rent places for meetings to expand the work of evangelization. Several hundred people were saved at the same time. All but one of those whose names were in my notebook were saved. This is evident proof that God listens to such prayers. It is His way that we must first pray for sinners before they can be saved. In those few years there were many instances to confirm this fact.</P>
