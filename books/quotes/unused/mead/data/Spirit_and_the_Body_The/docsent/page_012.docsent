   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>. The grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Spirit are with us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Love is the source, grace is the course, and the fellowship is the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The fellowship is a matter of transmission, of conveying something into us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With the Father, the source, we have love.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the love comes forth, we have the course, the grace of Christ the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When this grace is conveyed to us, it becomes the fellowship of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The fellowship of the Spirit transmits into us for our enjoyment all that Christ is along with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This transmission is the flow, the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is the transmission into our being of the very God the Spirit so that we may enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here in this transmission we enjoy the grace of Christ and we taste the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here we are in the fellowship, the communication, the flow, of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Day and night something is being transmitted into our being for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this way we enjoy the love of God and the grace of Christ in the fellowship of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today this Spirit is constantly flowing into us, through us, and out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the fellowship of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE TRIUNE GOD ISSUING IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus far, we have covered two aspects of the Spirit: that God is Spirit and that the Triune God issues in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Triune God with the Father as the source and with the Son as the course issues in the Spirit as the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Father and the Son come to us in the flow of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the Triune God issues in the Spirit for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE REDEEMER BECOMING A LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now we come to a crucial point: the fact that Christ, the Redeemer, became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First Corinthians 15:45 says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>. The last Adam was Jesus Christ in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a man in the flesh, He was the Lamb of God who took away our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, when He was crucified on the cross, He dealt with our natural life, our natural man, and our self.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By dealing with our sins and our self, Christ made it possible for us to receive the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's intention was to impart His life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As the Lamb of God, the last Adam accomplished these two things on the cross, taking away our sins and dealing with our self and natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Both are included in the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to see that our sins have been taken away and that our self has been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, we are able to receive the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After dying on the cross to take away our sins and to deal with our natural life, the last Adam, our Redeemer, became in His resurrection a life-giving Spirit to impart Himself as life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him as our Redeemer, it was the life-giving Spirit who came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many believers do not realize that they received the Lord Jesus not only as the Redeemer and the Savior, but also as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we knew that we were sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, we prayed, repented, confessed, and received Him as our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, we were not told that He would come into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At least I was not told this when I believed in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, I later found out that after believing in Him, there was something inside me that made me happy and joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sometimes I even felt like leaping.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Have you not had this experience?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the experience of Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although we received Him as our Redeemer, He came into us not only as our Redeemer, but also as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today He is in us mainly as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you ask believers where their Redeemer, the Lord Jesus, is, many lift up their eyes, point to heaven, and say, "He is in heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rarely do you find a Christian who, when asked where the Lord Jesus is, will say with rejoicing, "Christ is in me!"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you ask me where my Jesus is, I will say, "Jesus my Redeemer is, on the one hand, in the heavens as my Lord and, on the other hand, in me as the life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For this reason sometimes I am rejoicing, bubbling, and even beside myself with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Rejoice, Jesus Christ is the life-giving Spirit within us!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Before coming into the churches, you probably never heard that the Redeemer became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But there is a verse in the Bible telling us that the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It seems that those in Christianity do not have the second part of 1 Corinthians 15:45.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After completing the work of redemption, Christ became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
