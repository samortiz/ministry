We have gained much understanding in these last one and a half years in Taipei and have found out the sure way to gain the increase
That would have yielded two thousand eight hundred a month and eleven thousand two hundred baptized in four months
The main reason we did not reach this goal was that we did not have our training facility quite prepared when the training began
Also, in the training we did not have enough experience to know how to motivate the trainees in the way that a coach trains athletes
On the day of Pentecost, three thousand were added and later 'the number of the men came to about five thousand'
He said that this proved to be unsuccessful because their method was loose, and they were not strict in applying the new way
In October they had the saints sign up to be on a team and to make a definite consecration to give two hours each week for the door-knocking
One of the full-timers there returned from Taipei in December, and now with him they will have an intensive weekend door-knocking training
Afterward, she expressed how grateful she was that the saints came, and she wanted to know whose idea it was to visit people in their homes
Up to the last week of the training in Taipei, the full timers there had baptized only a little over six thousand
They felt this number was not up to the standard, so within the last week of the training they got close to one thousand
If you have enjoyed and still enjoy going to visit people by knocking on their doors, you know there is a big difference
In the last ten years in the United States, due to the defamation of some books, the rate of our increase has been just about three percent
Brother Nee told us repeatedly and insisted strongly that we give up the Lord's Day morning meeting in the churches
He told us that we needed to have meetings of mutuality, not meetings where one speaks and the other saints sit there to listen
They also met in the temple, but this was according to their tradition and habit and not according to God's economy
When you bring your contacts to a meeting, you may like to have a big hall, a large congregation, and a big, eloquent speaker
The brother from that local church of sixty told us that six were baptized by one team within an hour and a half
We present them the truth in a quick way with no vain talk, and we believe in the Lord's word concerning baptism
Many of those baptized in the new way experienced a real change and came up out of the water to walk in newness of life
When we made the change from having the big meetings in the hall to having the small meetings in the homes, many saints were disappointed
Some brothers in Taipei got addicted to the home meetings, and many trainees got addicted to the baptism in the new way
Every home will be meeting, every home will be working, every home will be teaching, and every home will be preaching
We have been drugged with the way of Christianity, so a taste of the way of Christianity has been built up within us
God even took away His kingdom from Israel because Israel was barren, fruitless, and gave His kingdom to another people, the church
Today there are only about seventy-four million Protestant Christians in the United States, the biggest Christian country on this earth
The gospel was preached mostly by pure Christian young people with no clergy, no hierarchy, and no organization
A brother who wants to be a good speaker with a congregation will not have one since the church life will be in the homes
Eventually in the recovery, the way of Christianity with a big congregation and one gifted speaker will be completely annulled
They like to have the home meetings where they could preach the gospel by themselves and where they could teach the truths by themselves
The homes are the basic foundation for the building up of the local churches, not the halls with big congregations
Verse 7 says, 'And remain in the same house, eating and drinking the things from them; for the worker is worthy of his wages'
Have we entered into the reality of abiding in John 15, and do we realize the seriousness of not bearing fruit?
You may say that you enjoy Christ, but where is the enjoyment if you have not borne fruit and have been cut off from the vine tree?
We all have to see how much we have been fooled and drugged by the tradition, the background, and the surrounding of today's Christianity
If the Lord is real and the Bible is a true book, it is solemn and serious to be a Christian without bearing fruit
In the last ten years since we suffered from the defamation of some books, our yearly rate of increase has dropped to about three percent
Fifty saints going out and baptizing over forty people within three days should be enough to wake up all of us
The elders should leave some of the prayer meetings and the Lord's table meetings to the saints and go to knock on doors
The elders need to go to create the increase, and their wives need to give up all their opinions and follow their husbands to knock on doors
In 2 Timothy 4:8 Paul says that he will be awarded with the crown of righteousness by the Lord, the righteous Judge
Paul seriously warned and charged Timothy, not by love nor by kindness, but by the Lord's appearing and by His kingdom
You may have offered yourself to the Lord many times in prayer, but your prayer may not have issued in a practical consecration of your body
If you are a person abiding in the Lord all the time uninterruptedly when you go out to knock on peoples doors that is the Lords knocking
A word from a child in elementary school does not bear the weight as the same word from someone in junior high school
The word of a college graduate is much heavier and more full of weight than the same word from a high schooler
If you know little about the truth and just go out with the little book to repeat it there will not be much weight much life or much light
A person who is weighty may go to a home and only sit while someone else talks, but even his sitting means something
Acts 11:24 refers to the inward filling of the essential Spirit, and Acts 4:31 refers to the outward filling of the economical Spirit
In Acts 11 Barnabas was one filled with the Holy Spirit essentially and inwardly, so many people turned to the Lord
In Acts 4 the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly and economically, so they spoke the word of God with boldness
We are regenerated, but we are in the body, in the flesh, and are still living on this earth with many dirty things
If you have the previous five points, you are surely equipped, qualified, and ready to go with the power and the authority of Christ
When we talk about door-knocking, we are talking about this kind of door knocking, not the kind practiced by the Mormons
You have Christ the Lord, His word, His Spirit, and His authority to go out, so you are a fully equipped soldier
Christians are used to saying that there are four Gospels, but Paul told us that the entire book of Romans is the gospel of God
It includes the preaching of God the condemnation of God upon fallen man and the Body life including the local churches in chapter sixteen
In the first chapter of Matthew, the first chapter of the entire New Testament, we are also told that God was born into Mary
The Lord raised up the so-called mystics in the 1600s such as Madam Guyon, Father Fenelon, and Brother Lawrence in the Catholic church
In the early 1900s Pentecostalism came out, and since the last century great preachers became prevailing such as C
The Assemblies of God have the highest rate of increase among the denominations, but it is only six percent yearly
The birth of Christ has been leavened to a mass, Christmas, and the resurrection of Christ has been leavened to Easter
The Bible tells us that we are all members of the living Body of Christ , and the Bible charges us as the members of Christ to function
The first item of functioning is to preach the gospel, to reach the sinners, to visit them to bring them to Christ
Will you tell Him that you have had a good church life in your locality, that whatever He has given you is still here?
Do not forget that the one who is put into outer darkness is the one who has received the real gift, one talent
He has given us His Spirit, His life, Himself as our talent, and His authority in heaven and on earth as our portion
In Luke 10 the Lord sent the seventy to knock on doors to visit people and to go into their home and stay with them
The formula of the new way has been fully proven to work in the full-time training in Taipei over the last four months
We hope that one out of twenty saints will be a job dropping full-timer and that one out of four saints will be a weekly door-knocker
Out of one hundred meeting in a certain locality there should be five job-dropping full timers and twenty-five weekly door-knockers
A team of three full-timers who goes out for five days, two to three hours a day, could knock on at least sixty doors
The twenty-five weekly door-knockers going out two or three hours weekly can each gain at least one within two months
At this rate they could baptize twenty-eight within one month, which is approximately one saint baptizing one a month
Following this, read the portion in the back of the booklet on baptism and show him Mark 16:16 believe and be baptized
Regardless of this person's status, he will be a little lamb, going along with you to get changed and get into the water
Even their salesmen before going out have a time to come together to have a little conference to get themselves prepared
As we have pointed out, this means not to speak your own words, but to speak every word according to the training's instructions
We must cut off the tail of the leaven of Christianity to have a new way and the new way is fully ordained by God and recorded in the Bible
If each one of you would rise up and go out for some time once a week for two or three hours, everyone will get one a month or twelve a year
We must visit people to share with them the high gospel, that is, the Triune God Himself to be our life and content
When people repent and believe, that is the right time for you to exercise your authority to authorize their baptism
Following this, set up a meeting in their home to teach them the pure truth by first using the New Life Lessons
If you only give the new ones a sheet of paper with points of the truth on it, they may not respect it very much
Circle or mark out certain paragraphs and teach them these certain paragraphs in about twenty minutes or at the most thirty minutes
In other words, give them a little portion for your teaching, but assign them to read the rest of the paragraphs of a certain lesson
Also encourage them to get a copy of the Recovery Version of the New Testament because they can read all the notes
After this, recommend to them our publications, such as the rainbow booklets, the Life-study Messages, and the many other small books
Encourage them to get these publications gradually and lead them to grow into the habit of reading the Bible and the spiritual books
They must learn how to pray, how to sing, how to call a hymn, how to read the Bible, and how to do many things
All the new baptized ones will learn to preach the gospel, to take care of their meeting, and to teach the truth
If in a certain locality the number is quite big, occasionally the whole church can come together once a month or once every two months
The church in Taipei has decided this year to collect all the saints together once a month renting a stadium that can take thirteen thousand
In Luke 10 the Lord told us He sent us as lambs in the midst of wolves, yet among the wolves there are some sons of peace
God chose and predestinated them before the foundation of the world, yet today they were born into the flock of wolves
Occasionally people came to us and they believed and were baptized, but they did not remain because nobody took care of them
We do not just go out to reach people by knocking on their doors and bringing them into the Triune God through their believing and baptism
The picture the Lord has shown us concerning the church life is not to ask people to come to attend our meetings
After we bring people to the Lord through baptism, we immediately set up a meeting in their home, so we continue to go
To come to the hall to big meetings week after week on the one hand helped us and on the other hand killed our function
Our trainees have been trained not to spend too long a time at a home meeting, only twenty or at the most thirty minutes
If you will be faithful to put all these things into practice, there will be some among you to help you to understand all the fine details
The new ones will learn to go out knocking on doors, to take care of their home meetings, and after two or three years to teach others
