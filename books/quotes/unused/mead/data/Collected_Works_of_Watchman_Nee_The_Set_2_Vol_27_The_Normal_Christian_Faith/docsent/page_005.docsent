   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EVIDENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some will immediately step back and say, "I have never said that I know there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One can never tell whether there is a God or not."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Well, if you cannot give a conclusion, I will ask witnesses whom I consider trustworthy to present arguments to you and prove the existence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Again let me say this, you are the judge, and I am the prosecutor.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am presenting only the evidence before you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Decide for yourself if there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE UNIVERSE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, look at nature, the world that is before our eyes and every phenomenon in it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all know that scientific knowledge is the rational explanation of natural phenomena.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, there is an observed drop in the temperature of a patient.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The drop in temperature is a phenomenon, and the explanation for it is scientific knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When an apple falls from the tree, it is a phenomenon.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why does an apple not fly into the air?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The explanation for this phenomenon constitutes knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A man with knowledge is a man who has the proper explanations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>ONLY TWO EXPLANATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The universe displays countless phenomena of diverse forms, colors, shapes, and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We cannot fail to notice these phenomena before our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The explanation for all these phenomena is known as knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All thoughtful persons have only two explanations as far as the origin of the universe is concerned; there is no third explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You have to take one or the other of them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What are these two explanations?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first says that the universe came into being through natural evolution and self-interaction; the second attributes its origin to a personified Being with intellect and purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These are the only two explanations presented by all philosophers of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is not a third one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Where did the universe come from?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Did it come into existence by itself or through chance?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Or was it designed by the One from whom we derive the concept of God?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You have to think and then make a decision about it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everything that is by chance has certain characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I would suggest you list all of these in a detailed way, the more the better, and then compare all the phenomena of the universe with your list.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Alongside of this make another list of the characteristics which, in your opinion, would be prominent if the universe were created by an intelligent Being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now by a simple comparison of nature with your two lists, it will be easy to draw a reasonable conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>CHANCE EVENTS</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What are the characteristics of things that come about by chance?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First, we know that they are unorganized.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the most they can be partially integrated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They can never be totally organized.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One can achieve a specified goal by chance once, but he can never achieve a specified goal by chance all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Anything that comes together by chance can only be integrated partially, never totally.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For example, if I throw this chair to the other side of the room, by chance it may come to rest at a perfect angle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If I do the same with a second chair, it may also lie neatly beside the first one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But this will not keep on happening with the third and the fourth and so on.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Chance can only provide partial organization.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It does not guarantee total integration.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, all random interactions are aimless, disorganized, and purposeless.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They are without order and structure; they are loose, formless, disorderly, and not directed toward any meaningful purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Briefly, we can say that the characteristics of chance events are disharmony, irregularity, inconsistency, purposelessness, and insignificance.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We will write down these four characteristics on our list.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>CONSISTENCY AND ORGANIZATION</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now let us compare the things in the universe with these characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Take, for example, the human being.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is carried in his mother's womb for nine months and delivered; he grows up and eventually dies.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This cycle is repeated for every single individual.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Consistency can be observed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is not a wild game of chance.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Again, look at the sun above your head.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It does not exist purposelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Rather, it has its purpose and significance.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Look at the moon, the stars, and the myriads of galaxies through your telescope.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some stars have their own planets.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They all follow definite tracks and patterns.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They are all organized.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Their manner of motion can be calculated and predicted.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The calendar in your hand is derived from them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even next year's calendar can be printed before this year is past.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All these show that the universe is organized, consistent, and purposeful.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>MICROORGANISMS</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Let us turn to the micro-world.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Take a thin slice of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Put it under a microscope and observe its grain and structure, all meticulously regular and rhythmic.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Even a blade of grass and the petal of a flower are finely fashioned.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Nothing is unorganized or confused.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Everything is disciplined and functional.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All these things witness one fact to you: the universe, with its macro and micro aspects, is purposeful and meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Can you say that all these came into existence by chance?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Surely you cannot.</S>
