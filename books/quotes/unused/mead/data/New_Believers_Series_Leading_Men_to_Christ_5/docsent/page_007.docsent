   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. Studying Carefully</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Each time you lead someone to the Lord, you have to do a detailed analysis, just like a doctor who studies each patient's case in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The doctor cannot prescribe the same medicine to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Certain sicknesses require certain drugs.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He administers a particular drug to a particular patient.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The same is true in leading men to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No one can be a doctor without studying medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the same way, no one can lead men to the Lord without studying.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some brothers and sisters are good at bringing people to the Lord because they have studied the ones whom they brought to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the beginning of the work of leading men to Christ, a new believer has to work hard to study each case.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You should always study why a particular person accepted the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why did a particular word open him up?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why did another person not believe after hearing a particular word?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why did a person shy away after listening attentively for a while?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why did a person accept when he earlier had opposed?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why are there no fish after waiting for a long time?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We always have to find the reason that the Spirit is working, and we also have to find the reason that the Spirit is not working.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you fail to lead men to Christ, do not put all the blame on others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who are good at leading people to the Lord always look for problems within themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We cannot wait by the seaside and hope that the fish will jump to the shore.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Leading people to the Lord is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to spend time to study and learn where the problems lie.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Leading people to the Lord is a skill, and this skill is acquired through working with people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is always something we can learn, whether through failure or success.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through failure, we learn the reason for our failure.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through success, we learn the reason for our success.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In every situation, we need to study the reasons behind the results.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you do this conscientiously, you will learn many lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, you will discover an interesting thing as far as believing in the Lord is concerned, there are only a few types of people in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you meet a certain type of person, you will need only to speak certain words to him, and he will receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you speak something else to him, he will oppose you and not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you know how to handle these few types of people, you can handle most people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You can handle those whose names are in your record book, and you can handle those whom you come across by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As soon as you come across someone, you will take the opportunity to witness to him, and you will be able to tell immediately the type of person he is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You will know in your heart what to do with this type of person and how to speak to him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He will most likely be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you study your cases one by one, you will become a very skillful soul-winner after one or two years.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You will realize that soul winning takes wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By God's mercy, you may lead some to the Lord, maybe a few dozen, or even a few hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you study all these cases carefully, you will become a very powerful soul-winner.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>APPENDIX:</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>PASSING OUT TRACTS A. No Time Limit</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>During the past two to three hundred years, the Lord has used tracts in a particular way to save many people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One thing special about winning people with tracts is that tracts are not limited by time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you try to testify with your mouth, you are restricted by time and personnel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You cannot speak twenty-four hours a day, and your audience may not be available all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You may be preaching a wonderful message, but the audience may not be there.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, tracts are not limited by time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You can pass out tracts any time of the day, and men can receive and read your tracts any time of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today many people do not have the time to come to our meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But tracts are not limited by time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We can give them out to people who are walking on the streets, who are cooking in their kitchens, or who are working in their offices.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the first convenience that tracts afford.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>B. Tracts Can Convey the Gospel in Full</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many people are very zealous in testifying for the Lord and leading men to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, their knowledge is limited and their words are lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They cannot convey the gospel message adequately and fully.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In addition to leading men to Christ through other means, a new believer has to do his best to select some good tracts in his spare time and pass them out to others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This will enable him to do what he himself could not do otherwise.</S>
