   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE EXPERIENCING THE POWER OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE PERSON OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 1:17-23; 3:16-21; 2:15-16, 18 THE TWO PRAYERS OF PAUL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians is a book on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church is profound, wonderful, and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Just as the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is a mystery and just as the person of the Lord Jesus the One who is both God and man is a mystery, the church is also a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In writing Ephesians Paul included two wonderful prayers, the first in chapter 1, verses 17 through 23, and the second in chapter 3, verses 16 through 19.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both prayers are very deep.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The prayer in chapter 1 is related to our need for revelation in order that we might see the church as the Body of Christ, whereas the prayer in chapter 3 is related to our need for experience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Recently, however, the Lord has shown me something more, something deeper, related to these prayers, namely that Paul s first prayer is related to the power of Christ and that his second prayer is related to the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The difference between the power of Christ and the person of Christ can be illustrated in relation to redecorating a house.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to redecorate a house, there is a need to move furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to accomplish this, a woman will need help from those who have strength and power.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When they move the furniture for her, she will experience the power of these helpers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the decisions that she makes related to moving the furniture, however, should be based on her being one with her husband and on taking him as her person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The prayer in chapter 1 concerns the power of Christ; the prayer in chapter 3 concerns taking Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition to experiencing the power of Christ, we need to experience His person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not merely seek His help in certain matters; rather, we should let Him make His home in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE SPIRIT AS AN ORGAN</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>AND THE SPIRIT AS A PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The proper organ for us to experience the power of Christ is our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I want to drink water, I do not use my eyes, ears, or nose, because these are the wrong organs to receive water.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Just as my mouth is the proper organ for drinking, my spirit is the proper organ to enjoy the power of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some think that the phrase a spirit of wisdom and revelation in 1:17 refers to the Holy Spirit, but this is not correct.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our mingled human spirit should be a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to receive wisdom and revelation, we must exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the prayer in chapter 3, however, our spirit is associated with the phrase the inner man v. 16 ; that is, it is referred to as a person rather than as an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In chapter 1 our spirit is an organ, but in chapter 3 our spirit has become a person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The person of our inner man, however, is not ourselves but the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need our spirit as an organ to experience the Lord s power, and we need our spirit as our inner man in order to experience the Lord as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In chapter 1 the power of Christ is experienced through our spirit as an organ, but in chapter 3 the person of Christ is enjoyed through our spirit as our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>EXPERIENCING THE FOURFOLD POWER</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>OF CHRIST IN OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In order to experience the power of Christ, we must turn to our spirit and exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not turn to our spirit but always remain in our mind, we will never touch the reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church is something in spirit 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to touch the church, we must be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to enjoy the power of Christ, we must turn to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we remain in our mind, we cannot enjoy the power of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As soon as we turn to our spirit, however, we enjoy the power of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to practice calling O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hallelujah! because this helps us to turn from our mind to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a sister does not learn to call O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Satan will utilize trivial things to hold her in bondage, causing her to linger in the considerations of her mind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more she thinks about her husband s faults, the more she will feel justified in criticizing his words and actions.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Instead of lingering in these thoughts, she should quickly call O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After calling a few times, she will turn from her mind to her spirit, and she will forget about her husband s condition.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As soon as she turns to her spirit, she will experience the power of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The first step in our experience of the power of Christ involves our experience of His resurrection power 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A wife whose mind is focused on the faults of her husband is fully in death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The more she thinks about his faults, the deader she will become.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If she stays in her mind when she comes to a meeting, she will be as silent as a person who is buried in a tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If, however, she begins to call O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hallelujah! she will experience the resurrection power of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>While it is easy for husbands and wives to be abrasive in their dealings with each other, the same is true for parents and children.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Children can bring their parents rather easily into death.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Often when a child makes a fuss, the mother s response is one of anger.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When she is alone, her mind will be filled with thoughts about her child s disrespect.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The more she thinks in this way, the deeper she will descend into death.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is also easy for parents to bring their children into death.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is easy for a child to become angry with his parents when he is restricted in some way, and in some circumstances he can become quite angry and even throw things.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If the child is saved but remains in his anger, he will experience only death.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, if parents are willing to call O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hallelujah! they will return to their spirit, and if children are willing to call O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Hallelujah! they will be in their spirit, no matter how much they are misunderstood.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Once we turn to our spirit, we spontaneously experience the power of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>His resurrection power delivers us from death.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we call O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Hallelujah! all day long, we will experience not only the resurrection power of the Lord but also His transcending power vv.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In such a condition, it is easy for a wife to be transcendent over every fault of her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>To be transcendent is to be on the throne, above all persons, matters, and things.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we continue to call O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Hallelujah! everything will be subdued, and we will enjoy the subduing power of Christ v. 22 . Then if we call O Lord! Amen! Hallelujah! we will live in the spirit all the more, experience His ruling power, and reign in our spirit v. 22 . We will be able to say, O Lord, I am seated with You on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>May You rule in our family so that the flesh has no ground.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is the way to experience the resurrecting, transcending, subduing, and ruling power of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If a person experiences Christ in this way, he will surely desire to be in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Whenever a person experiences the power of Christ, he is ushered into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In contrast, a wife who is focused on the faults of her husband or a child who is angry with his parents will have no desire to be in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The church is in resurrection, and it is transcendent.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>All things are under the feet of the church as it reigns with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If we are experiencing the power of Christ s resurrection, transcendence, subduing, and enthronement, we will spontaneously desire to be in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I often say that if we touch Jesus in the morning, He will bring us to the meeting in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The experience of the power of Christ brings us to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The church is not an organization or simply a gathering of people with similar interests.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The church is the joining together of people in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>As those who have received mercy, we have experienced the Lord s power and have been delivered out of death in order to transcend everything, subdue everything, and rule over everything.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If a brother is subdued by money in his business, he will be only an observer in a meeting of the church, and if he is oppressed by money, he will have little thought of even coming to a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>However, when he turns and calls, O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Hallelujah! he will rise above the power of money, be transcendent over money, subdue the influence of money, reign over money, and come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In order to experience the church, we need to experience the fourfold power of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Once we experience the power of Christ, we will be ushered practically into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The church is produced by the resurrected Christ, the transcendent Christ, the subduing Christ, and the ruling Christ.</S>
