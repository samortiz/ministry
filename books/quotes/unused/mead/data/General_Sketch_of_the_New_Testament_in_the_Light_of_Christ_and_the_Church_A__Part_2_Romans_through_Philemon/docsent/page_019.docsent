   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ the Power and Wisdom of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 22 continues, "For indeed Jews require signs and Greeks seek wisdom."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Signs are a matter of power; in order to perform signs, we need power.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Wisdom in this verse indicates knowledge and the way to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we have wisdom, we have the knowledge and also the way that enables us to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Power is one matter; the way to do something is another.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With all things in this universe, there is the need of the power and the way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may illustrate this with a car.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need gasoline within the car, and we also need to know how to drive the car.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 24 says of Christ crucified, "But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ is the power and energy of God, and He is also the wisdom and way of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is the power for us to do the things of God, and He is also the very wisdom, knowledge, and way for us to do them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ Our Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 30 continues, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The King James Version renders the latter phrase as "wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the first and here is the Greek word te, which is better rendered as both.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This construction indicates that wisdom is the heading, and under this heading there are three items righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is God's wisdom to us, which includes righteousness for our past, sanctification for our present, and redemption for our future.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Righteousness is for us to be justified at the time we believed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After being saved, Christ is our sanctification in our daily walk and in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The redemption mentioned here is the redemption of our body in the future Rom 8:23 , because it is mentioned as the last of the three items.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This redemption is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ is our righteousness for the past.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is also our sanctification for the present; we are being sanctified in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then in the future, Christ will be our redemption; that is, our body will be redeemed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this way we enjoy God's full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These three matters are the items of Christ's being wisdom to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that Christ is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jesus Christ, and This One Crucified</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Chapter two goes on to say, "For I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified" v. 2 . Paul indicated that he made the decision not to know anything but Christ and His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Fleshly Man, the Soulish Man, and the Spiritual Man</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 1:7 Paul says, "So that you do not lack in any gift, eagerly awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Corinthian believers were not lacking in any gift; they had all gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, in chapter three Paul said, "And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ" v. 1 . Strictly speaking, the word used in this verse is not fleshly but fleshy, referring to one who lives entirely by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verses 2-3 say, "I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But neither yet now are you able, for you are still fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For if there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and do you not walk according to the manner of man?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although the Corinthians had all the gifts, they were still infants in Christ, not only fleshly but fleshy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In chapter two Paul says, "But a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him and he is not able to know them because they are discerned spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the spiritual man discerns all things, but he himself is discerned by no one" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In these two verses there are two kinds of persons: the soulish man and the spiritual man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Along with these two kinds of persons, there is the fleshly man in chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These verses reveal the fleshly man, the soulish man, and the spiritual man.</S>
