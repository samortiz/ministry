   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We notice here something quite remarkable.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 26 says, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness..."; but verse 27 says, "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 26 the pronoun "our" is plural, but in verse 27 "his" is singular.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>During the conference of the Godhead, verse 26 says, "Let us make man in our image"; therefore, according to grammar, verse 27 should say, "So God created man in their own image."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But strangely, verse 27 says, "So God created man in his own image."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How can we explain this?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is because there are three in the Godhead the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, yet only one has the image in the Godhead the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the Godhead was designing man's creation, the Bible indicates that man would be made in "our" image since They are one, "our image" was mentioned ; but when the Godhead was in the actual process of making man, the Bible says that man was made in "his" image.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"His" denotes the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From this we ascertain that Adam was made in the image of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Adam did not precede the Lord Jesus; the Lord Jesus preceded him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When God created Adam, He created him in the image of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is for this reason it says "in his image" rather than "in their image."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's purpose is to gain a group of people who are like His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we read Romans 8:29 we find God's purpose: "Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God desires to have many sons, and God desires all these sons to be like that one Son of His.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then His Son will no more be the only Begotten, but the Firstborn among many brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's desire is to gain such a group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we see this, we will realize the preciousness of man, and we will rejoice whenever man is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How God values man!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even He Himself became a man!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's plan is to gain man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When man is gained by God, God's plan is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is by man that God's plan is fulfilled, and through man His own need is met.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What, then, does God require from the man whom He created?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is that man should rule.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When God created man, He did not predestine man to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man's fall is in chapter three of Genesis, not chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In God's plan to create man, He did not predestine man to sin, neither did He foreordain redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are not minimizing the importance of redemption, but only saying that redemption was not foreordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If it were, then man would have to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God did not foreordain this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In God's plan to create man, man was ordained to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is revealed to us in Genesis 1:26.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here God unveils to us His desire and tells us the secret of His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is God's purpose in creating man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps some may ask why God has such a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is because an angel of light rebelled against God before man's creation and became the devil: Satan sinned and fell; the Daystar became the enemy of God Isa 14:12-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God, therefore, withdrew His authority from the enemy and put it, instead, into the hand of man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The reason God created man is that man may rule in the place of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What abounding grace we see in God's creation of man!</S>
