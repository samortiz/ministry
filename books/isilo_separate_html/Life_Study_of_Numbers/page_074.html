The Twelve Men Going Up,<br>Spying Out the Land, and Cutting Down<br>from the Valley of Eshcol a Branch<br>with a Single Cluster of Grapes</H2><P>The twelve men went up and spied out the land. They cut down from the Valley of Eshcol (which means "cluster") a branch with a single cluster of grapes and carried it on a pole between two of them, with also some of the pomegranates and figs (vv. 21-24). From this we can see how rich the land was.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Twelve Men Returning<br>at the End of Forty Days</H2><P>At the end of forty days, the twelve men returned to Moses, Aaron, and all the assembly of the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Paran at Kadesh (13:25&#151;14:10). Kadesh is at the border of the good land.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Bringing In News That<br>the Land of Canaan Flowed with Milk<br>and Honey, but Also Bringing an Evil Report</H2><P>The twelve men brought in news that the land of Canaan flowed with milk and honey (13:26-27). However, most of the men went on to say, as an evil report, that the people who dwelt in the land were great and strong, that the cities were fortified and very large, and that the children of Anak (the Nephilim&#151;the giants) were there (vv. 28-29, 31-33).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Caleb Quieting the People before Moses</H2><P>Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, "Let us go up at once and possess it; for we are well able to prevail" (v. 30).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. All the Assembly of Israel<br>Crying Aloud, Weeping, and Murmuring</H2><P>All the assembly of Israel cried aloud, wept, and murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying to them, "If only we had died in the land of Egypt! Or died in this wilderness! Why does Jehovah bring us into this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become a prey; would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?" (14:1-3). Then they even dared to say to one another, "Let us choose a leader, and return to Egypt" (v. 4). These unbelieving and rebellious people were very eloquent, clever, insistent, and strong in their opinion.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_073.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_075.html">Next</a> </body></html>
