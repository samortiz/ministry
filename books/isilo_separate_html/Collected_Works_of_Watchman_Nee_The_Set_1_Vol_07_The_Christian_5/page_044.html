Which is right? (Liu, Feng Village)</P><P>Answer: In the Bible leaven has never represented anything good (Matt. 16:11-12; Mark 8:15; 1 Cor. 5:6-8). Leaven represents sins and erroneous teachings. The three measures of meal being wholly leavened does not represent the power of the gospel changing the whole world, because in this very chapter the Lord Jesus said that the world will never change. Within the world there will be "tares" and "foul" things until the day of judgment. In the Bible there is no place for the social gospel and for believers who wish to improve the world. The world will get worse day by day until the Lord comes.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PARABLES</H2><P>Question: By reading Matthew 13:10-15, one is led to believe that the purpose of using parables is to make the speaking difficult to understand. Ordinarily, people use parables to make the speaking easy to understand. Which is right? Which is wrong? (Tsui, Anhwei)</P><P>Answer: In the first twelve chapters the Lord Jesus suffered the rejection of the Jews; so from chapter thirteen the Lord Jesus began to reject the people of Israel. In this chapter, the Lord distinguished His disciples from the Jews. His eyes were already looking at the church. Using parables here, the Lord was trying to make His disciples (the future church) understand the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens (v. 11) and at the same time cause the Jews to hear but not understand and to see but not comprehend. By using parables, He was not trying to make it difficult for all men to understand the truth, only part of the audience. Therefore, the question of which is right does not exist.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE OUTER DARKNESS</H2><P>Question: Matthew 25:30 says to cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness. Is this darkness hell? Was that useless slave a believer? Do the believers go to hell because of not working? (Tsui, Anhwei)</P><P>Answer: We know that all three kinds of slaves will stand before the judgment seat of Christ. The judgment seat of Christ will be in the air, where the believers will be caught up (1 Thes. 4:16-17b). Hence, these believers will be in the air, and the outer darkness will be outside of the air. For this reason, the outer darkness will not be in hell. By reading Psalm 18:9 and 11, we know that thick clouds and darkness will enclose His glory when Christ descends to the air. So, the unfaithful slave will not be cast into hell, but he will be thrown into the darkness outside of the mid-air. This slave is a believer. Believers who do not work cannot rule with the Lord and will be in the outer darkness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</H2><P>Question: What is the proof that one is baptized in the Holy Spirit? One school uses speaking in tongues, as mentioned in Acts 10:46 and 19:6, as the proof of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Another school uses the fruit of the Spirit as the proof. Which of the two schools is right? (Liu, Feng Village)</P><P>Answer: The Bible does not say what the proof of the baptism of the Holy Spirit is. The proofs mentioned above are all man-made. In Acts there are many records of men being filled with the Holy Spirit, but speaking in tongues is only mentioned three times. This proves that not all those who were filled with the Holy Spirit spoke in tongues. Speaking in tongues is only one of the many gifts of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:4-10). "The same Spirit operates all these things, distributing to each one respectively even as He purposes" (v. 11). Hence, not every believer receives the gift of tongues. The fruit of the Spirit proves whether or not we have received the baptism of the Holy Spirit. To purposely seek after the speaking in tongues can lead to a counterfeit of an evil spirit. We must be careful about this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DISCIPLES AT EPHESUS</H2><P>Question: Were the twelve disciples in Acts 19 saved before they received the Holy Spirit? (Liu, Feng Village)</P><P>Answer: The Bible calls them disciples (Acts 19:1); disciples are Christians (11:26), those who believe in the Lord Jesus (Matt. 28:19). Ephesians 1:13 tells us that those who believe in the Lord Jesus are already sealed with the Holy Spirit. Therefore, these twelve disciples already had the Holy Spirit. What they had not received was the Spirit of resurrection and of Pentecost. The only Spirit they had not received was the outpoured Spirit (Acts 19:2). This does not mean that they had not received regeneration and the sealing of the Holy Spirit. These had already been saved (Eph. 1:13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST</H2><P>Question: Romans 8:9 says that if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him. Is this man saved? (Liu, Feng Village)</P><P>Answer: Of course he is not saved. But everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus as the Savior is of Christ and has the Spirit of Christ. Every saved person has the Spirit of Christ.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> </body></html>
