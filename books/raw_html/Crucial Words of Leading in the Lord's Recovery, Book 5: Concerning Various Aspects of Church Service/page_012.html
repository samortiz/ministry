	 <h2 class="head1">DOING A NORMAL WORK BY A NORMAL LIVING</h2>
<p>Some campuses have special circumstances. For example, the school administration may exercise strict oversight, and the students may have a very regimented schedule with little free time. With such campuses, we must keep the principle of not disrupting the order. Even making noise on such a campus can disrupt the order on the campus. We should follow the regulations of a school that has very strict oversight and do what we can in the time permitted and within the boundaries set forth. If a school allows us to use a limited area, we should use only that area. If a school allows us to use only a certain period of time, we should use only that time. We need to receive the Lord&rsquo;s leading and do only as much as we are allowed to do. An attempt to gain more in a short time may cause us to suffer loss. We should not count on luck; neither should we attempt to take the way of miracles.</p>
<p>The church has two thousand years of history on the earth, which show that the way of miracles does not last. There are many miracles in the four Gospels, but this is not the case in the Epistles. Initially, Paul&rsquo;s handkerchief healed the sick (Acts 19:11-12), but in his old age, instead of healing Timothy, his co-worker, Paul advised Timothy to take a little wine (1 Tim. 5:23). The way of life ultimately takes the direction of normalcy and regularity. We should not depend on luck. We should depend on living and working in a normal way. Students in schools that have strict oversight can still be saved. After some students are saved, we will gradually receive the Lord&rsquo;s leading and usher them into the church life. We should not expect to achieve much in a short time; neither should we create any conflict with the schools. According to the boundaries given to us, we should do the best we can. Over the long run, we will see the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING THE BROTHERS&rsquo; AND SISTERS&rsquo; HOUSES</h2>
<p>In mainland China and even during the early years in Taiwan, we did not have the practice of brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses. It was not until 1963, when we were laboring on the university campuses in America that we discovered the need of establishing brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses. Taiwan followed this practice. Even though the practice of having brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses has been blessed by the Lord, it also has its drawback, which is mainly related to management. If the management is loose, there will be chaos. If the management is too strict, it will damage and frustrate the growth of life. The problem is that everyone is willing to set up laws, but no one is willing to obey the laws.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Making Pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word and Calling On the Lord&rsquo;s Name into Laws</h2>
<p>We must not make pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s word and calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name into laws for the brothers and sisters who live in corporate housing. Calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name should not be a law. We heard that after some newly saved believers moved into corporate housing, they were forced to pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s Word, to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, and to praise loudly, even though they did not like it. The Bible does tell us to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name loudly (Acts 7:59-60), but our being loud can either be pleasant to the ears or unpleasant. There is a great difference. In Acts 3 after a lame man was healed, he was walking, leaping, and praising God. Based on this story, a brother once requested that everyone leap about in the meeting hall.</p>
<p>In the Bible there is a practice of calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name. We also call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, but we do not call in a disorderly manner, nor are we wild. Two hundred years ago, John Wesley broke the tradition of worshipping only in a chapel, that is, a so-called sanctuary. He preached the gospel on the streets. He cried out and was loud, and those who passed by stopped and listened to him. Many were touched to repent and be saved. At that time, the tide of the French revolution had swept through Europe, and it would have crossed the English Channel. However, apart from that revolution the English society was already going through a change brought about by the effectiveness of Wesley&rsquo;s preaching. For this reason, the royal household of Great Britain appreciated John Wesley.</p>
<p>During the past two thousand years of church history, different people have been raised up. We do everything according to the Bible, and we are not willing to be bound by an organization. Calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name is in the Bible; therefore, we call on the Lord&rsquo;s name. Praising out loud is in the Bible; therefore, we also praise out loud, but we do not praise wildly. We pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s Word, call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, and praise the Lord, but we do not set these practices as laws for others to obey in the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses.</p>
<p>The Bible encourages us to compel others only in one matter. We should compel others to believe in the Lord Jesus, but we still need to study how to compel others. Sometimes people would be willing to believe without our compelling, but when we &ldquo;compel,&rdquo; they run away. There was a brother in Southern California who was very aggressive. He even compelled a gospel friend to kneel down and pray. The friend was Chinese and reluctantly &ldquo;complied,&rdquo; but he later told others that he would never come to another meeting.</p>
<p>We should not become aggressive in the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses. We do not require the brothers and sisters who live together to uniformly pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s Word and call on the Lord&rsquo;s name. We should always remember that the church is a home. We cannot conduct ourselves as soldiers in a home. We should not require everyone to be the same. We should give the newly saved ones more freedom and encourage them to join us to pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s Word and call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, saying, &ldquo;You may not be used to what we are doing. Please bear with us and do not feel troubled. You are welcome to join us in prayer, or you can stay in your room.&rdquo; In this way they will feel comfortable.</p>
