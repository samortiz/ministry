   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-THREE THE SANCTIFICATION OF AARON AND HIS SONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE THE PRIESTS 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 29:1-14; 40:12-15; Lev 8:1-9, 12-17</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we come to another section of the book of Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have covered the tabernacle with its furnishings and also the priestly garments.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When God s people were gathered at Mount Sinai, Moses received the revelation of the pattern of the tabernacle and the design of the furniture of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The children of Israel were to build a house, a sanctuary, for the Lord to dwell among them and for His people to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Following this, the book of Exodus records a description of the priestly garments.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Bible garments signify our living, behavior, conduct, and character.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that, concerning the priests, God s serving ones, Exodus first takes care of their outward conduct signified by the priestly garments.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now in chapter twenty-nine we have a section dealing with the sanctification of Aaron and his sons to be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>FILLING OUR EMPTY HANDS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who read Exodus 29 can easily be impressed with what is often called the consecration of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Apparently this chapter is concerned with consecration, for here we see that the priests and their garments have been made ready and need to be consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some versions use the word ordination instead of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This translation of the Bible is based on the traditional, religious practice of ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Actually, there is no ground for this translation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 9 says, And you shall gird them with a girdle, Aaron and his sons, and bind caps on them; and the priesthood shall be theirs for an eternal statute; and you shall consecrate Aaron and his sons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Hebrew word rendered consecrate literally means fill their hand.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Neither the word consecrate nor the word ordain is accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, I prefer not to use the word consecrate in verse 9.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What this verse talks about is the filling of the priests hands.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because their hands were empty, they needed their hands to be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that we cannot serve God empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we would serve Him, our hands must be filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, to consecrate the priests, to ordain them if we want to use that word , means the filling of their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The hands of those who serve the Lord need to be filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 29:1 the word sanctify is used: And this is the thing which you shall do to them to sanctify them to serve as priests to Me: Take one young bull and two rams without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To sanctify something is absolutely different from ordaining it or consecrating it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To sanctify means to set something apart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, there may be many cattle in a herd, but one of these cattle is set apart from the herd.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result, that animal is sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, when an animal is set apart from the herd or flock, a mark may be put on it to indicate that it has been set apart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, to sanctify means to set something apart with a certain mark.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Formerly we were among all the sinners in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But one day the Lord set us apart.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Salvation is an all-inclusive matter, and it includes being set apart.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One day the Lord Jesus came to set us apart, that is, to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He separated us from sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be saved and set apart in this way is to be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord s sanctifying always labels us, puts a mark upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We bear a mark to indicate that we have been saved, sanctified, and set apart unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do you know what is the mark that separates us and sets us apart?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This mark is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we were among sinners, we were empty.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Not only were we empty-handed, but our whole being was empty.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we were saved, Christ came into us and became the mark that sets us apart from empty sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>From that time on, we have had something within us, something in our hand, with which to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many Christians, however, do not realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No one has told them they have Christ to fill their hand.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Nevertheless, from the time we were saved, we have had Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since we have Christ, we should not come to God empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Rather, we should always come to Him with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the reason we pray and meet in the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To meet in the Lord s name is to meet with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those, such as the Jews, who pray to God without praying in the name of the Lord Jesus, pray to Him in a way that is empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But our praying in the name of the Lord Jesus is different because we are praying to God with our hands filled.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now we can understand that consecration in Exodus 29 means to fill our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Genuine consecration is the filling up of our emptiness with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This also is sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whenever we come to the meetings, we should have something of Christ to offer to God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should not come to the meetings empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To be empty-handed in the meetings is to be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We all should be priests whose hands are filled with Christ.</S>
