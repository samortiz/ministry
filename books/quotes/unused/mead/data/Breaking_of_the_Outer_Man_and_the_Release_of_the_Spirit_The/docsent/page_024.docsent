   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE CHURCH AND THE WORK OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we truly know the meaning of God's work, we will have to acknowledge that the outer man is indeed a great hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We can say that God is restricted by man today.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's children must understand the function of the church and its relationship with God's power and His work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>GOD'S MANIFESTATION OR GOD'S LIMITATION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There was a time when God confined Himself within the body of a man Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With that flesh there was the possibility of either limiting God or manifesting God's riches.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before incarnation God's riches were not limited.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But after incarnation God's work and power were limited to this flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God would not do anything apart from that flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God was willing to be limited by that flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of course, the Bible shows us that God was not limited in any way by that flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It could have limited God, but it did not; rather, it manifested God's riches in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's riches became the riches of that flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God put Himself into flesh at the time of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today God has put Himself into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His power and work are found in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the time of the four Gospels, God did not do anything apart from that flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All of His works were committed to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the same way God has entrusted all of His works to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He does not do anything apart from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God does not work independently; He works exclusively through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From Pentecost until today, God's work has always been carried out through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Just as He committed Himself wholly, unequivocally, and unreservedly to one person Christ, He has given Himself wholly, unequivocally, and unreservedly to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How great the church's responsibility before God is!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church can limit God's work; it can limit God's release.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jesus of Nazareth was God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God was manifested in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He did not limit God because everything within and without Him was taken up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His emotions were God's emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His thoughts were God's thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>While He was on earth He did not come to do His own will but the will of the One who sent Him John 6:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Son did nothing from Himself; He only did what He saw the Father doing 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He did not say anything from Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What He heard from the Father, these things He spoke to the world 8:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Him we see a man in whom God entrusted Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God could say that this was the Word becoming flesh, God becoming man in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When God wanted to dispense His life to men, this One could readily respond, "If the grain of wheat dies, it bears much fruit" 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was able to release His life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He did not become a hindrance or a frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today God has chosen the church to be His vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He has put Himself, His power, and His work into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His desire is to release Himself through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church is the oracle of God, the vessel through which God manifests His power and accomplishes His work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the church affords God a way today, God's power and work will be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the church fails, God will be limited.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The fundamental teaching of the Gospels is that God was in a man, while the fundamental teaching of the Epistles is that God is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Gospels tell us that God was only in one man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was only in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Epistles show us that God is only in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is not in any organization or congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is only found in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May our eyes be opened to see this glorious fact.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once our eyes are opened to this glorious fact, we will spontaneously lift our gaze heavenward and say, "My God, how I have restricted You!"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When the Almighty God dwelt in Christ, He was still the Almighty One; He was not limited or diminished in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God's hope and goal today is that in the church He would continue to be the Almighty One, the infinite One.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God wants to freely express Himself in the church just as He was expressed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the church is restricted, God is restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the church is powerless, God is powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We can only speak such a word humbly and respectfully.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Simply put, any obstacle in us becomes an obstacle to God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Any limitation in us becomes a limitation to God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If God is not released through the church, He does not have a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God's way today is through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Why is the discipline of the Holy Spirit so important?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Why is the dividing of the soul from the spirit so important?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Why must the outer man be broken by the disciplining work of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is because God needs to have a way through us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should never think that this is merely about personal, spiritual edification.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is not merely a matter of personal, spiritual experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is very much related to God's way and work.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is a big issue.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Should we limit God?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Does God have the liberty in us?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Only as we are dealt with and broken will God find full freedom in us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If the church is to afford God a free way, we must undergo His stripping and allow Him to break our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The greatest hindrance to this is our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If the matter of the outer man is not settled, the issue of the church as God's channel can never be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If our outer man is broken by God's grace, there is no limit to how God will employ us as channels to His work.</S>
