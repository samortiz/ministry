<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWELVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ENJOYMENT OF GOD IN THE HOUSE OF GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Psa. 5:7; 11:4; 18:6; 20:2; 23:6; 26:8; 27:4-6; 34:8; 36:7-9</H1><P>In this message we want to see the revelation of the enjoyment of God in the house of God in Book One of the Psalms, which includes Psalms 1&#151;41. Thus far in our fellowship, we have seen four major stations concerning Christ&#151;Psalms 2, 8, 16, and 22&#151;24. We all need to see the particular aspects of Christ revealed in these psalms. Psalm 2 tells us that Christ is God's anointed One. Psalm 8 reveals Christ as the incarnated and crowned One, the excellent One in all the earth. Psalm 16 reveals Christ in His human living. It shows that Christ lived on this earth as a God-man, died on the cross, resurrected, and then ascended to the right hand of God. Psalm 22 shows us Christ crucified and resurrected to produce His brothers to constitute His Body, the church. Then in resurrection in Psalm 23, He became our Shepherd, shepherding us through five stages of enjoyment. Eventually, He will come back to be the King of glory, as revealed in Psalm 24. These psalms present us a completed Christ.</P><P>After these first four stations concerning Christ in the Psalms, Psalms 25&#151;41 follow as a group of psalms showing us the mixed expressions in the psalmist's sentiment in his enjoyment of God in God's house. In these seventeen psalms, the main point, the major point, the crucial point, is the enjoyment of God in the house of God.</P><P>We have to realize that God is located! On the one hand, He is not a wandering God, but on the other hand, He is omnipresent. He is everywhere. Thus, He is the universal God, yet the universal God today is located! The house in which we live has an address, which indicates that we are located. People can write us letters if they know our street address and the city in which we live. Because we are located, people can contact us. Today our God is located. He has an address, and we can contact Him. In Psalms 25&#151;41 we can see the location of God. This location is also mentioned in the foregoing psalms. The universal God is located in His house, His dwelling place.</P>
