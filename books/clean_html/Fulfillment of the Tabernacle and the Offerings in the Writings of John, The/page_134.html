<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:2-3; 2:16</h1><p>The writings of John are books of signs. In John 14 through 17 there are ten great signs. Some of the signs in the earlier chapters of this Gospel are the tabernacle (1:14), the Lamb of God (1:29), the door (10:7), and the pasture (10:9). A sign is a symbol with spiritual significance. A traffic signal is a good illustration. In a traffic signal, each color has a specific meaning: red means stop, and green means go. Both in the Gospel of John and in the book of Revelation there are many signs.<h2 class=head1>THE FATHER’S HOUSE</h2><p>The first of the ten signs in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John is the sign of the Father’s house. We need to study the Gospel of John in order to see that the Father’s house signifies the mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed people to be a dwelling place for both God and His people.<p>Throughout the centuries many have held the concept that the Father’s house in John 14 refers to a heavenly mansion, a mansion in the heavens to which the believers go after they die. It is common for pastors at the funeral of a believer to comfort the relatives by saying that the one who has died has now gone to a heavenly mansion, and that in this heavenly mansion he is happy. The pastor may go on to say that all believers will go to this mansion when they die.<p>Many believers think that there are three main reasons for becoming a Christian: first, to receive forgiveness of sins; second, to be saved from eternal perdition; and third, to go to a heavenly mansion when we die. This is the general thought held by many Christians. However, the concept of going to a heavenly mansion is superstitious and completely off the line of the revelation in the Gospel of John. The Gospel of John is not concerned with a heavenly mansion. The revelation in this Gospel concerns the Triune God dispensing Himself into us that He may make us His dwelling place and that this dwelling place may also become our dwelling place. This is the subject of John’s Gospel. In this book there is no thought about going to heaven.<p>The Gospel of John opens like this: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God” (1:1). Then we are told that “the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us…full of grace and reality” (v. 14). John goes on to say in 1:16, “For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.” What is the purpose of the Word’s becoming flesh, full of grace and reality? Is the purpose that we might go to heaven? This thought is illogical and far off the mark.<p>In the Gospel of John the Father’s house does not signify a heavenly mansion. The Father’s house signifies God mingling Himself with His redeemed people to make them His house, His dwelling place. Eventually, God’s dwelling place will also become the dwelling place of His redeemed people. Praise the Lord that in the universe there is such a wonderful entity as this mutual dwelling place for God and His redeemed people! God is dispensing Himself into His people and mingling Himself with them in order to produce such a mutual dwelling place.<p>In chapter one of the Gospel of John we have the tabernacle, and in chapter two we have the temple. Concerning the temple, the Lord Jesus said that it was His Father’s house: “Do not make My Father’s house a house of merchandise” (v. 16). By this we can see that the Father’s house in chapter two refers to the temple. That temple was on earth; it was not a mansion in the heavens. The same term that was used to refer to the temple on earth in 2:16 is used again in 14:2: “In My Father’s house are many abodes.” It is not logical to say that the Father’s house in chapter two is the temple on earth and that the Father’s house in chapter fourteen is a heavenly mansion.<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that in the Gospel of John the expression “My Father’s house” is used twice. In 2:16 it clearly refers to the temple on earth. What, then, does it refer to in 14:2? Here it also refers to God’s house among His people on earth; it does not refer to a heavenly mansion.
