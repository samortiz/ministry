   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING OUR GOING ON THE BURDEN FOR TRAININGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Another thing I want to make clear is our burden to have trainings to train the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Nee conducted regular trainings for the saints in mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I came out of mainland China to Taiwan in 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We started a formal training there for four months in 1953.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From that year on, I set aside a few months nearly every year for the training of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We practice this matter of training to follow what the Apostle Paul did, to follow in his footsteps.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Acts 19:9-10 says, "But when some were hardened and disobeyed, speaking evil of the way before the multitude, he withdrew from them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And this took place for two years, so that all those dwelling in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that time Paul was in Ephesus, and there was already a church there.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, he did some work beside the church but related to and for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He did his preaching and teaching in a school, the school of Tyrannus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Tyrannus might have been a teacher, and Paul might have rented his school and used it as a meeting hall to preach and teach the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul's work was not within the church but was something beside the church yet still for the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul felt that there was a need to have such a work to preach to and teach many people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He carried out this work in the school of Tyrannus for two years and the result was that all those dwelling in Asia heard the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Acts 28:30-31 says, "And he remained two whole years in his own rented dwelling, and welcomed all those coming in to him, proclaiming the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, unhindered."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This tells us clearly that Paul rented a place to teach in Rome, and at that time there was a church in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He did a work in his own rented dwelling to proclaim the kingdom of God and to teach the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No doubt, his proclaiming, his teaching, and his preaching went out to reach a good number of people.</S>
