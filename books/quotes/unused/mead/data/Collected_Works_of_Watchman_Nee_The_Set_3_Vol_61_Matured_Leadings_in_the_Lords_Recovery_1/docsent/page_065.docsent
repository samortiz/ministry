   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Working Saints Coordinating</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Preach the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brothers who are holding one kind of job should coordinate with other brothers who are holding similar jobs; they should preach the gospel together.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Around Sar-Di by the city of Hangchow there are six to eight hundred brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The amount they handed over last year is only enough to supply the need of the one hundred brothers who migrated to Yi-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When one migrates to a new place, he is starting everything afresh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He needs to have food and clothing before he can engage in farming.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In over ten counties around Yi-Yang, the footsteps of the gospel have been planted by our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some churches have sprung up in a few areas already.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They market the produce of the land, the livestock of their farm, and the fabric they produce from their own weaving.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They coordinate together for the gospel while selling their products on the side.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Shanghai is supporting Yi-Yang as well; more men are migrating there now.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the near future, some will move there from Nanchang.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Perhaps in the future Nanchang will head up Yi-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should never despise the wisdom of the simple villagers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Among the leading brothers in Yi-Yang, no one has graduated from high school; everyone has received only a primary education.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, they all have a burning heart for the Lord, and they all have handed themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Generally speaking, all of them are full of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They have wisdom in their service.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Their judgments are sound, and they are rich in experience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to my observation, many so-called wise brothers in China cannot match them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Their judgments leave no room for criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One can only lower his head and worship the Lord, saying, "Lord, You are in our midst."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If their judgments were not so wise, they would not have been so successful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They conduct business and do everything in an orderly fashion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now a few dozen brothers and sisters from Shanghai are getting ready to migrate to Yi-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are not just one or two people preaching the gospel there, but the whole church is working together in coordination on the basis of its consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The gospel is weak today among us because brothers and sisters have a selfish motive; they use the mammon they have in their hand for their own business with the view of making money for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Their business is not for the gospel, and they have not handed themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If no Christian lives for himself, and if everyone lives for the Lord and the gospel, the gospel will spread from province to province all over China.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Principle of Selling</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let me fellowship a little concerning the principle of selling our possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Suppose a brother has a piece of real estate.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I hope that he can hand it over and sell it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Any real estate that is left in an unproductive state is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moreover, real estate is not doing well today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is better to sell it and use the proceeds to start a business that engages in a form of production.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I hope the responsible brothers will make good and proper arrangements for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Suppose some brothers are sharing a business with unbelievers or family members.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If they want to hand themselves over, they have to work hard to separate their assets from the assets of others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Be generous in splitting the assets.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If one is in a joint venture with others, he can buy the others' shares and then sell it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In selling real estate, a person may not get the full price of the land, in which case we can help them to dispose of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We would rather take a loss than have our money locked in the land.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Possible Businesses That One Can Consider</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hong Kong is rich because it is linked to Swatow.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A great part of the investment in Hong Kong comes from Swatow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we go into business at all, there are a few things we can consider.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The first is cotton spinning.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some can try this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Starting a business this way helps Swatow indirectly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The capital is retained in Hong Kong and does not need to return to Swatow.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some can try this in Manila.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The shipbuilding industry is in existence already.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Presently, it is somewhat unprofitable.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some are doing it with a view to the future; they are waiting for better days to come.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to carefully consider this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Should we wait, or should we sell such a business and come back to it later?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should have much fellowship and prayer before making any decision.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>One brother is starting a very large fabric manufacturing company.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some time ago I heard that some brothers were starting a fabric company which both spins and weaves.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I think that spinning is too much for us; it takes a considerable amount of capital to handle spinning and weaving together.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But weaving is easier; it does not take much capital.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We can hire brothers and sisters for the weaving work.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A few of our brothers can dye; they are more skillful than others in this trade.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we manufacture our own dye, we can help many brothers and sisters from other places to learn the trade.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Weaving is convenient; it can be done anywhere and at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A weaving machine costs approximately three hundred dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We can put one in the living room and two in the bedroom.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This does not violate local ordinances, because it does not require an office.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In this way, we can do our own dyeing and even sell our goods locally.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Alternatively, we can form some kind of cooperative and sell our product together.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If the cost of traveling is not a problem, we can ask many out-of-town brothers and sisters to come to Hong Kong to learn such skills.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We can recruit twenty people from Hangchow, Peking, Tsingtao, Foochow, and Swatow.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In the beginning they can be apprentices.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In a year or two, we can buy off the unbelievers' shares and work with brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In this way we will not need to be yoked with unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Tonight I am touching this matter in brief.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>There is not enough time.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Perhaps we can have a more detailed discussion later.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I hope that we all will understand the proper principle to exercise such matters before the Lord.</S>
