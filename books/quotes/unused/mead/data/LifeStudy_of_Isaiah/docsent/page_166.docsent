   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE THIRTY-FOUR CHRIST SEEN IN HIS DIVINE GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH HIS HUMAN VIRTUES HELD IN HIS HOLINESS Scripture Reading: Isa 6:1-10; 5:16b; John 12:39-41</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Isaiah, a book which was quoted greatly by the Lord Jesus and the apostles in the New Testament, reveals many wonderful aspects concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In message one we saw Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth Isa 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Isaiah 7:14 says that the virgin will conceive, bear a son, and call His name Immanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah for the branching out of Jehovah God, in His divinity, into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a new development of Jehovah God for His increase and spreading through His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Shoot of Jehovah implies the spreading of Jehovah to branch Himself out for His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ as the Fruit of the earth is for reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ, as the one grain who fell into the earth to die, produced many grains, many believers, in resurrection John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Divinity cannot spread or increase without humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The divine life is reproduced in the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One day the divine God came to put on human blood and flesh Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was Christ as the Fruit of the earth, a man born of human blood and flesh from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In message one we also saw that Christ is a covering canopy of glory and an overshadowing tabernacle of grace Isa 4:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth will eventually become a canopy to cover all the interests of God on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we are in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth, we will fully realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is the universal canopy to cover all of God's interests.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is also the tabernacle overshadowing us, God's elect, protecting us from all kinds of troubles signified by heat, storm, and rain.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I hope that we can get into these aspects of Christ and fellowship about them until they become our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this message we want to see the vision of Christ in Isaiah 6.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this chapter Christ is seen in His divine glory with His human virtues held in His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His glory is divine, His virtues are human, and His holiness is standing fast.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible says that no man has seen God at any time John 1:18a .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our God is invisible, yet Isaiah saw Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Isaiah declared that he saw the Lord, the King, Jehovah of hosts Isa 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A clear picture is presented in Isaiah 6, showing us Christ in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This chapter, however, does not give us a detailed description of what Christ looks like.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Isaiah only says, "In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne, and the train of His robe filled the temple" v. 1 . The Lord seen by Isaiah must have been in the image of a man because verse 1 tells us that the train of His robe filled the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His robe is the first main item in this scene because it fills the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The second main item in Isaiah's vision is the temple being filled with smoke v. 4 . The third main item is the seraphim v. 2 . Verse two says, "Seraphim hovered over Him, each having six wings." The word "hovered" literally means "stood." The seraphim stood over Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We know that they were standing for His holiness because they declare, "Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah of hosts" v. 3 . Verse 4 says, "The foundations of the threshold shook at the voice of him who called." The divine glory is another major item in Isaiah's vision.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 3 says, "The whole earth is filled with His glory."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>John 12 says that Isaiah saw the Lord's glory and spoke concerning Him v. 41 . The smoke that filled the house, the temple, in Isaiah 6:4 is the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Isaiah 4:5 also refers to glory as a cloud of smoke over the convocations of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The divine glory is signified by the smoke, holiness is signified by the seraphim, and the Lord's human virtues are signified by the train of His robe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Human virtues mainly are based upon righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>An unrighteous person does not have human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is bankrupt in human virtues because he is unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Human virtues depend upon righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Christ accomplished His redemption on the cross, He fulfilled the requirements of God's glory, God's holiness, and God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As fallen sinners, we cannot fulfill the requirements of God's glory, holiness, and righteousness, but Christ satisfied them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to see the vision of Christ in Isaiah 6 in His glory, His holiness, and His righteousness with His human virtues.</S>
