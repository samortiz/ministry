   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOOTSTEPS AT PERILOUS TIMES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Those therefore who were scattered went throughout the land announcing the word as the gospel" Acts 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord Jesus commanded, "You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth" Acts 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But until today, we are still in "Jerusalem"; we have not preached in all "Judea and Samaria" yet, much less the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because God's apostles and disciples were hesitant to move out, He used the hand of Saul to scatter them "throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria" 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then He raised up an apostle Paul who was truly capable of answering His commission.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>During this period of persecution "the word as the gospel" was announced v. 4 . On the one hand, they were running for refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the other hand, they were spreading the word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>During the past few years our work has mainly centered around the coastal regions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>None of the places in the inland regions have seen God's full testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although some brothers have paid attention to the work in various places, most are bound to the work in a single locality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I believe that God allows the present war to go on for our benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I believe His strategy today is the same as in the early days of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason, I believe that we should produce the same result today as in those early days.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I would speak as a brother and would suggest the following things:</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>1 We all know that the church is local and that its administration and work are local.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the time for the apostles the workers to turn the administration and work over to the local churches and for the local brothers to take up the responsibility of the local work and administration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>2 Now is the time for the apostles to spend more time to labor in the inland regions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not have the concept that we must hold on to the coastal cities and go through tribulation with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should realize that we are not running away from the tribulation; rather, we are going forth to preach the word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Actually, going to the inland regions under the present circumstances is more difficult and more uncertain than before.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But we should trust in God rather than men, knowing that our provision and protection is from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who do not look to God genuinely and absolutely are not qualified to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>3 The responsible brothers in the various localities should remind the brothers in dispersion that they should not set their eyes too much on the war.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>During this time they should spend more time to preach the gospel and establish churches, just as Philip did in the region of Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>While it is true that the apostles should move out, it is also true that the disciples should move out.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I personally believe that God will use this war to expand and increase the sphere of His work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>May our prayer be correspondingly deeper!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Finally, a word of reminder: Our urgent need is the preaching of the gospel and the establishing of local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are not here to exhort others to leave the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those who pay attention only to the matter of denominationalism are not our brothers; they are not our co-workers and are not qualified to be our co-workers.</S>

   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Indeed, your abundance should be "for their lack that their abundance also may be for your lack," for the divine principle is: "He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack" 2 Cor 8:14-15 .</S>
