OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE CROSS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 53:6b, 11b, 10a, 5; 1 Pet. 2:24; 3:18a; 2 Cor. 5:21; Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20; 5:24; John 12:31; 16:11; Heb. 2:14b; Col. 2:15; Gal. 6:14; John 12:24; 19:34</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we said that incarnation was the first step of God&rsquo;s redemption. In this chapter we will consider the second step of God&rsquo;s redemption, the cross. The cross speaks of Christ&rsquo;s death; hence, to consider the cross is to consider Christ&rsquo;s death.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE CROSS</h2>
<p>Christ died on the cross in order to accomplish God&rsquo;s plan. God&rsquo;s plan is to dispense His life into man, but man fell before he could receive God&rsquo;s life. As a result of the fall, man became sinful and corrupt within, and man belonged to Satan. Hence, in order to accomplish God&rsquo;s plan, Christ had to deal with the three problems: man&rsquo;s sin, man&rsquo;s fallen humanity, and Satan. Christ also needed to release God&rsquo;s life in order to fulfill God&rsquo;s plan. Through His death on the cross Christ dealt with man&rsquo;s sin, man&rsquo;s corrupt nature, and Satan, and He also released God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>God has a purpose in His plan, but man&rsquo;s fall brought in three problems. In order for Christ to fulfill God&rsquo;s plan, He had to deal with all three problems and also fulfill the original purpose of God&rsquo;s plan. To deal with the problems that are the result of man&rsquo;s fall, Christ had to die on the cross and accomplish redemption. Redemption dealt with the negative problems in order to bring fallen man back to God. Moreover, through His death on the cross Christ released God&rsquo;s life to His redeemed people to fulfill the positive purpose of God&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p>On the cross Christ dealt with the problems of sin, the corrupt human nature, and Satan, and He also accomplished God&rsquo;s purpose of releasing His life. Hence, for us to have a thorough understanding of Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross, we will consider these four aspects of His death, according to the revelation of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Cross of Christ<br />
Dealing with Man&rsquo;s Sins</h2>
<p>As a result of the fall, man&rsquo;s first problem before God is sin. Sin contradicts God&rsquo;s righteousness, and God&rsquo;s righteousness cannot tolerate sin. God loves the man whom He created, but His righteousness requires Him to condemn man because of the fall (Rom. 5:16). God&rsquo;s heart may accept man, but His righteousness cannot tolerate man&rsquo;s sin. If God were to receive fallen man based only on His love, His righteousness would be offended. Righteousness is the foundation of God&rsquo;s throne (Psa. 89:14). Therefore, God must condemn man. God must be righteous and abide by His law; He cannot loosely tolerate or forgive man&rsquo;s sin based only on His love for man. If God were to receive man based on His love, He would not be righteous. No matter how much God values, treasures, or loves man, His righteousness requires that He condemn man because of sin.</p>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s righteousness, death is the punishment for sin (Ezek. 18:4; Rom. 6:23). Death, which was brought in by sin, includes eternal perdition (Rev. 20:14). According to His righteousness, God condemned man; hence, man cannot escape death. However, God&rsquo;s plan cannot be accomplished if man must perish. According to His love, God does not want man to perish, and thus, satisfying the requirement of His righteousness is complicated by His love; God&rsquo;s government complicates the fulfillment of His plan. In order for God to solve this problem, He must satisfy both His righteousness and love so that His government and plan are not hindered. God solved this problem by being incarnated as a man in order to be man&rsquo;s Substitute, that is, to bear man&rsquo;s sins and die in man&rsquo;s place. As a man, Jesus Christ was accountable to God&rsquo;s righteousness and suffered the punishment that man should have suffered on account of sin. He satisfied the requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness for man and fulfilled the desire of God&rsquo;s love for man so that God&rsquo;s government would be upheld and His plan could be accomplished.</p>
<p>In His death on the cross the Lord Jesus bore man&rsquo;s sins; He was punished on behalf of man. He was not crucified as a sacrificial martyr but as our Substitute, bearing our sins and suffering God&rsquo;s righteous punishment on our behalf. In the first three hours of His crucifixion, from 9:00 A.M. to noon, evil men put Him to death, but in the last three hours, from noon to 3:00 P.M., He was punished by God (Mark 15:25; Matt. 27:45). He was punished because He stood in the position of a man, bearing our sins. God caused the iniquity of mankind to fall on Him, to be borne by Him, judging our iniquity in Him (Isa. 53:6b; 1 Pet. 2:24). Therefore, God forsook Him on the cross (Matt. 27:46). Before Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion God had always been with Him (John 16:32). If He had been a martyr, God would have intensified His presence with Him because God delights in martyrs (Acts 7:54-59). But when Christ was on the cross, God forsook Him.</p>
<p>God cannot accept man because of his sinful nature, but the Lord Jesus was without sin. He even said, &ldquo;Which of you convicts Me of sin?&rdquo; (John 8:46). Before He was crucified, He was examined both by the Jewish priests, according to God&rsquo;s law, and the Gentile officials, according to the law of the Roman Empire, but no one could find fault in Him (Luke 23:4, 13-15, 22). He was sinless, but God forsook Him on the cross because He bore our iniquity. In the eyes of God Christ was a sinner on the cross. Although He was sinless and did not know sin, at the cross God caused the iniquity of us all to fall on Him (Isa. 53:6). God made Him our sin offering and trespass offering so that He could bear our sins on our behalf (v. 10). Hence, God not only forsook Him but also smote Him, afflicted Him, and crushed Him so that He might suffer the pain of death and taste death on our behalf in order that the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness might be fulfilled in us (vv. 4-5; Heb. 2:9). God caused the Righteous to suffer on behalf of the unrighteous so that He could redeem us and make us the righteousness of God (1 Pet. 3:18; Isa. 53:11).</p>
<p>Although Christ did not know sin, God made Him sin on our behalf (2 Cor. 5:21). In God&rsquo;s eyes fallen man is not only sinful but is also constituted with sin. Thus, on the cross the Lord Jesus was also made sin on our behalf. According to God&rsquo;s righteous requirements, not only are we ourselves judged by God but our sins are judged as well. The Lord Jesus was judged by God on the cross because He bore our sins and because He was made sin on our behalf. Our sins were judged by God upon the Lord Jesus, and we were judged by God in Him. Thus, we have been cleansed before God, and we have become the righteousness of God in Christ (v. 21). Because we are sinful and unrighteous, Christ bore our sins so that we could be forgiven by God, and because we are sin itself, Christ was made sin on our behalf so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. He bore our sins so that we might receive the forgiveness of sins and be justified by God, and He was made sin on our behalf so that we might become God&rsquo;s righteousness and be acceptable to God in Him. This is the first accomplishment of Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross for us.</p>
