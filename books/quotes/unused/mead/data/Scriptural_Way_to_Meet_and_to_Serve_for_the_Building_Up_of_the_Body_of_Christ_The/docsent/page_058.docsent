   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN LEARNING TO TEACH OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LORD Scripture Reading: Heb 5:13; 2 Tim 3:15-17; Col 3:16; Eph 5:19; 1 Thes 5:20; 1 Tim 6:3; Acts 2:42</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In chapter sixteen, we saw that we need to be those who exercise to speak the word of the Lord with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not only must we ourselves speak the word of the Lord, but we also must teach others to speak the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We do not have the habit of teaching others to speak the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we are going to teach others something, we ourselves have to practice what we are going to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because we do not adequately practice speaking the Lord s word, we do not have the habit of teaching others to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>TO INCREASE THE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>OF THE WORD OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we desire to teach others to speak the word of the Lord, we must do one basic thing, that is, we must increase our knowledge and experience of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hebrews 5:13 says, For everyone who partakes of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Babes are only capable of drinking milk, and they cannot take solid food.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 14 tells us that solid food is for the mature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The solid food in this verse refers to the word of righteousness mentioned in verse 13.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The book of Hebrews also mentions the good word of God 6:5 , which is the milk the Hebrew believers tasted when they believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The good word is the word of God s grace Acts 14:3; 20:32 for our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word of righteousness is much deeper than the good word of God because it embodies the deeper thought of God s justice and righteousness in His dispensational and governmental dealings with His people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The good word, the word of grace, has been spoken much, but the word of righteousness which concerns God s dispensational and governmental dealings with His children is not understood by many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to pick up a burden to practice the good word of God, that is, the word of grace for salvation, and we also have to practice the word of God s righteousness which is for God s dispensational and governmental dealings with us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more we increase not only our knowledge but also our experience of the word, the more we will be equipped to perfect others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then when we go to take care of the new ones in the home meetings, we will have the rich materials in our being to use.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we go to a home meeting, we do not know what particular word will be needed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must be like a pharmacy with many types of medicine stored within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we visit a home, we may not know what particular medicine the patient is in need of today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The many different kinds of people who are saved by the Lord through our gospel preaching will need help to begin their home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why we need many different categories of the word stored in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This will enable us to open up our mouth and utter something to meet the particular need.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Based on the Scriptures</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all have to gain an increase and an accumulation of the knowledge and experience of the word based on the Scriptures 2 Tim 3:15-17; Col 3:16a .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To gain such an accumulation we surely need to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 2 Timothy 3:15-17 Paul pointed out to Timothy that he had gained a good foundation in the knowledge of the holy Scriptures from his childhood.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then he told Timothy what the Scriptures can do for the man of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Scriptures enable the man of God to be complete, fully equipped for every good work v. 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I must charge you not only to pick up two verses daily but also to study the Bible daily.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These two verses are to stir up your spirit for your daily life, but we still need to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At least we should read the New Testament once a year.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, when we study the New Testament, we should not study it according to our preference.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should study according to the sequence of the books beginning with Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When I was young, I loved the Bible, but in my reading of the Bible I wanted to skip over the first seventeen verses of Matthew regarding the genealogy of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At a certain point, I realized that there were many riches in these seventeen verses, so I began to study them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Based upon my study of these verses, I wrote Gleanings from the Genealogy of Jesus Christ in 1936.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The content from this publication with some additional revelation is contained in the notes on these verses in the Recovery Version of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A number of seeking ones began to admire and appreciate the Recovery Version when they read these notes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This shows us that we should not despise any verse of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every verse of the Bible bears some particular significance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must learn to study the New Testament according to its sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not merely select some of your favorite chapters to study.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to study the Word to increase our knowledge of it, and we need to experience the word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not be inexperienced in the deeper word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A teacher must learn much more than what he needs for his teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the public schools of the United States, a person must have a college degree to teach kindergarten.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today we cannot see Christian groups practicing the proper Christian meeting according to what is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is because many Christians would rather take the easy way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To endeavor to practice the meeting that is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25 is a heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But if we take the grace, grace will bear the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We all need to experience the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to practice speaking, and then we have to learn to teach others to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For this we must increase our knowledge and experience of the word.</S>
