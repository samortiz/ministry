   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BASE OF THE PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE PROPER ONE ACCORD IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The New Testament reveals that not only all the saints but even all the churches must be in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As recorded in Acts 15, certain Judaizers came down from Judea to Antioch, teaching the Gentile believers that they had to be circumcised in order to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To make circumcision a requirement for salvation in the New Testament jeopardizes the redemptive work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, this was a great heresy that concerned all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, the churches came together to find a unique solution to this problem, a solution that could satisfy all the churches and keep the one accord among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The practice of the proper one accord in the church is based upon the following eight items.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Identity of the Churches The Seven Golden Lampstands, Symbols of</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>the Seven Churches, Being All Identical</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Revelation 1:11-12 and 20, the seven golden lampstands, symbols of the seven local churches in Asia, are all identical in essence, nature, shape, color, appearance, function, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In all these aspects the seven lampstands are identical.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This signifies that all the local churches should be the same in essence, nature, shape, color, appearance, function, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The seven lampstands were identical to the point that if they were placed side-by-side before our eyes, we could not discern which is which.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Seven Churches Differing</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>in the Business Affairs of Their Administration</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today a certain kind of teaching is being promulgated among the churches encouraging the churches to be different from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, the normal differences among the churches can be only in the business affairs of their administration.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although the Lord did not touch business affairs in the seven epistles to the seven churches, as a rule, according to their practical needs, the churches should be different in the business affairs of their administration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These affairs include such matters as the times of the church meetings, and whether the church purchases property and builds a meeting hall or simply rents a room or a building for its meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In matters such as these, there is no need for the churches to be identical.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To require all the churches to be identical in these matters would be very awkward.</S>
