On the one hand, baptism has been accomplished. But on the other hand, baptism continues until we are fully transformed and conformed to the image of Christ. Hence, until this goal has been attained, we continue to live a life of baptism. This means that we are daily under the application of the death of Christ as we experience the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death, which is now one of the ingredients, the elements, in the all-inclusive Spirit. If our husband or wife gives us a difficult time, we can experience at that very moment the application of Christ&rsquo;s death. Instead of exchanging words, we can experience the putting to death of the negative element within us. This takes place not by doctrine or by a particular practice, but by the killing element in the death of Christ included in the all-inclusive, divine life.</p><h2 class="head1">A HEAVENLY ANTIBIOTIC</h2><p>The divine life is a heavenly antibiotic. To argue with our husband or wife is to have a &ldquo;cough.&rdquo; Whenever we exchange words with our husband or wife, we are &ldquo;coughing.&rdquo; The death of Christ is the only antibiotic that can eliminate the germs that cause this illness.</p><p>The heavenly antibiotic not only crucifies us, but also resurrects us and renews the faculties of our mind, emotion, and will. This resurrection and renewing is the genuine growth and transformation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROCESS OF TRANSFORMATION</h2><p>The process of transformation is both organic and metabolic. It is organic because it is related to life, and it is metabolic because it is related to a process in which old elements are discharged and new elements are added. To change someone&rsquo;s complexion by makeup is neither organic nor metabolic. But a change in complexion that comes through eating nourishing food is both organic and metabolic. Such a change may be considered a physical transformation.</p><p>If we would be transformed, we must constantly look to the Lord, pray, read the Word, and call on the name of the Lord. In this way we eat, drink, and breathe the rich supply of Christ into us. This supply will produce a metabolic change in which the old, negative elements are discharged and replaced by new, positive elements. This metabolic change is transformation.</p><p>In 2 Corinthians 3:18 Paul speaks of beholding and reflecting with an unveiled face the glory of the Lord and of being transformed into His image by the Lord Spirit. As we gaze upon Christ and reflect Him, we are transformed into His image from glory to glory, that is, from one degree of glory to another. This is from the Lord Spirit, the very life-giving Spirit mentioned in verse 6. Verse 17 clearly says that the Lord is the Spirit. In order to bring out the connection between verses 6 and 17, Darby places verses 7 through 16 in parentheses, indicating thereby that verse 17 is the continuation of verse 6. Hence, the Lord is the Spirit who gives life. As we behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, we are transformed by this Spirit. The more we behold Him, the more we receive His supply and are transformed metabolically.</p><h2 class="head1">GROWTH AND SANCTIFICATION</h2><p>Transformation includes growth and sanctification. As we are transformed, we grow and are sanctified. Eventually, transformation will issue in conformation. The more we are transformed, the more we are conformed to the image of Christ. Through this process of transformation and conformation, we are brought fully into the divine sonship to be members of the Body of Christ. As we have pointed out, to gain such a Body to express Christ is the goal of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p><p>I am burdened that all the saints may have the full enjoyment of the all-inclusive, divine life and experience transformation and conformation. We do not need teaching or self-effort&mdash;we need a vision. I pray that the Spirit will enlighten the saints and unveil these matters to them so that they may experience them in their daily living.</p><p>When we see the vision of transformation and conformation by the grafted life, 6:8 will become real in our practical experience. Our having died with Christ will no longer be a mere fact that we believe; it will become our daily experience through the operation of the divine life within. This life both puts us to death and resurrects us. In this way we grow, we are sanctified, and we are transformed.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_224.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_226.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Romans &nbsp; pg 225</div><br></body></html>
