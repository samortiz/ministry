   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Having Been Stumbled in Her Ways</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>from the Ancient Paths, Walking on Bypaths</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Israel had stumbled in her ways from the ancient paths, walking on bypaths, on a way not cast up v. 15b . The ancient paths were the right paths, which their forefathers had taken.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whereas the right way, the ancient way, leads upward, the bypaths lead downward.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To take the bypaths is to go downward; to take the ancient paths, a way that is cast up, is to go upward.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Lord's recovery today, we are taking the upward way, the ancient paths, which the apostle Paul and the other apostles took.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>D. Making Their Land an Astonishment</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because of their evil condition, Israel made their land an astonishment, a thing to be hissed at, to be despised, forever v. 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>E. Devising Plots against Jeremiah the Prophet</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, they plotted against Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"Then they said, Come, let us devise plots against Jeremiah; for the law will not perish from the priest or counsel from the wise or a word from the prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Come, let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not hearken to any of his words" v. 18 . They contended with him and dug a pit for his life, having hidden snares for his feet and having made counsel against him for his death vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>19-20a, 22b-23a .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How evil they were!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>F. Forcing the Prophet</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>to Turn His Intercession for Them</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>before Jehovah to a Curse upon Them</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Originally, Jeremiah the prophet interceded for them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, their opposition forced the prophet to turn his intercession for them before Jehovah to a curse upon them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>19-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>G. Forcing Jehovah to Form Evil</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>and Devise a Plan against Her</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Israel also forced Jehovah to form evil and devise a plan against her v. 11a . Thus, in verse 17 He said, "Like the east wind I will scatter them / Before the enemy; / I will show them My back and not My face / In the day of their calamity." I believe that all these evils should have convinced Jeremiah that God's judgment of Israel was right.</S>
