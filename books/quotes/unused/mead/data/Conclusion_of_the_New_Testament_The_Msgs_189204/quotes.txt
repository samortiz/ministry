[1]  THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY-NINE THE CHURCH THE HIDDEN MYSTERY IN GOD'S ETERNAL ECONOMY 1
[2]  Thus far in these messages on the conclusion of the New Testament we have covered four persons: God, Christ, the Spirit, and the believers.
[3]  A. God's Eternal Economy Eternal Plan, the Purpose of the Ages
[4]  Ephesians 3:11 speaks of the purpose of the ages which God "made in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[5]  Outside of Christ there is no God, and outside of Christ we cannot find God or contact God, because the Triune God is altogether embodied in Christ.
[6]  Christ is also a mystery, and the church, as the Body of Christ to express Him, is the mystery of Christ.
[7]  From the Ages Hidden in God Who Created All Things
[8]  In Ephesians 3:9 Paul speaks of "the dispensation of the mystery, which from the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things."
[9]  The mystery of Christ, which from the ages was hidden in God, who created all things, and which was not made known to men in other generations, has been revealed to the apostles and prophets in their spirit by revelation in the New Testament age.
[10]  The church, something particular hidden in God as a mystery, has been revealed to the apostles and prophets.
[11]  The one is the mystery of God, which is Christ, who is in the believers as their life and their everything that they may become the members of His Body; the other is the mystery of Christ, which is the church as His Body to express His fullness Eph 1:22-23 .
[12]  Then Romans reveals how the believers are built together in one Body 12:4-5 to express Christ in local churches that have come into existence in many cities in a practical way, with all the saints loving one another and fellowshipping with one another among all the churches to express the Body of Christ for the fulfillment of God's mystery.
[13]  The mystery of Christ is to make the multifarious wisdom of God known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies Eph 3:10 .
[14]  According to 1 Corinthians 1:30, Christ is our wisdom with respect to righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.
[15]  As our righteousness, Christ has dealt with our past, which was altogether unrighteous.
[16]  After the Lord asked His disciples to say who they thought He was v. 15 , Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" v. 16 . The Christ, as the anointed One of God, refers to the Lord's commission, whereas the Son of the living God, as the second of the Triune God, refers to His person.
[17]  Built upon the Revelation of Christ as the Rock
[18]  Matthew 16:18a says, "I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church."
[19]  In order to have a complete view of God's way to bring forth the church and to build up the church, we need to realize that the rock in Matthew 16:18 is not merely Christ but also the revelation concerning the Christ, the Son of the living God.
[20]  In this message we shall continue to see the revelation of the mystery of Christ, the church, given by Christ in the Gospels.
[21]  The church revealed in Matthew 16:18 is the universal church, which is the unique Body of Christ, whereas the church revealed here is the local church, the expression of the unique Body of Christ in a certain locality.
[22]  The administration of the church in its locality is illustrated by the dealing with its members.
[23]  If any believer refuses to hear the church, he will lose the fellowship of the church like the Gentile, the heathen, and the tax collector, the sinners who are outside the fellowship of the church.
[24]  The prayer in one accord to exercise the authority given to the church to bind and loose what has been bound and loosed in the heavens should be in the gatherings of two or three with the Lord's presence.
[25]  They may gather together in the Lord's name, but they are not the church, for if there is some problem, they need to tell it to the church v. 17 . If those two or three were the church, there would be no need for them to take the problem to the church.
[26]  From the Lord's word in 18:20 we can realize that in the Lord's intention He did not want to have big gatherings in the local church for practical help.
[27]  In the Gospel of Matthew Christ twice revealed the church to the first group of the apostles, revealing the church in its universal aspect 16:18 and also in its local aspect 18:15-20 .
[28]  The revelation of the mystery of Christ by the Holy Spirit is found in the Epistles, especially in the Epistles of Paul.
[29]  "I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God, the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations, but now has been manifested to His saints; to whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory."
[30]  The deeper and more profound aspect of the church, the church as the mystery of Christ, was fully revealed to Paul.
[31]  But now God wants to bring to light this economy to the intent that His manifold wisdom might be made known to the principalities and powers through the church v. 10 . This is according to the eternal purpose, the eternal plan, which God purposed and planned in Christ.
[32]  Paul's prayer to the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, was for revelation.
[33]  By Knowing the Surpassing Greatness of God's Power toward Them, Which God Wrought in Christ
[34]  The surpassing greatness of God's power not only raised Christ from among the dead and seated Him at God's right hand in the heavenlies but also subjected all things under the Lord's feet.
[35]  Nevertheless, Christ is Head of all things to the church, and the surpassing greatness of the power that operated in Him is toward us who believe v. 19 . This divine power is not transmitted to the church once for all; on the contrary, it is transmitted continually.
[36]  The last part of verse 22 and the beginning of verse 23 speak of "the church, which is His Body."
[37]  Whatever Christ, the Head, has attained and obtained is now being transmitted to His Body, the church.
[38]  The church shares in His resurrection from among the dead, His being seated in His transcendency, the subjection of all things under His feet, and His headship over all things.
[39]  As the element of Christ is transmitted into the church, all that He has accomplished, attained, and obtained is transmitted into the church as well.
[40]  This aspect was not revealed until, after His resurrection, Christ had become the life-giving Spirit and had breathed Himself into His disciples and, on the day of Pentecost, had poured out the consummated Spirit upon them.
[41]  Having considered the church as the hidden mystery in God's eternal economy and having seen that the church, the mystery of Christ, has been revealed first by Christ in the Gospels and then by the Holy Spirit in the Epistles, we shall begin in this message to consider the formation of the church.
[42]  The Lord Jesus came to His disciples on the day of His resurrection as the pneumatic Christ.
[43]  In John 1 Christ is the Lamb, but in John 20, after His death and in His resurrection, He is the pneumatic Christ.
[44]  To say that Christ is the pneumatic Christ means that He is full of the divine breath.
[45]  The Lord Jesus Himself is the pattern for the believers' receiving the Spirit both essentially and economically.
[46]  First, the Spirit came as the divine essence for the conceiving and birth of the Lord Jesus Luke 1:35; Matt 1:18, 20 .
[47]  The Holy Spirit also came to Jesus Christ as the divine power for the anointing of Christ Matt 3:16 .
[48]  Through the once-for-all baptism in the all-inclusive Spirit, the church, in the eyes of God, was once for all, universally formed to be the fullness of Christ for His universal expression.
[49]  It is after this universal formation of the Body of Christ that, through the centuries, all God's chosen people were, are, and will be brought into not only the reality but also the practicality of the Body of Christ until the completion is reached.
[50]  What happened on the day of Pentecost with the Jewish believers and in the house of Cornelius with the Gentile believers was for the formation of the church, the Body of Christ.
[51]  Ephesians 1:22 and 23 tell us that God gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body.
[52]  We have seen that the formation of the universal church took place on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius and that this formation was accomplished by Christ the Head through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.
[53]  As the Spirit is the sphere and element of our spiritual baptism and in such a Spirit we were all baptized into one organic entity, the Body of Christ, so we should all, regardless of our races, nationalities, and social ranks, be this one Body.
[54]  According to Colossians 3:10 and 11, in the new man Christ is all and in all.
[55]  In Greek Christ here is "the Christ," referring to the corporate Christ, composed of Christ Himself as the Head and the church as His Body with all the believers as its members.
[56]  The corporate Christ, the Body-Christ, includes not only Christ Himself but also all the believers, who are the members of Christ's Body, the members of Christ, parts of Christ.
[57]  Intrinsically speaking, the church is altogether Christ Himself, for He is the constituent, the very being, of the church, whereas we are simply the extrinsic form of the church.
[58]  Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, with His unsearchable riches, is the life of the church.
[59]  As the intrinsic constituent of the church, Christ is not only the life of the church but also the nature of the church.
[60]  In Philippians 1:19 Paul speaks of "the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ."
[61]  In the two foregoing messages we covered the formation of the church.
[62]  The universal church is not established; rather, it is formed with two categories of elements: all the believers as the extrinsic element and the all-inclusive Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God consummated as the all-inclusive, compound Spirit as the intrinsic element.
[63]  In this message and in the message following, we shall give a history of the planting of local churches recorded in the New Testament.
[64]  Acts 9:31 says, "So the church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it was multiplied."
[65]  Acts 13:1 tells us that in the church in Antioch there were "prophets and teachers: Barnabas and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen, foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul."
[66]  In this message we shall continue to consider the establishment of the churches.
[67]  H. Spreading to the Province of Asia in Asia Minor 1.
[68]  In Philippians 1:1 Paul says, "Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and deacons."
[69]  When Paul says that the church is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, he indicates that we have been born of God and have been brought into the organic union with Christ.
[70]  J. Spreading to the Province of Achaia, next to Macedonia Churches Raised Up in: 1.
[71]  It indicates that the church in Corinth was not the church of Cephas, of Apollos, of Paul, nor of any practice or doctrine, but of God.
[72]  This message and the message following may be considered a review and conclusion of the ten previous messages on the church.
[73]  The church, the mystery of Christ, was first revealed by the Lord Jesus in the Gospels to the first group of the apostles.
[74]  On the Rock of the Revelation concerning Christ, the Son of the Living God
[75]  These words refer not only to Christ Himself but also to the revelation of Christ.
[76]  We all need to see that the building up of the universal church is altogether on the clear revelation concerning Christ, the Son of the living God.
[77]  In another sense, He was uplifted to the heavens by the great power of God that was wrought in Him to raise Him from among the dead, to seat Him in the heavens, to subject all things under His feet, and to give Him to be the Head over all things to the church for the producing of the Body of Christ Eph 1:19-23 .
[78]  In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus also says that "the gates of Hades shall not prevail against" His church.
[79]  Hence, the church as the house of God indicates that the church, on the one hand, is the household, the family, of God, and, on the other hand, is the dwelling place of God.
[80]  The Body of Christ, the Fullness of the One Who Fills All in All, for His Expression
[81]  These verses reveal that the church as the Body of Christ is constituted of all the believers baptized in one Spirit and given to drink one Spirit.
[82]  As the wife of Christ, the church comes out of Christ Eph 5:30 .
[83]  Just as Eve came out of Adam, the church as Christ's counterpart comes out of Christ.
[84]  This reveals that the church, the wife of Christ, is a pure product out of Christ.
[85]  God is expressed in Christ, Christ is expressed in the church, and the church is expressed in the local churches.
[86]  What the Lord revealed in His second mentioning in Matthew 18:17 is the local church for the administration of the church in its locality.
[87]  The first mention of a local church in the Epistles is in Romans 16:1.
[88]  In this verse Paul says, "I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a deaconess of the church which is at Cenchrea."
[89]  "The churches of Macedonia" 2 Cor 8:1 , "the churches of Galatia" Gal 1:2 , "the churches of Judea" Gal 1:22; 1 Thes 2:14 , "the churches of the nations" Rom 16:4 , the churches of Syria and Cilicia Acts 15:41 , "everywhere in every church" 1 Cor 4:17 , "in every church" Acts 14:23 , "the churches of God" 1 Cor 11:16 , "the churches of Christ" Rom 16:16 , "all the churches of the saints" 1 Cor 14:33 , and "all the churches" 1 Cor 7:17 mentioned in the New Testament all refer to the local churches, which were the many local expressions of the one universal church in the first century on earth, both in the Jewish world and in the Gentile world.
[90]  The churches are established in different cities by taking a city as the boundary and ground of each local church.
[91]  This shows clearly that the practice of the church life in the early days was that of one church for one city, one city with one church, with the city as the boundary and ground of each local church.
[92]  As Lampstands to Bear the Testimony of Jesus Christ in Separate Cities
[93]  Every local church is a golden lampstand, the testimony of Jesus Christ, having the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God as the lamps and shining the testimony of Jesus from its locality.
[94]  The golden substance of the lampstand signifies God the Father; the specific shape of the lampstand signifies Christ, since Christ is the embodiment of God; and the seven lamps of the lampstand signify the seven Spirits of God as the expression of God.
[95]  Hence, the golden lampstands signify the churches as the embodiment and expression of the Triune God shining forth, with the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God as the lamps, the testimony of Jesus in the dark age of today. e. All the Local Churches Being the One Unique Body of Christ in the Universe
[96]  The Bible first refers to one church and then to many churches because the one church, the universal church, is the totality of all the churches, and all the churches are local constituents of the one universal church, the unique Body of Christ.
[97]  In the New Testament the church is mentioned again and again from the first book, Matthew, to the last book, Revelation.
[98]  In these messages on the conclusion of the New Testament, we are collecting the various verses regarding the church and arranging them so that we may see a clear picture of the church as a great, corporate person, the new man.
[99]  We have seen that the church was a good pleasure in God's heart and that, based upon this good pleasure, God has purposed a will to obtain the church.
[100]  We have also seen that Christ, as the resurrected and ascended One, has formed the church with Himself as the embodiment of the processed Triune God becoming the life-giving Spirit breathed into His believers.
[101]  e. Not Lording It over the Church but Being Patterns of the Flock
[102]  In 1 Peter 5:3 Peter says to the elders, "Nor as lording it over the allotments, but becoming patterns of the flock."
[103]  THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED TWO THE CHURCH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FOUR SPECIAL GIFTS AND THE CHURCH
[104]  In the foregoing message we considered the offices in both the universal church and the local church.
[105]  The prophets are a gift mainly for the local church Acts 13:1; 1 Cor 14:23-24 .
[106]  In the churches today there should be prophets receiving the divine revelation and the light, prophets who know the truth, who have the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge, and who speak for God and speak God forth into others.
[107]  E. All the Four Special Gifts Not Building the Body of Christ Directly but Perfecting the Saints That They May Build the Body of Christ Directly
[108]  All the four special gifts the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherd-teachers do not build the Body of Christ directly.
[109]  THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED THREE THE CHURCH THE FELLOWSHIP AMONG THE CHURCHES 1
[110]  In this message we come to the very crucial matter of the fellowship among the churches.
[111]  The fellowship among the churches is the fellowship of the Body of Christ.
[112]  In 1 Corinthians 10:16 and 17 Paul says, "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a fellowship of the blood of Christ?
[113]  This means that the substance of every church should be God the Father, and the form, the appearance, of every church should be Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God.
