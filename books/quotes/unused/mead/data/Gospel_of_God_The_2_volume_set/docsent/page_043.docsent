   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In verse 19 Paul gives us the reason: "It was added because of the transgressions."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What does it mean to add something?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Recently I went to a certain place to work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>During my stay there, I went with a few brothers to a restaurant for dinner one night.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because we do not have a home there, we went to a restaurant and ordered a meal of five dishes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These dishes were eaten very quickly, and so we asked the waiter to add one more dish.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The addition of another dish was not our original intention; it was added to meet the immediate need.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In a similar way, Paul said that the law was added.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, God does not have to give us the law, and neither did He need to give it to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God gave the law to the Jews because He wanted to show the world through the Jews that He gave the law because of transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why was the law added because of transgressions?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let us look now at the last part of Romans 4:15: "But where there is no law, neither is there transgression."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And let us also look at Romans 5:20: "And the law entered in alongside that the offense might abound."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The purpose of the law is to cause the offense to abound.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sin entered the world through man, and therefore, sin is in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Death came from sin and began to reign.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From the time of Adam to the time of Moses, sin was in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But how can we prove this?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is evidenced by death being in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If there were no sin from Adam until Moses, man would not have died.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fact that from Adam until Moses all died proves that sin was there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although there was sin during that time, there was no law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, there was only sin but no transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is transgression?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sin was real and present in the world, but man did not know that sin was here until the law of God came.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through the law God showed us that we have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, there was sin already within us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We were corrupted already, but we did not know about it until the law came, at which time the sin within was manifested as transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The law is like a thermometer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A person may be sick with a fever.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if you say to him, "Friend, your complexion does not look very good; you have a temperature," he may not believe you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All you would have to do is get a thermometer and put it in his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After two minutes you could show him definitely that he has a temperature.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We were already sinful; we already had a "temperature"; but we did not know about it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>So God gave us a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although the law may not be a perfect standard, it is a sufficiently high standard.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God uses the law to measure us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By it we see that we have transgressed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once we see that we have transgressed the law, we know that we have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sin was within man already; but without transgressions, he would never have confessed that he had sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was only after he transgressed that he would confess that he really had sin.</S>
