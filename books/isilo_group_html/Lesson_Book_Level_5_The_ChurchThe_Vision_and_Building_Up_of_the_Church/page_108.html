We agree that Christians should pray. Do you pray? How often do you pray? How consistent is your prayer? Are your prayers answered? If you ask any Christian the same questions, you will find that most Christians rarely pray. Why? Most of us do not realize that prayer is important. We may not know how to pray, or we may not understand the principles of prayer. Our prayer may be non-effective and meaningless. We hope that this lesson will change all that. After you study this lesson and practice accordingly, you will be a proper serving one in the prayer ministry of the church.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_107.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_109.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Lesson Book, Level 5: The Church-The Vision and Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 108</div><br></body></html>
