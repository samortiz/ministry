   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 1:29 says, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He came as the Son of Man to be the Lamb to take away the sin of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 32 says, "...the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here, He is the dove, the Spirit, indicating that He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Son of Man is for redemption from sins, whereas the Son of God is for life-giving and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>John 3:14 and 15 say, "...Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that every one who believes into Him may have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was lifted up as the bronze serpent; this shows that He is the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"Every one who believes into Him may have eternal life" this tells us that He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse34 says, "For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for He gives the Spirit not by measure" this shows that He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In chapter four the Lord came to the well in Sychar, a city of Samaria, and met a woman who came to draw water.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This shows us that He was the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, He could give the woman living water to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This One who can give people the living water is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In chapter eight the woman who was caught committing adultery was brought to Jesus vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>3-11 , who was surely the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He stooped down to write on the ground, and when the Pharisees and the scribes persisted in pressing Him to deal with the woman, He stood up and said to them, "He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, they went out one by one, beginning with the older ones.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Afterward, the Lord asked the woman, "Has no one condemned you?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She said, "No one, Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And immediately the Lord said, "Neither do I condemn you."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That was the Son of Man speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then He said, "Go, and from now on sin no more."</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Later the Lord said, "Unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins" v. 24 . Undoubtedly, the great "I Am" is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is what it means to study the Gospel of John in the way of crystallization.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How different this is from the general study of the Bible!</S>
