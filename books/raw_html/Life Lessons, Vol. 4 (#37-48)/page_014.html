 <h1 class="msg">LESSON FORTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">SANCTIFICATION&mdash;THE THIRD STAGE</h1>
<p>We have seen that in God&rsquo;s full salvation, when sanctification is applied to us, it is divided into three stages. The first stage is for our repentance, the second stage is for our justification, and the third stage is for our transformation. We saw the first stage in Lesson Thirty-seven and the second stage in Lesson Forty. Now we will go on to see the third stage, the sanctification that is for our transformation. This is the very sanctification stressed in Romans 6:19 and 22.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE POWER OF THIS SANCTIFICATION&mdash;<br />
THE SANCTIFYING SPIRIT</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 15:16).</p>
<p>According to the way in which this verse is written, sanctification is accomplished gradually. This agrees with what we saw before, that God&rsquo;s sanctification in us is divided into three stages and is accomplished gradually. Thus, the sanctification spoken of here surely includes the third and ultimate stage of sanctification, that is, to make us acceptable to God through this sanctifying transformation. This third stage is accomplished in the sanctifying Spirit. The Holy Spirit, who is the sanctifying Spirit, is the sanctifying power in this ultimate stage. We must live in this sanctifying Spirit, living and walking by Him and acting and working according to Him, in order to enjoy the sanctification of this ultimate stage.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE LIFE OF THIS SANCTIFICATION&mdash;<br />
THE SANCTIFYING CHRIST</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Christ Jesus, who became...to us from God... sanctification&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 1:30).</p>
<p>Christ is holy (Luke 1:35), and He is the One who sanctifies us (Heb. 2:11). He has become the sanctification to us from God, because He is the sanctifying life within us, infusing the elements of His divine life into our entire being to sanctify us gradually. This sanctification is not obtained at one time, outwardly in position; rather, it grows in a gradual way, inwardly in our disposition. If we desire to experience the ultimate sanctification in God&rsquo;s full salvation, we must take Christ as life and live by Him in the organic union.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE REALITY OF THIS SANCTIFICATION&mdash;<br />
THE SANCTIFYING NATURE OF GOD</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Sanctify them in the truth [reality]; Your word is truth&rdquo;</strong> (John 17:17).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s nature is holy, and the word of God brings the reality of such a nature to us that we may obtain it as the reality of our sanctification. This is to be sanctified in reality. When we live by the holy life of Christ in the sanctifying Spirit, the reality of the holy nature of God will become the reality which sanctifies us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE PERFECTION OF THIS SANCTIFICATION&mdash;<br />
THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FATHER OF SPIRITS</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;The Father of spirits...disciplined us...that we might partake of His holiness&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 12:9-10).</p>
<p>The Father of spirits, our Father who regenerates us in our spirit, desires that we may enjoy the holiness of His nature. If we do not cooperate with Him, He disciplines us, forcing us to be willing to pursue His holiness, that He may perfect us in His holiness. This is even more so in the ultimate stage of His sanctification. Therefore, we should not make light of His discipline (Heb. 12:5). If we make light of it or refuse it, we will surely lose the opportunity to enjoy His holiness in God&rsquo;s sanctification, and especially in the ultimate stage of His sanctification.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE PURSUIT OF THIS SANCTIFICATION&mdash;<br />
OUR ENDEAVORING IN LIFE</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Pursue...holiness without which no one shall see the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 12:14).</p>
<p>Literally, to pursue holiness is to press toward holiness. This, of course, refers to our constant pursuit of holiness, after we are saved and are positionally sanctified unto God, until we are mature and glorified. We should especially strive to press toward holiness in God&rsquo;s ultimate stage of sanctification. This is the endeavoring in life which we should have.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE PERFECTION OF THIS SANCTIFICATION&mdash;<br />
OUR SELF-CLEANSING</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 7:1).</p>
<p>God perfects us in His sanctification, and He also wants us to perfect ourselves in His sanctification. God perfects us through discipline; we perfect ourselves through self-cleansing, removing all defilement of flesh and spirit, and by being in the fear of God. Often, because we do not cleanse ourselves according to God&rsquo;s enlightening nor follow the Holy Spirit to remove all defilement of flesh and spirit, we even do not fear God. At that time, the Father of spirits, who is our Father in our spirit, has no alternative but to exercise His discipline on us to perfect us in His holiness. This is so that we may fear Him, be willing to cooperate with Him, and cleanse ourselves, putting away all defilement within and without, in order to perfect that which He desires us to obtain, the holiness in His nature.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. OUR WHOLE BEING ENJOYING<br />
THIS SANCTIFICATION&mdash;<br />
THE SPIRIT, THE SOUL, AND THE BODY<br />
BEING WHOLLY SANCTIFIED</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 5:23).</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s full salvation, we must enjoy God&rsquo;s sanctification to such an extent that our entire being is in this enjoyment. Our spirit, soul, and body must be wholly sanctified with God&rsquo;s holy nature, that we may be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus. This is the ultimate completion of the sanctification we enjoy in God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p>
