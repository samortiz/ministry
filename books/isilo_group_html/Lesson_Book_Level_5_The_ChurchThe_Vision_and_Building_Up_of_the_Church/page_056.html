In the Bible there is a record not only of the positive things, but also a record of the failures in the churches and the degradation of the churches. The Bible also covers the recovery of the church. The Bible is very balanced in all these aspects.<h2 class=head1>I. THE FAILURES IN THE CHURCHES</h2><p>[There are no failures in the universal church; however, there are failures in the local churches. All the failures come out of one source, and this source in Satan, who instigates the weak saints to cause all kinds of local problems. The universal church is heavenly, holy, and even divine. But when the universal church reaches a certain locality to be expressed in a local church, the church in that locality may become contaminated and polluted by certain local customs, practices, and philosophies.]<p>Hypocrisy-[The first failure in the churches was that of hypocrisy seen in the case of Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5:1-11). Hypocrisy is a matter of pretending to be somebody in order to get a name that we may have vainglory. This is altogether related to ambition.]<p>Racial Difference-The second failure was that of being overcome by racial differences (Acts 6:1). &#8220;There was a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews&#8217;&#8217; because of eating. This caused the practice of having all things common to wane.<p>Legal Practices-Another failure was that of bringing in the legal practices of the Old Testament (Acts 15:1-2). Acts 15:1 says, &#8220;certain men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.&#8217;&#8217; This type of saying is an annulling of the faith in God&#8217;s New Testament economy, and is a real heresy. This failure annulled the believers freedom in Christ. This even caused Peter to be hypocritical and caused the rest of the Jewish believers who were with him to join him in hypocrisy. Even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy.<p>Compromise-A very serious failure in the churches was the compromise with Judaism led by the apostle James (Acts 21:20-26). This failure brought in the mixture of Judaism to contaminate God&#8217;s pure grace, which spoiled the purity of the church life, and damaged the pure testimony of Jesus Christ as the embodiment of God&#8217;s pure grace. This failure brought about the termination of the church when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Roman army (under Titus) in A.D. 70, as a result of God&#8217;s judgment.<p>Other failures included: judging one another in the matters of eating and the observing of days, and not building one another up (Rom. 14); making divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching of the apostles (Rom. 16:17); being puffed up on behalf of one gifted person against another unto strife and divisions (1 Cor. 1:11-12); committing fornication (1 Cor. 5:1); having lawsuits one against another (1 Cor. 6:4-7); questioning the apostleship and charging the apostle with being crafty in making gain with guile (1 Cor. 9:1-3; 2 Cor. 12:16); partaking of the table of the Lord and of the table of the demons (1 Cor. 10:21); eating the bread and drinking the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner and not discerning the Body (1 Cor. 11:27); abusing the gift of tongue-speaking (1 Cor. 14:19-20, 23); saying that there is no resurrection of the dead (1 Cor. 15:12); and finally, walking disorderly (2 Thes. 3:11).<p>[God&#8217;s intention in recording these failures in the holy Word is to give us a warning concerning the possibility of such failures recurring in the church life. We need to learn from all these failures and do our best to avoid them. If the churches in the apostles&#8217; time could suffer all these failures, it is even more likely that today, if we are careless, we also shall suffer the same kind of failures. Therefore, we need to look to the Lord that we may be kept from these failures.]<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_055.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_057.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Lesson Book, Level 5: The Church-The Vision and Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 56</div><br></body></html>
