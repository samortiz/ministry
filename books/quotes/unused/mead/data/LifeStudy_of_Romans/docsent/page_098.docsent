   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Toward God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 11 describes the way we should be toward God: Not slothful in zeal; burning in spirit; serving the Lord as a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not Slothful</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the church life we need to be diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No slothful person can prevail in practicing the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For the sake of the Body our slothfulness must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Burning in Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For the Body life, we need a body that is presented, a mind that is renewed in the transformation of the soul, and a spirit that is burning.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our whole being spirit, soul, and body is included in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For the sake of the church life, our body needs to be presented, our soul needs to be transformed, and our mind needs to be metabolically changed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our mind must be renewed, not simply by being taught, but by being transformed, having the element of Christ spread into it to produce a metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The transformation of our soul primarily depends upon the renewing of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are serious about practicing the church life, we need to present our body, to have our soul transformed, and to be burned and burning in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we have a heart for the church life, but fail to present our body to the church, we are impractical.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, suppose we are bodily in the church life, yet our mind is filled with old concepts, thoughts, and traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose our mind is occupied by our own natural cleverness, imaginations, and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may come to the church with our body, but we bring with us our very troublesome mind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such an unrenewed mind will be a great problem to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our body must be presented and our mind must be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Suppose, by the Lord s mercy, our body has been presented and our mind has been renewed, but our spirit remains cold.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That will never work for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After the presenting of the body and the renewing of the mind, we need the burning of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How we long to see that all the saints in the Lord s recovery would have three characteristics: a body that has been absolutely presented for the church life; a mind that has been completely renewed by metabolic transformation in the soul, a mind that is free from worldly, natural, and religious thoughts, wholly saturated with the Lord s mind, and purely for the Lord; and a spirit that is set on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If all the saints in the Lord s recovery are like this, how wonderful the church life will be.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Serving as a Slave</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the church life we must serve the Lord as a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A slave is one who has been sold to his master and who no longer has any freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to be this kind of person for the Body life, serving the Lord as slaves and having no freedom to do things according to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, toward God we must not be slothful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must burn in our spirit and serve Him as a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>C. Toward Ourselves</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Romans 12 we also see four aspects of a normal life toward ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rejoicing in Hope</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We Christians should be a rejoicing people because we always have the enjoyment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we enjoy the Lord in His riches, we will not only be joyful inwardly, but we will be rejoicing outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even in times of trouble we should and can rejoice in hope.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are not people who are without God and without Christ, having no hope Eph 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have God and we have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>So, regardless of the situation, we have hope and we can rejoice in hope.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Enduring in Tribulation</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We Christians must also be able to endure tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must be an enduring people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By rejoicing in hope we can endure any kind of tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Chapter 5:3 says that we can exult in tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We not only endure, but also exult in tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Persevering in Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order to endure tribulation we need to be persevering in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to pray persistently.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This will not only enable us to endure tribulation, but also to remain in the enjoyment of the Lord, in His presence and in His will.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Abhorring and Conquering What Is Evil</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>and Cleaving to What Is Good</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In addition to all this, as God s holy people, we must abhor and conquer the evil things and cleave to the good things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We Christians, who are separated unto God, must maintain the highest standard of behavior, a standard above that of moral and ethical people.</S>
