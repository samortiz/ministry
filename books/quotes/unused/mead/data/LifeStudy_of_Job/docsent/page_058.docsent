   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE STEPS OF THE PROCESS OF THE TRIUNE GOD His Incarnation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before incarnation, the first step of His process, the Triune God had divinity but not humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was only divine but not human; He was only God but not man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But one day the Triune God entered into the womb of a human virgin and after nine months was born out of that womb to be the God-man, a divine-human person, a person with both the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His Human Living</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This God-man lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although He did not accomplish anything great in a material sense, He did something marvelous He expressed God, He manifested God, in full, in His human living.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His All-inclusive Death</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The next step of the process of the Triune God was the all-inclusive death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through His death Christ redeemed God's chosen people, terminated the old creation, and released the divine life from within the "shell" of His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After dying an all-inclusive death, Christ entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once again I would emphasize the fact that in resurrection Christ was begotten to be the firstborn Son of God Acts 13:33; Rom 1:3-4; 8:29 and became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b to regenerate God's chosen people 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Early in the morning on the day of His resurrection, He went to heaven to the Father secretly John 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the evening of the same day, He came to the disciples and breathed Himself into them as breath, saying, "Receive the Holy Spirit" v. 22 . This is the essential Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His Ascension and Descension</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After forty days Christ ascended openly and officially.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In His ascension He was made the Lord of all and the Christ of God Acts 2:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ten days later, on the day of Pentecost, He descended to pour out Himself as the economical Spirit on the disciples vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>1-4, 17, 33 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In His descension three thousand were regenerated, issuing in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today He is the One who is ascending and descending continually John 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is in the heavens, and He is also on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a result of all the steps of this process, God is no longer the "raw God," God before His process, but the "cooked God," God after His process.</S>
