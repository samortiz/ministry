   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF NEHEMIAH MESSAGE FIVE THE LEADERSHIP OF NEHEMIAH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE RECONSTITUTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE NATION OF GOD S ELECT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The leaders of the returned captivity were Zerubbabel of the royal family, Ezra of the priestly family, and Nehemiah of a common family.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Among all the leaders in the history of Israel, these three were the top ones.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nehemiah was very common with no rank.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is no indication that his family had a high standing in society, and he did not have a high profession.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even though he served in the palace of the king of Persia, he was just a household servant.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although Nehemiah was a common person without any position, he was placed in a very high position, a position which involved close contact with the king.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nehemiah was a cupbearer to the king Neh 1:11b .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>While wine was being set before the king, Nehemiah would take up the wine and give it to him 2:1a .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, the king appointed this cupbearer to be the governor of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>NEHEMIAH S PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As one of the leaders of the returned captivity, Nehemiah had some particular and special characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Being a Pleasant Person</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>with a Proper Attitude and Behavior</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As a cupbearer to the king, Nehemiah must have been a person who was pleasant and sweet and who was always proper in his attitude and behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was never sad in the king s presence v. 1b . If Nehemiah had not been a pleasant person who fulfilled the king s requests, the king would not have allowed him to continue serving as a cupbearer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A Person Who Loved God</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>and God s Interest on Earth</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nehemiah loved God, and he loved God s interest on earth concerning His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This interest included the good land, the temple, and the city of Jerusalem, all of which Nehemiah loved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even though he was a common person without a rank such as that of a king or of a captain in the army, he took care of God s interest on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One Who Prayed to Contact God in Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nehemiah was also one who always prayed to God to contact God in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When he heard that the people in Jerusalem were suffering and that the wall of Jerusalem had been broken down and that its gates had been burned with fire, he wept, mourned, fasted, and prayed 1:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In verse 11 he prayed, saying, I beseech You, O Lord, let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant and to the prayer of Your servants, who take delight in fearing Your name; and cause Your servant to prosper today, and grant him to find compassion before this man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here Nehemiah was praying that he would find favor with the king.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the king asked him regarding his request, Nehemiah prayed to the God of heaven 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A Person Who Trusted in God</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>and Who Was One with God</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, Nehemiah was a person who trusted in God and who was one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Burdens were placed upon his shoulder by God, but in bearing these burdens he trusted in God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nehemiah knew that the good hand of God was upon him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>8, 18 , and he asked God to remember him 5:19; 13:14, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This indicates that he trusted in God and was one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was not easy for God to gain such a person as Nehemiah.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In rank and profession he was very low, but he loved God and God s interest, he prayed for God s interest, contacting Him in fellowship, and he trusted in God and became one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These are Nehemiah s particular characteristics in his relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Altogether Unselfish</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In his relationship with the people, Nehemiah was altogether unselfish.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>With him, there was no self-seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even though he gained a high position as the governor of Judah he was actually the acting king of Judah, representing the king of Persia he never sought anything for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>With Nehemiah there was no self-interest.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was always willing to sacrifice what he had for the people and for the nation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was the governor, but he did not take any compensation for twelve years, because he realized that the building of the wall was a heavy burden on the people 5:14-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He did not want to increase the burden on them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Instead of receiving compensation, he provided for the daily necessities of more than one hundred fifty men.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Nehemiah also was among those who were ready to fight against the enemy and he took part in the night watch 4:17-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He did not leave these matters to others but participated in them himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Not Indulging in Lust</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is quite striking that there is no word concerning Nehemiah s marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I believe that, in contrast to the judges and the kings, Nehemiah had only one wife.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He did not indulge in sexual lust.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>David and Solomon were both indulgent in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The indulgence in sexual lust was the main factor of the rottenness of David s family and the main factor behind the loss of the kingdom for David and his descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Nehemiah, however, was altogether different.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I believe that in the whole six thousand years of human history, there has never been such a one as Nehemiah.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There were no complaints about Nehemiah from the people.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Everyone appreciated him and was grateful for him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may say that Nehemiah was an outstanding elder, the best example of what an elder should be.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I hope that all the elders in the churches today will be like Nehemiah.</S>
