   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 1 Date:June 21, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER L. C.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was saved at a time that I least expected.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After I was saved, I loved to read the Bible and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My desire was to be a model pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Later I entered a Bible school.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After three years, I graduated and was assigned a preacher's job.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Upon reading Brother Nee's magazine The Christian, I came to know about the meaning of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet human affection restrained me from leaving my denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Later I heard Brother Nee preach at Hardoon Road, Shanghai, about the grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying to bear much fruit in John 12:24.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That message opened my eyes to see how the church is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother Chang Kwang-rong once preached in P'ing Yang, Chekiang province, on the standard of a servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I felt that I was unworthy to be called a servant.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I prayed that the Lord would touch Brother Nee to call for a national co-workers' conference once again.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord heard my prayer, and I was able to attend the last special conference in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>My past has been fraught with sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have encountered pirates three times, bandits once, civil wars twice, and sickness many times.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But thank the Lord, He has brought me through safely.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I feel that I am too old and that the young people should take up much of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet the responsibility of the church is still on my shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I do not want to hold on, yet I have to bear it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is my problem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT Spiritual Contradictions</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our brother is the main worker bearing responsibility around Wenchow, Chekiang.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He must not retire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For years the war in our country prevented the co-workers from having regular fellowship with each another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is a good sign that your natural interest for the Lord's work has diminished.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is good to be delivered from the self.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But at the same time, you should be more aggressive by the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the Lord's work, contradictions exist.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brother Hwang should encourage this contradiction.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This contradiction will show you how much you are for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By living under such contradictions, one realizes how he can serve the Lord with more purity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the one hand, we are no longer driven by natural interest in the work; we can give ourselves to the work, and we also can retire from the work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the experience of death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But it is not right to only have death without resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the positive side, we must be strengthened by the resurrection life so that we can labor even more than when we were young.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It concerns me that some people pay much attention to the work but do not produce much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For us to continue working is a matter of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is a matter not of preference but of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul said that woe was to him if he did not preach the gospel and that he would receive a reward if he preached willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But even if he was not willing, the responsibility was still upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is good to experience more of such contradictions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a man pays too much attention to his work, it becomes hard for him to let go.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, it is easy for him to become passive when he lets go.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God often leads men through the valley of death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brothers Yu-ting, Chin-fa, and Tien-zhu have all died.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This puts the churches in P'ing Yang in great trials.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have to ask my brother, "After you are no longer attached to your work, are you clearer about how much of your service is truly for God?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When a man loses interest in the work, he finds out whether or not he is for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When a man is young, he likes to do this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But it is merely a demonstration of the power of the flesh and the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When things are different, that is, when we are in the midst of dark days, we truly find out how much of our work is for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I am afraid that the things related to our youthful zeal had very little to do with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Most of them were for ourselves or for others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only as the self recedes does the Lord begin to work in an inward way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord can purify us so that the more we serve Him, the simpler we become.</S>
