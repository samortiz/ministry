IN WORKING FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>Although some brothers have seen some revelation, their looseness damages their speaking. For example, a brother once said, &ldquo;After the breath of life was breathed into man in Genesis 2:7, man received God&rsquo;s element, God&rsquo;s life.&rdquo; His speaking was about life, but it was loose and not according to the truth. When God breathed into man the breath of life, man did not receive God&rsquo;s element, God&rsquo;s life; instead, he became only a living soul. Thus, he still needed to be put in front of the tree of life to take in God as life (vv. 7-9). We must be careful and not speak about things concerning which we do not have the full assurance. In order to be an expert in anything, we must be disciplined and focused. Once we are loose, there are no standards or guidelines. Whether in our work or in our reading of the Bible, many of us are quite loose because we start but never finish. This is sufficient proof of our looseness in the Lord&rsquo;s work and in our leading the church. In order to release the Lord&rsquo;s word with proper utterance, we must be focused and disciplined.</p>
<p>Many people have a problem related to looseness and a lack of focus, but we should not serve the Lord in such a way. When we release the truth, there must be an introduction and a conclusion. If we are loose, we will speak in a light way. In order to release the truth, however, we must be serious. We must address every matter seriously, even our own personal matters. If some co-workers are working in Thailand for three years, they should either not mention the mystery of God at all or take it so seriously that all the saints in Thailand would know the mystery of God. Even though we have all heard and seen a little of the vision that God has given us throughout the ages, we have not taken it seriously. As a result, we can do only a little here and a little there in our work.</p>
<p><em>The Ministry of the Word</em> began to be published in 1951, three years after we arrived in Taiwan. In the twenty-plus years since then, more suppliers of the word should have been raised up. But after more than twenty years, we do not see many who can supply the word that the Lord has given to us. God is the source of the supply of the word, and we should enter into the supply that He has provided. In my work in mainland China, I was very much aware that the supply of the word was not with me but with Brother Nee. I gave myself fully to be in the supply of his ministry. Today we should immerse ourselves in the supply of the word; if we do, there will be no lack.</p>
<p>The churches in the United States serve the saints by bringing them into this supply of the word. When some of the local leading ones felt that they had something, I did not compel them to receive from this supply. I am not afraid of letting people compare the goods, even though I realize that some do not have an &ldquo;eye&rdquo; for the goods. After several years of doing things themselves, the eyes of these brothers were opened, and they acknowledged their need. This is a strength of the American saints&mdash;they are very straightforward. Once they see a lack, they are willing to receive from others. Once they saw that others had gold and that they themselves had only brass, they dropped their things and followed absolutely. This is part of their character. The character of the Chinese is not as strict, and it tolerates procrastination. This is harmful.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we believe that the Lord is not without hope today. We must prostrate ourselves before the Lord and have a thorough turn in order for the Lord&rsquo;s vision to become our goal. We need to devote ourselves to this vision and cling to it as a matter of life and death. This will be a source of hope among us. If we are not disciplined in this way, I absolutely believe that the Lord will not have a way to go on with us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEING AND FOLLOWING THE VISION CLOSELY</h2>
<p>We must worship the Lord for one thing: According to our observation of history and the condition of Christianity today, we can say that God has revealed His intention to us. Hence, we have indeed received a vision. I was saved at a very young age, and I pursued much and tried my best to buy spiritual books to read. I was familiar with all the famous Christian figures in the East and in the West. However, when I compared these books with the messages that the Lord was releasing through Brother Nee, I saw clearly what was superior and what was inferior. A comparison of goods is never a problem unless a person is unable to recognize the superior quality of the goods. When I read Brother Nee&rsquo;s messages, I firmly believed that the Lord&rsquo;s way and the Lord&rsquo;s vision were with him. From that day I resolved to follow the Lord according to what I saw, and to this day I have no regrets.</p>
<p>When the Lord brought me overseas, I still had hope that others could be raised up to speak of this vision. However, more than twenty years have passed, and no other ministry of the word has been raised up by the Lord in the East or in the West. In the United Kingdom there was once a considerable release of spiritual riches, but its present cannot compare with its past. In the United States the content of many so-called Christian magazines is quite mixed. Therefore, we can only bow and worship God for His vision among us. As a result of this, once the Lord&rsquo;s testimony reached the United States, it attracted many people; among these are brothers and sisters who were pastors, missionaries, and seminary graduates.</p>
<p>Recently, a pair of sibling brothers began to meet with us. The older brother was a traveling preacher, and the younger brother accompanied him as the choir leader. During one of their travels, they invited an American preacher to speak, and this preacher spoke entirely from the book <em>The Economy of God.</em> This preacher openly acknowledged that his speaking was based on this book. When the two brothers took him to the airport, the preacher gave them <em>The Economy of God</em> and <em>The All-inclusive Christ.</em> The brothers took the books home, read them, and realized that the preacher&rsquo;s speaking was truly taken from these books. Shortly thereafter, the two brothers began to meet with us, even though the preacher did not take this way. When these two brothers later shared their testimony with the preacher, he said that this ministry was the highest ministry on the earth.</p>
<p>This shows that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not a matter of doctrine but of vision. Today there is no book in Christianity that speaks clearly concerning the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ. It is a great mercy that the Lord has shown us so much. Consequently, we must not take for granted what the Lord has shown us of Christ being the mystery of God and the church being the mystery of Christ. These two mysteries are the story of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. I hope that we would spend considerable time and energy to pursue and pray about this matter in order to know Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ. We must open our spirit and enter into this vision. The Lord is not after holiness, spirituality, or victory. The Lord wants to bring us into this vision so that we may see that the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;is the all-inclusive Spirit who has entered into us to be our everything. We are the mystery of Christ, the church, because He is in us. The all-inclusive Spirit is mingled with our human spirit; hence, we must live in this Spirit.</p>
<p>The history of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the history of the church, involves two spirits&mdash;the divine Spirit and the human spirit&mdash;being mingled as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). The all-inclusive divine Spirit has been mingled with our human spirit. Never in history has this vision been revealed so clearly. Although the saints among us seemingly understand this, they do not care much for it. It is as if they have been given a treasure but are willing to put it aside in a corner while they care for other things in their living and work. We have neglected this treasure, and thus, we have lost the goal and the blessing.</p>
<p>The burden of this chapter is to call us to return to this treasure. Nothing is more precious than this treasure. I am not boasting, but for over fifty years I have been studying in this field. I have studied and handled truths concerning holiness, sanctification, and the bearing of the cross. These are not wrong, but they are not up to date. The matter of the all-inclusive Spirit was not so clear thirty years ago. If we neglect the Spirit today and go back to care for sanctification, victory, spirituality, and the cross, we are going backward. We must see that the Spirit, this treasure, as revealed by God to us in His word, is all-inclusive. By living in this Spirit, there is sanctification; by living in this Spirit, there is victory; by living in this Spirit, there is the cross. If we are in the Spirit, even our flesh is dealt with; everything is supplied by living in the Spirit.</p>
<p>The brothers in the Far East should have paid attention to this ten years ago, but they did not, and the blessing has been leaking away. Even though they have begun to pay more attention in the recent years through the influence of the American brothers, it is still not enough. The elders and co-workers should treasure this vision, enter into this vision, and live in this vision so that the riches may flow out of them to others.</p>
<p>I pray for this and hope that our eyes would be opened to see that throughout the ages God has desired to work the mystery of the Triune God into us. This mystery can be expressed with one word&mdash;<em>Spirit.</em> The all-inclusive Spirit is the totality of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Within this Spirit there is redemption, divinity, humanity, sanctification, and all the spiritual riches. Paul says that he was charged &ldquo;to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel&rdquo; (Eph. 3:8). These riches are the all-inclusive Spirit. This Spirit has entered into our spirit, regenerated our spirit, and lives in our spirit to be our life and person in order to transform our whole being. We must live in this Spirit.</p>
<p>We must see that the all-inclusive Spirit is in our spirit to be everything to us; therefore, we must live in this Spirit. We should not merely release our spirit loudly but also see this vision and live in it. Even if we have seen this vision, it is easy for us to become loose and careless. It is possible to see something but not be focused and disciplined. We do not need to discuss whether our methods are right or wrong; rather, we must focus on seeing this Spirit and letting Him be real in our experience. We must speak this in every message and live in it. Then we will have results.</p>
<p>A so-called co-worker among us once condemned me severely. He said that I was keeping the churches in the Far East in my &ldquo;controlling hands.&rdquo; But I must ask the responsible brothers from the various localities, &ldquo;What have I controlled?&rdquo; The ministry is not a matter of control but of vision. The vision is in this ministry; the church is blessed when it follows this vision, and there is no blessing when it does not follow this vision. The real question is not even related to the matter of control; it is a matter of whether we are willing to follow the vision that the Lord has shown us. We must follow the vision. Rather than following any person, we must ask where the vision is, and then we should follow it.</p>
<p>Our God is living and true (1 Thes. 1:9), and He is working. Since He must be speaking today, would He give different directions through two or three people simultaneously? I do not believe that God would be so foolish. The Bible shows that God&rsquo;s direction came through Moses and later through David. Even in the New Testament, God&rsquo;s direction was according to the vision given to Paul. God does not speak different things through different people at the same time; this would be chaotic. Furthermore, the world has become smaller. With the convenience of transportation and advanced communications, it is easy for something to spread from one place to another. The churches in America are blessed because the more the brothers in the various localities move forward, the more open and the brighter their eyes become. Hence, they are resolved to follow this vision. They firmly believe that this is the only way, the only vision, and they take care of it in a serious, disciplined, and careful manner in order to receive the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>We all know our situation here. There was a turmoil more than ten years ago, but the situation is stable now. We know the way and the vision, but we are loose and unfocused. We lack discipline and focus, and we are somewhat indifferent. We must all see this vision, and we must be focused after seeing the vision. If we are focused like the churches in America, the blessing will come.</p>
<p>During our first fifteen years on the island of Taiwan, the elders and co-workers moved forward in one accord. The condition then was the same as it is in America today. In fact, it was even higher. However, the Lord&rsquo;s testimony has been in the United States for only a little more than a decade, and there are now approximately six thousand who are taking this way. Of this number, one to two thousand are functioning and absolute for this way. They firmly believe in this way, and they are serious about taking this way. Their family life and personal life are for this way. Even though the opposers here have left, and the situation has become more stable in recent years, those who have remained seem to be looser. It is as if we have reached the bottom and cannot go any lower.</p>
<p>It is the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to show us our need to be more focused and disciplined in relation to Christ being the mystery of God and the church being the mystery of Christ. These two mysteries are two sides of one mystery, which is altogether related to our mingled spirit. The mingling of the divine Spirit with our human spirit is the mystery. We must live in this spirit. Furthermore, we must be focused in our service, in our meetings, and even more, in our church life. May the Lord bless us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Central Vision for Serving the Church &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
