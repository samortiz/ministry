   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WHO IS A SINNER?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we need to ask the question: Who is a sinner?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I know that some of the brothers and sisters here have been believers for over twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some have even worked for the Lord for over fifteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>My question can be considered as one of the ABCs of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Who is a sinner?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I believe that many would answer that a sinner is someone who sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you check Webster's dictionary, I am afraid that you would get the answer that a sinner is one who sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But once you read the Bible, you will have to reject this definition, because it is not that the ones who sin are sinners, but that the sinners are the ones who commit sins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many among us have read the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have heard many say that Paul, in proving that everyone in the world is a sinner, mentioned in chapter three that all have sinned and have come short of the glory of God v. 23 . God seeks the righteous and finds none; He seeks those who understand and who seek after Him and finds none; all have lied and have turned aside vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>10-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, it seems that Paul is saying that everyone in the world is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not be too quick to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Does Romans 3 mention the sinner at all?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If anyone can find the word sinner in Romans 3, I will thank him for it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Where is the sinner mentioned in this chapter?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Please note that the sinner is never mentioned here.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some have said that because Romans 3 talks about man sinning, it proves that man is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But Romans 3 does not mention the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is Romans 5 that talks about the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, we must make the distinction: Romans 3 is on the problem of sins, and Romans 5 is on the problem of the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All that Romans 3 tells us is that all have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is only in Romans 5 that we are told who the sinners are.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everyone who was born in Adam is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is what Romans 5:19 tells us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you open up J.N. Darby's New Translation, you will find that he used the words have been constituted sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are all sinners by constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When you write a resume, there are two things that you must put in. One is your birthplace, and the other is your profession.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to God, we are sinners by birth, and we are those who sin by profession.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because we are sinners by birth, we are always sinners, whether we sin or not.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once I was conducting a Bible study with the brothers in Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I told them that there are two kinds of sinners in the world the sinning sinners and the moral sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But whether you are a sinning sinner or a moral sinner, you are still a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God says that all who are born in Adam are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It does not matter what kind of person you are; as long as you are born in Adam, you are a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you sin, you are a sinning sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And if you have not sinned, or to be more accurate, if you have sinned less, you are a moral sinner, or a sinner who sins little.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you are a noble person, you are a noble sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you consider yourself holy, you are a holy sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In any case, you are still a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today the biggest mistake among men is to consider a man a sinner only because he has sinned; if he has not sinned, he is not considered a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But there is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whether you sin or not, as long as you are a man, you are a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As long as you are born in Adam, you are a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A man does not become a sinner because he sins; rather, he sins because he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, my friends, remember God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are sinners; we do not become sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We do not need to become sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once I was talking to a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There was a thermal flask in front of him, and he said, "Here is a thermal flask.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If it prays, I want to be a thermal flask,' what will happen?"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I said, "It already is one.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It does not have to be one."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Likewise with us, once we are something, we do not have to become it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Though our sins are forgiven, we remain sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We can call ourselves the forgiven sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But many believe that they are no longer sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They think that if we talk about being sinners, it means that we do not know the gospel that well.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But this may not be all that true.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul did not say that his sins were not forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But he did say that he was a sinner 1 Tim 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Have you seen the difference here?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you were to ask Paul if his sins were forgiven, he could not be so humble as to say no. But Paul could humbly say that he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He could not deny the work of God in him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But neither could he deny his position in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Although we have received fresh grace in Christ, God has not fully removed the problem of sin; we are still sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The problem of sin will not be fully solved until the new heaven and new earth appear.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, this does not mean that we have not received a complete salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Please do not misunderstand me.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In a few days we will come to this point.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The thing that we must see clearly and accurately is that everyone in the world is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Whether you have sinned or not, as long as you are a man, you are a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When some listen to the gospel, they spend the whole time reasoning about how many or how few sins they have committed.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But before God there is only one issue: Are you in Christ or in Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>All who are in Adam are sinners, and as long as you are a sinner, nothing more needs to be said.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Why then did Paul have to tell us in Romans 1 3 about all the sins that man commits?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>These few chapters show us that sinners sin.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The first three chapters of Romans prove that a sinner is known by the sins that he commits.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But Romans 5 tells us what kind of person a sinner actually is.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Once I went to Jian in Kiangsi and one evening met a brother who is a security guard.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He did not believe that I was a preacher and a worker for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Here was a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I am a worker for the Lord and a servant of Christ, but he would not believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Therefore, I had to prove to him that I was one.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I gave him many proofs.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In the end he did believe.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In the same way, we are sinners already.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But this has not been proven to us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The first three chapters of Romans prove that we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>They give us the evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>By showing us that we have sinned in such ways, these chapters prove to us that we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Chapter five says that we are sinners, but the first three chapters prove that we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Let me relate another story.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In Fukien, there were some robbers and kidnappers who had previously been nominal Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Though they were robbers and kidnappers, their consciences were still somewhat exercised; therefore, if they realized that they had kidnapped a pastor or a preacher they would release him without ransom.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>By and by, when some were kidnapped, they said that they were pastors or preachers of such and such a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>What could the robbers do?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>After some time, they came up with a way.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Every time someone said that he was a pastor, the robbers would ask him to recite the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, and the Beatitudes.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Those who could recite them had to be pastors, and so they were let go.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>I heard this story recently and thought that it was very interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If you were a pastor, you had to prove it.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The robbers required that these people prove to them that they were pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In the same way, God wants to prove to us that we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Without proving this to us, we may forget about our true self.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>This is why Romans 1 3 enumerate all those sins.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>It is to show us that we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>After so many facts are presented there, we are proven to be sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Therefore, one should never think that it is the many sins that makes us sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We have been sinners for a long time already.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We do not become sinners after these sins are committed.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We must lay this foundation clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Today you can walk out to the street and meet anyone, and take him by the hand and tell him that he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>If he says that he could not be a sinner because he has not murdered anyone or set fire to anyone's house, you can tell him that he is a sinner who has never murdered anyone or set fire to anyone's house.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>If someone tells you that he never robs or commits fornication, you can tell him that he is a sinner who never robs or commits fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>But no matter whom you meet, you can say that he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>In the whole New Testament, only Romans 5:19 tells us who a sinner is.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>All the other places in the New Testament tell us what the sinner does.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Only this one place tells us who the sinner is.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>A sinner can do a million things, but these do not constitute him a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>As long as he is born in Adam, he is a sinner.</S>
