   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ Becoming Our Sanctification</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before God, our righteousness is not our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But this does not mean that we do not have to care for our conduct while we live on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our righteousness before God is settled, but what should we do about our conduct and living?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must see that God has made Christ not only our righteousness, but our sanctification as well.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This sanctification is not a thing or condition, but a person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God has made Christ our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some Christians have a certain concept about sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They think that sanctification is Christ helping them to be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that they are not holy, but they will become holy through Christ's help.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Corinthians 1:30 tells us that God has made Christ sanctification to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not have to try to be sanctified by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not become sanctified through the help of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ Himself has become our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our sanctification is the person of Christ, not the help of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some Christians think that sanctification is Christ empowering them to become holy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They pray for the Lord to give them strength.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They think that as long as they have the strength, they can be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But God's Word does not say that we can be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It does not say that Christ gives us the strength to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's Word tells us clearly that He has made Christ sanctification to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our sanctification is a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our sanctification is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our sanctification is not the result of a power from God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not have the vision, we will not see the vast difference between these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not something that our mind can comprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do not have the revelation, it is useless even if our mind understands.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God must show us that Christ does not come to help us to become holy; He does not give us the strength to be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, He Himself is our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many Christians believe that there are two things related to sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One is the power of sanctification, and the other is the fruit of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They think that a man must have the power of sanctification before he can bear the fruit of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to this theory, where should we put Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Should Christ be on the side of power, which means that Christ as our power enables us to become sanctified?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yet God's speaking in 1 Corinthians 1:30 is totally different from this theory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ did not come to be our power of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ Himself is our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He did not come to be our power of sanctification to enable us to produce sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He Himself is sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have to shout Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He does not become our power of sanctification, which enables us to produce sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, we have Christ; therefore, we have sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brothers and sisters, if we say that sanctification is a thing, God's Word will tell us that Christ is that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brothers and sisters, our thing is a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our sanctification is a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our thing is Christ; our sanctification is Christ.</S>
