<h2 class="head1">THE INTRINSIC FELLOWSHIP OF THE CHURCHES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Flow of the Divine Life among and through<br />
All the Members of the Organic Body of Christ</h2>
<p>The intrinsic fellowship of the churches is the flow of the divine life among and through all the members of the organic Body of Christ (1 John 1:1-4). First John 1:1-2 says, &ldquo;That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld, and our hands handled concerning the Word of life; and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Word&rdquo; mentioned here is unique, not common. John also uses this term in his Gospel. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; The unique Word was in the beginning. In eternity past, there was the Word. The Word which was in the beginning was with God and was God. The Word in 1 John 1 is the same Word mentioned in John 1. In John&rsquo;s Gospel, he introduced us to this Word. In his Epistle, he refers us back to this same Word, who is God Himself.</p>
<p>This Word is the Word of life. God is life, the Word which is God is life to us, and this life was manifested. This life is the Lord Jesus Christ. When He was manifested in His flesh, He was manifested as life. If we prayerfully consider the record in the four Gospels with all the stories recorded concerning Jesus, we can see that in His human living, life was always manifested. The Lord Jesus was a person who manifested life. The disciples, including John, saw that life. Therefore, John could testify and report to us the eternal life which was with the Father.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John, the Word was God, and the Word became flesh and tabernacled among the disciples (1:14). John is reporting to us that which he saw and heard. He had heard, seen and even handled the Word of life, which is the eternal life. Now he is testifying and reporting to us the eternal life. Then John goes on to say that he reported what he had seen and heard, not that we might have &ldquo;life&rdquo; but that we might have &ldquo;fellowship.&rdquo; First John 1:3 says, &ldquo;That which we have seen and heard we report also to you, that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed the fellowship which is ours is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.&rdquo; At this point John uses another word to replace the word &ldquo;life.&rdquo; They saw and heard life, and they reported life, but it was for a strong purpose. John was saying, &ldquo;We report to you life with the strong purpose that you may have fellowship with us.&rdquo; This is the &ldquo;fellowship which is ours.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ours&rdquo; refers to the apostles. The fellowship which is &ldquo;ours,&rdquo; the apostles&rsquo; fellowship, is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. They report the Son as life to us that we may share this fellowship with them. Then in 1 John 1:4, John says, &ldquo;These things we write that our joy may be made full.&rdquo; The apostles would be happy to see that the believers would have what they have. What they have is fellowship with the Father and the Son. If the believers participate in this fellowship, they will be happy.</p>
<p>There are three major points we need to see when we study the significance of fellowship in the first four verses of 1 John 1. First, fellowship is something of the divine life. Second, this fellowship is the apostles&rsquo; fellowship. Third, the apostles expected to see that the believers would share in this fellowship. When we say that this fellowship is something of life, we mean that it is the flow of the divine life. It is the issue of the eternal life and is actually the flow of the eternal life within all the believers who have received and possess the divine life.</p>
<p>The divine life flows. At the conclusion of the Bible, the last chapter of Revelation gives us quite a meaningful picture. There is the throne of God and of the Lamb (Rev. 22:1). Out of this throne proceeds a current, a flow, which is the flow of the water of life, and this flow is a river. When a flow becomes a river, it is a very strong flow. The river in Revelation is the river of water of life (Rev. 22:1).</p>
<p>The last two chapters of Revelation present a picture of the New Jerusalem, a foursquare city which is a high mountain, twelve thousand stadia high (Rev. 21:16-17). There are three gates on each of the four sides of the city (Rev. 21:12-13). At the top of the mountain is the throne of God and of the Lamb. A river flows out from the throne and reaches every part of the city because it spirals down the mountain from the throne and passes by all twelve gates of the city. There is only one river, flowing in the one street (22:1) and watering every part of the city. Since the river is a spiral, it will pass through everywhere in the holy city, no matter where you are in it. This is a physical picture showing us the invisible things of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Today God is on the throne. Surely, He is on the throne in the heavens, but if the throne were just in the heavens, it would be too far for us to reach. Hebrews 4:16 charges us to &ldquo;come forward with boldness to the throne of grace.&rdquo; If the throne of grace were so far away, we could not reach it during our morning watch with the Lord. When we come to the Lord in the morning, however, we can touch Him on the throne of grace right away. This is because the throne is not only in the heavens but also in our spirit (see note 1 on Hebrews 4:16, Recovery Version). A river flows out of the throne. Within us there is a river that not only flows but also spirals to reach every part of our being. According to the picture in Revelation, the river flows to reach all twelve gates of the entire city. This river of water of life is the fellowship of the divine life which John speaks of in his first Epistle.</p>
<p>It may help us to understand this fellowship, this flow of the divine life, if we consider the circulation of blood in our human body. There is only one circulation of blood in our body, and it reaches every member of our body. No member of our physical body is independently autonomous of the other members. All the members of the body participate in the one blood circulation. There are many members, but only one flow of blood. The intrinsic element of the human body is its blood. This circulation of blood in our human body is a picture of the intrinsic fellowship in the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Whatever the church is, is intrinsic. It cannot be divided. The essence of the church is intrinsic, its growth is intrinsic, and its building up is intrinsic. Furthermore, the fellowship of the churches is also intrinsic, just as the blood circulation within our body is intrinsic. The local churches as the unique, organic Body of Christ, cannot be separately autonomous since they participate in the one intrinsic fellowship, the one flow of the divine life.</p>
<p>If our physical body were divided into autonomies, we would be good for nothing but a funeral. The members of our physical body are not autonomous, nor are they federated together. The United States of America may be considered as an organized federation of fifty states. Our government is a federal government. The fifty states are not divided but federated together as one nation. The church, however, is neither autonomous nor federated because the church is not organized like a country. The church is the universal Body of Christ, an organism.</p>
<p>Our physical body is a picture of the Body of Christ (Rom. 12:4-5). Our body has only one head, yet there are many members under this one head. All the members have only one head, and according to the blood circulation with the nerves, every member is connected to the head directly. The blood circulation, however, does not reach the members directly. It must flow through other members. The picture we need to see is that the blood circulation in our body is intrinsically one. In like manner, the fellowship, the flow of life in the Body of Christ, is intrinsically and uniquely one. The flow of blood in our physical body is a good illustration of the fellowship, the flow of the divine life.</p>
<p>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were brought into this fellowship. When we called on the name of the Lord, we may say that the Spirit came into us, that God came into us, or that the divine life came into us. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we received Him into us, and He is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). The Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God, and the Triune God is the divine life. The One who is now in us is the divine life, which is the Triune God, who is the Spirit and who is Jesus Christ. The divine, eternal life is a person, Jesus Christ. This One is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), and this life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God. The consummation of the Triune God is within us as the divine life, and this divine life is flowing within us all the time. He is flowing within you, within me, and within all the members of His great, universal Body. Within His universal Body is one flow, the flow of the divine life, the current of the water of life. The water is the divine life, and the divine life is the Triune God. The Triune God flows!</p>
<p>The first stanza of <em>Hymns,</em> #12 says:</p>
<p class="hbody">O God, Thou art the source of life,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divine, and rich and free!<br />
As living water flowing out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto eternity!</p>
<p>God is a flowing river who flows in all His chosen and redeemed believers. This flow is the fellowship of the divine life. According to 2 Corinthians 13:14, this is the fellowship within the Triune God. This verse says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; The Father is the source as love. Out of this love, grace comes forth through the Son. This grace through the Son reaches us as the fellowship of the Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God. The love of God in the grace of Christ becomes the fellowship, the flow, of the Holy Spirit. This fellowship has been neglected and even ignored by many Christians. Very few Christians know this flow. If you know this flow, you are greatly blessed.</p>
