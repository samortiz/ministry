<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Cherishing the Parents by Laying His Hands on Their Children</H2><P>When His disciples rejected people bringing their children to Him, He stopped their preventing and asked them to bring the children to Him, and He cherished the parents by laying His hands on their children (19:13-15). The disciples' preventing surely offended the parents. Quite often we are preventing people instead of cherishing people. The Lord stopped the disciples' preventing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In the Gospel of Luke</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Cherishing People with the Words of Grace Proceeding out of His Mouth</H2><P>Christ as the Man-Savior came to a synagogue in Nazareth and read a portion from Isaiah that says, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to announce the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to send away in release those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, the year of jubilee," to cherish people with the words of grace proceeding out of His mouth (4:16-22). If we were the Lord, we might have read the law from Exodus 20 to the people instead of the jubilee of grace from Isaiah 61. To read the law to them would have condemned them. Instead, the Lord read a portion from Isaiah to them to cherish them with the words of grace proceeding out of His mouth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Eating and Drinking with the Tax Collectors and Sinners</H2><P>Christ as the Son of Man came to eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners, even as their friend, to cherish them that they might be nourished by Him with His redemption and salvation (7:34). The Pharisees criticized the Lord for this, but His making friends with these sinful people was to lay the foundation so that He could nourish them with His redemption and salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Cherishing Zaccheus</H2><P>Christ as the Son of Man went to Jericho, passed by the tree from which Zaccheus was expecting to see Him, and looked up and said to him, "Zaccheus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay in your house," in order to cherish him that He might nourish him with His salvation (19:1-10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. In the Gospel of John</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Cherishing Nathanael</H2><P>When Christ as the God-Savior was recognized by Nathanael as the Son of God, He answered him that he would see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on Him as the Son of Man, like the heavenly ladder seen by Jacob in his dream, as a kind of cherishing to encourage Nathanael to follow Him that he might participate in His nourishment with all the divine benefits as revealed in the entire Gospel of John (1:45-51).</P><P>Christ in His humanity is the standing ladder. The ark with the tabernacle, built of acacia wood overlaid with gold, is also a type of Christ. Acacia wood signifies Christ's humanity, and gold signifies Christ's divinity. This wood is the standing part; the gold is the overlaying part. To stand we need to be human in resurrection. Jesus became the ladder not by His divinity but by His humanity, not by Him as the Son of God but by Him as the Son of Man. He is the heavenly ladder, the uplifted stairway, to bring heaven to earth and to join earth to heaven for the building of the house of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Cherishing an Immoral Woman of Samaria</H2><P>When Christ as the God-Savior wanted to save an immoral woman of Samaria, He had to travel from Judea to Galilee through Samaria and detoured from the main way of Samaria to the city of Sychar, and He waited at the well of Jacob, near Sychar, for His object to come that He might cherish her by asking her to give Him something to drink so that He might nourish her with the water of life, which is the flowing Triune God Himself (4:1-14). On His way to Galilee, Christ had to detour to a city in Samaria to cherish an immoral woman. He waited at the well of Jacob for her to come in order to cherish her so that she could be nourished with the living water of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Cherishing an Adulterous Woman</H2><P>When none of the accusing Pharisees could condemn the adulterous woman, Christ as the God-Savior, in His humanity, said to her, "Neither do I condemn you," to cherish her that He, as the great I Am, might nourish her with the freedom from sin and enable her to "sin no more" (8:3-11, 24, 34-36). Christ is the divine, great "I Am," who can set people free from sin.</P>
