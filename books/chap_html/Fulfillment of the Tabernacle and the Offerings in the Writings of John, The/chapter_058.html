<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN NINETEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 19:1-42</h1><p>In this message we shall continue to consider the signs in chapter nineteen of the Gospel of John.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE LORD’S BEHAVIOR IN PASSING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF DEATH</h2><p>If we pay attention to the details as we read this chapter, we shall see that from the time Pilate scourged the Lord Jesus until the time He stopped breathing and gave up the spirit, there was a process. As He passed through this process, the Lord behaved Himself in a way that is significant. His behavior in passing through the terrifying process of death is a sign that He is life and resurrection.<p>Using the present tense, the Lord said to Martha in 11:25, “I am the resurrection and the life.” When I read this verse many years ago, I was bothered by the fact that the Lord Jesus put resurrection before life. Furthermore, He used the definite article before both life and resurrection. In this verse the Lord says that He is the resurrection and the life. Even before He was resurrected from among the dead, He already was resurrection. If we read chapter nineteen carefully, we shall see that the One who passed through the process of death was a person who is resurrection and life.<p>The fact that the Lord Jesus had no fear of death is an indication that He passed through the process of death as the One who Himself is resurrection and life. In chapter nineteen we cannot find any trace of the fear of death with the Lord Jesus. The reason He was not afraid of death is that He is resurrection. If He had been afraid of death, then He would no longer have been the resurrection and the life. Because the Lord is the resurrection and the life, in His behavior as described in John 19 there is nothing of the fear of death.<h2 class=head2>Willingly Suffering Pilate’s Scourging</h2><p>John 19:1 says, “Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged Him.” The Lord Jesus did not do anything to avoid Pilate’s scourging. He did not walk away or turn away. Instead, He willingly suffered this scourging. Because He is the resurrection and the life, death could not affect Him in any way.<h2 class=head2>Quietly Accepting the Insulting Mocking</h2><p>After the Lord Jesus had been scourged by Pilate, He was mocked by the soldiers: “The soldiers, having plaited a crown out of thorns, put it on His head, and threw around Him a purple garment. And they came to Him and said, Hail, King of the Jews! And they slapped Him in the face” (vv. 2-3). The soldiers mocked the Lord Jesus when they put the thorn crown and the purple garment on Him, but He accepted their mocking.<p>We should not think that the Lord was weak in quietly accepting the insulting mocking of the soldiers. No, He certainly was not weak. Actually, He was strong. The fact that He could withstand this mocking indicates that He was strong. As the One who is the resurrection and the life, He could withstand this mocking.<h2 class=head2>Boldly Facing the Threat of Death</h2><p>According to 19:7, the Jews said to Pilate that according to their law the Lord Jesus deserved to die “because he made himself Son of God.” When Pilate heard this word, he was afraid and asked the Lord Jesus where He was from (vv. 8-9). Roman rulers were known to be superstitious and fearful of so-called gods and spirits. Hence, when Pilate was told about Jesus’ being the Son of God, he was afraid and asked the Lord concerning His place of origin. However, the Lord Jesus did not answer him (v. 9). Pilate then said to the Lord, “You do not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you, and I have authority to crucify you?” (v. 10). Here Pilate was threatening the Lord with death. But not being afraid of this death threat, the Lord answered, “You would have no authority against Me in anything unless it were given you from above; therefore, he who delivered Me to you has the greater sin” (v. 11).<p>Here we see that because the Lord is the resurrection and the life, He was bold in facing the threat of death. If we had been on trial before Pilate, we probably would have been fearful and said, “Sir, let me tell you that I’m an honest person. I would not do anything to damage you. I beg you to release me.” The Lord Jesus, on the contrary, was not at all afraid of offending Pilate.
