<p>In addition to learning to coordinate and learning skills, the workers must learn to be flexible in their work. Sometimes the workers are rigid and cannot accommodate others. The medicine that a doctor prescribes for a patient can be taken in different ways. The medicine can be injected into the patient, or it can be taken as a pill, as powder, or as a solution. The same medication can be dispensed in many ways. Similarly, our labor should not be rigid. We should consider the situation and be able to adapt.</p>
<p>We should not say, for example, that we cannot do anything because the saints do not want our help in a particular matter. For example, we should not be helpless if the saints do not want to study the Bible. Some people are able to receive an injection, but others are frightened as soon as they see a needle. They may need to take the medication orally. We need to be flexible. If it is difficult to lead the saints to study the Bible on their own, we should speak something concerning the Bible to stir up their interest. We can also ask questions related to the Bible. We should be willing to try different ways.</p>
<p>The character of a worker should be strong yet pliable. It is regrettable that some workers are stubborn and have a strong disposition. They always do what they want to do. Once they decide to do something, they cannot be changed. They desire to impart the Lord into others, but they are strict and inflexible in their way. Every mother must learn to feed her children and not force them to eat.</p>
<p>I enjoy helping the young saints and the older saints. I would never say that I am here to help only the young people and will not work with the older saints. We must serve the Lord even if there are no young people. We need to help and supply all the saints, whether they are old or young.</p>
<p>We should not require others to accommodate us, neither should we demand that the environment cooperate with us. Rather, we should be flexible to work in any environment and to fit in with the local situation. Even if the local saints do not seem like suitable material and are barely alive, we need to supply them and enable them to rise up. Those who serve the Lord need such a spirit. The workers who have this spirit are effective. They grasp every opportunity to labor. When there are many opportunities, we need to consider which is the best or which requires the most attention. If there is a group of young people longing to be supplied, we should grasp the opportunity to supply them. This is to be flexible. Some workers are so rigid that they are willing to supply only the older saints. The younger saints may express a desire to be supplied, but these workers will supply only the older saints.</p>
<p>A worker of the Lord must be flexible and lively. For example, a successful businessman, who is occupied with making a profit, cannot easily be offended. He does not have time to complain. If he has an opportunity to make a profit, he will do business since he cares only about making a profit. This is the way that we should labor. We should always endeavor to impart something into the saints and help them.</p>
<p>A worker who wants to coordinate with the local brothers must learn to be strict with himself and not blame the brothers. He must not, for example, say that he cannot work in a place because the local saints do not accept his fellowship concerning the cross. Neither should he say that he cannot work in a place because he wants to preach the gospel, but the local saints do not have a gospel spirit. Instead, he should say that he cannot work in a place because he does not know how to coordinate with others.</p>
<p>I cannot defend a brother who says that he is unable to work in a place because the saints are difficult. His complaining shows that he still has lessons to learn. We have heard messages concerning the discipline of the Holy Spirit. We should accept the situations that we encounter as the discipline of the Holy Spirit and learn from them. We should consider the reason that it is difficult to coordinate with the saints, and the reason that the saints do not respond to our work. This is the discipline of the Holy Spirit so that we can learn the lesson of the cross and can coordinate with others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING NOT TO HAVE OPINIONS</h2>
<p>Everyone has opinions. No one can claim that he does not have opinions. However, as long as we have opinions about any place or person, we have not learned the necessary lessons. When we learn the lessons, we will not have opinions about the brothers and sisters living in the workers&rsquo; home or about the church service. Instead, we will be in harmony with the saints.</p>
<p>Arguing with the brothers shows that we need to learn the lesson of not having opinions. I have learned this lesson. I have encountered opinionated brothers, ill-tempered brothers, and difficult brothers. The Lord put me with these brothers, and by His mercy I do not have opinions, nor do I complain. I know only to learn the lesson.</p>
<p>If we are willing to receive this word and learn the lessons that we need in order to coordinate with others, to be flexible, and to not have opinions, we will be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand and gain spiritual weight. Our inability to coordinate with others proves that we still need to learn some lessons. If our work is not effective, it means that we are not flexible. We should not have opinions about anyone or anything in the work.</p>
<p>These may seem to be small matters, but they are serious. If we cannot coordinate with the local brothers or the local saints, we cannot coordinate with our fellow workers. If our work is ineffective in one place, it will be ineffective in every place, and if we are in discord with the brothers in one locality, we will be in discord with the brothers in every place. This is a serious test.</p>
<p>If we do not want to serve the Lord, we can ignore these matters. However, if we want to serve the Lord, we must learn these practical lessons. Then we will be able to coordinate with any brother. We will also be able to be one with any brother, regardless of how quarrelsome and troublesome he may be. We will not murmur. Then we will have the Lord&rsquo;s blessing, no matter where we are or what we do. Moreover, our work will have real spiritual weight.</p>
<p>Some may consider this as a matter of being broken. But instead of stressing being broken, I would rather speak of learning the lessons. We need to learn these lessons. Over the years many brothers and sisters have learned these lessons, and as a result, they have genuine spiritual growth. However, we still have more to learn.</p>
<p>There are two more matters that require our attention. One is the effectiveness of our work, and the other is the messages that we give from the podium. Some brothers are capable, but their work has no effect. We need to pray and look to the Lord to find out the reason and make any necessary adjustments. Similarly, some brothers can give good messages, but there is no effect. We must also seek the Lord concerning this to find out the reason. Every good tree produces good fruit. A tree that does not produce fruit is not a bad tree, but there is something wrong with it. May we all learn to solve the problems so that the Lord&rsquo;s work can have a clear and free way among us.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> </body></html>
