   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NEW TESTAMENT EXAMPLES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF DEALING WITH THE PAST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What then should we do with the things of our past?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In reading the New Testament, I have spent much time to find out how one should terminate his past after believing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I found only a few passages where the subject is mentioned briefly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, they are not teachings but examples.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A. Matters Related to Idols</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Needing to Be Dealt with Thoroughly</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First Thessalonians 1:9 says, "You turned to God from the idols."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a person believes in the Lord, he must deal with all idols.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Please remember that we are the temple of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What agreement does the temple of God have with idols?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even the apostle John, in addressing the believers, said, "Little children, guard yourselves from idols" 1 John 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, this is not as simple a matter as many may think.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One thing we must take note of is that God forbids man to make an image of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We cannot consider a man-made object to be living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The moment we have such a thought, the object becomes an idol to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Of course, idols are nothing, but if we consider them to be living, we fall into error.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is why God forbids the worship of such things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even an inclination in the heart towards them is forbidden.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One of the Ten Commandments forbids the making of idols Deut 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Deuteronomy 12:30 says, "Be careful...lest you seek after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This shows us that we should not even inquire how the Gentiles worship their gods.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some who are curious like to study how the nations worship and serve their gods.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But God forbids us to inquire about such matters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we inquire about them, the next thing we will do is worship their gods.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, we are forbidden from being curious.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Second Corinthians 6:16 says, "What agreement does the temple of God have with idols?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The meaning here is quite obvious.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christians should not visit temples.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are exceptions of course, such as when a person is stranded on a deserted mountain and cannot find a place for shelter at night and there is only a temple for lodging.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But generally speaking, believers should not visit any temple.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is because 2 Corinthians 6:16 says clearly that we are the temple of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It also says that there is no agreement between idols and the temple of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Unless one is pressed by special occasion or circumstance, it is inadvisable to go near or purposely tour any temple.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>John says, "Little children, guard yourselves from idols."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Guarding ourselves from idols means staying away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Psalm 16:4 says, "Nor will I take up their names upon My lips."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even at the pulpit, we should carefully avoid the names of other gods except in the case of a necessary illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not hold on to any superstition, fear of misfortune, or taboo for certain associations or words.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many believers still pay attention to fortunes, the reading of facial features, and destinies.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Everything related to fortune-telling or horoscopes is prohibited.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Everything in the realm of idolatry should be dealt with thoroughly before God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should sever our relationship with it completely.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A new believer must give up his idols from the very first day of his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He should not mention the names of idols, be involved with fortune-telling, or visit any temples.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We cannot worship anything with an image.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even the thought of worshipping such things is forbidden.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We cannot inquire about the worship of other religions.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All these things belong to the past, and we should deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Anything that falls into these categories should be destroyed; they should not even be sold.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should destroy, exterminate, and remove them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I hope that new believers will not take this matter lightly; they have to be very careful about these things, for God is extremely jealous of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you cannot take a strong stand against idols today, you will have a hard time escaping the greatest idol on earth in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Of course, we should not worship idols made of clay or wood.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But even if there is an idol that is living, we must not worship it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There are actually living idols the man of lawlessness 2 Thes 2:3 being one.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Please remember that you cannot worship any idols; you must reject all of them, even images of the Lord Jesus and Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must deal with this matter thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Otherwise, we will be distracted to follow another way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are those who serve not in the flesh but in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God is seeking those who serve Him in spirit, not in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God is Spirit, not an image.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If all the brothers and sisters take care of this matter, they will not fall into the hands of Roman Catholicism in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>One day Antichrist will come, and the power of Roman Catholicism will be greatly expanded.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the Bible, the first thing one has to do in dealing with his past is to reject all former idols.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must turn away from idols and wait for the coming of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should not even keep any picture of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Such pictures are not the real image of the Lord Jesus; they are worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the museums in Rome, there are over two thousand different images of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All of them represent the imagination of the artists.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In some countries artists often look for people who resemble their idea of Jesus and then pay them to pose for portraits of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is blasphemous.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Our God is a jealous God, and He will not tolerate such things among us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There should not be any kind of superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Some people like to say, "It is not a good day today; there are bad omens."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Such remarks are directly from hell.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God's children should get rid of these ideas from the very first day and deal with them in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They should not allow any flavor of idolatry to come in.</S>
