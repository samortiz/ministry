   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EATING JESUS BEING OUR ETERNAL PORTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we can see that there is no other way to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The unique way is eating.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to eat Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eating is the unique matter in the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible starts with the eating of the tree of life, and it ends with the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the New Jerusalem in the last chapter of the Bible, out of the throne of God flows a river, and on either side of the river grows the tree of life, producing fruits every month to supply the need of all the people of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Revelation 22:14 says, "Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter by the gates into the city."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our eternal right is to eat the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many Christians are happy that their robes have been washed, but they do not realize that the washing of the robes is for eating the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is our eternal portion and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>EATING JESUS BEING THE REVELATION OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jesus is sweet, precious, enjoyable, and available.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The day that I came to know that I can eat Jesus, everything changed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first time I came to this country, in 1958, I was invited to speak to a group in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That was the first time I gave a message in English.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My message was on eating Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That was the first time I told people in this country that they need to enjoy Jesus by eating Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After that message, some persons came to me and said, "Brother Lee, this is a good thought, but we wish to help you to use the proper words to express it."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since this was the first time I had given a message in English, I admitted that I needed some improvement, and I asked them to help me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They said it is better not to use the phrase eat Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, they could not find a better phrase.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To eat is simply to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What word can we use?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Any other word will still mean "to eat."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually I told them, "Brothers, do not try to find a better word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus Himself used this word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In John 6:57 He said, He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.'</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is good enough."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They argued that this is not good English, but no one could find a better English word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This troubling is absolutely due to the old concept.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not regulate the revelation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, our concept needs to be regulated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eating Jesus is not my teaching; this is the teaching of the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus is our eternal portion not merely for us to learn about but mainly to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have been eating food over sixty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today, I do not know what vitamin C and vitamin D are; I only know their names.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I do not know much about vitamins, but daily I take in many vitamins.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must simply eat Jesus and not care for knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>OVERCOMING BY EATING JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may be assured that by eating the Lord Jesus we will be overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to my age, I may be a grandfather, but I am younger than many young people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They are not as living as I am.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am younger than they, not by myself but by Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Jesus is so living!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In my speaking some may think that I am "crazy," but in my private room I am more "crazy" with Jesus, because my Jesus is enjoyable.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I cannot help myself; I have to be crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>My Jesus is the living Jesus, not a doctrinal Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>My power, my message, and my impact is my enjoyment of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can never return to the old Christianity because our Jesus is too enjoyable.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Simply by eating Jesus we will be the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We will overcome the world, the degraded situation of Christianity, and all the teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We will declare, "We do not care for teachings; we only care for our Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yes, I read the Bible, but I do not read it for knowledge; I read it for enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I may pray-read the beginning of Matthew 1: "Abraham begot Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Isaac begot Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Amen!"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I may not know all about Abraham and Isaac, but oh, the enjoyment I have!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Bible is no more a book of knowledge to me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is no more a tree of knowledge; it is the tree of life, a book of life, a book of the living Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>By enjoying Jesus in this way, we become the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then to be sure, we will try our best to find where there are other Christians like us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We will be anxious to have fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This produces the church life, and eventually out of this comes the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>By the Lord's mercy, the overcomers are the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We know that the man-child in Revelation 12 is the overcomers because verse 5 says that the man-child will shepherd all the nations with an iron rod.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is similar to 2:26 and 27, which says, "He who overcomes and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations; and he will shepherd them with an iron rod."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The overcomers are the man-child, and the man-child is the overcomers.</S>
