   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. The Flourishing Riches of Christ's Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Flowers appear on the earth;/The time of singing has come,/And the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>/The fig tree has ripened its figs,/And the vines are in blossom they give forth their fragrance" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>12-13a .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here "flowers," "singing," "voice of the turtledove," "blossom," and "fragrance" indicate the flourishing riches of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All these are signs of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we sing, we are in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever our mouth is closed, we are in winter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>F. Christ's Eagerness in Asking</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His Lover to Get Away from Her Introspection</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>of the Self to Be with Him</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Rise up, my love,/My beauty, and come away" v. 13b . This repeated word indicates Christ's eagerness in asking His lover to get away from her introspection of the self to be with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, it is not easy for one to come out of introspection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is very difficult to help a brother or sister who is introspective.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sometimes it takes a year or more before such a one can be helped to get away from the introspection of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>CALLED TO BE IN ONENESS WITH THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verses 14 and 15 the lover is called to be in oneness with the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whereas in the New Testament we have a clear word concerning the cross, in Song of Songs the cross is signified by figures of speech.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A. Christ Wanting to See</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His Lover's Lovely Countenance and Hear</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Her Sweet Voice in Her Oneness with the Cross</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"My dove, in the clefts of the rock,/In the covert of the precipice,/Let me see your countenance,/Let me hear your voice;/For your voice is sweet,/And your countenance is lovely" v. 14 . Here Christ, considering her His simple lover My dove , wants to see His lover's lovely countenance and hear her sweet voice in her oneness, union, with the cross the clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice . Here we see Christ's call for His lover to be in oneness with the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This point on the cross is the central stress in this section on deliverance from the self.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If I had been the lover, I might have said, "My beloved, I cannot get to the clefts of the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The clefts are too high and the way is too rugged.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not have enough power to go there."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But here Christ was indicating to His lover that she could enter into the experience of the cross by the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The objective cross must become our subjective experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to get into the cross and the cross must get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this way we and the cross become one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our oneness with the cross is our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To be delivered from the self means to be saved from the self through becoming one with the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every day we should be conformed to Christ's death by the power of His resurrection Phil 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without the oneness with the cross, we cannot be delivered from the self.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I appreciate the chorus of the hymn which says, "Through the Cross, O Lord, I pray,/Put my soul-life all away;/Make me any price to pay,/Full anointing to receive" Hymns, #279 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to be willing to pay the price to enter into the subjective experience of the cross.</S>
