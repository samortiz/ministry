   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST BECOMING OUR WISDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us look at 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 1:30: "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I myself received much help from this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of God are we in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not only so, God has made Christ our wisdom,...etc. We think that though we are not too brilliant, if we study more books, read more of the Bible, and listen to more sermons, we will be more intelligent.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But this is not what God says.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has made Christ our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Wisdom is tied to Christ again.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He becomes man's wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We say that we are unrighteous and that we cannot see God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But what does this verse say?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God has made Christ our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we can face God as if we were sinless.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We think that we are too corrupted; our thoughts are unclean; we are proud and always lie.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have no holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet God has made Christ our holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He can be transmitted into us through Christ to be our holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many have experienced that had it not been for Christ, there would absolutely have been no holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Concerning salvation, a part of it touches the future.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We will not mention it now.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At any rate we can see that Christ is our wisdom, righteousness, holiness, and salvation from beginning to end.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>BEGOTTEN AND GROWING IN HIM</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First Corinthians 3:1: "And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the Scripture, it doesn't matter what your physical age is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What matters is your stature in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This measure is again one that is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First Corinthians 4:15: "For though you have ten thousand guides in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only in Christ can someone be regenerated and begotten by the gospel.</S>
