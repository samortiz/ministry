   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO A DAILY LIVING UNDER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LEADING BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The matter of the leading by the Spirit of God has been misunderstood by most Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our understanding is still unconsciously under the influence of our background.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We all came from that region where the understanding of the matter of the leading of the Spirit was mostly natural.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Very little of that understanding was spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Recently I admired some wonderful testimonies concerning the leading by the Spirit of God, but at the same time I had the deep sensation that they were wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They were very good, but they were wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Your understanding of the leading by the Spirit of God is still wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is wrong in this aspect: you consider that the leading by the Spirit is a matter for activities, for actions, or for business.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What many call the leading of the Spirit is actually a kind of performance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In seeking the Lord s leading you are a kind of dramatic performer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You are not Peter, but you are performing as if you were Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You are not Mary, but you are performing as if you were Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The real Peter did not perform; he just lived.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He simply lived that way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That was his being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whatever he did was not merely his activities, but his living.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE LEADING BY THE SPIRIT FOR OUR DAILY LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Romans 8 the matter of the leading by the Spirit is a conclusion of so many points.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not one among many items.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, it is the totality of those many items.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is the conclusion of all those previously mentioned items in verses 1-13.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>So it is a great thing!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Romans 8 there is no hint that the leading by the Spirit is related to activities or works or actions or business.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is altogether related to our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>An actor is one who lives one way but performs another way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He may be a young man in his living, but he is performing as if he is an old man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you would apply this principle of acting or performing to your way of seeking the Lord s leading, you could see that in the past it was like this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You didn t live that way, but when the occasion came up and you needed to do something or to face a situation, you sought the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This kind of leading is not your daily living; it is your acting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>PHILIP S LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some might argue that certain instances in Acts indicate that the early Apostles received the Lord s leading for activities.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, there is the case of Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch Acts 8:26-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After baptizing the eunuch, the Holy Spirit caught Philip away.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You might ask, Was that not the Lord s leading?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yes, that was the Lord s leading, but you have to realize that all the day long Philip was under the Spirit s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For him to be caught away by the Spirit was not an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That was his living.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was all the time under the leading of the Spirit, so he didn t need to seek after the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was living minute by minute in his daily walk in the leading by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The leading by the Spirit was his living.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was taken to the eunuch by the Spirit, and he was also caught away by the Spirit,</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>PETER S LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then you might ask about Peter s case in Acts 10.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By the vision that he saw in his trance, he realized that he had to go to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You might ask, Was that not a leading for Peter s activity?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I would say no. Rather, Peter all the day long was living and walking in the spirit, and he simply went to the housetop to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He lived that way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For him to go to the housetop at his prayer time proves that way was his living.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>While he was living in that way the vision came.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>So it was not a leading for his activity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>PAUL S LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Acts 16 is an example of another person who was altogether living and even dreaming under the leading by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>While Paul was traveling, the Spirit within was forbidding and prohibiting.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was always living under the leading by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He was a person living by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He was not led by the Spirit to have some kind of activity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The New Testament ministry according to 2 Corinthians 2 is not carried out by activities, but by the ministers of the New Testament in their living.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They are captives in the triumphal procession of Christ 2 Cor 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They live a captive life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Paul considered his ministry a life of a captive in the triumphal procession.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>So whatever he did was not a kind of activity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It was just a kind of living.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To Paul, his traveling about was not a kind of activity.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To Paul it was just the leading by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It was the way Paul lived.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you don t live day after day and hour after hour under the leading by the Spirit, when the time comes for you to make a decision, then you must perform.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Not only must you perform, you must even try to force the Spirit to perform with you.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whatever comes out of that kind of situation will not be a part of your living.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It will be just an activity because in your daily life you are not so one with the Spirit.</S>
