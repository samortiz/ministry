Resulting in Rebellion</H2><P>According to the type of the kingdom found in Genesis, the kingdom issued in the rebellion at Babel. Now, in the fulfillment of the kingdom in Revelation 20, we see the real rebellion. Can you believe that after a thousand years of heavenly ruling under the kingship of Christ in restoration (Acts 3:21) there could be such a rebellion? But the fulfillment in both the type and the reality is the same. The result is rebellion.</P><P>Many Christian teachers say that as long as the Lord returns everything will be all right. I strongly say that this is not so. Even after the Lord returns, the rebellious nature is still in man. Even after the restoration during the thousand years, the rebellious human nature will still be in man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) Satan Loosed to Expose Man's Rebellious Nature</H2><P>At the end of the thousand years, Satan will be loosed out of his prison (Rev. 20:7). Why will God allow Satan to be loosed? Satan will be set free to expose the hidden rebellious nature in mankind. Revelation 20:8 speaks of Gog and Magog. If you look at a biblical map, you can realize that Gog and Magog are in the north of the earth. The tendency of the human race today indicates this rebellion. Even after a thousand years of heavenly ruling, the rebellious nature will still be in man. Therefore, God will loose Satan from his prison to expose the rebellion in man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) Both Man and Satan Judged by God</H2><P>After that rebellion, God will come and exercise His judgment over both man and Satan. That judgment will clear away the rebellious nature of mankind.</P><P>We should not learn about the kingdom as a doctrine. We all must see where we are today. We are in the church life under the heavenly ruling. Now we need to be in resurrection and to live and walk according to the spirit that we may have the reality of the kingdom among us.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_227.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_229.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Genesis &nbsp; pg 228</div><br></body></html>
