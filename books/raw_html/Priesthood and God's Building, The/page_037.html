<h1 class="title">BEING PRIESTS TO ACCOMPLISH GOD&rsquo;S PLAN</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PRIESTS BEING THE ONES<br />
TO ACCOMPLISH GOD&rsquo;S PLAN</h2>
<p>God needs priests in order to accomplish His eternal plan. Of the three offices&mdash;the priesthood, the kingship, and the prophethood&mdash;mentioned in the Scriptures, the most important in terms of the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s plan is the priesthood. It is not enough just to be a king, because if a king does not live according to the principles of the priesthood, he will not be a proper king. This is also true of prophets. A proper prophet should be a priest in principle.</p>
<p>In addition to these three offices, the Bible uses many terms to refer to God&rsquo;s people, such as the <em>children of God</em> and <em>servants of God. Priests,</em> however, is an all-inclusive term. <em>Priests</em> includes the aspects of being God&rsquo;s servants as well as His people and His children. The Bible shows that the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s plan depends upon priests, because priests are the only people who can accomplish God&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PLAN BEING ACCOMPLISHED<br />
WITH THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH MAN</h2>
<p>The first two chapters of Genesis and the last two chapters of Revelation present two descriptive pictures, which are the &ldquo;blueprint&rdquo; of God&rsquo;s plan. Although the Bible speaks of God&rsquo;s plan throughout its pages, the two clearest pictures of God&rsquo;s plan are presented at the beginning and at the end of the Bible. These chapters show the &ldquo;blueprint&rdquo; of God&rsquo;s plan, whereas the remaining portions of the Bible speak of the process through which God accomplishes His plan. Hence, if we want to understand God&rsquo;s plan, we must look at the pictures at the beginning and at the end of the Bible. These two pictures show that God desires to work Himself into man in order that man would express His image and represent His authority. In order to fulfill this plan, God needs to be joined and mingled with man.</p>
<p>The most mysterious and central revelation in the Bible is that God is willing to be joined with man as one. The Word becoming flesh is God&rsquo;s coming to mingle Himself with man (John 1:14). The Word is God, and the flesh is man. The Word becoming flesh means that God became a man, and it also means that God is mingled with man. One of the main points concerning the Lord&rsquo;s birth in Bethlehem is that a Savior was born (Luke 2:11). The most important point, however, is that God and man were mingled together. When the Word became flesh, the One who was begotten was called Emmanuel, God with us, that is, God with man (Matt. 1:23). The Lord, who was born, is God as well as man, man as well as God.</p>
<p>The central thought in the Bible is that God desires to be mingled with man and for man to be mingled with God. Without God, man has no meaning. Similarly, without man, God is not satisfied. If God and man exist apart from one another, the universe will be without full meaning. The full meaning of the universe is revealed in the mingling of God with man.</p>
<p>An unbeliever tends to feel that life has no meaning, because he is a man without God; that is, there is no element of God in him. In contrast, a believer feels that human life is meaningful, bright, joyous, and promising, because God has entered into him and has been mingled with him. We all experienced this mingling when we were saved, but we did not have a full comprehension of what happened. It is similar to receiving the benefit of taking a vitamin tablet without knowing the ingredients of the tablet. We are much clearer now about the mingling of God with man. Therefore, we can say with assurance that the meaning of human life and the satisfaction of God&rsquo;s heart depend upon the mingling of God with man. Mingling is the basic condition that enables God&rsquo;s plan to be accomplished. Man can express God&rsquo;s image only when God and man are mingled, and man can represent God and bear God&rsquo;s authority only when God and man are mingled.</p>
<p>The pictures at the beginning of Genesis and at the end of Revelation also reveal that God&rsquo;s desire is not related to scattered individuals but to a corporate man. According to the type in Genesis 2, Eve is Adam&rsquo;s corporate counterpart. At the end of Revelation, the bride of the Lamb is also a corporate counterpart, the New Jerusalem. A city signifies a corporate entity because a city is a corporate entity of people who congregate together. These pictures show that God desires to gain a corporate entity, not scattered individuals.</p>
<p>The first time that the Bible speaks of the Word becoming flesh is in John 1:14, which says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; This verse refers not only to the mingling of God with man but also to a corporate expression of this mingling, because the Word who became flesh is also spoken of as a tabernacle. A tabernacle cannot be built with only one piece of building material; it has to be built with many pieces. The Lord also referred to Himself as a temple (2:19-21). The Word who became flesh is both a tabernacle and a temple. Hence, when the Bible speaks of the Word becoming flesh, it conveys the thought of mingling and the thought of a corporate entity. This is a mysterious matter.</p>
<p>I hope that we can see this matter. From God&rsquo;s viewpoint, our experience of regeneration did not occur at various times; rather, it was accomplished in a corporate way at the same time (1 Pet. 1:3). With God there is no element of time or space. In God&rsquo;s eyes, Paul was not saved two thousand years ago, while we were saved two thousand years later. In God&rsquo;s eyes, Paul was not saved in the Mediterranean region, while we were saved in the Pacific region. In God&rsquo;s eyes, we were saved together at the same time.</p>
<p>Hence, our experience of regeneration involved more than the union of God and one individual person; it was the union of God with a corporate man. Through incarnation the Word became a tabernacle and a temple, hence, a building. The completion of this building will be expressed through the Body of Christ as the dwelling place of God and as the counterpart that God desires. The corporate entity produced through incarnation and regeneration is the Body as God&rsquo;s dwelling place and counterpart.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
