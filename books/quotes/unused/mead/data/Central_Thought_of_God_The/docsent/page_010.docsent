   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE CHURCH THE COUNTERPART OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26-28; 2:18-24; Eph 5:30-32; 2:15b-16a; 4:24; 1:22-23; 1 Cor 12:12; John 3:29-30; Rev 21:2, 9; 22:1-2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that man has the highest life in God's creation, a life with the image of God to express God and with the authority of God to represent God to subdue all the enemies of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this way man can bring satisfaction and rest to God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By the help of the New Testament, we can realize that the man created by God is a type, a figure, pointing to the real man, who is Christ Rom 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first Adam is a type, a figure, of the last Adam 1 Cor 15:45b , who is the real Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is the Son of God incarnated as a man by the name of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Most of the items of God's creation are also types, figures, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The heavens, the earth, the plants, and the living creatures are figures of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually, man, the last item of God's creation, is a figure of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the things created by God are not the real things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The real thing is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The real heaven, the real earth, and the real light are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The real plant, the real beauty, and the real order are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The real word is Christ; He is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you do not have Christ, all that you have is false.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is everything as reality to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE CORPORATE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We also have to realize that the man created by God was not an individual man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Adam was a corporate man, a collective man, a man including himself and all his descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the same principle, Christ is not only an individual man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is a collective man, a corporate man, composed of Christ Himself and all the members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, 1 Corinthians 12:12 says, "For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ is not only the Head but also the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that Christ is a collective man, a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Just as the old man includes Adam and all his descendants, the new man includes Christ and all His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We were made as parts of the first Adam, and now we have been regenerated as parts of the last Adam to be the expression of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With the first Adam, everything is a figure and is not real.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But with the last Adam, everything is real.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you are merely a person of the first Adam, you do not have anything real.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After you have been regenerated to become a part of the last Adam, there is something real within you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God also created a bride, a wife, to match man, to be the helpmate to man, the counterpart of man, and this counterpart was his increase.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A wife is a counterpart and an increase to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A man needs a wife to match him, to be his counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A watermelon cut in two halves is a picture of a wife and a husband.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One half is the husband and the other half is the wife, and when you put the two halves together, you have the whole person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a man, you need a wife to match you to be your counterpart, to make you whole, to make you complete, and to be your increase.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The man created by God is a figure of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He needs a counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This simply means that Christ, the new man in this universe, needs a counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church is the bride of Christ, the counterpart to match Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Scriptures reveal how much Christ loves the church and desires to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why the enemy always does his best to spoil the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church is the desire of Christ's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ephesians 5:25 tells us that Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may only have the thought that Christ loves sinners, so He died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We forget that Christ loved the church, so He died on the cross for the church, which is His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, in the types in God's creation, there are the man and the bride, the counterpart, to match the man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This counterpart is something out of man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>She is not an addition but an increase.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Similarly, the church is not something added to Christ but something increased out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A man needs a body to express himself and a wife to make him complete.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A head without a body is frightening because it is not a real or proper man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Yet today many Christians have the thought that as long as we have Christ as the Head, everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, Christ is not only the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He also includes the Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our Christ must be the Head with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we have only a Christian life, that is not good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to experience Christ as our life, and we also need the experience of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A complete person is a person with a head and a proper body.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need a proper church life to match our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need Christ as the Head and the church as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God created Adam, the husband, but God gave Adam an increase, which was Eve, his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Brothers, you cannot live just by yourself as a bachelor.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sooner or later you have to be married.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Although some remain unmarried, that is an exception.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>That is not natural.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Spiritually and naturally, you have to marry.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This also means that as a Christian, living a proper Christian life, you need the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Your spiritual nature within says that you need the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A born-again Christian, a spiritual Christian, always longs to have a church life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you do not have a church life, you have no rest.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You are not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You need both Christ as the Head and the church as the Body.</S>
