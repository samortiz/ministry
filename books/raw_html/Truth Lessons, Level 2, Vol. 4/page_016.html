Supplying Us with His Bountiful Supply</h2><p>In Philippians 1:19 Paul said, “I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.” The Greek word rendered bountiful supply refers to the supplying of all the needs of the chorus in ancient times by the choragus, the leader of the chorus. The choragus supplied all the needs of everyone in the chorus, the needs for food, lodging, and musical instruments. Once a person had joined the chorus, there was no need for him to be concerned about the necessities of life. In using this expression Paul likened the supply of the Spirit, which is so bountiful, to the supply of the choragus. In the bountiful supply of the Spirit are the rich items such as the Lord’s divinity, His humanity, His human living, His death and its effectiveness, and His resurrection and its power. In his suffering for Christ, the apostle Paul experienced and enjoyed such a bountiful supply so that he was able to live Christ and magnify Christ. We also need to experience and enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit today in all kinds of circumstances.<p>Because this verse speaks first of the saints’ petition, then of the bountiful supply of the Spirit, this reveals that the bountiful supply of the compound Spirit is upon the Body of Christ. Although Paul was imprisoned, the imprisonment did not isolate him from the Body of Christ or cut him off from the supply of the Body. We also must be joined to the Body of Christ today that we may enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit which is for the Body.
