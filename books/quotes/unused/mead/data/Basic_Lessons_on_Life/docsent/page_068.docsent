   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Law 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Spirit Not Only Belonging to Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>but Also Having Its Law</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 8:2a speaks of "the law of the Spirit of life."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This shows that the Spirit not only belongs to life but also has the life law as the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Life Being the Content and Issue of the Spirit;</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Law Being the Function and Action of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Life is the content and issue of the Spirit, whereas the law of life is the function and action of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the Spirit functions, this function is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the Spirit acts, this action is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By Contacting Life We Touch the Spirit;</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>by Sensing the Law We Also Sense the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can realize the Spirit by contacting life and by sensing the law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By this we can see that the phrase the law of the Spirit of life is somewhat complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The law, the Spirit, and life are wrapped up together as one unit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Life is the content and issue of the Spirit, and law is the function and action of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, when we contact life, we touch the Spirit, and when we sense the law, we sense the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is because life and law are both one with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>C. Peace 1.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Peace Being Also the Issue of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Romans 8:6b says that to set the mind on the spirit is life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In addition to life, peace is also the issue of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Touching the Spirit, We Do Not Only Touch Life but Also Peace</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not forget that this is a continuation of our fellowship in lesson eleven on the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to point out that the feeling of peace is the inner feeling of ease, comfort, harmony, rest, joy, and liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we touch the spirit, we touch life, and at the same time we also touch peace.</S>
