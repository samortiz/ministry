   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST'S RESURRECTION PROVING THAT HE IS GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The most wonderful thing about Christ is not only the way He died, but that He did not remain in death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was in the grave for less than seventy-two hours.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the third day Christ rose from the grave Matt 28:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a historical fact which no historian can overturn.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He resurrected with a body and appeared to His disciples many times for forty days 1 Cor 15:4-7; Acts 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many modern critics have dismissed the resurrection as a myth or a story that the early disciples fabricated.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the fact that so many witnesses saw Christ after His resurrection, and the fact that their encounter with the resurrected Christ brought about profound changes in their lives, are strong proof that the resurrection is not a fabrication.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before Christ's resurrection the disciples were fearful and disheartened; Peter even denied the Lord three times Luke 22:54-62 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After His resurrection the same group of people became bold and aggressive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Peter was the first one to stand up at Pentecost to preach to more than three thousand people Acts 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No fabrication can produce such a life-transforming change; nor could the disciples have been in any kind of religious hallucination, because all of them spoke soberly and behaved responsibly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The early church was not a community of self-deceived lunatics but a body of proper, upright, and sober-minded believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The resurrection of Jesus Christ is the greatest historical fact in the history of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It changes the course of human history and opens the way for man to have a new life in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>CHRIST'S ASCENSION AND HIS LIVING FOREVER PROVING THAT HE IS GOD</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Kings and empires have come and passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Roman Empire that was once the pride of ancient civilization has crumbled to pieces, but the little Jesus of Nazareth whom it persecuted has triumphed and remained.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Forty days after His resurrection Christ ascended to the right hand of God Acts 1:9; 2:33-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today He is the King of kings and the Lord of lords Rev 19:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is God, and He rules over the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Great monarchs and imperial dynasties have built monuments and edifices to their memory, only to see them falling to pieces through the eyes of their posterity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the name of Christ has remained, and His cross has shined through the ages with ever-increasing glory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Kings and conquerors have instituted calendars to commemorate their reigns, but the only calendar that has remained is the calendar of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today, in the East and in the West, from the most industrialized nation to the most backward country, everyone uses the universal calendar, the calendar of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without realizing it, the whole world is acknowledging that Christ is the only Monarch and the supreme Ruler.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Behind the great wheel of human history is Christ's own omnipotent hand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the Jews killed Jesus, they thought that the disciples who surrounded Him would be dispersed in a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Little did they expect that in less than two months the situation would be completely turned and thousands would be converted to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Roman Empire despised the little communities of Christians and thought that its mighty imperial power could squash such a feeble movement in no time.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The communists seventy-five years ago proclaimed that Christianity would die within that generation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Little did they expect that Christians all over the world would multiply by the thousands and millions, even right within their own atheistic countries.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every day thousands of people are turning to Christ and are committing their lives to Christ.</S>
