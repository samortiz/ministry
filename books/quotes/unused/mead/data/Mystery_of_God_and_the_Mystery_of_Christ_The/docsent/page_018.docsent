   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN RECEIVING REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE REALITY Scripture Reading: Col 2:11-12, 20; 3:1-5a, 9-11 SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE DEPENDING ON REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we love the Lord with our heart, something happens in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may pray to the Lord, Lord, by Your grace I am constrained by Your love to love You.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, I would like to learn to love You.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I offer You my love, my heart, and my whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we pray in such a way, we have the sense that something wonderful is happening in our innermost being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the experience of being filled with the wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Simply by loving the Lord with our heart, we are filled in our spirit with the wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once we have such an experience, we must look to the Lord to receive not only the wisdom but also the spiritual understanding concerning what we have experienced Col 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need spiritual understanding in order to understand and experience further what has happened in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a spiritual principle in order to have the real experience of Christ being our life and everything, we must have the true and complete knowledge of God s eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we do not have the full knowledge and revelation of Christ in God s plan, we will never be able to have the real experience of Christ being our life in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why we must spend time with the Lord in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to spend much time in the presence of the Lord to pray in a particular way concerning this very matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should pray, Lord, reveal Your eternal purpose to me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Reveal to me Your plan concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Reveal to me everything that this Christ, whom I have experienced, is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Lord, open my eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Give me the full understanding of Your eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should practice to pray in this way every day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In fact, it would be good if we would pray this kind of prayer every day for six months.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For half a year, whenever we come to the Lord, we should pray, Lord, open my eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Give me the understanding that I might see, realize, and apprehend what it means for Christ to be my life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Show me Your eternal plan regarding Christ as the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should pray and pray day after day for revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible does not record very many of the prayers of the apostles, but it does record some of the prayers of the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we read these prayers, we will be able to see that they have a common nature and content.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul prayed very much that we might have the opening of our eyes, the revelation, concerning God s eternal plan Eph 1:16-19; 3:14-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, we should also ask for this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must ask the Lord for revelation; otherwise, we will never be able to experience Christ as our life to the fullest extent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>More than anything else, we need spiritual light and the knowledge of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We do not need the knowledge of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our need is the knowledge of spiritual revelation with spiritual understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When this knowledge of revelation is impressed into our spirit, heart, mind, and entire being, it will become a controlling factor within us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It will control our whole being and direct our walk.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The revelation we receive always rules us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we have no revelation, then we are not under any control or rule cf.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Prov 29:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The knowledge of doctrine or teaching is nothing, but the knowledge of heavenly revelation impressed into our spirit by the Holy Spirit will be a controlling and ruling factor within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It will even rule us day by day, causing us to be under the control of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE REVELATION THAT CHRIST IS OUR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The revelation that we must see is of two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The first and central aspect of this revelation is that God s eternal plan is that Christ would enter into us to be our life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is what God will stress to our spirit in His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God strongly desires that we would realize that Christ is life to us in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is not merely some sort of saying or doctrine; it is a spiritual fact.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ today is in the Spirit and is the Spirit Himself 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, The Lord is the Spirit and 3:18 refers to the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because Christ is the Spirit, we can receive Him into our spirit 2 Tim 4:22a .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is very real.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord is the Spirit, we have a spirit, and we can receive the Lord Spirit into our spirit and be mingled together with Him 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the stress of the revelation of God that Christ is life to us as the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is a reality, but we can realize it only by revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we do not see this, we can never realize it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Merely to receive some teaching or to hear about something will not cause us to have the reality of what we have been taught or have heard.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Suppose for example that someone tells you that something you own is full of germs.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you cannot see the germs, you may feel that the item is quite clean, and what they have told you will not mean anything to you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But if you are actually able to see the germs, then you will have some realization.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we have the seeing, then the facts will mean something to us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Otherwise, all we have is theory.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We may have heard the saying Christ is our life many times.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In response, we may have said, This is wonderful; Christ is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have heard the saying, and we have even repeated it, but does it mean anything to us?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we have not seen the reality, then it does not.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thus, we must pray, Lord, open my eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Reveal to me that Christ is my life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Only when we see this, will we be able to realize and experience to the full the fact that Christ is life to us.</S>
