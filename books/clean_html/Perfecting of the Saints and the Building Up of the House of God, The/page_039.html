<h2 class="head1">THE WORKERS MEETING THE LOCAL NEEDS<br />
AND THE OVERSEAS PROPAGATION</h2>
<p>After much fellowship we are clear that several brothers need to move for their service and labor. Some brothers want to move, and there are places that have a need. Moreover, it may be necessary to reassign the responsibilities of some co-workers. This applies to our service in Taiwan, particularly in Taipei.</p>
<p>Concerning going abroad, we feel that we should take care of Japan and Southeast Asia. There is an urgent need in Tokyo and Bangkok. We hope that at least two brothers can go to Bangkok or that a brother and his family can go there. At least one brother should go to Tokyo. There is also a need for some brothers to go to different places in Southeast Asia. It would be good for more brothers to receive a burden to go overseas for the propagation. For example, if a brother has a clear leading from the Lord and has a burden to go to the West, especially to America, it would be very good. However, the urgent need is in Tokyo and Bangkok. I hope that some brothers will be open to seek the Lord&rsquo;s will and receive a burden to go to these places.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the past most of the co-workers in Taiwan stayed in one place for a long time and bore the responsibility there. The workers did not travel and labor in different places. In principle, we stayed in one place and were responsible for the work in that place. We did not work like the apostle Paul, who traveled from place to place without staying for long in any one place. It may be time for us to have a change. This does not mean we should all move to different places, but we need to make changes that will involve a few workers. There should be a group of workers, brothers and sisters, who receive the leading to travel from place to place on a regular basis to supply the needs of the churches.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BENEFITING THE WORKERS</h2>
<p>According to the fellowship from the brothers, some workers cannot leave immediately to supply the churches, but other workers can. A brother who receives the burden to go to supply the churches in different places should help the church where he is and also set aside a portion of his time to travel for the supply of other churches. In this way the workers can supply other churches and learn more related to the ministry. This will enlarge their heart and broaden their view.</p>
<p>The workers who do not travel regularly can stay in larger cities, such as Kaohsiung and Taichung. The workers who travel regularly can stay in smaller cities, such as Chiayi and Tainan. They should go to a place and then return to their locality when it is necessary. It is time for us to work in this way. We will benefit from traveling to different places. This will prevent the workers from being narrow in their view, and it will enlarge their capacity. The workers who travel to supply other churches will be enlarged in their view and capacity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BENEFITING THE CHURCHES</h2>
<p>Furthermore, when a co-worker goes out from his respective locality, the saints in his locality have an opportunity to serve and supply the church. When the worker returns, he can help locally. With the service being carried out mainly by the local saints, the workers can assist and guide the saints. When the workers are in a place, they should advise and assist the saints so that the saints will be able to take care of the practical service after he departs. When the worker returns, he can consider the service of the saints. Some areas of service may need adjustment, and the saints may need support or motivation. This will perfect the local saints who have the opportunity to serve.</p>
<p>We need a good coordination in every place. Some of the co-workers who travel can labor in the gospel, but they should not preach the gospel outside the fellowship of the church. They should preach the gospel in coordination with the brothers and sisters in a locality. In this way the church will preach the gospel, even when the workers bear responsibility for giving messages.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR PRACTICE</h2>
<p>The best practice is for two workers to travel together. The biblical principle is to go out two by two and work in coordination (Mark 6:7; Luke 10:1). The workers can hold conferences related to the building work, helping the saints in the matter of life or in reading the Word of God. It is best to go to the different places in twos and work in coordination. Then the churches in Taiwan will have an opportunity to receive the supply from many gifts. Moreover, some of the local brothers will have the opportunity to rise up and learn to bear responsibility. This will, in turn, provide the workers with more opportunities to travel.</p>
<p>The workers who travel should first go to places that are close to their present locality. This will give the saints in their locality the opportunity to bear more responsibility in the church. When the local saints are able to bear more responsibility, the workers can go to places that are farther away. With time, the workers as well as the local brothers will receive practical training. This is our present need.</p>
<p>Some saints may feel that we should continue to stay in one place for many years. Other saints may agree with this change in our practice. There are many patterns in the Bible. The apostle Paul stayed in one place for three years (Acts 20:31), in another place for a year and six months (18:11), and in several other places for a much shorter time (13:42, 44-52; 14:1-21; 17:2). He was flexible, because his labor was based on the need. Hence, we should not be as rigid in our labor as we have been in the past, when we stayed in one place for a long time and visited other places occasionally. It is time for us to travel to other places.</p>
<p>The localities that are new may not be ready for this change, but the local saints in more established localities should be given the opportunity to rise up and serve. Although the workers can guide the saints, their main responsibility is to supply the churches. A worker should be able to supply even the church of another worker. For example, a worker in locality A can supply locality B, and a worker in locality B can supply locality A. In this way there will be a mutual supply, and the capacity of life and service in the local churches will be enlarged.</p>
<p>A worker who travels to supply the churches should not abandon his locality. Just as Paul returned to Antioch, the locality that sent him out, the workers should return to the locality that sent them. Paul was sent out to labor, but he returned to Antioch to fellowship with and supply the saints. He did not abandon Antioch. Paul continued to care for the church in Antioch while he cared for the churches that were raised up among the Gentiles (14:26-28; 15:30, 35; 18:22-23). The brothers need a proper understanding of this matter, but we do not need rules related to how the workers travel. The brothers should always be ready to receive the Lord&rsquo;s leading to visit and to render practical help to the churches. How long the workers should stay in a place depends on the Lord&rsquo;s leading.</p>
