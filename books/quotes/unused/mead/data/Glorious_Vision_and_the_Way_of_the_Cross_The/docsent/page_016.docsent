   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD REGULATING MAN THROUGH DELEGATED AUTHORITY AND THE INWARD CONSCIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to know that the old creation and the natural life within us can do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If there were no laws in the country, we could even rob banks.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today, God sovereignly puts nations and rulers on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Romans 13 says, "Let every person be subject to the authorities over them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are appointed by God" v. 1 . All rulers govern for God to maintain the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If there were no law courts, governments, or police stations on earth, we would not be able to live and work peacefully.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In addition, God has created a conscience within man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The conscience controls our walk and conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Moreover, we the saved ones have God added to our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The conscience forms a part of man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since God lives in our spirit, He lives in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, God does not use brute force to rule over this part of us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, He draws us with His love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We see this in the Lord's question to Peter, "Do you love Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Peter answered, "Yes, Lord, You know that I love You."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord said to him, "Shepherd My sheep" John 21:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is His drawing us with His love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do not love the Lord, we lose the restraint that comes from this kind of attraction and are liable to do anything and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>HUMANITY BEING SAFEGUARDED THROUGH LOVING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For a Christian to serve the Lord, he must have the humanity of a servant of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not have to wait for the government, the law court, or the policeman to regulate us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Neither should we merely be regulated by our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our humanity comes from our loving of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have been planted in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now we are willing to live in Him and are willing to be found by others to be a person in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, what we live out is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We always allow Christ to be magnified in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No matter what kind of circumstance, whether it be poverty, riches, suffering, enjoyment, peace, danger, or even death, I magnify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this way, He becomes my humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, such a high humanity can be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One can degenerate from a noble humanity to a base one, giving up one's position and rights as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is possible for Christians to degrade to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is like Alexander; he did not have a proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He would even do many evil things to a servant of the Lord who loved and served Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Likewise, Demas loved the present age and forsook Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today, we should be those who are willing to remain in Christ and be found in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this way, we can do all things in Him who empowers us Phil 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every one of the six virtues that which is true, honorable, righteous, pure, lovely, and well-spoken of v. 8 is hard to achieve from man's point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But we can do all these in Him who empowers us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this way, we live out godliness and the proper humanity, which is just Christ manifested in our bodies and lived out through us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, we should not think that as Christians our humanity is safeguarded.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whether our humanity will be safeguarded or not depends on whether or not we continue to love the Lord and consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why the new way is helping us to be revived every morning and to overcome every day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Such a living will keep us in the proper condition.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Otherwise, it will be impossible for us to live out the normal, proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In February of this year I visited the churches near San Francisco.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A brother there asked me if I, as one having been in the Lord for so many years and with such a vast area and heavy burden in the work, had ever had any trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I replied that certainly there are many troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The brother then asked me if I have peace within.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I replied that though troubles are many, the peace is even more.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is because the work is not my business but the Lord's business.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is the same with the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is the Lord's business whether a person will be saved or not.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is our duty to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If others accept it, they will receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If they reject it, they will miss the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For me, I am not troubled at all.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is something that we need to know.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>STANDING FIRM IN CHRIST AND NOT FEARING THE WAVES</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have to see today that first we have to be equipped with such a humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only then are we qualified to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Once we lose this humanity, we do not have the position and the right to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Second, I know that you are still young.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I am at least sixty years ahead of you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I am very familiar with this way, but you have a long way yet to go.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There are many difficulties along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"God hath not promised skies always blue, Flower-strewn pathways all our lives through" Hymns, #720 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For this reason, by grace you have to stand firm in Christ, maintaining this life through holding Christ as the humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When you see a storm, do not listen to rumors and do not be affected by those who have changed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Do not ask why.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When a man is changed, he is changed, and that is all.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We have to look to the Lord's mercy today to keep us unchanged and to preserve us all the way to the end.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Mark 4 describes the Lord Jesus sitting in the boat with His disciples as they crossed over to the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Suddenly a great windstorm came, and the waves beat into the boat so that the boat was filling up.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The disciples were very afraid, but Jesus was sleeping on the cushion in the stern vv.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>37, 38 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The stern of a small boat is the part that is most easily swayed.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Although the swaying was severe, the Lord still had a peaceful sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>May the Lord's blood cover me.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I have the same sensation today.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There may be windstorms.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But I can still sleep in the stern.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I hope that you also can be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You should know that even with such a short trip as the journey across the Sea of Galilee, there were still frequent windstorms and high waves.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Paul said in 2 Timothy 1 that all those in Asia had turned away from him v. 15 . Chapter four also shows us that Demas had forsaken Paul v. 10 . Moreover, Alexander did many evil things to Paul v. 14 . It seems that there was no one there who was one with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But thank the Lord, there was still Timothy who was one with him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>That is why in 2 Timothy Paul did not show any discouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Rather, he was singing the victory song.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He said, "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith; henceforth, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me in that day; and not only to me, but also to all those who have loved His appearing" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If we love His appearing, we will be kept in the realm of having Christ as our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When He returns, we shall surely be rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on March 16, 1989</S>
