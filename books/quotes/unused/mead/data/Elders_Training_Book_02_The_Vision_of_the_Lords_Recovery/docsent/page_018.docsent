   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE VISION CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION 1</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must have a clear view about the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible, comprised of sixty-six holy books, is the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The New Jerusalem is the conclusion of such a great book.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Also, in this great book, God s economy, His eternal purpose, His eternal plan, is fully revealed with His divine purpose, which is the highest purpose in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The New Jerusalem is the conclusion of this purpose, of this plan, of this economy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE TOTAL CONCLUSION OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must also see that none of the sixty-six books of the Bible has an adequate conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Genesis does not have one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This book is concluded with a dead man in a coffin, buried in Egypt 50:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Is that a satisfactory conclusion?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then the book of Exodus concludes with something glorious, which is quite in contrast to the conclusion of Genesis a tabernacle filled with God s glory 40:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even though this conclusion is glorious, it is still not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Matthew concludes with a kind of commission.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord charges the disciples to go to disciple the nations and baptize them into the Triune God 28:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Again, this is not an adequate conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The book of John concludes with the matter of fishing 21:1-14 and in the Acts we could not see an actual conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The last verse of Acts says that Paul was proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, unhindered 28:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only one book of the sixty-six books of the Bible, Revelation, has the conclusion of the Bible, because all of the sixty-six books are concluded with one item the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The New Jerusalem is the total conclusion of the sixty-six books, the entire, total conclusion of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE CONSUMMATION OF ALL THE ITEMS IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The New Jerusalem is not only the conclusion to the entire Bible, but also the consummation of all the items in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Triune God, His economy, Christ s redemption, God s salvation, the believers, the church, and the kingdom all consummate in this one item the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is imperative that we see that the New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of all the subjects, the items, the matters, the persons, and the things recorded in the holy writings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the consummation, it is an exceedingly great item.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Based upon these few points which I have mentioned, we can realize that the New Jerusalem surely could never be a physical mansion for God s redeemed to lodge in for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is too low to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is like the conclusion of a kindergarten textbook.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Surely the holy writings as the entire revelation of the great, purposeful God would not end in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The New Jerusalem must be the consummation of the Triune God with His economy and the consummation of the wonderful church and the marvelous kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The significance of this consummation must fit all these points.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From the entire divine revelation of the Bible we must infer logically that the New Jerusalem surely could never be a physical, lodging place.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must be impressed that the New Jerusalem is the consummation of all the divine items in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although this consummation only occupies a little over one chapter in the Bible, it comprises every basic, intrinsic, essential, and genuine item in the entire divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must see this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>NOT A PHYSICAL MANSION</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order to understand the New Jerusalem properly, I would like to present six reasons why the New Jerusalem could not be a physical mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A Book of Signs</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First, we must realize that the first verse of the book of Revelation tells us how this book was written: The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him to show to His slaves the things that must swiftly take place; and He made it known by signs Rev 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This verse tells us that the Lord Jesus made this God-given revelation known to us by signs.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It would help us to circle, color, or underline the word signs in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord Jesus made this revelation known to us by signs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The word signs is the key word to interpret the entire book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Revelation is a book of signs.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every number in the book of Revelation is a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Seven is a sign, four is a sign, twelve is a sign, and ten is a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The lampstands 1:11-13, 20 are signs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lamb who was slain 5:6 is a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The lion 5:5 is a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The seven stars 1:16, 20 are signs.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In 4:3 the One who was sitting on the throne looks like jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Jasper is also a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Revelation 12:1 the universal woman crowned with twelve stars, clothed with the sun, and standing on the moon is a great sign.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Could such a wonderful woman be merely a single, individualistic female?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is not logical to interpret it in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Also in Revelation 12 is a great red dragon v. 3 . This is also a sign, as well as the man-child v. 5 . Then in the next chapter, chapter thirteen, we see the beast coming out of the Mediterranean Sea vv.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>That beast signifies the coming Caesar of the coming Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is a sign of a man v. 18 . The harvest in Revelation 14:15 is also a sign, signifying God s living people.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The firstfruit in Revelation 14:4 is a sign which signifies the living overcomers among God s living people.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The number one hundred forty-four thousand is also a sign v. 1 . The glassy sea in 15:2 is another sign.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then in chapter seventeen we see a great prostitute v. 1 , Babylon the Great v. 5 . This surely will not be a physical city of Babylon which is today s Baghdad in Iraq.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The great Babylon, the mystery, is a sign in Revelation 17.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In chapter 19 we see a bride, the wife of the Lamb, who is clothed with righteousness vv.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Do you believe that when the Lord Jesus comes back He will marry a literal woman, a single female?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To interpret the signs in the Bible in this way is seriously wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I hope we can see all the signs in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What is the last sign, then, of this book of signs?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The last sign of this book, which is made known to us mainly by signs, is the New Jerusalem.</S>
