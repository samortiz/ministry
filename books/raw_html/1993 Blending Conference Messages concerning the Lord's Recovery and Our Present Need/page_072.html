<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD SPIRIT FOR TRANSFORMING THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>The Spirit is also the Lord Spirit for transforming the believers into the glorious image of Christ. Second Corinthians 3:18 says, "But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit." The life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45 is called the Lord Spirit in this verse.</P><P>The title the Lord Spirit is related to the transforming work of the Spirit within us. The verb transform in Greek is metamorphoo, meaning "to change form." Transformation is a metabolic process. Metabolism has at least three aspects. First, a new element comes into our being. Second, this new element replaces our old element. Third, the old element is discharged. Therefore, transformation can be defined as the inward, metabolic process in which God works to spread His divine life and nature throughout every part of our being, bringing Christ and His riches into our being as our new element and causing our old, natural element to be gradually discharged. Through this metabolic process we are transformed into the same image as the resurrected and glorified Christ.</P><P>Transformation is a lifelong process. Therefore, every morning we need to cooperate with this process by opening our entire being to take in the new element of the life, nature, and essence of the processed and consummated Triune God. Our God is not the "raw" God anymore. The Triune God has gone through a process to become the life-giving Spirit. Every morning we need to take a new element into our being to replace the old element. We do not have to be bothered by the natural life, the flesh, the self, and all kinds of negative things any longer. By taking in this new element of the processed Triune God, we will be transformed into the same image as the resurrected and glorified Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF LIFE, THE ESSENTIAL SPIRIT OF GOD</H2><P>The life-giving Spirit is also the Spirit of life, the essential Spirit of God (Rom. 8:2). The title the Spirit of life indicates that life belongs to the Spirit, and the Spirit is of life. The Spirit and life are actually one (John 6:63). Hence, the way for us to experience the divine, eternal, uncreated life is by the Spirit of life. This Spirit works in us inwardly to transform us metabolically day by day. He also works in us inwardly for our life and living essentially, freeing us from the law of sin and death. According to Romans 8, the Spirit of life, who is now mingled with our spirit, gives life to our spirit (v. 10), to our soul, represented by our mind (v. 6), and to our mortal body (v. 11).</P>
