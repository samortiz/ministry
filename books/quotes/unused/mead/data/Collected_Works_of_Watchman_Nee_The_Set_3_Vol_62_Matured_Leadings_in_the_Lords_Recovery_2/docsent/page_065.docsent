   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SERVICE 8 Date:March 3, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee ARRANGEMENT OF BUSINESS AFFAIRS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>TAKING CARE OF THE PROPER APPEARANCE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>OF THE MEETING HALL</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Witness Lee: In the past we thought that appearance was not important.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We thought that this was a minor matter that could be handled by some hired workers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We thought that we should reserve the saints' energy for spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the more services there are in the church and the larger our meeting place is, the more pressing are these needs.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some people do not mind if our meeting hall is dirty or messy, but some people are naturally clean and tidy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are used to cleanliness and feel uncomfortable when they come in. In large cities everyone pays much attention to modern amenities and hygiene.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If a man comes into the meeting hall, and he finds the furnishings poor and dirty, it will be hard for him to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Suppose there are specks and dirt on the chairs of the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A person who comes to listen to the gospel must wipe it with a handkerchief before he can sit down.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It would be hard for such a one to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A messy hall can easily stumble others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A man once came to listen to the gospel in a white shirt.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was turned off from the gospel when the back of the chair soiled his shirt.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The next day he came back to accuse the church and harass it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although we do not want to be too fancy, modern, or extravagant, we should be proper, clean, and neat.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE NEED FOR SPIRITUAL FEELINGS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>IN OUR ARRANGEMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In decorating the meeting hall, we must have spiritual feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our feelings should not be superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should do things out of a genuine love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In our services we need thorough prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not determine the worth of a work by the work itself but by the person who is doing the work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Mopping the floor is a small thing, but if the president of the United States, Mr. Truman, or the queen of England came to No. 7 Jordan Road to mop, this would be a very significant event.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Suppose a brother comes with a rag in his hand to clean the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If his heart is for the Lord, he will pray as he cleans the windows.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He will ask that the Lord bestow grace to the church through his labor.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this way his window cleaning becomes something weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If enough of the brothers' and sisters' love, prayer, and service are lavished on the meeting hall in this way, will not the Lord bless us?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to remember the words of Song of Songs 2.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus is standing behind the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is looking through the windows and through the lattice v. 9 . If the windows of the meeting hall are not clean and if the walls are dirty and greasy, I am afraid that the Lord cannot bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many brothers and sisters were saved because they were impressed by the cleanliness of the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One brother was somewhat messy before he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When he came to the meeting hall, the very sight of cleanliness and orderliness turned him to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Another person did not believe in any so-called sacred sites.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But as soon as he saw our meeting hall, he was subdued and believed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Two brothers were saved because they saw the meeting hall in their dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 1942 they returned home from Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In their dreams they saw themselves walking into the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When they woke up, they went to the meeting hall and saw that it was just as neat and tidy as they had seen in their dreams, and they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In decorating the meeting hall we must not only do a good job, but also we must lavish the saints' prayer, zealous spirits, and love on it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is where we differ from the Gentiles.</S>
