   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUPPLYING THE BASIC AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PROFOUND REVELATION IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By the Lord s power I was saved when I was nineteen, and the Lord planted within me a heart that loves the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, I studied the Bible diligently for eight years, between the ages of nineteen and twenty-seven.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the period of time when a person s comprehension and memory are the strongest.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I truly loved the Bible, and the more I read the Bible, the more I loved it, because no book in English or Chinese could compare to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I felt that the Bible is profound and that every verse contains an important meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I also collected many Christian books as reference material for the things that I did not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I later came across the expository magazines published by Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I thought that he could expound the Bible in such a marvelous way because he was an elderly man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was only when I began to write to him that I found out that he was only two years older than I. This increased my eagerness and motivation to understand every word and verse in every chapter of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I asked Brother Nee which book could teach me to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He replied that as far as he knew, the book that was the best exposition of the Bible was the Synopsis of the Books of the Bible by J. N. Darby.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He added that it was difficult to read because of its long sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, a person needed to read it four or five times before he could begin to understand it; unless a person made an effort to study, he could not enter into it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brother Nee and I eventually became co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I began to serve full time, I visited Brother Nee in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One day he came to me with two large sets of books and indicated that they were for me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One of the sets was Darby s Synopsis of the Books of the Bible, and the other was Henry Alford s New Testament for English Readers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That was in 1933, fifty-two years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During these fifty-two years these two sets of books have always been with me, and they have been a continuous help to me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From the time that I received these books, I have made an effort to study the most particular and profound words in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have been studying the phrase the fullness of God for more than forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was not until the last twenty-five years that I began to understand the difference between the fullness of God and the riches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a crucial matter that every new believer needs to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I want to supply you with the basic and profound truths in the Bible, and I hope that you can obtain light, truth, life, and a rich supply from these truths.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE MEANING OF THE FULLNESS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let us begin with the meaning of the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The fullness of God is the overflowing of God s riches to become His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The fullness of God is also the expression of God s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, here is a cup with water in it, but you do not know how much water is in the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There may be a small amount of water in the cup, or there may be much water.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If I pour water into the cup until the water overflows, the cup becomes rich with water to the point of overflowing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This overflowing is the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Inside the cup are the riches, and what flows out is the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The cup first has the riches and then the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, the fullness is the issue of the overflowing of the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This issue is the expression of the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Unless the cup overflows, we can only guess concerning what is inside the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once it overflows, we know that water is inside the cup, because the water is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, we should never consider the riches as the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These two things are absolutely different.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The riches are the quantity of an object, whereas the fullness is the flowing out, the overflow, of the object to become the expression of the object.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God s fullness is the overflow of His riches, and this overflow is God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God is abundantly rich.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is so rich that His riches overflow.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This overflow is the expression of God.</S>
