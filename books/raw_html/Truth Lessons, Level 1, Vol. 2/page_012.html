<h2 class="head3">2. Jeremiah</h2><p>Jeremiah means &ldquo;Jehovah exalts&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah throws down.&rdquo; Jeremiah&rsquo;s whole life was a testimony of the meaning implied in his name. People despised and rejected Jeremiah, regarding him not as a priest, much less a prophet; they treated him like a criminal and like a traitor. God, however, lifted him up (Jer. 1:5, 10). On the other hand, the kings and people of Israel committed sins and wickednesses, worshipped idols and rejected God&rsquo;s word, and were extremely unrestrained. So God threw them down. Jeremiah prophesied that Christ was a righteous sprout which God would raise up for David, and that (at His coming again) He would reign and would execute judgment and justice in the earth, that the whole race of Israel would be saved, and that His name would be called Jehovah our righteousness (Jer. 23:5-7; 33:15-16). He also prophesied that God would make a new covenant with His people, according to which He would put His law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts; He would be their God, and they would be His people. They would know Him, from the least to the greatest of them. He would forgive their iniquities and would remember their sins no more (Jer. 31:31-34; Heb. 8:8-12). For the rest concerning Jeremiah and his prophecies, see Lesson Twelve in volume one.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Ezekiel</h2><p>Ezekiel, the son of Buzi, was a priest (Ezek. 1:3). His name means &ldquo;God strengthens&rdquo; or &ldquo;God is the strength.&rdquo; He sternly rebuked the leaders and people of Israel for turning away from God, worshipping idols, committing fornications, and doing all kinds of evil. He transmitted the word of God to the children of Israel who were in captivity (Ezek. 3:10-11); he continued and confirmed that which was spoken by Jeremiah (Jer. 29:1-14), earnestly telling them that before they could return to Jerusalem they needed to turn back to Jehovah their God. Although it was very difficult in the beginning and although he encountered great opposition (Ezek. 3:7-9), the people in captivity eventually detested the idols, turned their hearts to God, and were returned to their homeland after seventy years. This was mostly the result of the work of the prophet Ezekiel. For the rest concerning Ezekiel and his prophecies, see Lesson Twelve in volume one.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Daniel</h2><p>Daniel was of the children of Judah (Dan. 1:6). His name means &ldquo;God is the Judge&rdquo; or &ldquo;my God is the Judge.&rdquo; The testimony of the prophet Daniel is that his God is the Judge. The reason the kingdom of Judah fell and Daniel was taken captive to Babylon is that God is the Judge. He exercised self-control to keep himself undefiled and was not willing to go with the tide; he stood for God, even not caring for his own life, because God is the Judge. The dream and the writing which he interpreted before the king and the prophecies in his book also testify that God is the supreme Judge. He predicted that Christ would be cut off four hundred eighty-three years (that is, sixty-nine weeks) after the issuing of the decree to rebuild Jerusalem (Dan. 9:25-26); that He would receive the kingdom and come back (7:13-14); and that at His coming back He would be as a stone cut out without hands, which would become a great mountain (the kingdom) and would fill the whole earth (2:34-35). He also prophesied that in the future resurrection, some will receive eternal life and others will receive eternal punishment (Dan. 12:2; John 5:28-29); they who are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars forever and ever (Dan. 12:2-3; Matt. 13:43). For the rest concerning Daniel, see Lesson Twelve in volume one.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Prophets Who Wrote the Books<br />of the Minor Prophets</h2><p>The books of the so-called Minor Prophets are not called such to infer that the prophets were of a lower rank, or that the contents were of lesser importance, but because they were shorter books.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Hosea</h2><p>Hosea was the son of Beeri (Hosea 1:1). His name means &ldquo;salvation&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah is salvation.&rdquo; The prophecies in the book of Hosea were filled with salvation, especially Jehovah&rsquo;s salvation for the backsliding Israel. Hosea spoke for God as a prophet in the years of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the years of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. His contemporaries included the prophets Isaiah, Micah, and Amos. He predicted the escape of Christ to Egypt after His birth (Hosea 11:1; Matt. 2:15).</p><h2 class="head3">2. Joel</h2><p>Joel was the son of Pethuel (Joel 1:1). His name means &ldquo;Jehovah is God.&rdquo; Based upon the contents of the book of Joel, we can conclude that among the prophets who wrote books, Joel was one of the earliest. His ministry preceded that of Amos. He prophesied that the Holy Spirit would be poured out at Pentecost and that those who would call upon the Lord&rsquo;s name would be saved (2:28-32; Acts 2:16-21). He also prophesied that when Christ comes again, He will judge all the nations living on the earth (3:1-2; Matt. 25:31-46; Acts 17:31; 10:42).</p>
