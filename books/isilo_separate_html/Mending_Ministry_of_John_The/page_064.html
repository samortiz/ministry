These are they who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb wherever He may go. These were purchased from among men as firstfruit to God and to the Lamb; and in their mouth no lie was found, for they are without blemish&#8221; (Rev. 14:1-5).<p>These one hundred forty-four thousand as the firstfruit have grown into maturity ahead of others. Their faster ripening is the result of their receiving the most supply from the Lord. By following the Lamb &#8220;wherever He may go,&#8221; this supply has been their portion. Some of us are satisfied with the supply we get from the meetings. Apart from the meetings, when we are at home, we may not seek any supply. Of course, the supply from the meetings is better than nothing. But there are some who are continually with the Lord, following Him all day every day, and these receive a greater supply. Wherever they are and whatever their situation, they grow. This implies that the Lamb whom they follow is ministering the life supply to them.<h2 class=head2>(4) The Overcomers on the Glassy Sea</h2><p>&#8220;And I saw as it were a glassy sea mingled with fire, and those who had come off victorious from the beast and from his image and from the number of his name, standing on the glassy sea, having harps of God. And they sing the song of Moses, the slave of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and wonderful are Your works, Lord God the Almighty; righteous and true are Your ways, O King of the nations. Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy; for all the nations will come and worship before You, for Your righteous acts have been made manifest&#8221; (Rev. 15:2-4).<p>This fourth case tells us of those who overcome the persecution of the beast, refusing to worship him and to bear the number of his name. Standing on the glassy sea, they sing two songs, that of Moses and that of the Lamb. When the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, they sang in celebration of their victory over Pharaoh (Exo. 15:1-19). The day will come when the late overcomers will also stand on the seashore, not of the Red Sea but of the glassy sea, and praise God with the song of Moses, These overcomers, however, will also praise with the song of the Lamb. The song of Moses is mainly about judgment, while the song of the Lamb is for redemption. They will be there praising God for His judgment over Satan&#8217;s power and praising the Lamb for redeeming them. They will be singing in praise of God as the eternal, righteous Judge and in praise of the Lamb as the Redeemer.<p>How were they able to overcome the persecution they suffered at the hands of the Antichrist and to stand on the glassy sea? It was by Christ&#8217;s heavenly ministry, including His intercession. Both chapters fourteen and fifteen are insertions. While Christ was opening the seals and thus executing God&#8217;s eternal and universal administration, at the same time He was caring for His people-the hundred forty-four thousand in chapter fourteen and the victors over the beast in chapter fifteen. His people can withstand persecution and suffering because of His ministering the life supply to them. In themselves they could not bear it, but His heavenly ministry sustains them so that they can overcome any difficulty.<h2 class=head2>(5) The Bride</h2><p>&#8220;Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife has made herself ready. And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints&#8221; (Rev. 19:7-8).<p>The bride is made up of all these earlier cases we have mentioned. First they were followers of the Lamb; finally they became His bride. We are that bride!<h2 class=head2>(6) The Armies in Heaven</h2><p>&#8220;And the armies which are in heaven followed Him on white horses, dressed in fine linen, white and pure&#8221; (Rev. 19:14). The armies here are the called and chosen and faithful in 17:14. Those who have overcome every obstacle will be Christ&#8217;s cofighters in the final battle against Antichrist. These are His bride. They have become His cofighters by His ministering the rich life supply to them. Surely the expectation is here that all of us will be such cofighters.<h2 class=head2>(7) Co-kings</h2><p>In chapter twenty the millennial kingdom is set up (20:4-6). Christ will be King and we the overcomers will be co-kings. Firstly we are His cofighters. Then we become His co-kings to rule over the whole earth.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S PURPOSE FULFILLED</h2><p>From these cases we have covered you can see how Christ&#8217;s rulership and His heavenly ministry go hand in hand. His rulership covers the universal situation, while His heavenly ministry supplies the heavenly riches to His seekers to make them all overcomers. In the end God&#8217;s purpose is fulfilled. Christ has His bride, His cofighters, and His co-kings. How great is the accomplishment of Christ&#8217;s heavenly ministry!<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> </body></html>
