   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If I were the woman, I might say, "Lord, thank You for Your forgiveness, but how can I sin no more?"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is why chapter eight goes on to show us how to be freed from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter the Lord told us three times that He is the great I Am who can set people free from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 24 He said, "Unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 28 says, "Jesus therefore said to them, When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am, and that I do nothing from Myself, but as My Father has taught Me, I speak these things."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then verse 58 says, "Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came into being, I am."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Seemingly, the Lord was mistaken in grammar.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He should have said, "Before Abraham came into being, I was."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But with the Lord there is just one tense the present tense.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With Him there is no element of time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He does not say, "I was."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead, He says, "I am.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I am forever.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am in eternity future."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This great I Am not only will forgive you but also will set you free from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John 8:32 says, "And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then verse 36 says, "If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the I Am, the Lord is the One who is able to free us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the age of grace, Christ is qualified to forgive and redeem judicially.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is also qualified to set us free from sin organically.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the proper shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In our vital groups, we need leaders who know how to shepherd sinners who need the forgiveness of sins and the setting free from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If all the saints practice this kind of shepherding, the vital groups will be flourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Lord Jesus was teaching in the temple in John 8, He was shepherding a lost sheep in sin who was shamefully caught by the hypocritical scribes and Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He shepherded her first by telling her that He did not condemn her.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then He shepherded her further to free her from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In chapter nine there is the Lord's shepherding of a blind man in religion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After the Lord healed this man, the Pharisees said to him, "Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But he responded by saying, "Whether or not He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord shepherds us by forgiving our sins, setting us free from sin, and opening our eyes to see.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are not certain about the divine things, that means we are still blind and need our eyes opened by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord Jesus revealed in chapter ten that He is the Shepherd, the door, and the pasture vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>11, 14, 16, 7, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The door is for people to go in and come out.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When they come out, He is the pasture to them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That means He is a feast for the shepherded sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ was the door in the Old Testament age for His people to enter into God's economy by being kept in the custody of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and their descendants such as David, Solomon, Isaiah, and Jeremiah entered into the fold of the law in a positive sense.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ, the Messiah, was a door for the positive Old Testament saints to go into the God-prepared fold to be kept there until He, the Messiah, would come in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the Old Testament, Christ was the door to go in. In the New Testament, He is the door to come out.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One of those who came out was the blind man healed by the Lord in John 9.</S>
