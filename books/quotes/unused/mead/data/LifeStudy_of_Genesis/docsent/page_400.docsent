   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 Being Born the Second</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God sovereignly arranged the environment and circumstances pertaining to Jacob's life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Jacob and Esau were in their mother's womb, they fought over who would be born first 25:22-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jacob was subtle and seemed to be saying, "We are both in the womb.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whoever gets out first will be the firstborn and have the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I must not lose the birthright."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, Jacob began to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Under God's sovereignty, Jacob had a smart mind, but he did not have much physical strength.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Esau, on the contrary, was not so intelligent, but he was physically strong and defeated his brother, not allowing him to be born first.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although Esau suffered the cheating of Jacob's mind, Jacob was defeated by Esau's strength.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If Jacob had had both a smart mind and great physical strength, Esau could not have done anything and Jacob could have had whatever he wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But God was very wise and seemed to say, "Jacob, I'll let you have a smart mind, but I will not give you much physical strength.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Your brother may be dull, but I shall make him stronger than you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You will have a smart mind, and he will have a strong body."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, even before he was born, Jacob was defeated by Esau and was born the second.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although Jacob was defeated, he would not admit that he had been defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead, he held on to Esau's heel 25:26 , indicating that he refused to admit defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The same is true with us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many times we are defeated by our Esau, but we do not admit it and still hold on to his heel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes the sisters are defeated by their husbands, but, refusing to admit defeat, they hold on to the husband's heel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At other times, the husbands are defeated by their wives and they become the heel holders.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps even today you have had such an experience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all are Jacobs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God has chosen us, and we are under His dealing hand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let me share something from my own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have been in a number of local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In every church the elders felt that they were under my dealing, but I felt that I was suffering their dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the first two or three places I was not clear, but later I became very clear about God's dealing hand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I came to realize that one of the elders was my Esau, that another was my Isaac, that still another was my Rebekah, and that I was their Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I needed all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God can never be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the co-workers, elders, and leading sisters whom God has given me have always been my opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, when I preferred to have a careful person, God did not give me one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But every dealing has been a profit to me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Every incident has helped to transform me a little more.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When certain things happened, I was unhappy with all the dear Isaacs, Rebekahs, and Esaus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But deep in my heart I could say, "Praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am thankful for everyone and everything."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It was no accident that Jacob was born to Isaac and Rebekah and that Esau was his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All this was prearranged by the Father for Jacob's transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From the time he was in his mother's womb, Jacob needed one to be physically stronger than he was.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We often say that twins are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But if Jacob and Esau had been the same, Jacob could never have been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Jacob was a quiet man who always exercised his mind, and Esau was a hunter who exercised his physical strength.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, Esau was exactly what Jacob needed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not be dissatisfied with your married life, for your husband or wife is the best one for you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Out of a hundred married people, probably not one husband would say that he is satisfied with his wife, and probably not one wife would say that she is satisfied with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before we were married, we all had a dream about married life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Eventually, our marriage turned out to be the opposite of our dream.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But whatever our husband or wife is like, he or she is God's gift to us and is exactly what we need.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Throughout my whole life I have never seen a person whose second marriage, after remarrying following a divorce, was better than the first.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I know of some who were married four times and who have said that each marriage was worse than the preceding one.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The marriage of those who have been chosen by God is under His sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rebekah was brought to Isaac and she became his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whether she was good or bad, she was Isaac's destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He had no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I have had much experience in spiritual life, in human life, and in married life, and I can advise you not to take your choice.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you make your own choice, you will suffer.</S>
