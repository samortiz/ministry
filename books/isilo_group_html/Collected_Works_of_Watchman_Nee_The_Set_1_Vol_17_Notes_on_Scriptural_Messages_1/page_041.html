Once when a woman discussed this matter with me, I asked if she believed. She was not an eloquent person and did not have much knowledge. She told me that her grandparents and her parents were all believers and that she herself was also a believer. Having said that, she recited to me the Ten Commandments, just to show me that she knew something about religion. Then I told her, "We believers have nothing that we cannot say. May I ask you a question? If you were to die now, could you say that you are saved?" She answered, "I dare not say this. I am trying my best to behave well, help others, and serve the Lord. When that day comes, if the Lord is merciful to me and lets me go to heaven, it will be wonderful. If He is not merciful to save me, I will not be saved." I began to explain many things to her. After some time she began to understand. Had I not explained all this to her, she would still be saying, "I will try my best to behave, sacrifice, and suffer, hoping that one day I will be saved."</P><P>Once I was talking to a young, knowledgeable seminary student. He was not clear concerning the matter of salvation. He said, "I am trying my best to work and do good. In the future if God says that I am worthy to go to heaven, I will be saved. Saying that I am saved while I am on the earth today is too boastful and proud." I had to spend much time with him before he was brought to an understanding of his position in salvation.</P><P>In my public and private meetings with people, I have met many believers who dare not say that they are saved. They refuse to believe that the Bible is the Word of God. Whatever God says, it is so. Whatever God says will not change; it will definitely come to pass. Many people think, "I should try my best to work and to do good, hoping that God will save me in the future." However, hoping is not believing. Please remember that every time the Bible mentions faith, it is in reference to accomplished facts in the past and not to things in the future. All those who hope to be saved have a problem with their faith concerning the Lord's accomplished salvation. They hope to receive God's promise and grace, but they will not believe in Him. God is not pleased with such an attitude.</P><P>Now we want to examine another matter. Can a believer know that he has eternal life? Can he know that he is already saved? Concerning this matter, I would not say anything and would not ask you to say anything. Let this book-the Bible-speak to us. Let us now read a few portions of the Scriptures to see if we can know that we have eternal life.</P><P>First, please read 1 John 5:13: "I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God." We have to grasp the last sentence of this verse. Does it tell you to hope? Not at all. It says that we should know that we have eternal life. To whom does John write the letter? To those who believe into the name of the Son of God. Who is the Son of God? He is Christ. What did John say when he wrote to those who believe in Jesus Christ? He wrote so that they may know that they have eternal life. Does a believer have eternal life? The Bible says that we can know this. John's purpose in writing is to let those who believe into the name of the Son of God know that they have eternal life.</P><P>Next let us look at Acts 13:38-39: "Therefore let it be known to you, men, brothers, that through this One forgiveness of sins is announced to you; and from all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified." What does the first sentence say? Does it say, "Brothers, be hopeful"? or "Brothers, you should believe"? Not at all. It does not say to hope or to believe; rather, it says, "Let it be known to you, men, brothers, that through this One forgiveness of sins is announced to you; and from all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified." Can we know that we are justified and forgiven? Paul's word says that we can. He says that we should know that we are justified and forgiven. Those who believe should know this and should not need others to tell them this.</P><P>Let us see 2 Corinthians 5:1: "For we know that if our earthly tabernacle dwelling is taken down, we have a building from God, a dwelling not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens." Unlike the last verse in Acts, which says that we should know, this verse is a command. It says clearly that we know. It seems to be telling us that no one needs to explain, there is no need to struggle to understand, and the matter should be very apparent. What is it that we should know? Paul says, "For we know that if our earthly tabernacle dwelling (our physical body) is taken down, we have a building from God, a dwelling (our resurrected body) not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens." Paul knew assuredly that if our earthly bodies die, we will have resurrected and eternal bodies in the heavens. In other words, Paul knew that we are saved. The words here are stated most clearly; there is no ambiguity at all. Paul was very careful in saying these words. Otherwise, others may misunderstand, saying, "Since Paul is an apostle and has worked so well, surely he will go to heaven when he dies. But I am not that fervent, and I do not love the Lord that much. If I die, I may not have a resurrected body." Paul was very careful in saying what he said. He did not say, "I know if my earthly tabernacle dwelling is taken down." Paul used we. This includes not just you and me, but all those who believe in the Lord. If our earthly tabernacle dwelling is taken down, we have a building from God, a dwelling not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens. This shows us once more that whoever believes may know that he has eternal life and is saved.</P><P>Following this, verses 6 and 8 say, "Therefore being always of good courage and knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are abroad from the Lord...we are of good courage then and are well pleased rather to be abroad from the body and at home with the Lord." Paul had no doubt concerning where he would go after he departed from his body; He was certain that he would not go to the eternal dreadful place. He knew that he would be with the Lord forever. Therefore, he was confident and was not afraid of death at all. This shows us again that we do not have to wait for the future; we can know today whether we are saved.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 17: Notes on Scriptural Messages (1) &nbsp; pg 41</div><br></body></html>
