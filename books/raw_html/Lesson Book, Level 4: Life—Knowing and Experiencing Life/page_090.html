<h2 class=head1>III. NOURISHING THE NEW ONES IN CHRIST</h2><p>After they have believed and are baptized, they are saved (Mark 16:16), and have been born of God (John 1:12) to be members of the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:12-13). Since they are regenerated through the living and abiding word (1 Pet. 1:23), they are as babes needing to be fed with the milk of the word that they may grow (1 Pet. 2:2).<p>Firstly, we have to use verses such as John 3:5-6; 4:23-24; and 1 Corinthians 6:17 to show them that the Holy Spirit has entered their spirit to give it life, and that these two spirits have been mingled into one spirit. From now on, they must strengthen their mingled, regenerated spirit by calling on the name of the Lord (1 Cor. 12:3) and by praying (Eph. 6:18). Secondly, we must use verses such as John 6:63, 2 Timothy 3:16, 1 Peter 2:2, and Matthew 4:4 to show them that the Word of God is Spirit and life to be the supply to their regenerated spirit as spiritual air, water, and food. They need to pray-read and read the Word of God every day to be filled with the Spirit and grow in life. Thirdly, We must use verses such as Romans 8:6 and Galatians 5:16 to show them that we have a sense of life within us that is of the mingled regenerated spirit. From now on they need to live and walk by the sense of life within them. This sense of life is the sense of the mingled regenerated spirit. We sense life and peace whenever we are doing things according to the spirit. We sense death whenever we are doing things according to the flesh.<p>These three points are the three foundation stones of the Christian life. The new ones must be clear about them and practice them to be established in their faith. There are many other points you may use to help your new ones. Chapter nineteen of The Scriptural Way to Meet and to Serve for the Building Up of the Body of Christ will render you further help.<h2 class=head1>IV. PERFECTING THE YOUNGER ONES TO FUNCTION</h2><p>After the new ones become more established in the faith, you need to perfect them further. You must teach them everything you have learned (Matt. 28:20; 2 Tim. 2:2). You must cause them to be just like you: loving the Lord, having morning revival, living a victorious life, etc. As you sow Christ into them as a seed of life (John 12:24), they will grow up to love the Lord just like you. If you have kept your first love toward the Lord, they will have the first love toward the Lord. If you are living uniquely for the gospel, they will live uniquely for the gospel. If you help your friends receive salvation, they also can help their friends receive salvation. Whatever you are in life, they will be. Whatever you are perfected in, they will be perfected by you in the same things (Eph. 4:11-12). The apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 11:1, “Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ.’’ You can say the same thing to your new ones. If to you to live is Christ (Phil. 1:21a), then to them to live will also be Christ. This is too wonderful! You will be a little apostle, a little evangelist, a little prophet, a little shepherd and teacher. If you would do this for ten years, you will surely experience much life and you will grow in life. After ten years, you may become a mature apostle, evangelist, prophet, shepherd and teacher.
