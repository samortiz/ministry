<h1 class="title">EATING AND DRINKING CHRIST<br />
IN 1 CORINTHIANS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 3:2a, 6, 9b, 11-12a; 5:7b-8a; 10:3-4, 16-17, 21; 11:23-26; 12:13b; 15:20; Rev. 22:14, 17</h1>
<p>At the beginning of the Bible there is the tree of life for man&rsquo;s eating, and there is also a river that signifies the river of water of life (Gen. 2:9-10, 16; Rev. 22:1-2). In the New Testament the Lord Jesus told His disciples that they needed to eat Him and drink Him (John 6:35, 48, 51, 54, 57; 4:14; 7:37-39). In the second of the Epistles, the book of 1 Corinthians, there are a number of verses related to eating and drinking. Throughout the past centuries the matters of eating and drinking the Lord have never been as clear in this book as they are today. Many expositions of 1 Corinthians say almost nothing about eating and drinking the Lord. Instead, they speak concerning teachings and spiritual gifts, especially the gift of speaking in tongues. However, the verses in this book concerning eating and drinking are strong and strategic. When we read them, we can sense Paul&rsquo;s particular tone and utterance.</p>
<p>As we saw in the previous message, 1 Corinthians 1 tells us that the believers in Christ are those who call on the name of the Lord. According to this chapter, we are the called saints, and God has called us into the fellowship of His Son. In addition, we are those who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ (vv. 2, 9). This is a two-way calling. First, God called us, and now we call on the Lord Jesus. We have not been called by God to be dumb; we have been called to call. We are the called ones and the calling ones. To call on the name of the Lord is to participate in Him as our allotted portion. Christ as our portion is the power of God and the wisdom of God as righteousness for our past (vv. 24, 30). Since our past was so miserable, we need the Lord Jesus to be our righteousness so that we may be justified by God. Christ as the wisdom of God is also sanctification for our present and redemption for our future. He is everything to us in relation to the three stages of time. Christ as our portion is fully adequate to meet our need.</p>
<p>Then chapter 2 tells us how to participate in Christ as our portion. We need to realize that our portion today is the divine Spirit in our spirit. Therefore, we must live in our spirit as spiritual men, not in our soul as soulish men (vv. 10-15). A soulish man relies on his mind to think and to meditate. This is to use the wrong organ to contact the Lord. We need to stop our mentality and turn to our spirit, where Jesus is (2 Tim. 4:22). This is the way to touch the Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17; Rom. 8:16). It is not adequate for us simply to make up our mind to turn to our spirit. The more we do this, the more we will remain in our mind and our will, which are parts of our soul. Moreover, the more we remain in our soul, the more soulish we will be. The best way to turn to our spirit to meet the divine Spirit as our portion for our enjoyment is to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not sufficient for us to simply talk about the need to exercise our feet. If this is all we do, our feet will eventually be out of function. The way to exercise our feet is either to walk, run, or jump. Likewise, the most prevailing way to exercise our spirit is to call on the name of the Lord. If a person receives only the teaching concerning the exercise of the spirit, one day when someone bothers him, he may think, &ldquo;I was told that this is the time to turn to my spirit. Now I should do it.&rdquo; Eventually, however, he may forget the teaching and speak a harsh word to that person. To merely have a teaching without applying it is the wrong way. When we are troubled by something, we need to stop the exercise of our mind and say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus. Praise the Lord! Amen.&rdquo; This is the best way to turn to our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FED WITH CHRIST FOR THE GROWTH IN LIFE</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 3:2 Paul says, &ldquo;I gave you milk to drink,&rdquo; and in verse 6 he says, &ldquo;I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth.&rdquo; All mothers know that the way to help their children grow is not by teaching them. The only way for a child to grow is for someone to feed him. Paul planted something in the Corinthians, and Apollos followed to water what Paul had planted. Then God honored the planting and the watering by causing the growth. Feeding brings in growth. This is why we do not like to follow Christianity in the way of emphasizing teachings. Rather, we prefer to follow the apostle Paul to feed the saints, to minister food and nourishment to the brothers and sisters so that they may grow. In the past years we have seen the saints grow day by day and year after year. In the local churches the saints are always growing. I do not like to criticize anyone, but I must speak the facts. I was in Christianity for many years, and I observed that people remained the same year after year. Some attend Sunday school every Sunday morning and remain under certain teachings for many years, but they do not have any growth. However, attending even one meeting in the local churches causes us to be different.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING CHRIST AS THE PASSOVER FEAST</h2>
<p>The only way to grow is by eating. Paul tells us that Christ is our Passover (5:7b-8a). When many Christians speak of the Passover, they emphasize the applying of the blood (Exo. 12:7, 13). Few ever speak of the enjoyment of the passover feast. To the children of Israel, the Passover was a great enjoyment. They not only put the blood on the doorposts, but they also ate the lamb with unleavened bread and bitter herbs (v. 8). This is why Paul says, &ldquo;Let us keep the feast&rdquo; (1 Cor. 5:8). He did not tell us to keep the ritual, the commandment, or the teaching; he told us to keep the feast. The Christian life and the church life are a feast that we keep every day. When many of us were in Christianity, we kept the fast, not the feast, because there was nothing there to eat, but in the church life we keep the feast. I have been on the way of the church life for over forty years, and it has always been a feast to me. Some have criticized us for being beside ourselves in our enjoyment. To be sure, we are beside ourselves in our church feast (2 Cor. 5:13). After meeting with the saints, we are all joyful and filled.</p>
