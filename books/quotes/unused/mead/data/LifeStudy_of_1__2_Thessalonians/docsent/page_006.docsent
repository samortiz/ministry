   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE TWO CHARACTERISTICS OF A HOLY LIFE FOR THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 1:4-10</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The more we read the book of 1 Thessalonians, the more we realize that it truly was written to young believers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this Epistle Paul is speaking to new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>SELECTED BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1:4 he says, "Knowing, brothers beloved by God, your selection."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Selection refers to God's choosing before the foundation of the world for His eternal purpose Eph 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The apostles knew that the brothers beloved by God were chosen in such a manner by God for the fulfillment of His heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The apostles knew that the Thessalonians were included among God's selected people, His chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Their selection had been made manifest to such an extent that the apostles had the assurance that the Thessalonian believers had been selected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fact that the Thessalonians had been selected by God was manifested by their reaction to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How do we know that we have been selected?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We know this by the way we respond to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a person rejects the gospel, that is a sign that he has not been selected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But if he accepts the gospel willingly in a positive way, that acceptance is a sign, an indicator, that he surely has been selected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God selected us in eternity, before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in time He comes to us in the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now it is a matter of our reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If our reaction is positive, that is a positive sign, a sign that we have been selected.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if our reaction is negative, that is a negative sign, a sign that we have not been selected.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The apostles knew that the Thessalonians had been selected by God because of their ready and willing acceptance of the gospel in a very positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No doubt, Paul's word in 1:4 concerning selection is directed to young believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>New Christians need to be helped to know that they have been selected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The foundation of our salvation was not laid in this age; rather, it was laid in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Based upon His selection, God saves us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, with God's selection as the foundation, the Spirit moves us to believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The move of the Spirit in this way is based upon the foundation of selection laid in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should try to help new believers realize God's selection as the eternal foundation of their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all need to see that in eternity past we were selected by God and that our being in the church today is a sign of this eternal selection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, in 1:4 Paul could say, "Knowing, brothers beloved by God, your selection."</S>
