   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Satan is God's adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Matthew 13:28a is nearly the only verse in the New Testament which tells us that Satan is God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Matthew 13:28 the word enemy is used, but we have to realize that Satan is not only God's enemy but also God's adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is because he is within the circle where God is Job 1:6 .</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was and still is not only an enemy from outside but also an adversary from inside.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to point out that in the universe God has an enemy and even an adversary within His kingdom.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Genesis 3:1 shows that Satan hid himself in the subtle serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For this point we can also use 2 Corinthians 11:3 and Revelation 12:9.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Satan is always hiding himself in some thing, in some matter, or even in some person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Matthew 16 Satan was hiding himself in Peter, so the Lord Jesus even called Peter, "Satan" v. 23 . When Satan first came to man, he was hiding himself in a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because Satan was hiding himself in the serpent, eventually his name is called the ancient serpent in Revelation 12:9.</S>
