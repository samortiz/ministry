   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT A MATTER OF DOING GOOD OR EVIL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BUT A MATTER OF DOING EVERYTHING IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 7 and 8 are two chapters in the Bible that are completely different from each other.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The focus of chapter seven is altogether different from that of chapter eight; thus, the central points of these two chapters are also different.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The central point of chapter seven is that the I wants to do good and does not want to do evil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What it speaks of is related to the matter of good and evil, and what it focuses on is whether the I does good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we come to chapter eight, it is altogether not a matter of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In chapter eight there is only spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Chapter eight does not speak of the I doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, it says that we should no longer live in the flesh but in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Chapter eight does not speak of doing good or doing evil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, it is concerned with whether we do things in the flesh or in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This shows us that Romans 7 and 8 are absolutely different.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In chapter seven it is a matter of good or evil, that is, a matter of what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in chapter eight it is a matter of the flesh or the spirit, that is, a matter of who does it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Chapter seven focuses on what we do good or evil, whereas chapter eight focuses on who does it the flesh or the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not say that only what is evil is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In God s eyes even what is good may be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only what is done by the spirit is right.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, suppose there is a sister who, after waking up in the morning, becomes irritated by her child because he does not listen to her.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At that time what is the right thing for her to do to pray or to get angry?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course, we all would say that she should pray, because it is right to pray and wrong to get angry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, does the problem end there?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Would it be enough for our sister to no longer be angry and to kneel down to pray?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose that when she kneels down to pray, she truly thanks and praises the Lord that although she should have been angry, she is not and instead is praying.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Most people would say that this sister is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am afraid that even we would testify for her, saying how good she is because she has such a good testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She should have been angry, but instead she asked the Lord, Should I be angry, or should I pray?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the end she prayed, so we would praise her.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, please remember that this matter does not end there.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to ask a further question: When she knelt down to pray, was she the one praying, or was it the Lord who was praying?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Did she put up with her child by herself and force herself to pray, or was the Lord praying with her?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These two situations are completely different and are very serious.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>LIVING IN THE LORD AND BEING MINGLED</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many times when we kneel down to pray, we are the ones who are praying.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In other words, the Lord is not with us in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the sister with the disobedient child kneels down to pray in the morning, she may say, O Lord, You see that this child is very disobedient, and I should have beaten him, but I did not beat him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, I came to pray and tell You this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While she is saying this, however, within her there may be a voice saying, O Lord, look how disobedient this sister is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>While she is bringing her accusations concerning the child s disobedience to the Lord, deep within her there may be another voice accusing her, saying, You are also disobedient.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She may persist, saying, O Lord, I told him three or four times to obey, but he still did not listen to me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then the Lord may say in her, You are just the same.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have told you to obey three or four times, yet you still do not listen to me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, this kind of prayer may be the sister s praying in herself, not the Lord s putting her on to pray or the Lord s mingling with her in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then what kind of prayer is the Lord s prayer in us?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many times we are the same as that sister.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we pray, it is often the faculties of our soul our mind, emotion, and will that pray.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We often pray according to our resolution, thought, emotion, and preference.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At these times, however, the Spirit of God, the Lord Himself, will often give us the feeling in our spirit that our children s disobedience is to remind us that we are also disobedient before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We may start by praying before the Lord concerning our children, but gradually, we will bring our own situation before Him and pray for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Here we see that there are two layers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the superficial layer we may pray concerning our children.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the activity of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the deeper layer, however, we may have a feeling in our spirit that our situation is not good and that we need to pray for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we do not care for this feeling in our spirit but merely pray according to the activity of our soul, saying, O Lord, this child is disobedient, the Lord within us will not pray with us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Instead, He will condemn and enlighten us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we have learned the spiritual lesson, we would cease immediately, turn to our spirit, follow the feeling in our spirit, speak with the Lord, and move with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We would open our mouth and say, O Lord, I have not listened to You for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I am a rebellious one.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even though You told me to obey three or four times, I still did not listen to You.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At such a time, are we praying from our soul or from our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are praying from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Is it we who are praying or is it the Lord who is praying?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is the Lord putting us on to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is the Lord praying in coordination with us and we praying in coordination with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we do not pray like this, we will pray from the soul according to our preferences, decisions, and ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Sometimes we may even pray to a point where we cry, O Lord, I really do not know how to deal with this child.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The wonderful thing is that it is at this time that we have another feeling deep within us that we truly do not have any way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, we have to see that there are two layers in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We may pray on the superficial layer or on the deeper layer.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Do not merely ask whether it is right to be angry or to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To know this is insufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We must ask ourselves further whether it is we who pray or the Lord putting us on to pray and whether it is our soul or our spirit praying.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Hence, in our Christian living we should not merely ask what to do but how to do a certain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We must ask who is doing it the flesh or the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Are we doing it by the soul or by the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Are we doing it, or is the Lord who puts us on doing it?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Christian living is not a living outside of the Lord, that is, a living in which we reject evil and do good by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is merely the living of a Gentile or of a good man.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Christian living is a living that is in the Lord and is mingled with the Spirit of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This kind of living is one that also rejects evil and does good, but in this kind of living we do not do these things by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Rather, we are mingled with the Lord, and we do these things with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is the Lord doing them by putting us on and by being mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Our living should not be merely a good living but a living that is the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is a living that is God mingled with man and man mingled with God, the two being mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is the Christian living.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Hence, in our Christian living we should not merely ask whether or not it is right to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Rather, we should ask who is doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Only when we are in the mingled spirit, in which God mingles with man and man mingles with God, and only in such a spirit of living can we have the proper Christian living and service.</S>
