<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE REVIVED TO DEVELOP<br />
THE ORGANIC FUNCTION</h2>
<p>I hope these words will give you a deep impression that you will have a new beginning and be revived from within: those who did not taste the Lord before will now be able to taste the Lord, those who did not enter into the Lord&rsquo;s words before can now enter in. In this way, your spirit will be strong, and you will be rich in the enjoyment of the Lord&rsquo;s word. Then when you come to the meetings, you will speak the Lord&rsquo;s word. Strictly speaking, the Lord&rsquo;s word does not start in the meeting. It starts from the time you wake up in the morning. You should speak to the Lord, and you should pray-read the word of the Lord. By the time you go to work and meet your colleagues, or when you go to school and meet your classmates, you should speak the word of the Lord at any time. During the day, whenever you meet someone, you should speak the word of the Lord. Do this until the evening when you come to the meeting.</p>
<p>If you are such a person, then whether you go to the home meeting, the group meeting, or the district meeting, you will be a supplier. You will always be one that nourishes others. Actually, when you nourish others, you will be the first one to be nourished. In a meeting, the first one to be nourished is always the speaker. If you do not speak, you are depriving yourself of any nourishment. The minute you speak, you nourish yourself, and you nourish others. As a result, all the saints nourish one another and are nourished by one another. This kind of meeting brings out the riches of the Lord&rsquo;s life in us, just as those digging gold from the mine. Such meetings also develop the organic ability and function within each one.</p>
<p>This morning I am like a crowing rooster. I am giving all of you trainees a warning. First, I hope that you would change your concepts and would have a full understanding of the new way. Do not go to the home meetings or group meetings with the thought that you have seniority. You must be renewed continually. Every day you should be living and fresh. Then, when you go to work, you should forget about the old ways. Do not ask what the new method is, for it is not a matter of the method, but of the person, whether or not your person is living. Within us, we all have the vigorous life of the Lord, which is the Triune God. Also, we have a living Bible in our hands. As long as our spirits are living and bubbling, and as long as we enjoy the Triune God through the Bible daily, we will surely be able to practice the new way.</p>
