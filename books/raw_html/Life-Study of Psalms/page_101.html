<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Seeking to Dwell in the House of God<br>All the Days of His Life</H2><P>David said that he sought to dwell in the house of God all the days of his life (Psa. 27:4-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. To Behold the Beauty<br>(Loveliness, Pleasantness, Delightfulness) of God</H2><P>In Psalm 27:4 David said that he desired to behold the beauty of Jehovah in His house. The Hebrew word for beauty implies loveliness, pleasantness, and delightfulness. When we are beholding God's beauty, we are in a very pleasant atmosphere. Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we can have an unveiled face to behold the glorious face of the Lord in glory. In our time with the Lord in the morning, it is best to have short prayers with a number of "selahs" so that we can behold the Lord, look at the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. To Inquire of God</H2><P>The psalmist also inquired of God in His temple (Psa. 27:4b). This means that we can check with God about everything in our daily life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. To Be Concealed in God's Shelter</H2><P>In Psalm 27:5 David said, "For He will conceal me in His shelter/In the evil day." God conceals His saints in His shelter in the evil day.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. To Hide Himself in the Hiding Place of God's Tent</H2><P>The psalmist also said that God would hide him in the hiding place of God's tent. We need to differentiate between the notions of concealing and hiding. When evils, calamities, are taking place, we can be concealed in God's shelter, and the evils cannot "see" us, cannot affect us. When someone is trying to capture us, there is a hiding place in God's tent where no one can find us. To be concealed is for getting away from the damage of calamities. To hide is for getting away from the ones who want to get us. The house of God is both a shelter and a hiding place.</P><P>I can testify that throughout the years, I have been concealed in God's shelter in the evil day and hidden in the hiding place of God's tent. According to my experience, I should have died at least three times. But on the one hand, the Lord concealed me, and on the other hand, the Lord hid me from the ones who were trying to get me.</P>
