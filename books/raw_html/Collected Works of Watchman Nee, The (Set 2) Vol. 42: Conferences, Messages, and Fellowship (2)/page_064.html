<h2 class="head1">GOD'S REMEDY</h2><p>Originally, God only had to do one thing&mdash;cause Adam to receive the life of God. If man would have received God's life, His goal in creating man would have been fulfilled. But Adam sinned. God now must do two things. In the garden of Eden, He only had to do one thing to accomplish His purpose. But after man left the garden of Eden, God had to do two things. First, He had to deal with man's sin. Second, He had to cause man to receive His life. God wants man to receive His life&mdash;this is His eternal purpose which He purposed before the ages. His dealing with man's sin and His saving grace for man are simply His remedial actions. God did not intend for Adam to sin; Adam's sin was an incidental matter. Hence, God's dealing with sin is also an incidental work; it is not according to His original purpose. For example, when you drive a car, you have no intention to overturn the car; your intention is to arrive safely at your destination. However, you may have an accident, overturning the car and hurting yourself. Then you need to take care of your injury and fix the car before you can resume your journey. In the same way, God created man with a purpose. Yet man fell, and God had to do a remedial work before He could bring man back to His original purpose.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW GOD ACCOMPLISHED HIS ORIGINAL PURPOSE</h2><p>Now let us see how God saves us and brings us back to His original purpose in creation. After man fell, he not only needed to be saved from sin, he also needed to be saved from just being a man. What makes the Bible so distinct is that it not only says that a sinner should no longer be a sinner, but that a man should no longer be a man. Hallelujah! We do not have to be a sinner, and we do not have to be just a man. God wants man to live out His life in order for man to speak what he could not otherwise speak, to do what he could not otherwise do, and to live in a way that he could not otherwise live. Until we reach this point, we are at best like Adam in the garden of Eden; we are not yet men according to His will and not yet sons of God. God's purpose is to put His life within man so that man can live Him. When God is in man, man becomes God's son, and spontaneously he is able to live out the sermon on the mount.</p><h2 class="head2">The Need of the Blood</h2><p>After man fell, his greatest problem was that he had sinned and become a sinner. This is why the Bible speaks of the need of the blood. Leviticus 17:11 says that life is in the blood and that it is therefore needed for the atonement of sin. Hebrews 9:22 says, "Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness." The Bible speaks of the blood over four hundred times. When man sins, he has to be punished, and the punishment comes in the form of the shedding of blood. When a man's blood is shed, life is gone; when life is gone, the soul is gone; and when the soul is gone, the man is dead.</p><h2 class="head2">The Picture of the Passover</h2><p>The Passover in the Old Testament is a picture of God's work of redemption. Exodus 12:2-13 speaks of the Passover. At the Passover, God took away man's sin and delivered him from His judgment through a substitutionary lamb. He told the children of Israel that the angel of destruction would come, and that the firstborn of all the households that did not put blood on the doorpost and side posts would be killed. The firstborn represents the sinner, because the first man was out of the earth and earthy (1 Cor. 15:47). Every household of Israel killed a lamb and struck the blood on the doorpost and sideposts. This blood is objective; it is not for man to see, but for God to see. If you were in the house, you "could not see the blood; the blood is for God to see. God said, "When I see the blood..." The word "I" is very important. The blood of Christ is not for us to see, but for God to see. The question is not how we strike the blood and how we apply it, but who is the One who sees it. A sinner can say to God, "Do to me according to Your valuation of the blood." This is what the Passover has done for us.</p><h2 class="head2">According to God's Righteousness</h2><p>Once I was traveling to Kiu-Kiang, and I met a Muslim on the way. I told him that if God appointed a way of salvation, it would have to be compatible with His own righteousness and holiness. In other words, the way must be proper in God's eyes and must also be proper in our eyes. One cannot be saved according to any way that he thinks is right; he can only put his trust in the sufficiency of God's way of salvation. If the righteous God thinks that a way is good enough, an unrighteous sinner should conclude that it is good enough. God has accomplished everything. What else should we do? We can say, "Thank the Lord that my sins are all forgiven. All my sins, great or small, obvious or hidden, noble or vile, good or bad, are covered by the blood. I do not have to be afraid when I come to God." God says that my sins have been dealt with already, and I also say that my sins have been dealt with already. This is faith.</p><p>Once D. L. Moody was preaching to a man who was afraid that the blood of Christ would not be sufficient to take away his sins. Moody asked, "If one of Noah's daughters-in-law had entered the ark, but was afraid that it would leak, would she have not been saved because of this?" The man said, "Of course not." Moody then pointed out to him that his view of the blood would not diminish the effectiveness of the blood in any way. Through this word the man became clear.</p>
