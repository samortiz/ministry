   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TO THE BROTHERS IN YIYANG AND KUEIXI</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We want to thank God for showing us the way of migration and for moving a group of brothers and sisters this way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some brothers and sisters migrated from here to Yiyang and Kueixi on the twenty-third of this month.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before we parted, I felt a heavy burden to speak a word to the migrating brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The main idea is summarized here:</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, "I do all things for the sake of the gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The goal of migration is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The gospel speaks of love, sacrifice, denial of self, and giving.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, after migrating to Kiangsi, all elements of our living, whether clothing, food, or travel, must be in accordance with the main goal of being "for the gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even our loving of one another must be for the same goal.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, "unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the gospel is to be preached, a great price must be paid.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must be like grains of wheat planted into Kiangsi.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must die in Kiangsi; only then will we be able to bear much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are already taking this way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because of the Lord's love, we are willing to give up a more comfortable life and live for the gospel in a remote area.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For the future of the migrations and for the way of the gospel, I feel that I must present a word to you:</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First, please do not give the brothers and sisters who migrated from Shanghai special treatment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is only right that they have the same food, clothing, and lifestyle as the rest of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the one hand, it is good that you showed your love toward the brothers and sisters from Shanghai, but in reality "differing love" is a hateful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, its influence on further migrations is too great.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For the sake of giving the Lord a way, I hope you will not pay attention to personal feelings but will speak the truth in love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I hope you will avoid divisions among you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It does not matter how much education or talent you have.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All are brothers and sisters, and all should do the same work and receive the same treatment and care.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only give the elderly and sick extra food and rest according to their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second, all should labor together, working with their own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not have some overburdened while others are idle, doing nothing but sitting and enjoying the fruit of others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Work and rest, labor, and enjoyment should all be equal.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>May you live out the testimony of the Body so that the gospel may flow out through you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>May God bless you!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Chang Yu-zhi</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>January 25, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A DESIRE TO MIGRATE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is truly God's will to spread the gospel through migrations.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Abraham lived a life of migration.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He established a testimony in his migrations.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I, too, have a desire to migrate.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have handed over the responsibility for the church in Anchang to others, and I feel peaceful and assured.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If God allows, my family hopes to migrate to Kiangsi this year.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do the brothers want me to serve in Yiyang or in Kueixi?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Please give me direction.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Fei Chang-bao</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>January 15, 1950</S>
