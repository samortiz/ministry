   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Releasing the Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ s death was not only a terminating but also a releasing death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His death released the divine life concealed within Him John 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 12:24 says that a grain of wheat remains alone unless it is sown into the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If it is sown into the earth, it dies and then grows up to become many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This illustrates the releasing death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His death not only terminates all negative things; it also releases the divine life the unique positive thing in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When Christ died, a soldier pierced His side and out came blood and water John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These are symbols.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Blood signifies redemption, and water signifies life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Blood and water are symbols of the two aspects of Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The negative aspect is redemption, and the positive aspect is the release of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He died, and the life within Him was released.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through His death not only did the redeeming blood flow out; the divine life also flowed out from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today when we believe in Him, we receive the blood and obtain the living water, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We receive redemption and we obtain eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>RESURRECTED</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the third day after His death, Christ resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some wonderful things have been carried out through His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Glorified in the Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First, in His resurrection Christ was glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a carnation seed is sown, it dies under the earth, and then it grows up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When it blossoms, that blossoming is its glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Jesus was the unique seed of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before His death, the divine life was concealed within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His humanity was the shell.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When His humanity was broken on the cross, the divine life came out from within Him, and He was glorified in that life John 7:39; Luke 24:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ s entering into resurrection was like the blossoming of the carnation seed: He was glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Becoming the Firstborn Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>with Many Brothers</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Second, in resurrection Christ was born as the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Not many Christians realize that to Jesus Christ resurrection was a birth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Incarnation was His birth as a man, but resurrection was His birth in His humanity as the firstborn Son of God Acts 13:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ as the Son of God has two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before His resurrection He was the only begotten Son John 1:14; 3:16 ; then in resurrection He was born of God as the firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Christ was incarnated, He put on humanity; however, His humanity was not divine.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was through death and resurrection that His humanity was brought into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, Acts 13:33 tells us that in His resurrection He was born.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The only begotten Son became the firstborn Son Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ephesians 2:6 tells us that in Christ s resurrection we, His believers, were also resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When He was crucified, we were crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When He was resurrected, we were resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In His resurrection He was born as the firstborn Son of God, and we also were born as the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He became the Firstborn, and we became His many brothers John 20:17; Heb 2:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Bible makes clear that before we were born, we were crucified with Christ and resurrected with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In resurrection He was born as the firstborn Son of God, and in His resurrection we also were born as the many sons of God 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He became the Firstborn among us, His many brothers.</S>
