[2]  Volume 53 of The Collected Works, The Ministry of God's Word, contains eighteen lessons given by Watchman Nee to his co-workers in a training at Kuling between 1948 and 1949.
[3]  Acts 6:4 says, "But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word."
[4]  The phrase ministry of the word can be translated as "service of the word."
[5]  The work of serving men with God's word is known as the ministry of the word, and the persons who are involved in this service are called ministers of the word.
[6]  The announcing of God's word and the ministry of this word to men follow specific principles, and God's servants should learn these principles well.
[7]  When man's opinion was added to God's word in the Old Testament, the word ceased to be God's word.
[8]  Hence, we can say that the feeling of the Lord Jesus was the feeling of God's word, His thoughts were the thoughts of God's word, and His opinions were the opinions of God's word.
[9]  There is another kind of minister of the word in the New Testament the apostles.
[10]  In the Old Testament the ministry of the word was realized when the word came upon a man and the man's voice was used as a carrier.
[11]  In the Lord Jesus the ministry of the word was not through the visitation of the word but through the embodiment of the word as a man.
[12]  Everything that belonged to this man was being employed by the word, because every aspect of this man was in harmony with God's word.
[13]  The difference between the New Testament ministry of the word and the Lord's ministry of the word is this: In the case of the Lord Jesus, who was God's word becoming flesh, first there was God's word and then there was flesh to match this word.
[14]  A New Testament minister of the word not only has God's word and not only releases God's word with his human voice but expresses God's word through his human life in its full dimensions.
[15]  The New Testament is full of human elements, yet it is all God's word.
[16]  Every writer has his own style, expression, and characteristic, and God uses these characteristics to express His word through them.
[17]  There are human marks and human characteristics, yet it is still God's word.
[18]  In the New Testament ministry God entrusts His word to man, and He uses man's very own elements to express His word.
[19]  Today God does not want His word to remain His word alone; He wants His word to be spoken through man's mouth in a way that it is seen as man's word.
[20]  In 2 Corinthians 2:4 Paul said, "For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you through many tears."
[21]  In writing to the Corinthians, Paul was serving them God's word.
[22]  While he was writing, his human elements were mingled with God's word, and he released God's word this way.
[23]  He was not like a tongue-speaker, who receives a word and passes it on without the mind having any effect upon the word itself.
[24]  Through the word we can find the extent to which a man has been taught by God, disciplined by God, and tested by God.
[25]  The Bible shows us that God transmits His word in a way that transcends all human concepts.
[26]  According to our concept God can spread His word and make His speaking known in at least two ways.
[27]  First, He could create something in nature similar to a tape recorder that would convey His word to man.
[28]  If man can invent a tape recorder, God certainly can create something in the universe which would faithfully convey His word verbatim.
[29]  If God were to convey His word to man this way, there would be no possibility of mistakes; everyone could hear God's pure word.
[30]  If God used something like a tape recorder to transmit His word, there would be very little chance of error, and God could continually repeat His word.
[31]  Human elements occupy a crucial place in the word of God.
[32]  Since God's word is full of human elements, He also includes man in the transmission of His word.
[33]  Since God's word is full of human elements, God cannot use a tape recorder, thunder, lightning, or angels to communicate His word.
[34]  Human elements must be involved in the communication of His word.
[35]  God's word has to pass through our spirit and even our mind, feelings, and understanding and then be converted into our own words before it can be released.
[36]  If we receive a word from God and send out the same word verbatim, we are acting merely as a recording machine.
[37]  We must always bear in mind the meaning of the ministry of the word.
[38]  The ministry of the word means the outflow of God's Spirit in His divine word through man.
[39]  It is not the independent release of God's Spirit in His word but the release of His Spirit in His word in conjunction with man.
[40]  This is the significance of the ministry of the word.
[41]  We have discussed already the nature of God's word.
[42]  God's word contains many human elements, yet it nevertheless remains God's word.
[43]  We have also seen that the ministry of the word consists of the release of this human-impregnated word through human faculties such as the memory, understanding, thoughts, heart, spirit, and utterance.
[44]  This is the reason that it is so important for a minister of the word to be proper before God when he preaches the word.
[45]  Let us turn our attention to Paul's Epistles to the Corinthians, in particular to the manner in which he fulfilled his ministry of the word.
[46]  A brother once said that of all the books of the Bible, the Corinthian Epistles, and in particular 1 Corinthians 7, show us the peak of human experience.
[47]  This is the "human element" which we discussed earlier.
[48]  This is an outstanding and stark example of man's elements being employed in God's word.
[49]  Here was a man who was disciplined, restricted, and broken by the Lord to the extent that he could speak even when he was very clear that the Lord had not said anything.
[50]  Yet in the end, his word became the word of the Holy Spirit.
[51]  God had worked in him to such an extent that he could almost speak God's word without having God's word.
[52]  With many servants of the Lord, God's word can be found in them only when a word is put into their mouth, and when it is not placed in their mouth, they do not have any word.
[53]  This is not a matter of whether or not we have God's word in our mouth but a matter of whether we have been beaten to the point where God can entrust His word to us.
[54]  Let us turn to 1 Corinthians 14:29-32, which says, "And as to prophets, two or three should speak, and the others discern.
[55]  Here we find a basic principle: In releasing God's word, the Holy Spirit decides what should be spoken, but the prophets decide when and how the word should be spoken.
[56]  But when the Lord gives us the word, we still have to decide how and when we should speak such a word.
[57]  A characteristic of Paul was God's ability to use him and God's willingness to entrust him.
[58]  If God cannot use a person, He cannot entrust His word to him.
[59]  If God entrusts His word to you and charges you to speak, how are you going to speak?
[60]  When God lets you speak His word, your mind will frustrate God's word if it is not working properly.
[61]  When a man's emotion, mind, will, and spirit are all dealt with, the Holy Spirit puts His word in that person's mouth, and his utterance is an inspiration, a revelation.
[62]  Besides the Lord Jesus, who is the very Word of God becoming flesh, there are two kinds of ministers in the ministry of the word.
[63]  First Corinthians 7 shows us that Paul was chosen by God to be a minister of His word.
[64]  God perfected him to such an extent that his ministry became the very utterance of the divine inspiration.
[65]  His speaking was so accurate that not a single word missed the mark.
[66]  His word not only contains God's word, but it is so accurate that every sentence and phrase hits the mark.
[67]  With Paul, we can see how God puts His word in man and how He releases it through man.
[68]  If the release of God's word were merely a matter of man repeating God's utterances word for word, such a task would be easy.
[69]  The New Testament ministry of the word is not one in which God dictates His message word by word and then man repeats it word for word.
[70]  Let us again consider Paul's condition in 1 Corinthians 7.
[71]  When we come to verse 40, we see that this was the word of the Spirit of God.
[72]  God does not piece His message together word by word, hand it over to us, and then ask us to memorize it.
[73]  This leads us to an important question which needs our attention.
[74]  We must realize that the Spirit of God not only resides in man but is doing an engraving and constituting work in man.
[75]  I am not saying that we can all follow the example of 1 Corinthians 7.
[76]  If the Lord has no leading for us to speak in this way, however, it is a gross error for us to speak this way.
[77]  If we did not have 1 Corinthians 7, we could only know what the Holy Spirit had done through Paul; we would not know what the Holy Spirit had done in Paul.
[78]  When God's word came upon this man, there was no frustration to the word, just as there was no frustration during those times when God's word was not active in such a person.
[79]  When we talk about the ministry of God's word, we are not saying that God has other words unrelated to the Bible.
[80]  We must condemn all independent revelations and independent ministries.
[81]  In Galatians Paul says that the law was something that was "added" 3:19 .
[82]  In the beginning God gave man grace; He gave man the gospel.
[83]  Psalm 68:18 speaks of the Lord Jesus dispensing gifts at the time of His ascension.
[84]  Ephesians 1 tells us that the Lord Jesus ascended to the height and is seated at the right hand of God the Father v. 20 . Then chapter four tells us that in His ascension, the Lord Jesus led captive those who were taken captive by His enemy and gave gifts to men v. 8 . If we look back a little, we will find that this is exactly what Peter said on the day of Pentecost.
[85]  Both Peter's word concerning the outpouring at Pentecost as well as Paul's word in Ephesians concerning the ascension and the giving of gifts for the building up of the church were based on a knowledge of the light revealed in Psalm 68.
[86]  Let me repeat: other than the mystery of the Body of Christ, which is composed of Jews and Gentiles, and which is depicted in Ephesians, the New Testament contains nothing new.
[87]  In order to learn to serve the Lord and be a minister of His word, we have to learn to know His Word.
[88]  Not everyone who is familiar with the Bible can serve as a minister of the word, but those who are not familiar with the Bible will have less of a chance to become a minister of the word.
[89]  If we do not receive our word from existing words, we are not qualified to be a minister of the word.
[90]  We have to take note, for our own sake as well as for the sake of others, that the word released by ministers of the word today cannot be independent from those that are found in the Bible.
[91]  All of God's subsequent words are based on His original words.
[92]  If a man claims that his word is independent, separate, and distinct from the New Testament and the Old Testament, that it bears no correspondence to God's past words, and that it is not based upon them, we can say with certainty that this is heresy; it must be the doctrine of the devil.
[93]  The words released by the ministers of the word must be based on God's previously spoken words on the one hand; however, God must explain and interpret these words to the ministers on the other hand.
[94]  Hence, not everyone who bases his speaking on God's word is a minister of His word.
[95]  God must explain His word to His ministers before they can have the ministry of His word.
[96]  Let us take the Gospel of Matthew as an example and consider how Matthew served as a minister of God's word.
[97]  The Holy Spirit took full control of Matthew when he related the story of the Lord Jesus.
[98]  First Timothy speaks of the history of Adam and Eve in 2:13-14: "For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived; but the woman, having been quite deceived, has fallen into transgression."
[99]  Both prophecies and history require the interpretation of the Holy Spirit.
[100]  God assigns a special place for this kind of interpretation for His minister of the word.
[101]  Neither Matthew, Paul, Peter, nor any of the other ministers of the New Testament spoke their own words.
[102]  One must have the interpretation of the Holy Spirit before he can have the ministry of the word.
[103]  It is the Holy Spirit who enlightens, who explains the meaning of a word, who finds the facts in the Old Testament, who points out the highlights in these words, and who affords a person the basis for speaking.
[104]  A minister of God's word must know God's past speaking and have the interpretation of this speaking, but he must have another basic qualification: He must be a man of revelation.
[105]  If he does not have a spirit of revelation, he cannot serve as a minister of the word.
[106]  Today God has to breathe His breath upon this word once again before we can know God's word and before we can be a minister to Him.
[107]  The meaning of the Bible being God's inspiration is that at one time God breathed His breath upon this book.
[108]  When God breathes His breath upon His word a second time, when we find light again through the Holy Spirit and the anointing upon His word to see what Paul once saw, we have revelation.
[109]  If a man does not have revelation, he can study every word from the first page to the last without hearing a single word from God.
[110]  It is not how much of the Scriptures we understand, how many biblical truths we have seen, or how many verses we can quote.
[111]  These will not constitute us as a minister of the word.
[112]  If we have this basic ingredient, we have the ministry of the word.
[113]  It is the same word, because without that word as the basis, God cannot speak; there is no disagreement in His speaking.
[114]  God is putting His life into His word once more, and when this word becomes living in man, it is revelation to man.
[115]  In looking back at church history, we find that God has been taking the way of recovery from the time of Martin Luther.
[116]  In the church nothing is more serious than the absence of men who supply others with God's word, revelation, and light.
[117]  If we do not supply others with these things, can we expect others to receive them simply through prayer?
[118]  By asking them to pray for these things by themselves, we are shirking our responsibility and casting the burden on their shoulders.
[119]  Just like the seven deacons in Acts 6 who served by dispensing food to the saints, a minister of the word is one who serves by dispensing the word to others.
[120]  Yet this word is not merely words per se; this word is a person.
[121]  At the time He walked on earth in disguise, men did not know Him.
[122]  God was disguised among men, and men did not recognize Him as God.
[123]  It takes God's Spirit to open men's eyes before they can recognize this Jesus as the Son of God and the Christ.
[124]  The same principle can be applied to our reading of the Bible.
[125]  Many people are pressing upon the Bible, but few touch the Son of God.
[126]  Our Lord taught many things when He was on the earth, and many heard Him.
[127]  Let us read 1 John 4:6: "We are of God; he who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us.
[128]  From this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deception."
[129]  The ministry of the word is related to the things behind the parables.
[130]  The problem today is not the lack of God's word but the ignorance among God's children concerning His word.
[131]  If we do not touch the very thing behind the word, we can say all we want to others, but we will have nothing to minister to them.
[132]  Perhaps one, two, three, or four passages of the Scripture will stand out, and gradually, the Christ you know in your revelation becomes the word, and you know that the Lord is preparing you to be a minister of the word.
[133]  One must not only be able to speak the word with his mouth but must know in an inward way that Jesus is indeed the Christ, the Son of the living God.
[134]  A minister of the word is one who receives mercy from God to have a revelation concerning God's Son.
[135]  What does it mean for God to reveal His Son in us?
[136]  The basic issue is: Are you simply ministering to others from this book, the Bible, or are you one who has met Christ and who has a revelation of Christ?
[137]  The trouble with some people is that they turn the order of Christ and the Bible around.
[138]  They want to know the Bible first and then know Christ.
[139]  But it is possible for a man to know the Bible yet at the same time to not know Christ.
[140]  In order to be a minister of the word, we must begin by having a knowledge of Christ.
[141]  Only after we have known Christ will we know the Bible, and only then will we be able to serve as a minister of the word.
[142]  Anything short of that will not qualify us to be a minister of the word.
[143]  We can say that a minister of the word translates Christ into the Bible, that is, he takes the word of the Bible and uses it to tell others about Christ.
[144]  In the end the Holy Spirit translates the words of the Bible back into Christ within those who have received the word.
[145]  When we translate the Christ we know into the words of the Bible and allow the Holy Spirit to translate these words back into Christ, we have the word of God.
[146]  We have considered the subject of the person the minister, and we have considered the word of the Lord.
[147]  We have seen that God's speaking, both through the Old Testament ministry of the word as well as through the New Testament ministry, contains human elements.
[148]  But there is a danger: If a man does not have an ear and tongue of "an instructed one" Isa 50:4 , he will project himself into God's word.
[149]  If a man has not been dealt with and has not gone through the molding work of the Holy Spirit, it will be very easy to inject his own thoughts and feelings into God's word.
[150]  However, we have another fact before us: All ministers of the word must first meet the Lord apart from the Scripture and receive His revelation, the revelation of Christ, before they can use the Scripture as the basis of their ministry of the word.
[151]  In speaking of ministry, we have to realize that there are two kinds of revelations.
[152]  When you receive your basic revelation for the first time, you realize that the Bible is living.
[153]  For example, you may see that Christ is your holiness, with emphasis on the word is.
[154]  Even if we have received a revelation, we need a fresh revelation from God every time we minister the word and serve others with Christ so that the old things can once again be new.
[155]  Today when we minister the word to men, we should not depend on our memory.
[156]  We should not think that we are free to speak the same things again just because our past experiences and past speakings are still intact in our mind.
[157]  Even though it worked for us the first time, it will not work for us this time.
[158]  We may speak the same thing again, but afterward, we feel that something is wrong, that what we said was not the right thing.
[159]  We feel that we are, in fact, quite far from the thing that we were speaking about; we do not touch that thing at all.
[160]  We must realize that there are two different realms.
[161]  If God does not speak, we cannot force any word out of our mouth.
[162]  Hence, we have to say to the Lord, "I can do nothing.
[163]  Lord, I cannot do anything with Your word unless I first prostrate myself before You and move beyond the pressing of the ordinary crowd."
[164]  Today many people do not realize how helpless they are as far as God's word is concerned.
[165]  Once revelation comes, God shines in us, and we feel that we have a little light within.
[166]  This brings us to our second subject translating light into thoughts.
[167]  The starting point of the ministry of the word is God's shining and enlightening within us.
[168]  We must remember that the first thing the ministry of the word needs is revelation from God.
[169]  Yet in order for the human element to be present in God's word and in order for man to be a minister to God, the light of revelation has to pass through man.
[170]  If our spirit is not in the right condition, we will not receive any revelation or light.
[171]  Some may ask, "Does not 1 Corinthians 2:13 teach us that spiritual things require no human wisdom?"
[172]  Brothers, do not think that squandering our mental energy is a small thing.
[173]  Many people often waste their mental power on unrelated things.
[174]  A minister of God's word not only needs the light of God's revelation and the power to retain this light, but he also needs a burden.
[175]  After we receive light from God and after we have the thoughts, we only have enough material to have a burden, but this is not enough to discharge it.
[176]  Light and thoughts must first become words to us; the thoughts must first become words before we can release these words through our voice to the outside world.
[177]  If we only have thoughts and no words except our own, we still are short of one thing, and we are not able to be a minister of the word.
[178]  We have to ask God for further shining, not for a shining in our spirit which communicates its meaning to us, but for a shining that conveys words which translate the meaning of the light into words.
[179]  We receive words from God in the second revelation, but the words of revelation which we receive from God the second time are for the purpose of capturing the light which we see in the first place.
[180]  When God grants us revelation, He grants us life.
[181]  Every time we have a burden, no matter how heavy it is, we will receive a word related to it if we wait long enough before God.
[182]  Yet revelation and light alone do not constitute the ministry of the word.
[183]  What we say may not be wrong, but we will not have the ministry of the word, and the Lord will not be released through us.
[184]  Yet even if our mind is clear, we still may not be a minister of the word because we still do not have the proper words.
[185]  Since the discharge of a burden is related closely to the inner words, how can we receive the inner words?
[186]  Most of the time, we receive the inner words through reading the Bible and in our moments of waiting upon God.
[187]  We have mentioned previously that sometimes light is accompanied by God's word when it is translated into thoughts, and that it is this word which enables us to be a minister of the word.
[188]  Three necessary steps constitute the ministry of the word: light, thoughts, and word.
[189]  Hence, a minister of the word must first receive a divine word from God and then release this word with his own words.
[190]  When God's word was spoken through Peter, the teaching was God's, but the flavor was Peter's. When God's word was spoken through John, the teaching was God's, but the flavor was John's. When God's word was spoken through Paul, the teaching was God's, but the flavor was Paul's. Human elements are present in the ministry of God's word.
[191]  Let us turn back once again to the matter of speaking in tongues.
[192]  In his discussion concerning the ministry of the word, Paul made a comparison between tongues and the prophetic ministry.
[193]  But it useless as far as the ministry of the word is concerned because no human understanding is involved.
[194]  The Holy Spirit conveys a word to man, and man releases it verbatim with his spirit.
[195]  God's word is released, yet there is no trace of human understanding or human element in this word.
[196]  It is His intention for the teaching to be His but for the words to be man's. Since this is the case, a minister of the word has a tremendous responsibility! If we are not up to the standard, what can we contribute? This is the reason that our very person has to be broken.
[197]  In preparing the outer words, we have to pay attention to the words of the Scripture.
[198]  When we have the inner words and try to release them to others, we often find that we are short of words.
[199]  If we repeat the same word once, twice, or ten times, others will be bored by our speaking; they will not appreciate it.
[200]  Now we have to mold our word, the very word that we have received from God, according to their words.
[201]  How do we know whether our speaking is on the right track?
[202]  As we speak, we have to be attentive to whether our burden is being reduced or whether it is becoming heavier.
[203]  We do not have to wait until we step down from the platform to find out whether or not we are speaking on the right track; we can sense this as we are speaking.
[204]  When a minister of the word stands up to speak, what is the source of his speaking?
[205]  A minister of God's word does not just use his mind to think of words to say; his words must come from another source.
[206]  Once we know the source, we will realize that many things should not come out of our mouth; they cannot be considered as God's word.
[207]  We must repeat the fact that there is a strong relationship between the ministry of the word and our human elements.
[208]  We should also remember that in the function of the ministry of the word, God first gives man a word or two, which he then develops into many further words.
[209]  When a minister of the word stands up to speak, he uses his own words, yet he is speaking the word which God has spoken within him.
[210]  If God has done some constituting work in us, that is, if His Spirit has operated in us, disciplined us, and dealt with our outward man and crushed it, to the extent that we begin to touch something spiritual and our character begins to change, our speaking will be the speaking of the Spirit spontaneously.
[211]  God's word was a person when it was in the Lord Jesus.
[212]  Today God's word must also be a person when it comes to us.
[213]  When the Lord was on the earth, He was the Word becoming flesh; God was speaking through the flesh.
[214]  Today God is again manifesting His word in the flesh; He is still embodying His word in a person.
[215]  He has to deal with our flesh to such an extent that the release of a word from our flesh is the release of the word of God.
[216]  God constitutes something into us through His indwelling Spirit, and as we ponder over such things and enunciate them, God's word is released.
[217]  The inward constitution of the Holy Spirit makes God's word our own subjective word.
[218]  A minister of God's word must allow the Spirit to constitute him to such an extent that the word is no longer objective, but subjective.
[219]  God's constitution should be so strong that our word becomes not only similar to God's word but God's very own word.
[220]  To be a minister of the word, we need not only light, thoughts, the inner words, the outer words, and the memory; we also need to pay attention to how we deliver this word on the platform, that is, the word formed out of the discipline we have received.
[221]  Let us go on further by posing a question: Where is the light of revelation found?
[222]  We may say that it is found in the spirit.
[223]  Why is the light of revelation not seen continuously in our spirit?
[224]  Once we learn our lesson, we will have a word for such an occasion.
[225]  The more we yield and surrender, the more words we will have.
[226]  If we do not submit, we will not have the word.
[227]  Other brothers and sisters may be tried later and may come to the end of themselves, but by then we will have risen up, and we will be able to release the word that has been formed in us during our trials.
[228]  What is the goal of ministering to others with the word?
[229]  When God puts us in a certain environment or allows us to face certain difficulties, we are faced with a great sense of need; we find that we are forced to seek the Lord.
[230]  This is analogous to the principle of quoting Scripture.
[231]  First we have to touch something in our experience, and then five, ten, or more verses will come to us.
[232]  However, we must cultivate these verses in our spirit; we cannot cultivate them in our mind.
[233]  In fulfilling the ministry of the word, a man's memory occupies a very important place.
[234]  First, our spirit sees something; second, our thoughts capture it; and third, we have a word within us.
[235]  This word contains thoughts, and it also contains light.
[236]  We can say that it is a word, yet this word is an inner seeing, an inner revelation; it is not merely a word.
[237]  Romans 7:13 says, "Sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful."
[238]  One day the Lord may show you how evil and sinful sin is.
[239]  The very word sinful is enough to scare you.
[240]  But when you preach about it after a few days, it is possible that you still remember the word sinful, but the picture, the image, is gone.
[241]  Whenever we stand up to speak, we have to ask the Lord to grant us the memory of the Holy Spirit so that we will convey not only the words but impart the very thing behind the words as well.
[242]  Let us come back to the illustration of the sinfulness of sin.
[243]  If it is fresh within us, we will be a minister of the word when we release it sentence by sentence.
[244]  If it is not fresh within us, we can speak about the sinfulness of sin on the platform, but others will receive only stale manna; it may be a day old, a year old, or even ten years old.
[245]  We will not be serving as ministers of the word in that case, and our word will amount to nothing.
[246]  In order to be a minister of the word, our word has to be nurtured in the memory of the Holy Spirit.
[247]  If we have the memory of the Holy Spirit, this memory will become operative as we speak and convey the inner word to others.
[248]  The strange thing is that when we see something in the spirit, we may forget about it the very first time we try to use it to minister the word.
[249]  Sometimes we have the word within; we have the word of God's revelation, and we also have the memory of the Holy Spirit.
[250]  We should also pay attention to the matter of quoting the Scripture.
[251]  In delivering God's word, we have to follow the example of the apostles who quoted from the Old Testament.
[252]  In speaking God's word, we must have the written Bible as our basis.
[253]  In previous chapters we have said that a minister of the word needs four things.
[254]  Two of these things, light and the inner words, are of God, while the other two, thoughts and memory, are of the minister himself.
[255]  Before a minister of the word opens his mouth to speak, he needs to have two things available to him his own thoughts and his memory.
[256]  In reading the Bible, we find one outstanding feature in all the writers of the books: Their feelings were never a hindrance to them in their ministry of the word.
[257]  While a minister of the word is speaking, it is not enough for him to release words alone.
[258]  If the obstacles mentioned above are not dealt with, nothing will happen even if one has light, thoughts, the inner word, the memory, and the outer words; all of these will be vain.
[259]  If the more we speak, the colder and more unnatural we become, and if we realize that our feelings really do not match our word, we can be certain that our spirit is not released, that the Holy Spirit is not released, and that our word has no power.
[260]  We should not merely know how to apply our feelings.
[261]  We need to see how the Lord breaks our outer man and how He prepares our feelings for the ministry of the word.
[262]  Since the spirit is expressed through the feelings, a stricken spirit has the feeling of being stricken.
[263]  When God's word comes to us again, we will sense the feelings of the word, and our feelings will match the word.
[264]  After we have gone through such discipline in our feelings, we discover one interesting thing: We not only speak God's word, but we feel His word as well.
[265]  Now let us turn to the matter of the word and the release of the spirit.
[266]  Whether or not the spoken word is received as revelation or merely doctrine depends very much on whether the minister is releasing his spirit.
[267]  Whether or not a person falls on his face at the word or remains unchanged depends on whether the minister can release his spirit.
[268]  We need to realize that when the word is released, that is, when the ministry of the word is released, not only is the word released, but the spirit is released as well.
[269]  If we preach a word of revelation and release our spirit at the same time, others will touch not only the word but the spirit as well.
[270]  The exercise of the spirit of a minister of the word depends on two things.
[271]  Whether or not a minister can exercise his spirit to minister to the church and the extent to which and the areas in which he is able to exercise his spirit depend entirely on the amount of experience he has related to these two things.
[272]  A minister of the word cannot release his spirit more than what he has learned to release.
[273]  But if he has received strict and repeated trainings in his spirit, it will be easy and spontaneous for him to exercise his spirit in the ministry of the word.
[274]  Whenever we go through a trial, we go through it with the view of eventually transcending it.
[275]  The more trials we have, the more strength we find to meet the trials.
[276]  The exercise of a minister's spirit is something that demands his life.
[277]  When a person serves as a minister of the word, he must not only have a useful spirit, but he must be willing to sacrifice and expend his spirit.
[278]  Every time a person serves as a minister of the word and ministers the word to others, he has to exercise his spirit by pouring out his life, just as the Lord Jesus did when He poured out His life.
[279]  In the ministry of the word, there is not only the manner of the delivery of the word but also the matter of willingness on the part of the deliverer.
[280]  Are we willing and happy to push out our spirit?
[281]  If we are willing, the word will spontaneously have a strong impact on others.
[282]  If we do not push out our spirit, the words will not be strong.
[283]  Every genuine minister of the word knows what it means to push out the spirit.
[284]  As he speaks, he has to exert his strength, not his fleshly strength, but another kind of strength.
[285]  The ministry of the word is a matter not of opening the mouth but of having a definite word within and then pushing out the spirit through the word.
[286]  Whenever we have the word without the spirit, we have doctrine; we do not have God's word.
[287]  Whether or not others touch the outward shell of the word or the life within the word depends on whether we have pushed out the spirit.
[288]  There are underlying principles to the release of the spirit.
[289]  The amount of spirit that is released by a person depends on two things: the amount of his willingness and the amount of pressure that he sustains.
[290]  Our word must be backed up by the spirit.
[291]  But in order to release a spirit that is pure and clean, we have to go through dealings.
[292]  One thing is certain: The kind of spirit that we have determines the kind of expression of the Holy Spirit that we bear.
[293]  When we come across a minister of the word, we often find that he has God's word, and his spirit is released.
[294]  We should be in fear and trembling all the time.
[295]  Even though the Lord may use us, we must not forget that we are still unqualified.
[296]  If something is wrong with us, the flaws that are in our spirit will be mixed in with the word of the Lord.
[297]  One day the Lord will shine His light in us, and we will prostrate ourselves before Him and say, "Nothing that I have said in the past was up to Your mark."
[298]  We must understand the responsibility of the church today.
[299]  God has entrusted His Christ to the church with the intention that the church would communicate this Christ to others.
[300]  God also has entrusted His Holy Spirit to the church with the intention that the church would communicate this Holy Spirit to others.
[301]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN A FEW THINGS TO PAY ATTENTION TO
[302]  Serving as a minister of the word is an altogether new thing to us; we have never done such a thing before in our life.
[303]  Second, the spirit must be watchfully attended to before it can be released.
[304]  As soon as our mind wanders, moves out of focus, or fails to catch up with our thoughts, our spirit is injured.
[305]  Our mind has to attentively wait on the spirit before the spirit can direct the mind freely.
[306]  Some ministers of the word cannot use their spirit because their spirit is injured, and their spirit is injured because something is wrong with their mind.
[307]  THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD NOT BEING OUT OF TOUCH
[308]  When a minister of the word opens his mouth, he may have four or five passages he wants to cover.
[309]  He may have four or five verses he wants to speak or four or five things he wants to say.
[310]  How can a man tell if his words are right or wrong?
[311]  He can tell by the way the spirit is released.
[312]  If his spirit is released while he speaks, the words are right.
[313]  After speaking for a few minutes with both the word and the spirit moving together, we know that we made the right turn a moment earlier.
[314]  Before the Lord a minister of God's word must see that his release of the word is not just for the sake of releasing the word; he is releasing it to release his spirit.
[315]  If our spirit is not released, our word is not God's word; it is only an imitation of His word, not His very own word.
[316]  The first way is to put the spirit into the word and then to push out the word with the spirit.
[317]  In our speaking, we must also pay attention to our mind.
[318]  Whether a word should be spoken first or last is a decision that rests with the mind.
[319]  In our service as a minister of the word, our mind occupies a very important place.
[320]  If our mental faculty is versatile, we can place a word at the beginning of our speaking or at the end. Either place will fit, and the spirit will be released during the speaking.
[321]  In such a case, whether the word comes to our mind at the beginning of the speaking or at the end, the spirit is not released in our speaking.
[322]  In our speaking, it is easy for us to know the climax of our speaking because our mind easily can identify it, but it is not easy to know the climax of the spirit.
[323]  In his speaking, a minister of the word has to pay attention to the difference between the climax of the word and the climax of the spirit.
[324]  If our condition is right, we should clearly know the particular word that God has given to us whenever we open our mouth to speak for the Lord.
[325]  Nevertheless, we have to remember that the mind of a minister of the word has to be devoted solely to the word on the one hand, but the mind always must be flexible and agile before the Lord on the other hand.
[326]  When we stand up to speak for the Lord, our mind must be pliable and open to the Lord.
[327]  Only then will we know what God is trying to do.
[328]  While we are speaking, we should test the Holy Spirit to find out whether our speaking is in the right direction.
[329]  If we find that there is some amount of release of the spirit after a few words, we should exercise our mind to facilitate the release of the spirit.
[330]  We typically speak whatever comes to our mind; whatever we think of, we speak.
[331]  The raw materials from which we formulate our speaking come from whatever we have learned previously, whatever our mind is occupied with, whatever we have experienced and seen in the past, and whatever breaking work we have experienced.
[332]  Suppose we know what the Lord wants us to say.
[333]  It may be something long that cannot be expressed in one word.
[334]  The Lord wants us to speak these words, but we are afraid that we will forget them.
[335]  In serving as a minister of the word, we must have substance to our words; we cannot speak vain words, and we must have enough memory to apply everything that we have learned in our lifetime to our speaking.
[336]  We must realize that the spirit flows out of us only when our feelings match our words.
[337]  If there is a little reservation in our feelings about the word we have received from the spirit, the word will not come out, and the spirit will not be released.
[338]  We may discount our words or hold back the feelings we should have concerning our word.
[339]  If we do not let go, we will have reservations, and as long as we have reservations, the word will never be released.
[340]  All ministers of God's word should learn from the Scripture the character of God's word.
[341]  It is harder for us to speak today than for those who spoke one hundred years ago, and harder still than for those who spoke four or five hundred years ago.
[342]  It is harder for us to speak than it was for Martin Luther, because the release of God's word is always advancing onward and upward.
[343]  The more we speak God's word, the more profound it becomes and the higher it gets.
[344]  THE AUDIENCE CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE AUDIENCE OF THE WORD
[345]  Speaking involves not only the minister but the audience, that is, those who listen to the word.
[346]  The minister of the word has much to do with the speaking, but the audience has something to do with it also.
[347]  The audience can become a hindrance to the release of God's word, and it can also become a strengthening to God's word.
[348]  In previous discussions we have seen the responsibility of the ministers.
[349]  We must also see that, in addition to the qualifications of the ministers, there is the condition of the audience.
[350]  Even if the minister is very powerful before God, and even if he wants to impart revelation to others, his ministry of the word will be void of revelation in the presence of such wise and intelligent ones.
[351]  In learning to be a minister of the word, we have to remember that sometimes the problem is with us; the word is withheld in us.
[352]  First Corinthians 1:19 says, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the understanding of those who understand I will set aside."
[353]  The purpose of doing this is that "no flesh may boast before God" v. 29 . Simply put, God does not want us to be proud.
[354]  Romans 11:8 says, "As it is written, God gave them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes to see not and ears to hear not, until this very day.'"
[355]  This verse says that God has given the Jews a spirit of deep sleep.
[356]  If we are willing to be a proper audience of the word, that is, if we are willing to receive the word and not give resistance to God's word, we will touch something in the ministry, and God's blessings and light will shine on us.
