<h2 class="head1">THE GOOD PART OF THE FLESH</h2><h2 class="head2">The Wisdom of the Flesh</h2><p>There are two aspects to the good part of the flesh. First, there is the wisdom of the flesh. Second, there is the power of the flesh. Let us first consider the wisdom of the flesh. Many fleshly persons can do many things beside committing sins. They have a good mind that is capable of thinking and scheming. They can be quick to understand and apt to speak. This is the wisdom of the flesh. This wisdom was with us before we were regenerated. Since we have believed in the Lord and have been baptized, these things should be condemned. However, after we are saved, we try to serve Him in His work. We want to do everything for His sake, and we try to please Him by testifying for Him. Spontaneously, we apply the wisdom that we formerly employed in our business to God's work. The wisdom that we used to apply to our studies, our business, and our managing of human relationships is now applied to the work of God. We may think that it was wrong to use our wisdom in the world, but right to use it in God's work. I did not realize this truth until I had been in the Lord's work for six or seven years. One day I read John 3:6 which says, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit." I understood then that whatever is born of the flesh is the flesh no matter where it is applied. Another passage that is in Romans 8 says, "Those who are in the flesh cannot please God" (v. 8). This verse does not say that the evil of the flesh does not please God. It says that the flesh&mdash;as long as it is the flesh&mdash;cannot please God. Then I read the Lord's Word in John 6:63 which says, "The flesh profits nothing." It profits nothing whether it is the good flesh or the bad flesh. Only the Lord's word to us is not flesh; it is spirit and life, and only His words can give life. Other than that which is from the new life and the spirit, everything else is from the flesh and is useless.</p><p>In God's work, the only wisdom we can apply is spiritual wisdom. We can only work according to God's will. We often read the Bible the same way that we read an ordinary book. But God will destroy the wisdom of man. He has chosen the foolish things in this world to put to shame those who are wise (1 Cor. 1:27). In the spiritual journey, the wise do not have any advantage over the foolish. One does not become more spiritual because he is more wise. There is not such a thing. A wise and thoughtful person is the same as a foolish person when it comes to spiritual matters&mdash;both need faith. The wise one may understand things quicker, but this does not mean that he can acquire the spiritual realities faster. He must have faith, obedience, and consecration in the same way that the foolish one does, before he can acquire spiritual things. In order to receive spiritual things, there are no shortcuts; believing, obeying, and consecrating are the only way.</p><h2 class="head2">The Power of the Flesh</h2><p>Let us come back to the first aspect of the goodness of the flesh&mdash;natural strength or the power of the flesh. Many people are powerful in preaching; they have natural attraction, organizational skills, and management skills. They think that these make them good helpers to God's work. But the power of attraction in preaching and leadership, the ability to save souls, organizational and management skills, and a talent for design and methodology do not add anything to God's work. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; when it sins it is the flesh, and when it applies itself to God's work it is still the flesh. A Chinese is always a Chinese whether he is in England or in China. The place may change, but the person does not change. The evil flesh is abominable in God's eyes, but the good flesh is equally abominable in God's eyes. The flesh cannot please God when it sins, and it equally cannot please God when it applies itself to God's work. The flesh is useless in combating sin, and it is equally useless in doing God's work.</p><p>Thank God that He has brought all men down to the same level. No one is "taller" than anyone else. Nothing in the old creation can be brought into the new creation. Nothing in Adam can render any help to anything in Christ. Everything in the old creation, whether power or wisdom, is useless in the building up of the new creation. It is a great mistake for God's worker to think that a man with eloquence, intelligence, articulation, and ability would be a big catch if he ever was saved. He thinks that such a man would be greatly used by the Lord and does not realize that the only things that a man can consecrate to the Lord are things from the first Adam. Do you think that the things of the first Adam can ever render any help to the second Adam? Suppose you see a country person who is poor in words, thoughts, and writings. You preach the gospel to him and he is saved. Suppose another man, who is young, educated, eloquent, and intelligent, is also saved. What would you think of these two persons? You may think that there is considerable hope for the young, educated man because he has a good background. You may think that there is not much hope for the country person, but that the young man is a good piece of material. However, what kind of material is he? He is material destined for hell! Where does such material come from? It comes from the flesh, and it deserves nothing but the fire. Everything that he originally has is the flesh and is abominable. That which is born of the flesh is the flesh, and it has nothing to do with God's work.</p>
