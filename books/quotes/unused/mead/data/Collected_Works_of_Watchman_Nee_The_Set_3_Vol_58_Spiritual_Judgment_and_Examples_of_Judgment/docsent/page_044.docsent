   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 25 Date:July 27, 1948 TESTIMONY BY SISTER M. Y.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was saved in a clear way through Brother Nee's preaching on Ephesians 2:8.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In May of 1927 I was baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After this, my spiritual life took a big turn.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I returned to my village to preach the gospel to my grandmother, mother, and brother.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They all accepted and believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>My father was in America, and he wanted me to go there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I did not want to go, and he was very unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He became more unhappy when I told him that I wanted to serve the Lord full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Prior to that, he regularly sent me money.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After he heard that I wanted to serve the Lord, he stopped sending me money.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But I had faith.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the Bible says, when my parents reject me, God accepts me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Later I began to serve the Lord in the church in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is the Lord's mercy that I am able to come to the mountain to receive this training.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I also have consecrated myself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I used to be very healthy; however, I suddenly have found that I have high blood pressure and other ailments.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I began to be afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Later the Lord told me that my sickness was not unto death but for the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I dropped my anxiety and committed my sickness to the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we have little light, we do not see anything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we have a medium amount of light, we see clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But when we have great light, we become blurred again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When a man is in a very bright room, it is hard for him to see anything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some lights provide guidance, while other lights subdue and make men blurred.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a man can describe what he has seen after a meeting, it proves that he has not seen anything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a man can describe in detail how he fell like Paul, whether his head went down first or his feet went down first, he surely has not really fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He has only pretended to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As far as the knowledge of God is concerned, the more light we receive, the more we know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But as far as the breaking of our own self goes, the more light we have, the more unclear we become.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A sober-minded person has never received any light.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is a preciousness to being blurred.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After a man is enlightened by a great light, he becomes blurred and confused.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more he gropes in darkness and confusion and the more he places himself in the Lord's hand in the midst of weakness, the more he experiences grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are delivered by God through weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord leads our way, and although the way is not always clear and we are not always certain of anything, we can look to Him moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul asked the Lord three times in his weaknesses what he should do.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord only said, "My grace is sufficient for you."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For Paul, this word was good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What this grace was, Paul did not know.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Grace is a principle; it is not the fine points.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the Lord said, "My grace is sufficient for you," Paul did not have to ask about the fine points.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All of God's revelation to us requires no thinking on our part.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the way of grace, we can only go on blurrily.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When light comes, we do not have to be too concerned, analytical, or probing about it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We only need to stand calmly at a distance and look to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is no need to be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After Aaron's rod remained in the ark for a night, it sprouted, blossomed, and bore fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The night signifies the period of darkness which comes before resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the dark night no one saw how the rod sprouted, blossomed, bore fruit, and grew.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not know how that dead stick sprouted, blossomed, and bore fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is not of concern to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our responsibility lies in the fruit bearing; we do not have to be concerned about how the fruit is borne as long as it is genuine fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our responsibility is to put the dead stick in the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What happens between the time that the dead stick is put in and when it becomes a fruitful stick is none of our concern.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It does not matter to us anyway, because it is the Lord's business.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As long as there is fruit, we are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What happens during the night is God's business.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We can remain in our unclearness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After a while, we will see the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>During the night our responsibility is simply to wait on God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many people have forgotten that before the dead stick was vivified, the night was a dark, puzzling, and incomprehensible time.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Everything related to the Lord becomes clear to us as soon as we are enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But everything related to us remains altogether a mystery as to how it comes about.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is something veiled in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the reason we have to set ourselves aside and put our situation totally in the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Anything that can die should die.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Anything that cannot die will live.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord did not put the stick in Aaron's room or in his hand for him to study, analyze, or investigate.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The stick had to leave the owner's hand and be placed within the ark in the Holy of Holies; it went from Aaron's house to the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It had to go through a long night.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Aaron knew nothing about it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But the next day, everyone saw that the stick had sprouted, blossomed, and borne fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The same principle applies to our spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should only put ourselves in God's hand and remain there throughout the dark night.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should turn from the self and look to God's hand, until we see the blossom and the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>No one saw how the stick blossomed, but everyone saw the blooming flower.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We should not worry and not try to understand anything.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we do, nothing will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is a joke for a child to constantly think about whether or not he is growing up and about how much weight he puts on each day.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We should never look at ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we are a failure, let it be.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is the way of the world to try to find out how one can avert his failures.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This should not be a concern to us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We often do not know how we rise up after we have fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We have to learn to trust, not to know.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>All we need to do is believe; we do not need to know anything.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We do not have to be smart, and we do not have to try to find out everything that God is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Those who are smart in their mind are usually void of light.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Those who are enlightened and who look to the Lord all the time are never busy in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Many spiritual things only call for our faith, not for our knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Paul was a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>After he heard the Lord's word, "My grace is sufficient for you," he became silent.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>"My grace is sufficient for you" only speaks of a principle; it gives no definite pattern and does not define any specifics.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Paul was not concerned about what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>His eyes were set on the principle; he did not push for the fine points.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Paul genuinely believed, and that was good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In pursuing the Lord's grace, we should not push for the fine points.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We are apprehensive of messages that have no light, but we are equally apprehensive of messages that have so much light that everything becomes crystal clear immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If we are truly subdued by the light, we will not know anything; we will be satisfied with God's grace alone.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>May the Lord preserve us so that we can trust Him in the midst of our ignorance.</S>
