   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONFESSING THE LORD JESUS BEFORE MEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Believers also need another kind of confession, not only the confession of sins but the confession of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They have to confess the Lord Jesus before men.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From now on you must confess, you must tell others, that you belong to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now you have become a Christian, a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Confess the name of the Lord Jesus, and confess before men that Jesus is the Lord and your Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Romans 10:9 says, "That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We confess Jesus as the Lord with our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is very strange that throughout the whole earth in the East and in the West, in Europe and in Asia people have a feeling of shame when confessing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If someone says, "Now I believe Christ; I confess Jesus is Lord," there is to some degree the feeling of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is also very strange that when people follow Confucius and tell others about it, they have a feeling not of shame but of boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This sin of shame comes from the devil, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to fight the battle by the grace and mercy of God to overcome this feeling of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometimes in the past I told Satan, "Satan if you keep giving me this feeling of shame, I will shout my confession."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The devil is frightened by this, and he runs away.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The proper believing in the Lord Jesus includes the step of telling people that from this day you are no more an unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From today you are a believer in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You have received Jesus as your Savior and as your Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From this day you confess that He is the Lord and that you belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After you believe in the Lord Jesus, you need to go back to tell your parents, relatives, friends, and neighbors and make a thorough confession of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Young students, after you believe in Christ, you should go to your schoolmates to tell them, "Now I am different.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yesterday I was without Christ, but today Christ is within me."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is a need for a real repentance and two different kinds of confessions: the confession of sins before God and the confession of Jesus Christ as Lord before men.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You should not try to be a hidden Christian, a secret Christian, or a nice Christian within but with no appearance without.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Learn to be released by the confession of Christ before men.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In China I saw certain brothers do something very interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may say that this was too much, but if you were in that environment, you would realize that there was the need for it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After they were saved, some brothers put a label on their clothing that said, "I am a Christian today."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In many cases that helped them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Others would say, "Do not go to him for certain matters, because he is a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not try to convince him, because he is a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not ask him to play certain games or go to the movies with you, because he is a Christian."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In order to be a living, prevailing, powerful believer, you have to make a public confession of Christ before people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>BEING BAPTIZED</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You also have to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be baptized means to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After you believe in the Lord Jesus, right away you have to be buried, because you realize that you are so sinful, good for nothing but death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You realize that you have been crucified with Christ on the cross, so you are dead already.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You have been dead for two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since you realize that you are dead, you must be willing for the church to give you a funeral, to bury you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is very necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From my youth I was raised in a semi-Christian home.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I heard many stories of the gospel, and I was educated and brought up in a Christian school.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, it was not until I was nineteen years old that I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before that day I knew many things about Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I knew almost all the stories about Jesus in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We were taught these things in the Sunday Schools.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sometimes we would even make jokes about those stories.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, when I was nineteen years old, I experienced a real salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On that day I realized that I was sinful and that with me there was no good thing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Within me, every bit is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I did not like myself; I hated myself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I realized that this man is good for nothing and that he must truly be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As a member of a so-called church, however, I already had been baptized by sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At that time I had not repented, and I had not believed or prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I had not realized that I was a sinner, and I had not truly known that Christ was my Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I only knew something about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Nevertheless, the pastor told me I had to be sprinkled.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He told the congregation, "This young man is a member of a Christian family, with a very nice mother and sister.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, we have to sprinkle him."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This kind of sprinkling did not mean anything.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Later when I was saved, I realized that I was a dead person, good for nothing, and that I had to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I was anxious to be buried, so I went to some Christians who loved the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I asked them, "Is it right that I have to be baptized?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I have already been sprinkled."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They told me it was one hundred percent right for me to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I said, "Then we had better do it right away.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Bury me!"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After you believe in the Lord Jesus, if you seek the Lord within you, there will be the desire to be baptized, to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In a certain place a small native boy became a member of the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Catholic Church did not allow people to eat meat on Friday, but they allowed people to eat fish.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One Friday the little boy went out to hunt, brought home a deer, and began to cook it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>While it was cooking, a priest passed the house and smelled the meat, so he came to the door and scolded him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>That little boy had been given the name of Johnny.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He said, "A few years ago I was not named Johnny.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I had a native name, but one day you brought me to your church and sprinkled me.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>From that time you told me, That is no longer your name; now you are Johnny.'</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This morning I went out and tried to catch fish.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I could not catch any, but I took a deer, sprinkled it, and said, You are no longer a deer; you are now a fish.'</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I believed what you told me, so why do you not believe what I am telling you?"</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We do not baptize people in this false way, to put some water on them and change their name.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Rather, to be baptized means that you realize that you are dead with Christ and in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Now you are allowing the church to bury you by putting you into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Friends, after you believe in Christ, you need to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You cannot baptize yourself; you must be baptized.</S>
