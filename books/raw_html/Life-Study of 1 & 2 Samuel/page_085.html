<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE NINETEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>LESSONS OF THE FIVE MAJOR FIGURES<br>CONCERNING THE ENJOYMENT OF THE GOOD LAND<br>IN 1 SAMUEL 1 TO 2 SAMUEL 1</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Sam. 2:27-30, 35; 3:21; 12:3-5, 23; 18:1-4; 23:16-18; 9:1-2, 17; 13:13-14; 15:19, 23; 16:1, 12-13; 30:6b-10; 26:19b</H1><P>The books of Samuel, as books of history, are on Christ for our enjoyment that God may carry out His economy. These books reveal the right, the particular, and even the full way for us to enjoy Christ that we may be a part of God's economy. Concerning this we need to realize that God desires people who are according to Him, people who are His duplication. In the long period of history covered in 1 Samuel 1 to 2 Samuel 1, there are five major figures: Eli, Samuel, Jonathan, Saul, and David. We need to learn the lessons of these five persons in relation to God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. LESSONS OF ELI</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Priest by Birth according to God's Ordination</H2><P>A descendant of Aaron, who was chosen to be God's priest, Eli was a priest by birth according to God's ordination.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Having the Right<br>to Enjoy the Top Portion of the Good Land</H2><P>As a priest Eli had the right to enjoy the top portion of all the good land allotted to the twelve tribes of Israel (Num. 18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Disregarding the Priesthood<br>in His Loose Disciplining of His Two Evil Sons</H2><P>Eli disregarded the priesthood in his loose disciplining of his two evil sons (1 Sam. 2:28-29). This caused the tragedy of the ending of his history, the termination of his enjoyment of the good land, and the fading of the priesthood in the divine revelation, that is, in the speaking for God. Today we need to learn of Eli to have a high regard for what God has given us in His recovery.</P>
