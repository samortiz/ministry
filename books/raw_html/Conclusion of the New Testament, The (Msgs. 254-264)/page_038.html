<h2 class=head2>C. To Drink of the Water of Life Flowing from Its Spring (Christ) as the Flow of the Processed and Consummated Triune God</h2><p>Another aspect of the enjoyment of God’s redeemed in eternity is the water of life (Rev. 22:17; 21:6). The water of life of the life-giving Spirit is our eternal drink, and the life-giving Spirit is actually the processed and consummated Triune God flowing Himself out to be our drink. We need to both eat and drink, for it is not pleasant to eat without having anything to drink. We praise the Lord that for eternity in the New Jerusalem we will have food, the tree of life, and drink, the life-giving Spirit.<p>In the New Jerusalem all of God’s redeemed will drink the water of life as their eternal portion. This indicates that even in eternity future we will still need the supply of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. That dispensing will be the spring of the water of life. The spring is God Himself in Christ, and the water of life is the flow of the life-giving Spirit. In the New Jerusalem the Triune God Himself will be flowing as the water of life for our supply eternally.<p>The water of life as our eternal drink is clear as crystal (22:1). In the life-giving Spirit there is nothing opaque. As we drink this eternal Spirit, everything becomes crystal clear.<h2 class=head2>D. To Live in the Divine Light of the Divine Life Embodied in the Redeeming Lamb</h2><p>In the New Jerusalem God’s redeemed will live in the divine light of the divine life embodied in the redeeming Lamb (Rev. 21:23). The divine light is the divine life embodied in the redeeming Lamb operating within us. The Lamb as the lamp shines with God as the light to illumine the New Jerusalem.<p>Revelation 22:5 says, “Night shall be no more; and they have no need of the light of a lamp and the light of the sun, for the Lord God shall illumine them.” Being illumined by the Lord God is another aspect of the eternal enjoyment in the New Jerusalem. We will have no need of a lamp, the light made by man, nor of the sun, the light created by God. God Himself in the Lamb will shine upon us, and we will live under His illumination.<h2 class=head2>E. To Dwell in the Processed and Consummated Triune God as the Temple</h2><p>In the New Jerusalem we shall dwell in the processed and consummated Triune God as the temple. Revelation 21:22 says, “I saw no temple in it, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.” This indicates that the processed Triune God will be the holy city as the temple, which will be the eternal dwelling of all His redeemed people, where they will live with Him and serve Him. In the coming eternity, the holy city will be the tabernacle as God’s eternal dwelling and the temple as our eternal dwelling. Eventually, it will be a mutual dwelling of God and us.<h2 class=head2>F. To Partake of the Divine Kingship and Priesthood</h2><p>In the New Jerusalem we will partake of the divine kingship and priesthood. Revelation 22:5b says, “They shall reign forever and ever.” This is a matter of the divine kingship. In the New Jerusalem for eternity we will reign as kings over the nations that will be on the new earth.<p>The last part of Revelation 22:3 says, “His slaves shall serve Him.” The pronoun “Him” in this verse refers to God and to the Lamb; God and the Lamb are one in eternity. In eternity we shall serve God and the Lamb. This verse indicates that we will serve God as priests. For eternity in the New Jerusalem, all the believers will participate in the priesthood.
