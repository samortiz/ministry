   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In addition, each one of the twelve gates is a pearl 21:21a .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Pearls also have an important spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must recognize that the city has three kinds of materials: gold, pearls, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The gates are pearls, the wall is built with precious stones, and the city proper with its street is pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We recall that Genesis 2 says that a river went forth from Eden and that there were gold, bdellium pearl , and onyx stone a precious stone .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These are the same three kinds of materials found in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, the three materials in Genesis 2 appear again in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This shows that these three materials are of great significance to the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The record in this portion of the Word is symbolic or allegorical.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Like a picture, it looks very simple on the surface, but its intrinsic significance is profound.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you read the Scriptures, you will find that each one of these three kinds of materials pure gold, precious stones, and pearls has its definite significance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we would like to know the building up of the church, the building work of God throughout the ages, we need to understand the meanings of these materials in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let us first look at the pearls, which are a very special kind of material.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Pearls are produced by oysters, which grow in the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When an oyster is wounded by a grain of sand, it is stimulated to secrete a substance onto the grain of sand that gradually makes it into a pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, in the spiritual sense, the pearl denotes how we were regenerated to become a new creation in the wound of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>While in the world as the sea, the Lord Jesus as the oyster was wounded by us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As earthly people, every one of us may be likened to a grain of sand.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As grains of sands, we wounded Christ, and in His wound we experienced a transformation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By receiving the Lord's death we become a new creation through regeneration with the life that came out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this life, both death and resurrection are included.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the wound of the Lord we died with Him, resurrected together with Him, and also live together with Him in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the significance of pearls, which are formed by the mingling of the sand and the oyster.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This corresponds with the principle of three times four, the principle of the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, that the gates of the city are pearls indicates that whoever does not correspond with the nature of the pearl cannot enter into the city to participate in it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Anyone who enters into the city through the gate has to be the product of three times four the issue of the mingling of God with man, and a new creation in Christ through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You cannot bring anything natural, anything of the earth, into this building.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every grain of sand must be changed by entering into the oyster's wound.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every earthy person must pass through death and resurrection through the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All natural beings and all natural elements must become a new creation pearl through the dealing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only then can they enter through the gates.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After reading this, you may understand it in theory, but you still may not be clear about the application.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, let me give you an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, let us consider a person who is well educated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His mind is clear, and he is eloquent in speaking and competent in debating.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose that this person gets saved into the church in Taipei, and loves the Lord fervently.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As a result, within two months all of his good qualities will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the responsible brothers see his condition, they will likely say, "Oh, this brother is a mouthpiece; let us ask him to stand on the platform and give messages."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I want to tell you, brothers and sisters, that if this happens, those responsible brothers will be making a big mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since this brother has been saved for only a short amount of time, his eloquence, his mind, his education, and his way of thinking are all natural, sandy, and earthy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are not of resurrection or pearly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>None of his qualities can enter through the gates into the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, if the responsible brothers invite him to give a message, he may speak with great eloquence and present all the points in good order, and everyone may shower praises on him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, after he has been speaking for two or three months, I am afraid that the church will collapse because all his speaking will have been natural and earthy instead of pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His natural abilities have not yet touched the wound of Christ, have not yet been dealt with by the cross, and have not yet passed through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, instead of building the church, they tear it down.</S>
