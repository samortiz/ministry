<h2 class="head2">Succeeding in the Truth-teaching Meetings</h2>
<p>Second, the elders must build up the truth-teaching meetings. These meetings must become the center of all the meetings. In these meetings we must not only teach the truth but also help the saints to meet. In the future all large meetings and consolidated gatherings should be truth-teaching meetings. We do not have sermon meetings. Our sermon meetings are truth-teaching meetings.</p>
<p>Concerning the teaching of the truth, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery should be the most qualified and experienced among the Christian groups in Taiwan. Our teaching has spread even to other countries. No one&rsquo;s teaching can compare with ours. Our <em>Truth Lessons</em> have rich main points, clear outlines, simple and concise language, and are easy for new believers to understand. Of course, we should never be satisfied. We should study and improve our teaching and delivery skills.</p>
<p>The important thing is that we must not only teach, we must also make our meetings living. If we do this, we can bring our friends and relatives to the truth meetings. I hope that in the coming days, the truth meetings will be the most attractive meetings in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We need to turn with the age. Today everyone wants knowledge and information. Even an unbeliever wants to know the truth. If we preach in an ordinary way, others will not be attracted; however, if we speak logically, concisely, clearly, and with much content, others will be convinced. The whole world knows that Christianity teaches the Bible. Everyone more or less respects the Bible. If we can present the truth properly and clearly, based upon this well respected &ldquo;classic,&rdquo; others will rise up to admire it.</p>
<p>Today most people have received a good education. Most people are college graduates. We cannot invite people to come listen for an hour and a half to a message given in a sloppy manner. This is what we did before. The truth meetings, however, present a simple and clear message that is packed with truth and logic. This will easily touch people. To the educated and thoughtful people, this is very effective and attractive. Hence, we must make the truth meetings our goal. We should even use these meetings to preach the gospel. If we would practice this, it will become a new move in Christianity; others will not be able to match us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Actively Visiting<br />
the Communities and the Campuses</h2>
<p>Third, we need to actively engage ourselves in the visitation work in the communities and on the campuses. The co-workers and elders need to take the lead to do this work. Today Taiwan is growing rapidly. The expansion in the big cities mainly revolves around the new urban communities. There are high-class, young, and ambitious people living in these new communities. Some of these urban developments are more advanced than those in the United States. If we do not bring the gospel to them, we will miss the opportunity. We must take action and begin visiting. We are not the only ones who have noticed this phenomenon; the denominations are also paying attention to these new developments. If we take the initiative, we will gain people. If we wait until Christianity has started their work, it will be difficult to catch up. Hence, the co-workers and the elders need to wake up and take the lead to visit and work in these communities.</p>
<p>In the next term of the full-time training, there will be three hundred trainees. Every week they will spend two days visiting the communities. However, this work is not primarily theirs; this work belongs to the whole church. The elders must, therefore, stir up and encourage all the local saints to do their best to cooperate and coordinate together in the visitation work. In the future the spreading of the gospel will depend almost entirely on the communities. We must go to the communities. In addition, the campuses are important targets. In Taipei we should work to gain the students and to prepare the best material for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We should build up a strong testimony on all the campuses.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOCUSING ON THE CAMPUS WORK</h2>
<p>I have a proposal concerning the campus work. I hope we will fellowship thoroughly concerning this proposal. We must locate good meeting halls adjacent to good universities such as National Taiwan University. The location must be right, and the building must be large enough. Hall three was originally remodeled for this purpose. However, National Taiwan University is located near hall nineteen, and hall nineteen is not suitable for this use. I visited that hall once and was discouraged by what I saw. The location is hidden, and the hall is shabby. If I were a college student, especially from overseas, I would surely hesitate to go to such a hall. Even if I wanted to become a Christian, I would not want to enter such a shabby-looking place.</p>
<p>Let me say a word to the church in Taipei. For a brief time let us forget about Lin-ko. Let us focus on this goal and this burden. Secure a large and suitable building near the campus for a meeting hall. Find one that will hold at least three to four hundred people. National Taiwan University is the top university in this country. This university produces all the top people and has a large student population. We should have the foresight. If we want a campus work, we must work on National Taiwan University. I ask the co-workers to give me the liberty to bring up some old complaints. You have been under my training for many years and have been serving this entire time. Why have we not had this kind of view? We have always boldly declared that we are for the campus work, but what has been done on the top campus in the country? If I were taking the lead in the church in Taipei, I would surely go back to all of the meeting halls and fellowship aggressively about this burden. I would encourage all the brothers and sisters to make offerings for a new building near the campus. We should have this kind of spirit and this kind of view.</p>
<p>This is the reason I was merciless to the co-workers when I came back a year and a half ago. I was clear that if I was nice and polite, our work would not go on. I hope we will pray much before the Lord. Today we are engaged in the heavenly King&rsquo;s enterprise. We are building up His kingdom. This is a tremendous matter. We love the Lord. We want to be faithful to Him; for more than two or three decades we have given up everything and consecrated our all to Him. What have we accomplished? According to my observation, we have managed to hold on to a certain attainment; we have maintained a certain amount of truth and life. But what have we actually accomplished? In reality we are merely eking out a living. We should not be that passive and impotent. We should shake off this lethargy.</p>
<p>We should have a proper and practical plan concerning the campuses. Some meeting halls are five or six stories tall. What is the use of having such tall buildings in places that do not have a good campus? If the saints cannot afford to give for the campus, I do not believe we need to keep the big meeting halls. We can sell three or five of these halls and direct the money to a large facility by the campus. This is worthwhile. Even if we can gain only one hundred students from the campus, this is still worthwhile. When a nation launches a project, it cannot spend too much time calculating the cost involved; it can only count on the success of the project. If the project succeeds, it is worth the expense. I hope the elders will pray and fellowship thoroughly concerning this matter during the elders&rsquo; meeting.</p>
