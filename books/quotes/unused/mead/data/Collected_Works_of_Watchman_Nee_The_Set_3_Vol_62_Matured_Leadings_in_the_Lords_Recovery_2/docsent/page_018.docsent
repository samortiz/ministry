   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RESPONSIBLE ONES IN THE DISTRICTS Caring for and Cherishing the Saints like Elders</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The districts have responsible ones.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is an important function.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the one hand, these responsible ones have to care for the saints like elders.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the other hand, they have to be diligent like the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The responsible ones in a district must make proper arrangements before the meetings, take the lead during the meetings, and clean up after the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In short they have to act as the elders in the districts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a manner of speaking only; it does not mean that they actually carry the title of elder.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you are a responsible one in a district, you bear a much heavier responsibility for the souls of the people than the elders bear.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not possible for the elders to know all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But as a responsible brother in a district, you have to know every brother and sister in your district.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You have to take up the spiritual burden of all the saints in your district.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we cannot do this, we are merely splitting our meetings into districts; we have not fulfilled the real purpose of subdivision, which is to spread the care to the districts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The responsible brothers have to make proper arrangements in the districts for the follow-up work of all the ones received into our bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You cannot let one name slip away.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a brother or sister has been assigned to your district, you have to exercise care over him or her in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, you have to know the names of all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second, you have to know their faces.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You must recognize them and must not let them go away easily.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Third, you have to know their background, including their school, family, and environment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Fourth, you have to know their spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, you have to know how long they have been saved, whether or not they are meeting regularly, whether they have the experience of loving the Lord, and whether they are zealous for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps you have to ask them, "You have been saved for a long time already.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Have you led anyone to the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The responsible ones in a district have to be like the elders; they have to care for the brothers and sisters, to cherish them and nourish them with the heart of a father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They have to open up their hearts to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They have to exercise a fatherly concern for them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whether or not God's work will prosper among us depends not so much on the procedures and methods but on the amount of care we pour out on the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It depends on the fatherly and motherly compassion we exercise over God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Working under the Elders like Deacons</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A local church can be subdivided into districts based on number or on need, but its administration cannot be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A few people in a district cannot decide what that district should do or how they should do it; they cannot take things into their own hand and work independently.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The administration of the church is based on its locality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The business affairs, the shepherding, the care, and the perfecting of the saints in a church can be conducted in the districts, but first they must be discussed in fellowship with the church as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The responsible ones in a district have to pay attention to one thing more than the elders: They have to learn to ask before they do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is similar to what the deacons have to do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This applies not only to the care of the meetings, to the management of business affairs, but to the heading up of the work as well.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The responsible ones in a district are almost like elders, and yet they are not exactly the same as the elders of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For this reason the responsible brothers in a district have to learn to refer matters to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is beneficial to them in more than one sense.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The main emphasis of the church should not be business affairs, but spiritual affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The responsible ones in a district have to learn not to make any decisions in the districts.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In everything they first must fellowship with the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They must receive orders from the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the business decisions and methods of the elders do not work, they should first go back to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Never make any changes independently.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are humans, and even the elders can make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Of course, they have learned more lessons from God, and it is less likely for them to make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Here you have to learn the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If something is wrong, you have to refer back to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This will force the elders to go to God and come up with the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you deliberate and act independently, you will only bring damage to the church, not profit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A district is not a stand-alone local church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Arrangements to Be Made in a Local Church</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Visitation of the saints should be carried out in the districts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is the need of careful arrangement in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The districts should also make decisions concerning their business affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For example, we may have to borrow a saint's home for the district meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In so doing we should use such a home for our meeting only; we should not overburden that saint's household.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should set up the place ourselves and make the proper arrangements before and after the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should even prepare the drinking water by boiling it ahead of time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Every matter great or small, general or specific that goes on in the districts should be listed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Either the responsible brothers have to take care of it themselves, or they have to assign the brothers and sisters to take care of it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Gospel visitation should also be conducted in the districts under the direction and supervision of the districts.</S>
