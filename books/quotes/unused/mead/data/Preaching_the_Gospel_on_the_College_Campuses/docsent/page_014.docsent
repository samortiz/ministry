   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Loving All Men</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In addition to brotherly love, we also need love toward all men.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2 Peter there is a progression from the divine nature to brotherly love and eventually to the divine love, a love that is toward all men 2 Pet 1:4-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The New Testament tells us that we have to love our enemies Matt 5:44-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not hate any of our opposers or critics.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to love all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Saul of Tarsus was a chief opposer of the church Gal 1:13; 1 Tim 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When Stephen was being stoned to death, Saul of Tarsus was there approving of his death Acts 7:59 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He took the lead to persecute the church 1 Cor 15:9; Phil 3:6 , but on his way to Damascus to persecute the saints he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All of the early disciples were surprised, and many of them did not believe that Saul of Tarsus had turned to the Lord Acts 9:21, 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Prior to his conversion, I do not think that the early disciples loved him very much.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do you believe that the disciples loved Saul of Tarsus and prayed for him?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>None of the disciples may have even been willing to preach the gospel to him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to Acts 9:1-6, Paul was saved without any human involvement.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was saved through the Lord's direct preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This little hint indicates that the disciples probably did not like Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps they said, "Saul is a hopeless case."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This attitude can also be applied in today's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many times we think a certain person is hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is especially true of those who oppose us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the Lord's word, however, this attitude is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord said, "You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But I say to you, Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you" Matt 5:43-44 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a good verse for us to have in dealing with all the opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The young people on the campuses should not be troubled by persecutors.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Years ago I was very troubled by all the persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes I was so troubled that I even doubted whether our work was really of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then the Lord showed me in the Gospels that He was always persecuted Matt 10:16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many times there were more persecutors than followers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Acts, the persecutors followed Paul wherever he went Acts 9:22-24; 14:1-2, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I saw this, I was strengthened, confirmed, and comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I was in northern China, someone from my hometown opposed me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I even studied with him at the same college.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I moved from mainland China to the island of Taiwan in 1949, he purposely followed me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He told people that his purpose in coming to Taiwan was to stop my work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When he later found out that I was going to Singapore, he went ahead of me to spread rumors.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even in the United States, persecutors have followed us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Despite their activities, we should not fight them, but love them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some persecutors eventually turned to the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I was in college, one of the school's directors was a highly educated gentleman.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was very qualified, and he was a famous speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I was one of his students, and he truly loved me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the Lord brought me to His recovery, however, this man became very offended.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>While he was opposing, his eldest son and daughter-in-law were caught by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They came into the church and loved the Lord very much.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His daughter also turned this way, but the father still had a hard heart.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He continued to oppose us for over ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After his son, daughter-in-law, and daughter sent him many letters and telegrams asking him to attend a meeting, he finally came.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Later he told me that when he walked into the meeting, before he even sat down, he started to weep.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Throughout the whole meeting, he wept in regret over his opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In 1943 he turned this way and Brother Nee eventually appointed him to be one of the elders in the church in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not be discouraged or disappointed by all the opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whenever you meet an opposer on the campus, do not be bothered or downcast.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Instead smile and tell them that you love them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Learn to say this from your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must love them and be full of hope that they may one day turn this way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to love the opposers and pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In reality, our only enemy is Satan, and we have no human enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must have such an attitude, but we still need to be strong in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For the sake of the truth, we should be strong, but we should also love everyone, even the top opposers and evil persecutors.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should love them because the Lord Jesus tells us to love them and to pray for those who persecute us Matt 5:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should never compromise the truth, but we should exercise a universal love.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need a universal love, loving the Lord Jesus, loving all the saints, and loving all people, including the opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have to consider that the opposers are lovable human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the campuses we all must keep such an atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Do not give others the impression that we are fighting against everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>No matter what someone says against us, we should not be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After they speak, we may tell them that we love them and that we would like to talk with them about the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If they would not talk to us, then we can tell them that we will pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should be strong, be bold, and be steady in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>For the sake of the truth, we need to be strong and steady but we also need to love everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The more that others oppose us, the more we should love them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We even have to thank the Lord for the opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The opposition has helped us a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All the opposers have been for our perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we realize this, we will have mercy upon them, love them, and pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must keep such an attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This will stop any fighting on the campuses between the saints and the opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Do not think that when we fight for the truth, we must also fight against people.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We do not need to fight against people.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Rather, we need to love everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In our preaching of the gospel we need a proper daily living and a universal love.</S>
