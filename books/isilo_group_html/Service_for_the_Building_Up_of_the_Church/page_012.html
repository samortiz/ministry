<h1 class="title">FUNCTION BEING MANIFESTED<br />
THROUGH THE SPIRIT&rsquo;S OPERATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:15-16; Col. 2:19</h1>
<p>Ephesians 4:15-16 says, &ldquo;Holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; Colossians 2:19 says, &ldquo;Holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, being richly supplied and knit together by means of the joints and sinews, grows with the growth of God.&rdquo; Both of these portions are related to the building up of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH DEPENDING<br />
ON THE GROWTH IN LIFE</h2>
<p>Both of these portions speak of the growth of the Body in relation to the building up of the Body, which is the church (Eph. 1:22-23). This shows that the building up of the church is not the same as building a physical house. In order to build a physical house, one needs only to sort and organize wood and then frame and build the house. In order to build up the church, however, one cannot simply sort and organize the saints. Just as human limbs cannot be artificially joined and knit together into a living body, the saints cannot be built into the church through outward organization.</p>
<p>The building up of the church is altogether a matter of life. How much the church is built up depends on how much the saints in the church grow in life and in the stature of Christ. Spontaneously, as life grows, the saints are fitly joined and firmly knit together. Many responsible brothers and sisters have a heart to serve, and they long for the building up of the church, but the only way for the church to be built up is to lead the saints to grow in life. With the growth in life, there is building up; without the growth in life, there can never be building up.</p>
<p>I have met some workers of the Lord who are quite sociable and who can easily bond with people. Often they need only to speak a few words to a stranger in order for him to become very congenial toward them. They have a disposition that many persons find quite agreeable. We may think that these saints are quite capable of building up the church, of joining the brothers and sisters together. In experience, however, the churches in which these ones serve often have problems, and the brothers and sisters among them are often in discord. This is because the church cannot be built up by man&rsquo;s natural bonds or methods. The building up of the church is a matter of life. When we help the brothers and sisters to grow, to have the growth in life, they will be built up together. Man-made bonds do not last, and they often become a source of many problems. Only the growth in life brings in the building up of the church.</p>
<p>How can we grow in life? Simply speaking, growth in life is related to reducing the source of our problems, which is the element of our self, and to increasing the element of God in us. The story of God&rsquo;s life in us is one of reducing, negatively, the element of our self and of increasing, positively, the element of God. The more we experience life, the more the divine life grows. This reducing and increasing work is through the operation of the Spirit. The Spirit leads us in many things toward the goal of God&rsquo;s life growing in us and our being built up more with the brothers and sisters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT NEEDING OUR COOPERATION<br />
TO WORK OUT MAN&rsquo;S GROWTH IN LIFE</h2>
<p>The Spirit needs our cooperation. God works on the brothers and sisters through those who have received the benefit of the Spirit&rsquo;s operation. This does not mean that the Spirit cannot work on a Christian directly but that according to the spiritual principle, the Spirit works on some so that He can in turn work on others through them.</p>
<p>Some believers are full of the element of the self in everything they do. Although they are saved, they do not have much of the element of God, the element of building. In order for them to be truly built up in the church, there is a need for some who have been worked on by the Spirit and who have a certain measure of function. Through such ones, the Spirit has a way to build up the believers by reducing the element of their self and increasing the element of God. The Spirit works in the saints and arranges their environments in order to work on them, but God must gain a group of people who will cooperate with Him and work with Him.</p>
<p>The cooperation that a believer gives to God related to the work of the Spirit is his function in the church. The service that counts, the work that builds up the brothers and sisters, comes into being through our cooperation with the Spirit. Only this service has spiritual value, and only this service can build up the church. If we have been worked on by the Spirit and if we work according to the move of the Spirit, the brothers and sisters whom we serve will spontaneously accept the operation of the Spirit. Thus, they will have less of their natural element and more of God&rsquo;s element, and they will grow in life, and the church will be built up.</p>
<p>Without the Spirit working in us, we will not be able to be subject to the authority of the Head, even if this is our earnest desire. Furthermore, our love for the brothers and sisters will contain mostly the element of our self, and even our zealous and diligent service will not manifest much function. Everything depends on how much we allow the Spirit to work in us. The more the Spirit can work in us, the less there will be of the element of our self and the more there will be of the element of God. Then as our life grows, the function of life will be manifested.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Service for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
