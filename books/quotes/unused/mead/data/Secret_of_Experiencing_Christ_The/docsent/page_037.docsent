   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In our hymnal we selected about 800 hymns from over 10,000 collected hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Among these selected hymns were a number of hymns written by A.B. Simpson, the founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One of his hymns Hymns, #255 speaks of breathing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first stanza and chorus of this hymn say:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>O Lord, breathe Thy Spirit on me</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Teach me how to breathe Thee in;</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Help me pour into Thy bosom</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All my life of self and sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am breathing out my sorrow,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Breathing out my sin;</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am breathing, breathing, breathing,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All Thy fulness in.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After singing this hymn for the first time, one brother was offended at the thought of breathing the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, a few years later, after having had the experience of breathing Christ, he expressed his appreciation of this hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord's recovery is to recover all the subjective experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is why in the previous chapters after I presented to you many items of Christ's Person and work, I emphasized the fact that now there is an organic union between us and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This organic union is not physical.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not material, visible, or touchable.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is something organic, something of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No life, whether animal, vegetable, human, or divine, is visible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Life is real, but life is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Electricity is a good illustration of this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Electricity is not visible, but it is real.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the tubes in a fluorescent light fixture are united to the power plant in a kind of electrical union.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is this electrical union which affords the light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This electrical union is the electrical current flowing between the power plant and the fluorescent tubes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may apply this illustration to understand our organic union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are the fluorescent tubes, and Christ is the power plant.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Between us and Christ there is a spiritual current.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This spiritual current is an organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are united to Christ and Christ is united to us in this current.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this organic union, Christ is in you, in me, and in every one of His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the organic union in which we should abide, in which we should remain.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To abide in Christ is to remain in this organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Every day, morning and evening, we have the deep sense that in our spirit there is a kind of current flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the living Christ, this is the organic union, and this is the spiritual fellowship of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ lives in this organic union, and we also live in this organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He and we are living together in this one organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This organic union is fully illustrated by Christ in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There He told us that He is the vine and we are the branches of this vine.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the vine with all the branches we can see an organic union in which life is flowing and circulating.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is in this circulation that both the vine and the branches grow.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The vine and the branches are growing together in this organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are living together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ lives and we live with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The vine lives in all the branches, and all the branches live in the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They live together one with another.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all need to see this.</S>
