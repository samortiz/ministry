   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Anything That Quenches</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our Spiritual Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is difficult for us to point out the world item by item; the list is endless.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But we should grasp one basic principle: everything that quenches one s spiritual life in the Lord is the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The world is anything that kills one s zeal for prayer to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The world is anything that takes away one s interest in God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The world is anything that frustrates one from testifying before men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The world is anything that hinders one from coming to the Lord, anything that results in confession.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The world is an atmosphere that chokes and dries a person up.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is anything that discourages a man s heart from loving and yearning for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here we see a broad principle anything that quenches our spiritual condition before the Lord is the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must reject all of it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some people say, This thing is not sinful at all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Can you say that it is worldly?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many things appear to be very good to our eyes, but they quench the fire within us after we touch them once or twice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our conscience becomes weak before God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After we become involved with these things, our Bible reading becomes tasteless.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may have the time, but we no longer have the heart for reading.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After we participate in such things, we feel empty inside and have nothing to testify before men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such things may not be a matter of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our question is whether or not these things are quenching our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everything that quenches our spiritual life is the world and must be rejected totally before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>D. Everything That Fails to Give Others</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>the Impression That We Are Christians</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to mention one more thing our relationship with other people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Any kind of social function, communication, or activity that causes us to hide our lamp under the bushel is the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many social friendships, functions, and contacts with worldly people force us to put our lamp under the bushel; there is no way under those circumstances for us to stand up to declare that we are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When others engage in such conversation, you have to pretend to be courteous.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You have to listen to them and laugh with them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You feel quenched within, but you have to put on a smiling face.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Inwardly you feel that this is the world, yet outwardly you have to go along with it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Inwardly you know this is sin, yet outwardly you cannot say that it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You should not remain in this kind of social environment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many of God s children are gradually sucked into the world through indiscriminate social activities and contacts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All new believers must know where they stand from the very beginning, and they must make a choice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are not trying purposely to be antisocial.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are not John the Baptist who did not eat or drink.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We follow our Lord who ate and drank.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But when we contact people, we must maintain our stand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No one should be able to insult our Christian stand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They should respect our stand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I take a stand as a Christian, I must maintain my stand even if others criticize me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we really want to take the way of separation from the world, we must pay attention to our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must also show our Christian stand every time we are in the company of others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we cannot maintain our stand as Christians, it is better to turn away from where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Psalm 1:1 says that we should not stand on the path of sinners, / Nor sit in the company of mockers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we stand on the path of sinners, we will end up in their place sooner or later.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we sit in the company of mockers, we will become mockers sooner or later.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sin and mocking are contagious.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must learn to flee these things as if we are fleeing from germs.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>E. Things Disapproved of by Weak Believers</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Things which stumble a weak conscience are another class of things that constitute the world.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God s children must learn to turn away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The previous discussion concerns things which the world considers improper.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Here we are talking about things which a young Christian considers improper.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If a Gentile thinks that we should not do a certain thing, we will lose our testimony if we do it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Similarly, we should avoid anything that a Christian disapproves of, even if the one who disapproves is the youngest and weakest of all Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the biblical commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is not the words of the strong Christian but the words of the weak Christian that should determine what we should or should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What they say may not be correct; what they consider forbidden may not be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But we should not stumble them because their conscience is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They may think that we are on the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we take such a way, we will stumble them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Paul said, All things are lawful to me, but not all things are profitable 1 Cor 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All things are lawful, but others may consider these things to be a form of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, we should not do them for their sake.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Paul spoke of the example of eating meat.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He said that if eating meat would stumble a brother, he would never eat meat.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Who can abstain from meat forever?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Paul s word does not suggest that one should not eat meat.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In 1 Timothy he clearly said that it is wrong to abstain from meat.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, he showed us that he was willing to carry such caution to the extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It did not matter to him whether or not he ate meat.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He might have been clear about what he was doing, but others who followed him may not have known what he was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We may know at which point we should stop, but those who follow may not know this.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What would happen if they take a few steps further?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There is nothing wrong if we eat meat, but after awhile those who follow us may go to the temple to eat the sacrifices or perhaps worship the idols as well.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Many things may not be directly related to the world, but we should still exercise care in touching them because others may consider them a form of the world.</S>
