[1]  CONSECRATION Scripture Reading: Exo 28:1-2, 40-41; 29:1-25; Lev 8:14-28; Rom 6:13, 16, 19; 12:1; 1 Cor 6:19-20; 2 Cor 5:14-15
[2]  If he views his faith in the Lord Jesus as being a favor to the Lord and his faith in God as a courtesy to Him, it will be impossible to talk to him about consecration.
[3]  We are no longer our own; we are the Lord's. We must glorify God in our bodies because we are not our own; we have been bought by the Lord with a price.
[4]  In order to receive the holy service before God, that is, in order to consecrate oneself to God, the first thing that has to be taken care of is the propitiation for sin.
[5]  The problem of our sin is settled by the sin offering, but the burnt offering makes us acceptable to God.
[6]  The burnt offering is the sweet savor of the Lord Jesus before God that secures God's acceptance of Him.
[7]  This means that since God has accepted us in Christ, we should acknowledge the blood's separation of our ears, hands, and feet fully unto God.
[8]  We should declare that our ears, hands, and feet are fully God's. Because of redemption, our ears, which were made for hearing, should now hear for God; our hands, which were made for working, should now work for God.
[9]  From this day forward, our ears will listen for the Lord, our hands will work for the Lord, and our feet will run for the Lord.
[10]  The goal of consecration is not to become a preacher for God or to work for Him.
[11]  May God be gracious to us and show us that our service to Him is our rightful duty.
[12]  But before God we must see that our entire life is directed towards our service to God.
