The Spirit of God</H2><P>The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:9a). When He comes in, God comes in. The Holy Spirit dispenses God as the very element into us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Spirit of Christ</H2><P>The Holy Spirit is also the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9b). If Christ were not the Spirit, He could not come into us. According to Romans 8:9, the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ. Thus, when the Spirit of Christ comes into us, Christ Himself comes in. When we have Christ, we have God as the element.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Spirit of Life</H2><P>The Holy Spirit is also the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2a). God, Christ, and life are one. They are three in one. God is Christ, and Christ is life (John 11:25; 14:6). This life is just the Spirit. Thus, the Spirit is called "the Spirit of life."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Indwelling Spirit</H2><P>The Holy Spirit is also the indwelling Spirit (Rom. 8:11a). How wonderful this is! Do not say that because you are a bad person you are unqualified to have the Spirit indwelling you. No one is good (Rom. 3:12) except God (Matt. 19:17). We all are bad; therefore, we all are qualified to receive God. We need God, we need Christ, and we need life. Now, the Spirit who is God, Christ, and life is indwelling us. He is the indwelling Spirit who gives life. His giving of life is His dispensing of life. I can testify that every day, nearly every moment, the indwelling Spirit is within me dispensing life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Spirit Who Gives Life</H2><P>The Holy Spirit as the indwelling Spirit is also the Spirit who gives life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To the Believers' Spirit</H2><P>The indwelling Spirit gives life first to the believers' spirit (Rom. 8:10). We have three parts: spirit, soul, and body (1 Thes. 5:23). When the Spirit gives life to our spirit, our spirit is regenerated (John 3:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To the Believers' Mind</H2><P>The Spirit then gives life to the believers' mind (Rom. 8:6b). In Romans 8 the mind is mentioned instead of the soul because the major part, the leading part, of the soul is the mind. In the New Testament the mind equals the soul. In the renewing of the believers, the first step is to give life to their spirit, and the second step is to give life to their soul.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_155.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_157.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Central Line of the Divine Revelation &nbsp; pg 156</div><br></body></html>
