   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Peace Offering</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to Be Eaten by the Clean Persons</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The peace offering to be eaten by the clean persons signifies Christ, who is our peace, to be dispensed into us, who are clean, for our spiritual enjoyment in the fellowship with God Lev 7:15-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the people of God, as long as they were clean, were allowed to eat the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To offer the peace offering to God is higher than to offer the sin and trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To help others to overcome sin and sins is not as high as bringing others into fellowship with God and with His saints.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Wave Offering</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>of the Breast of the Peace Offering</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>and the Heave Offering</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>of the Right Thigh of the Peace Offering</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>to Be Eaten by the Offering Priests</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The wave offering of the breast of the peace offering and the heave offering of the right thigh of the peace offering were to be eaten by the offering priests, signifying that the Christ of love and the Christ of strength are to be dispensed into us as the offering priests for our enjoyment of Christ in His love and in His strength Lev 7:28-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The peace offering could be eaten by all God's people who were clean.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the breast and the right thigh were particular parts of the peace offering that only the offering priests could eat.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are God's children and are cleansed by His blood, we have the right to eat Christ as the peace offering for our enjoyment in the fellowship with God and the fellowship with all His dear saints.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, we do not have the right to eat the breast, signifying the Christ of love, and the right thigh, signifying the Christ of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These particular parts are only for the serving priests.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For the Triune God, who is embodied in Christ, to dispense Himself into us, we need to be the right persons.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First, we need to be God's people; second, we need to be God's cleansed people; third, we need to be God's priests; and fourth, we need to be God's serving priests, ministering to others what we have enjoyed of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we are merely cleansed, redeemed persons, we have the right to enjoy only the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not have the right to enjoy Christ as the meal offering, the sin offering for others, or the breast and right thigh of the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many believers today are going on in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They are saved, and whenever they sin, they confess their sin, and the Lord's blood cleanses them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, most are not priests, but if they are priests, they are not offering priests.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They do not offer the sin and trespass offering for others, or even if they do, they may not offer the peace offering for others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we offer Christ to God for others, we have a particular right to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are such ones, we can enjoy Christ as the meal offering, the sin and trespass offering, the peace offering, and the two particular parts of the peace offering the loving breast and the strengthening thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this way we have more and more enjoyment of God, and God has more and more opportunities to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have four levels of the enjoyment of God, and God dispenses Himself into us in four levels.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He dispenses Himself into us as His cleansed and redeemed people in a general way, as priests in a higher way, as priests who offer Christ as the sin and trespass offering in an even higher way, and as the priests who offer Christ as the peace offering for others to have fellowship with God and His people in the highest way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we preach the gospel to a sinner, we offer Christ as the sin and trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The one whom we contact may be an unsaved sinner or a fallen believer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We contact such a one with a burden and with Christ in our spirit to bring him Christ as his sin offering and trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is to offer Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To contact others in this way will make us stronger and stronger in the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many times we may come to a sinner not knowing what to say or having nothing to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we enjoy Christ as the sin offering, we will have a strong word to speak about Christ being the offering for our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we speak in such a way, we enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the same way, if we do not have much fellowship with God in the enjoyment of Christ as the peace offering, we will not have much to minister to the saints to help them to enter into the fellowship with God by enjoying Christ as the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we have the experience of the riches of Christ, we will be able to help others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We will be able to minister Christ to others as their peace offering, and we will also enjoy what we minister.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This will afford God the opportunities to dispense Himself into us.</S>
