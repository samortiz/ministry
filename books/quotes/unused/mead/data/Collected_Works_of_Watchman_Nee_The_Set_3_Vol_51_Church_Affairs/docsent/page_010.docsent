   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HELPING THE RESPONSIBLE BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE SURROUNDING AREAS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the future you can do a very profitable thing in a local church which is also the center of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, if you are in Peking and you see that there are three very good brothers in Sui-Yuan and another two very good brothers in T'ai-yuan, you can invite them to come to Peking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The meeting of the responsible brothers in Peking should be open to them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This meeting is not open to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It should not be open to sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We do not allow sisters to attend.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today if a brother comes from T'ai-yuan and attends this meeting, it is a very great privilege we extend to him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may tell him, "This meeting is not for others, and we do not lightly open the door to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today we invite you to come and live here for a month or two with the hope that you can learn something.''</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the beginning let him sit in the meeting, without saying anything.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He should learn to observe how you manage spiritual things before God, how problems are solved, how questions are raised and discussed, how prayers are offered, how to sense before God whether or not a certain thing should be done, and how to make a decision when peace is obtained.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then show him how to answer the questions the brothers and sisters bring, how you fellowship with brothers from out of town, how you receive those who ask to participate in the breaking of bread, and how you fellowship with those who want to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Present a pattern to him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After a period of time, you can say to him, "Please speak to this brother on our behalf.''</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then you should observe how he speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After some time, perhaps you may send him back.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let him do the work of an overseer in T'ai-yuan without giving him the name.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A little later, you might go to T'ai-yuan and hear what the saints there are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not all the criticisms will be correct, but you need to know the things this brother has done.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The criticisms of some brothers are not correct because they do not submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If this brother is actually wrong, you have to see where the problem is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When you go to visit the second time, you should be clear whether or not that brother can bear the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For this reason it is necessary to have strong meetings at the center of the work, where the apostles are.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You need to help the meetings of the overseers so that you will be able to help the responsible brothers in this district through this church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Otherwise, you have no way to help them because you do not have any pattern to show them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You have no pathway to lead them on.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For a brother who has the qualification before the Lord and who can learn to be a responsible brother, you should let him learn in the center of the work through the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then his eyes will be opened to realize that he has been reckless in his own locality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many times brothers have told me that they now realize what they did in the church before was really reckless.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many people have never seen what a spiritual church is and how a spiritual church should be taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many times they just come together and make decisions in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the meeting you should hold the rein and also let the responsible brothers in that locality hold the rein.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Show them that this meeting is more serious than the time Moses was on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was only given the law, but we are taking care of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To take care of the church is more serious than Moses going up to the mountain to receive two tablets of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, you should make your home in the church where the center of the work is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That place must be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only when it is strong do you have the way to make the churches in the surrounding area strong and bring them into the presence of the Lord.</S>
