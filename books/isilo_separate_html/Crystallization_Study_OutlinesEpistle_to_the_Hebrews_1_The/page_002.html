<h1 class="title">God&rsquo;s Speaking in the Son</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 1:1-2a; Acts 6:7; 12:24; 19:20</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Our God is the revealed God because He has revealed Himself in His speaking&mdash;Heb. 1:1-2a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today there is the multiplication and abundance of God&rsquo;s word&mdash;Acts 6:7; 12:24; 19:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God is speaking day after day and meeting after meeting&mdash;Lev. 1:1.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s speaking to us proves that we are under His blessing&mdash;cf. 1 Sam. 3:1, 10, 21.</li>
		<li>The life of the believers hinges totally upon the Lord&rsquo;s speaking&mdash;Heb. 1:3; Matt. 17:5; Rev. 2:7a; S. S. 8:13; Heb. 5:13-14.</li>
		<li>The living God imparts and infuses Himself into us by speaking&mdash;2 Tim. 3:16-17; Ezek. 37:4-6:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>When God speaks, the light shines, bringing us understanding, vision, knowledge, wisdom, and utterance&mdash;Psa. 119:105, 130.</li>
			<li>When God speaks, life is imparted, and this life includes all the divine attributes and human virtues of Christ&mdash;John 6:63; 1:1, 4.</li>
			<li>When God speaks, power is transmitted, and this is the growing and reproducing power of life&mdash;Mark 4:14, 26.</li>
			<li>&ldquo;If the Lord would take me away from this country, I would have the complete assurance that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in this country would still go on because it is not a movement of man&rsquo;s doing. It is a move of the divine life growing. The seed has been sown here, the word has come, and life is here. Hallelujah! Where the word is, there is power in life. Now we can see why God speaks. He speaks to shine, to enliven, and to empower&rdquo; (<em>Life-study of Hebrews,</em> p. 26).</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The whole universe came into being by God&rsquo;s speaking&mdash;Rom. 4:17; Heb. 11:3; Psa. 33:9.</li>
	<li>In the Old Testament, God spoke in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets, in men borne by His Spirit&mdash;2 Pet. 1:21.</li>
	<li>In the New Testament, God speaks in the Son, in the person of the Son:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This person was firstly individual and then became corporate.</li>
		<li>God today speaks in a person, and this person has been increased to be a corporate person, including all the apostles and all the members of this person&rsquo;s Body&mdash;1 Cor. 14:4b, 31.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The essence of the Epistle to the Hebrews is God&rsquo;s speaking in the Son:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God speaks in the Son, the Son speaks as the Spirit to the churches, and ultimately the Spirit speaks with the church&mdash;Rev. 2:7a; 22:17.</li>
		<li>It is altogether by this speaking story that God is brought into man and man is brought into God.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The apostles&rsquo; teaching, the unique teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, is God&rsquo;s speaking in the Son&mdash;the entire speaking of God in the New Testament concerning the full ministry of Christ in three stages&mdash;Acts 2:42; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; 6:3; Heb. 1:1-2a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>First, God spoke in the Son as a man in the four Gospels, revealing the stage of Christ in incarnation&mdash;John 14:10; 5:24; 16:12; 10:30:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To bring the infinite God into the finite man.</li>
		<li>To unite and mingle the Triune God with the tripartite man.</li>
		<li>To express in His humanity the bountiful God in His rich attributes through His aromatic virtues.</li>
		<li>To accomplish His all-inclusive judicial redemption.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Second, God spoke in the Son as the Spirit through the apostles in Acts and the twenty-one Epistles (Romans through Jude), revealing the stage of Christ in inclusion&mdash;John 16:12-15; Matt. 28:19-20; Heb. 2:3-4; 2 Pet. 3:15-16; Col. 1:25-27:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be begotten as God&rsquo;s firstborn Son.</li>
		<li>To become the life-giving Spirit.</li>
		<li>To regenerate the believers for His Body.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Third, God spoke in the Son as the seven Spirits through the apostle John in Revelation, revealing the stage of Christ in intensification:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To intensify His organic salvation.</li>
		<li>To produce the overcomers.</li>
		<li>To consummate the New Jerusalem.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The proper ministry is the ministry according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching, the teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, for the building up of the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem.</li>
	</ol></li>
