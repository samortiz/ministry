   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING MET BY GOD S LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, the requirements of the kingdom are not meant to be met and fulfilled by us; they are to be met and fulfilled by God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The requirements of the kingdom speak forth how able God is; the requirements of the law, on the other hand, speak forth how impotent man is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus said, Only with difficulty will a rich man enter into the kingdom of the heavens...It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God 19:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I do not know if anyone has seen an eye of a needle large enough for a camel to pass through.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, no matter how large the eye of a needle can be, it cannot make possible the passage of a camel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even if we have never seen a camel and do not know how big it is, at least we have seen the eye of a needle.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even the largest eye of a needle is not large enough.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No matter how large the eye of a needle could be, a person could not pass through it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How then could a camel pass through it?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus used such an illustration, telling the disciples that it is even more difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of the heavens than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that entering into the kingdom of the heavens is impossible with man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Upon hearing and understanding this, the disciples immediately asked the Lord, Who then can be saved? v. 25 . This is a good question who can be saved? This is an impossible thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the Lord answered immediately, With men this is impossible v. 26 . With man, the fulfilling of God s requirements is certainly impossible; it is unattainable by man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is impossible for man to be perfect as God is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Likewise, it is impossible for man to have a righteousness that surpasses that of the scribes and the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is even more impossible for man not to have any filthy thought or any anger.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No one can fulfill any of these requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When someone slaps us on our right cheek, we need to turn to him the other also this is not something that we can do.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is as impossible as requiring a cat to fly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Who then can enter into the kingdom of the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus said, With men this is impossible, but He went on to say, with God all things are possible v. 26 . Hallelujah! With man this is impossible, but with God it is possible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, to enter into the kingdom depends not on man but on God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The requirements of the kingdom cannot be met by man; they can be met only by God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE VITAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE KINGDOM AND LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How does God meet the requirements of the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He does it by coming into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the New Testament we must see two things, the kingdom and life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These two are great and weighty things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord said, The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He also said, Unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The requirements for entering the kingdom of the heavens are great.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, there is a life that can meet these requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God s Word says, Everyone who believes into Him the Lord Jesus may have eternal life John 3:15 ; he who has the Son has the life 1 John 5:12 ; and unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God John 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that if we are regenerated, we can see the kingdom of God; if we have God s life, we have the way to enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the New Testament we find not only the kingdom but also life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whereas the kingdom is a demand, life is a supply.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We see a strict demand in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This demand is not the law but is something higher than the law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It requires us not merely to be perfect or excellent but to be like God and ultimately to be perfect as God is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Is anything higher than God?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Is there anything more perfect than God?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The kingdom requires us to be as high as God and as perfect as God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God s Word says, Unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees...</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Matt 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees is the righteousness of the moralists and the law keepers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If our righteousness does not surpass this kind of righteousness, we cannot enter into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This shows how high the requirements of the kingdom are.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect v. 48 ; this is to be perfect as God is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is a high requirement that cannot be met by man; with man it is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, with God it is possible.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How can it be possible with God?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is possible through His entering into us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When He enters into us as our life, He supplies us with the power that enables us to do what we otherwise cannot do.</S>
