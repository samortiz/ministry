   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eph 5:26; John 17:17; 6:63 Outline To be made holy Holiness is God Himself Growth By His life Through the Spirit and the Word Text</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Praise the Lord for regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Through it we have received a new life, a new heart, and a new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit of God is now dwelling within us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our spirit, which had been deadened by man s fall, has now been made alive by the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have now begun to subjectively experience God s full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Praise Him for this wonderful new beginning!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But is this all there is to God s salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Certainly not.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Several more things must take place for God s full salvation to be completed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this lesson we will talk about sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sanctification is the swallowing up of our sinful nature by the working of God s holy nature into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I. TO BE MADE HOLY</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order for God s holy nature to be worked into us, sanctification is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sanctification means the process by which something is made holy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some people think that if you try not to sin, then you are holy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some think that if you stay away from evil things, then you are holy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But, how can we, the unholy people full of the satanic nature, become holy just by doing or not doing certain things?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is impossible!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>HOLINESS IS GOD HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the whole universe, God is the only holy One.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His life and nature are holy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you don t have God, you cannot be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you have a little God, you have a little holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you have more God, you have more holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you are full of God, you are full of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Holiness is just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>GROWTH</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You have been regenerated by believing in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Are you holy?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you say yes, then how much?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Regeneration is a new birth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Peter tells us that young Christians are newborn babes l Pet.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At regeneration, we were born of God and received a portion of God s holy life and nature into us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, we are a little holy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we grow in the divine life and nature, we become more holy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The growing of life is the adding of God s holy nature into us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This growth process is called sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>BY HIS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Romans 5:10 says, For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This verse clearly tells us that the saving in life is much more than reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Reconciliation only took care of our outward problem with God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But being saved in His life saves us from our sinful nature into the divine and holy nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Apostle Paul used the words much more to show the importance of sanctification in life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>V. THROUGH THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The way to be sanctified is to touch the Spirit of holiness Rom 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord has come into our spirit through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we turn to the Lord and pray, we touch the Spirit of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At that moment, the holy nature spreads into our soul to sanctify us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>John 17:17 also tells us that we are sanctified in the truth of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>So, we also need to touch the Lord through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this lesson, we can see that we should not be satisfied with being forgiven or cleansed by God or even with being regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These things are wonderful but we must go on.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must go on until we reach full maturity in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we reach this goal, we will be fully sanctified; that is, we will be saturated with the holy life and nature of God, and able to express and represent Him fully.</S>
