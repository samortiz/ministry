[1]  When Jesus Christ was born 2,000 years ago, an angel appeared at night to some shepherds and said, I announce to you good news of great joy, which will be for all the people, because today a Savior has been born to you in David s city, who is Christ the Lord Luke 2:10-11 .
[2]  We become sons of God not merely because we are declared so by God but because we have received His life through believing in His Son John 1:12; 1 John 5:12 and now partake of His divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 .
[3]  In His divinity, Christ is forever the only begotten Son of God, but as the unique God-man, who passed through death and resurrection, He is the firstborn Son of God among many brothers, among many sons of God.
