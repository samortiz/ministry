   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today the Lord is recovering the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The contents of the outlines in this book are from audio messages and recent publications of Brother Witness Lee that have been made available to the Lord s children during the past four years; the basic revelation in these outlines is from his speaking during the past sixteen months.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The outlines cover the matter of prophesying in the meetings of the church for the organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the scriptural revelation in Corinthians 14, prophesying is not in the sense of predicting, foretelling, but in the sense of speaking for the Lord and speaking forth the Lord to dispense Christ to people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is the excelling gift for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our desire is that the Lord would use these outlines to help perfect the saints unto the work of the ministry, equipping them to carry out God s eternal economy to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>November 1989</S>
