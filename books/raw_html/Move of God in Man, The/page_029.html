<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Dying for All of Us</H2><P>Christ also died for all of us (2 Cor. 5:14-15). He died not only for our sin but also for us, the persons.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Crucifying Our Old Man</H2><P>Romans 6:6 says that our old man has been crucified with Christ, and in Galatians 2:20a Paul said, "I am crucified with Christ." "I" here refers to the old man. "I," the old man, have been crucified with Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Destroying the Devil,<br>Who Has the Might of Death</H2><P>Hebrews 2:14 tells us clearly that Christ destroyed the devil, who has the might of death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Judging and Crucifying the World</H2><P>In John 12:31 we can see the judgment of the world through the death of Christ. Then Galatians 6:14 speaks of the crucifixion of the world.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Tasting Death for All Things<br>and Reconciling All Things to God</H2><P>Hebrews 2:9 says that Christ tasted death for all things, and Colossians 1:20 says that through His death, He reconciled all things to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Abolishing the Law in Ordinances<br>and Slaying the Enmity between Peoples</H2><P>In His crucifixion, Christ abolished the law in ordinances and slew the enmity between peoples, especially between the Jews and the Gentiles (Eph. 2:15-16; Col. 2:14). The law comprises the Ten Commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances in the Old Testament. When a statute carries a judgment with it, it becomes an ordinance. Keeping the Sabbath is a statute, but this statute carries a judgment with it, so it is an ordinance. The children of Israel were required to keep the Sabbath. Otherwise, they would be stoned to death (Exo. 31:14-15; Num. 15:32-36). This judgment makes keeping the Sabbath an ordinance. When judgment is added to statutes, they become ordinances. When Christ was crucified on the cross, all the ordinances were nailed there (Col. 2:14).</P><P>Now we need to consider who died on the cross. Satan was destroyed on the cross. We believers died on the cross. You have to say, "Hallelujah, I died there, and my enemy Satan died there." The world died there. Our sin died there. Who did not die there? You may say, "God!" But do not say this. In the crucifixion of Christ, God died in man! Satan and the fallen angels died there, God died there, man died there, the world died there, and the entire old creation died there (Heb. 2:9; Col. 1:20).</P>
