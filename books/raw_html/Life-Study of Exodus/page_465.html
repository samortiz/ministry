<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">THE SANCTIFICATION OF AARON AND HIS SONS<br />TO BE THE PRIESTS</h1><h1 class="title">(12)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 29:29-46</h1><p>Exodus 29:38-40 says, &ldquo;And this is what you shall offer upon the altar: two lambs a year old, every day continually. The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer between the evenings; and with the one lamb a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mingled with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and a fourth of a hin of wine for a drink offering.&rdquo; According to these verses, two lambs a year old were to be offered every day, one in the morning and the other in the evening. Along with each lamb, there was to be an offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour, a fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and a fourth of a hin of wine.</p><p>In typology, or in figure, a lamb signifies Christ as the One obedient to God and meek before men. When Christ was on earth, He lived a life of obedience and meekness. The four Gospels indicate that Christ in His humanity was obedient and meek.</p><p>When some read this word about the meekness of Christ, they may wonder if Christ was meek when He took a whip of cords and drove out the moneychangers from the temple (John 2:15). We need to remember that Christ is all-inclusive. As a man, He is obedient and meek. But He is also the Lord and the Master. As the Master, it was necessary for Him to chasten His people. A father may be very gentle and meek, but it is still sometimes necessary for him to discipline his children. A father should not say, &ldquo;I should always be a lamb in relation to my children. Therefore, I should not discipline them.&rdquo; In such a case, he would be a lamb-father. But in the Bible there is no such thing as a lamb-father. Rather, the Bible reveals that the Father must discipline, chasten, His children. Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s chastening of His people in no way detracts from His meekness as a human being.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LIFE PRODUCER AND LIFE SUPPLY</h2><p>Let us now go on to consider the items of the vegetable life in Exodus 29: the wheat, the oil, and the wine. In <i>The All-Inclusive Christ</i> we have pointed out in detail that wheat and barley are both types of Christ as our life supply. As the vegetable life, Christ is the One who produces life. A grain of wheat is useful in producing life and also in producing food for eating. When a grain of wheat is sown into the ground, it eventually grows and produces wheat. When the wheat is ground into flour, it becomes suitable for eating. Therefore, wheat signifies Christ as the life producer and also as the life supply.</p><p>In the Gospel of John we have a revelation of Christ as the life producer and life supply. In John 6:41 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the bread that came down out of heaven.&rdquo; Elsewhere in the same chapter, the Lord used five barley loaves and two fishes to feed the multitude. Moreover, according to John 12:24, the Lord Jesus was a grain of wheat who fell into the ground to produce many grains: &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&rdquo; In chapter six of John we have the life supply, and in chapter twelve, the life producing.</p><p>When we offer Christ to God in the morning as our sin offering, we shall be brought into a clear situation with God. We shall also have a clear conscience, a liberated spirit, and an atmosphere of peace. Spontaneously, during the day Christ will be a lamb to us, and we shall live Him as this lamb. Furthermore, we shall also experience Christ as a grain of wheat. As we live Him, He will become our life supply, and He will also produce something within us that is good for eating. This is the way to grow Christ as wheat.</p><p> Are you still wondering how to grow Christ as wheat? The way to grow Christ is to live Him as your life supply and as the One who produces life within you. Words are not adequate to describe this experience. But if we daily offer Christ as our sin offering, other experiences of Christ will follow automatically. By offering Christ to God as our sin offering, we indicate strongly that we mean business with God. Perhaps in the past we were somewhat negligent and did not mean business with the Lord. However, offering Christ to God as a sin offering proves that we are serious with the Lord in living Him. Previously we may have talked about living Christ, but were not seriously intending to live Him. But from the time we sincerely begin to offer Christ as a sin offering, we indicate that we mean business with the Lord. As a result of offering Christ as the sin offering, the sky is clear over us, our spirit is freed, and spontaneously Christ as the life-giving Spirit has the ground in us to move and the opportunity to energize us inwardly. Then spontaneously we live Him as a lamb and also as a grain of wheat. In this way we raise Christ as a lamb, and we grow Him as wheat.</p>
