   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being Perfected to Be a Pillar</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How can you tell that someone has become a pillar?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the church life we realize that if certain brothers are taken away, everything collapses, but if they are present, they are pillars supporting the whole building.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord is not concerned about those who are offended; He cares for those who will become pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The pillars can only be perfected in Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other words, the pillars can only be set up in Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No pillar for God's house has ever been set up outside of Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If that brother whom I met in Dallas had not come into the church but had remained in a denomination, he could not have been perfected to be a pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was perfected in Bethel, in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After we experience Christ in a subjective way and are definitely and absolutely in the church life, we still need a great deal of perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let us consider further the pillars mentioned in Galatians 2:9.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Lord called Peter, he was a fisherman.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was raw, wild, and unperfected.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But after the Lord had spent three and a half years working on him, he was perfected and, on the day of Pentecost, he was set up as a pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Peter stood up on the day of Pentecost, the angels might have rejoiced and said, "This is Boaz.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the sign that God's building is coming."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you read the book of Acts, you will see that Peter was a pillar standing in front of the New Testament temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Young people, this is a word from my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord's recovery is spreading, and I have the assurance that it will spread at a good pace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the rate of the expansion of the Lord's recovery depends upon the pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I believe there will be churches in all the major cities of this country and in all the leading countries on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For this, there is the need of the pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I hope that you young people will see this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you see it, you will say, "Lord, I cannot deny that You have appointed me to Your way and that I have heard Your up-to-date word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I realize that I must experience Christ in a subjective way and that I must be perfected in the church life in Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Lord, have mercy on me and grant me the grace I need."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Young people, my burden is that you realize that your responsibility is tremendous.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If during the coming years many of you will be perfected, the Lord's recovery will spread at a rapid speed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How much the Lord has done through those who have been perfected to be pillars!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What do you think the Lord could do if He had a hundred more?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>My burden is not simply to release a message.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is to help you see that today we all have the golden opportunity to be perfected and to be made pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because we are at Bethel, our opportunity is much greater than Peter's was.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Peter was in the Gospels, in the beginning of the New Testament, but we are at the end of the New Testament, even in Revelation 3:12.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I believe that the opportunity we have today is unique in history.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Never before has there been such a church life as there is today in Anaheim, and never before has the Lord's ministry of the Word been so bright and rich.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do not exercise your mentality or hold to your opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Your opinions will take you nowhere.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Drop your opinions, love the Lord, take Him as your life and as your person, and live by Him in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Learn of those who have become pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They have devoured, absorbed, and soaked in everything of the church and of this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Follow them to know nothing and to daily be saturated with the church life and with the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you do this, I believe that after a few years many of you will become pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then wherever you go, the pillar, the signboard of God's building, will go with you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all are in the church and under this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today is surely a golden opportunity ordained by the Lord.</S>
