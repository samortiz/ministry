Having Delight in the Saints, the Excellent on the Earth</H2><P>Christ has delight in the saints, the excellent people on the earth (Psa. 16:3). The saints implies the church, the Body of Christ. Why does Christ delight in the saints? It is because the saints are the members that constitute His Body, the church. While we are gathered together in the meetings, many other people are gathered together to engage in worldly entertainment and sinful pleasures. Who is the excellent group in God's eyes? By the Lord's mercy, we are the excellent group. In Christ's view, we are a particular and excellent people. Christ delights in God's people, and He has made us excellent.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. Having Nothing to Do with Other Gods and Their Offerings,<br>nor Taking Up Their Names upon His Lips</H2><P>Christ in His human living had nothing to do with other gods and their offerings, nor did He take up their names upon His lips (Psa. 16:4). He would not mention the names of any idols. He even would not mention the names of the idol worshippers. That would contaminate His lips.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. Taking God as the Portion<br>of His Inheritance and of His Cup,<br>and Trusting in God to Maintain His Lot</H2><P>Christ took God as the portion of His inheritance and of His cup (Psa. 16:5). Inheritance refers to a possession, and cup refers to enjoyment. In Christ's human living, God became His possession and also His enjoyment. God was His inheritance and His cup. With the inheritance, there is a portion, and with the cup, there is also a portion. The portion of our inheritance and of our cup today is Christ. Furthermore, Christ trusted in God to maintain His lot (v. 5). Today the whole earth is a mess. Seemingly there is no hope for this earth. We may think the earth is hopeless, but God still maintains it for Christ. Eventually, Christ will inherit the earth as His possession.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>g. Appreciating the Possession Given by God to Him<br>under the Measuring Lines on Pleasant Places<br>and the Beautiful Inheritance Given to Him by God</H2><P>Christ appreciated the possession given by God to Him under the measuring lines on pleasant places and the beautiful inheritance given to Him by God (Psa. 16:6; 2:8; Rev. 11:15). This messy earth will become a pleasant globe to Christ when He comes back to inherit it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>h. Blessing God Who Counsels Him,<br>and Being Instructed by His Inward Parts in the Nights<br>(through His Contact with God)</H2><P>Christ blessed God who counseled Him and was instructed by His inward parts in the nights through His contact with God (Psa. 16:7; Luke 6:12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>i. Setting God before Him Continually and<br>Not Being Shaken Because God Is at His Right Hand</H2><P>Christ set God before Him continually and was not shaken (cf. Psa. 15:5b) because God was at His right hand (Psa. 16:8; Acts 2:25). In John 8:29 the Lord said that while He was on this earth, He was never alone, because God the Father was always with Him. In Jesus' human living, God the Father was with Him.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> </body></html>
