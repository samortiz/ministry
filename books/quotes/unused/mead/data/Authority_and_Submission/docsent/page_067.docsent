   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Concerning Elders</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The elders are the authorities in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All the brothers have to submit to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Titus 1 speaks of basic qualifications of an elder self-control and submission.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A lawless person can never execute the law, and a rebellious person can never make others submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>An elder must exercise strict self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A common trait among many people is the lack of discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, in appointing elders, we have to select those who are particularly exercised in self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God appoints the elders to manage the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As such, they must be submissive and must exercise self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They must set their hearts to be a pattern to all in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God never appoints a person who loves to be the first among others like Diotrephes to be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The elders are the highest deputy authority in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason they must be men with self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Timothy 3:4-5 speaks of another basic qualification of an elder he must be able to manage his own house.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Managing one's house does not refer to managing one's parents or wife, but it refers mainly to managing one's children.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>An elder has to teach his children to walk soberly and to be obedient in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A man must first be a good father before he can be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He must first be an authority at home before he can be an elder in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>An elder must not be an arrogant person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a person becomes proud as soon as he assumes authority, he is not qualified to be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>An elder in a local church should feel as if he has no authority at all.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If an elder is always conscious of his authority, he is not qualified to be an elder or to handle the affairs of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only the foolish and the narrow-minded are proud.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such ones cannot stand the temptation of God's glory, and they cannot bear God's commission and assignment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once such ones are entrusted with something, they fall into a snare.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why a new convert cannot be an overseer 1 Tim 3:6 in Greek this word means a novice in a trade.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, among carpenters there are masters who have been in the trade for decades, and there are novices who have barely learned to handle a hammer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>, lest he be blinded with pride and fall into the judgment suffered by the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Concerning the Lord's Workers</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Titus 2:15 describes the requirements of a deputy authority in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Titus was not an elder in the church, but a worker of the Lord, serving in the capacity of an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul charged Titus to exhort men.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He should not only speak in public but also exhort men one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He should convict men with all authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the same time, he should not let others despise him in words and deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order for others not to despise us, we have to sanctify ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are the same as others in many things, and if we are loose, careless, and unchecked in our daily life, others will despise us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must not be indulgent in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only then will others respect us and honor us as an authority and a representative of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is what Paul told Timothy 1 Tim 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although a worker should not seek after human glory or honor, he should neither be despised to the point of losing his sanctified stature.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the entire New Testament, Paul wrote only two books which were directed toward young co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They are 1 Timothy and Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In these two books Paul often said that a worker should not dishonor himself but should be a pattern in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Anything that leads to contempt should be avoided; one should refuse such things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is a price to pay in being an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One has to separate himself from others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He has to be able to live alone.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A pattern must be different from others; he must sanctify himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If he is the same as the others, he is no longer a pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should not uplift ourselves, but at the same time we should not make others despise us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should always sanctify ourselves and should not jest lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have to learn to separate ourselves in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A worker should not be arrogant, but neither should he give reason for others to despise him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once a worker becomes too common, he is disqualified from his work.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Once he becomes too common, his usefulness is gone, and his authority is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A worker must also keep his standing and maintain God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Authority manifests itself in separation and distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The main thing about a representative authority is that he represents God, and being an authority has everything to do with being a pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A deputy authority is one who "represents" authority, not one who "exercises" authority.</S>
