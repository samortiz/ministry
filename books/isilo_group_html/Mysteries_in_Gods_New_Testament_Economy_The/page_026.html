We worship You and wait on You. We thank You from the depth of our being. Lord, we are truly indebted to You. You have generously loved us in many ways, but we have been indifferent and unresponsive toward You. Lord Jesus, draw us again that we would run after You. Lord, we are waiting here for Your mercy and blessing. You have rich provisions for us. Your blood, Your anointing, Your word, Your light, and Your life are all provided for us. Lord, reveal Yourself to us here once more. Speak to us again, and release the mystery in Your word. Open Yourself up to us. All of us are open to You. We would all say, "Lord, Jesus, we love You." Although we do not love enough, and we do not know how to love, we still would say that we would love You forever. Lord, we dare not love You by ourselves. We trust in Your mercy and Your blessing. Lord, be one spirit with us, and speak in our speaking that we would see this organic union. Release the riches in Your word in a most definite way that all of us would be supplied, cared for, and healed and that all of us would receive Your anointing and enjoy Your sweetness. Lord, how sweet it is that we can sit before You, touch Your word, and seek after Yourself. Grant us more of Yourself. Bless us in a great way tonight. Touch us, and may we touch You. May every one of us be able to say that the Lord is with us. Lord, we do not depend on what we speak or on what we can do. We depend fully on You and Your word. May You meet the need of each one of us and give all of us a word. Lord, even a little supply from You will satisfy our hearts and will bring us home in joy, so that we will be thinking about and meditating on You through the whole night, enjoying Your presence in this way. May we have a bright and revived morning, so that we can bear a good testimony for You once more. Amen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MYSTERIOUS CENTER<br>IN GOD'S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Move of God's New Testament Economy<br>Being Like the Turning of a Big Wheel</H2><P>Now we come to message three, which is the mysterious organism in God's New Testament economy. I believe you are quite familiar with the term organism. But it is a heavy burden on me to try to explain this organism thoroughly and to speak about it until it gets into you. It is difficult for me to know where I should start. After seeking before the Lord, He gave me Ezekiel 1. There we have four wheels turning. In the beginning of this message, my first point is the mysterious center in God's economy. The move of God's New Testament economy is like the turning of a big wheel (cf. Ezek. 1:15-21). Today the greatest thing happening on earth is the tide of democracy. Everywhere people are talking about democracy. This is indeed a great change. When we come back to the Bible, we first see at the beginning of Revelation the scene at the throne in heaven. Following that we see the move on the earth, represented by the four horses (Rev. 6:1-8 with notes). The first horse is the white horse, which, together with its rider, symbolizes the spreading of the gospel. It takes the lead in the entire move on earth. When we look at the world situation, especially at the changes in eastern Europe, we know that this is the turn of the great wheel of the age. But we have to remember that we are in a bigger and greater wheel, which is the move of God's New Testament economy.</P><P>Many of us here have come from far away for this time. Perhaps many of you do not know each other. What has brought us here together? We have to say that it is all because of God's New Testament economy. We all have to recognize God's sovereignty. Many things are not up to us. We are in this great wheel of God's economy. Apparently, this elders' and co-workers' conference was initiated by the brothers in Taipei. But actually, the Initiator is neither they nor I, but God. We are nothing. We are all women before God; we cannot depend on ourselves. What we are looking for is His mercy. We wait for His blessing. Hence, it is the move of God's New Testament economy that has gathered us together to participate in the mystery of His New Testament economy.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Mysteries in God's New Testament Economy &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
