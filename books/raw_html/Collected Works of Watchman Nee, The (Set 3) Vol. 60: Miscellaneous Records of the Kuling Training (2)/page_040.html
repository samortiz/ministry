<p>John 17:3 says, "This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ." However, Matthew 11:27 says, "No one fully knows the Son except the Father." For a man to know Jesus Christ, he must first have the revelation of the Father. A man must come to the Son to receive life, but only those to whom the Father has chosen to reveal Himself will know the Son, and only those who know the Son will come to the Lord. Those who come to Him will have life. Do we know the Lord and then come to Him, or do we come to Him and then know Him? Do we come to the Lord to receive eternal life, or do we receive eternal life to come to the Lord? Thank the Lord both are right. All are works of God. Man cannot specify any condition. God has combined the condition and the result into the same thing.</p><p>In John 10:11 the Lord Jesus says, "I am the good Shepherd; the good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep." The Lord's sheep are those who have believed into Him. But verse 26 says, "But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep." This proves that His sheep are those who believe in Him. Those who believe are the Lord's sheep, and the Lord lays down His life for them. We usually say that we believe in the Lord because He has first died for us. Yet John 10:26 says that one does not believe because he is not of His sheep. This means that the Lord's sheep are those who believe in Him and that He has laid down His life for such sheep. This turns things around. It seems as if the Lord is saying that we have to believe in Him first before He will die for us. Of course, we have never heard such a gospel. But this is indeed the case with the Lord. This means that our Lord is God; He is not governed by any time sequence. He is the One who accomplishes the believing, and He is the One who has laid down His life for us. Everything is of Him.</p><p>In Acts 18 Paul wanted to remain in Corinth for the gospel. That night the Lord Jesus appeared to him, saying, "Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent...because I have many people in this city" (vv. 9-10). Does a man first believe and then become part of God's people, or does a man become part of His people first and then believe? As soon as we introduce the concept of time, we have a problem. Thank God that He is beyond time. We are bound by time, and therefore with us there is the matter of time sequence. But with God there is no time sequence; He is not bound by time. This is the reason a condition can be a result at the same time. Both things are accomplished by God. Outwardly speaking, it seems as if they are accomplished by man. Actually, they are all accomplished by God's grace. It is God who operates in us to receive salvation and to work for Him. Man can do nothing.</p><p>Romans 9:23 says that we are "vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory." We become a vessel, and then we receive His glory. Glory is with God. He created a vessel and filled this vessel with His glory. God has made us a vessel prepared unto glory, and then He fills us with this glory. We do not receive this glory by ourselves. We receive it because God has done everything. We have done nothing. Hallelujah! God has made us a vessel unto glory.</p><h2 class="head1">COMING TO JESUS JUST AS WE ARE</h2><p>Hence, everyone can come to the Lord just as he is. The Lord is a friend of sinners. As long as a man opens his heart wide to Him, God will save him. Man's prayer may be wrong, but the One who listens to his prayer is never wrong. All that a man needs is a little desire to turn to God. Man's requests may be wrong, but God's answer is never wrong. In addition, the Holy Spirit has come, and wherever man prays, He operates. There is no place that the Holy Spirit cannot reach. As long as there is a crack within man's heart, the Holy Spirit can perform His work. Man may be lacking in knowledge, but as soon as he touches the Lord, everything is done. Furthermore, God has blended the condition of the gospel with the result of the gospel. Man does not have to do anything. He only needs to come to God. God's work will bring him to his salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO LESSONS</h2><p>There are two sides of the gospel. On the one hand there are the techniques of the gospel. On the other hand, there is the content of the gospel. If we are well-trained in both areas, we will save many people. Anytime we find a person who is seeking and looking for more truth, we should give him a proper and clear exposition of the truth. If we find a person who is looking for the simple gospel, however, we should simply lead him to the simple and genuine gospel. We have to pay equal emphasis to learning both lessons.</p>
