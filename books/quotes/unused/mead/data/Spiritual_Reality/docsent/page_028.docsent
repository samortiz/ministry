   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is it to be fresh?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To be fresh is to be vigorous and living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When you meet a saint with the appearance of oldness, you know that he has not been living in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One who lives in the Spirit is renewed daily and never gets old.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A certain saint once testified that in 1933 he met an elderly Christian brother in Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This elderly brother was already over eighty years of age at that time and was not able to hear well.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But when the saint fellowshipped with this brother, he enjoyed his spiritual freshness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to his physical body, this elderly brother was not able to hear or speak much, but when people came to him, they could sense his inward freshness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This elderly man would hold the saint s hand steadily and firmly and say, Brother, to this day I cannot live without Him, and He cannot live without me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Who is this He ?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This He is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How sweet a statement this is: I cannot live without Him, and He cannot live without me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These two sentences are so fresh!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This brother did not need to use thousands of words.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, in two sentences he was able to cause others to touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This proves that he was inwardly living and fresh and had the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brightness</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The third expression of life is brightness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One who lives in the Spirit and touches the Spirit will be bright.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There was once a famous preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By reading his writings, you could not get a sense of his person; however, when you listened to his speaking for the Lord on the podium, you could realize that he was as transparent as glass and as clear as crystal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was because he was a man in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sometimes when you contact a person, you feel like you are touching a wall, a big stone, or a cave.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once you contact him, you have an unfortunate feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You feel as if you have fallen into a cave, an underground vault, or some place that is very dark and without any light or brightness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At other times, however, when you meet someone else and spend a brief amount of time with him, you feel that there is light and that everything is bright.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The reason that a person lacks brightness is not because he does not have life within but because he is not living in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once a person lives in the Spirit, he touches the Spirit and has life because the Spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Life is the light that shines on man cf.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The wind cannot hurt life.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The reason grass does not grow well sometimes is that it is not exposed to sunlight or wind.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The places where grass grows well are the places where there is ample sunlight and moderate wind.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many times the exposure to sunlight, the blowing of the wind, and the beating of the rain do not destroy life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead, they help life to grow because life is strong and powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There was once a certain person who was stumbled because the usher arranged for him to sit under a fan in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because of this he never came to the meeting again.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a weak Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must realize that when a man is weak to the uttermost, he dies.</S>

   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>With life, the more the difficulties, the stronger the wind, and the harder the rain, the more it will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May the Lord have mercy on us to strengthen us that our expression may prove that we are living in spirit and in life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>LIFE AND PEACE</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Finally, these four points added together issue in peace and satisfaction, not emptiness or poverty.</S>

   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When the bread is broken, everyone is joyful, but they can neither cry nor smile.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is as if they are suspended in mid-air.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This kind of Christian does not have rest, peace, or joy because he has not touched the spirit or received life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Romans 8:6 says that when we touch the spirit, we touch life; and when life comes, peace is there.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The issue of these four conditions or expressions is peace.</S>
