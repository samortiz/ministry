<h2 class="head2">News of the Brothers and Sisters<br />in Several Places</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>"Sister Wu Jen-han's mailing address is [omitted]. When she left, she carried only one Bible with her. Sister Chao Jing-tze arrived in Shanghai on March 11. Her twelve year-old child, sister, and brother-in-law, Hsu Lien-hwei, and their five sons came with her. A sister has taken her to the Red Cross Nursing School to get a job washing clothes and taking inventory. The rest are living in the meeting hall temporarily. Sister Jin Bao-jieh has arrived in Shanghai. Brother Chang Hwei-zhi left Shanghai on March 23 and arrived in Hankow by way of Hong Kong and Canton. His mother (Mrs. Chang An-wei) has come from Lan-Si to Shanghai. She lives at 8 Ping-Ji Lane." (The preceding is an excerpt from Brother Ho Yueh-chiao's letters dated between February 25 and March 22&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>"Sister Huang Bao-ji will probably find a job in Shanghai. She is now helping out in the laboratory of a nearby refugee hospital." (From Sister Chen Jing's letter of February 17&mdash;Editor.) [Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>"In Jia-Shan, the people are still very nervous. They are still fleeing from danger. I returned to Jia-Shan yesterday. If there are any letters, please send them c/o Wei Gan-chun, Food Service Department, Yung-An Company, Nanking Road, Shanghai." (From Brother Wei Jing-dao's letter of February 20&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head3">Four</h2><p>On March 13, Hankow received a letter from Sister Shao Ai-yu saying that she was safe in Gao-Yu. We still do not have any news of Sister Shao Heng. [Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Five</h2><p>"Although I serve in the post office and have moved with my job on and off, I arrived in Li-Shui on January 1. My family moved here on February 26 from Ju-Jih. Brothers Lee Kwei-sien, Ruan Chi-yu, Hsu Yung-ming, and Chai En-lai and their wives and Mrs. Chang Jing-hai are all in Hangchow. Brother Chen Fang is in Jin-Shiang, Ping-Yang." (From Brother Ma Di-sheng's letter of March 31 from Li-Shui&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head3">Six</h2><p>Brother Shan Kai-fen's letter of March 11 says that Brother Huang Jai-ching and his mother moved from Hangchow in November of last year and have been living in Brother Yen Buo-yin's home in Si-Shing since then. Brother Huang takes some responsibility for preaching messages in the assembly in Si-Shing. (His mailing address is [omitted].) Brother Hsu Jen-rong moved from Hangchow to Chou-Jia-Pu last year. His wife had a nineteen-day-old baby at the time, and they had to flee into the mountains on very steep roads. It was a great suffering to them, but the Lord's grace cared for them in every aspect. Although they have nothing, neither do they lack anything. The entire family arrived in Shao-Shing in the middle of February, and they are now living in Dan-Ju-Wu. Praise the Lord's grace unceasingly! [Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Condition of the Churches in Nan-Sha, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Greetings in the Lord to Brother X:</p><p>Thank God for keeping us safe in Him. There are daily prayer meetings in the river regions in the brothers' homes. The numbers in the meetings are growing. The work of the Holy Spirit continues to revive us. There are some who were drawn by the world in the past but have now returned to the Lord. The Lord is our only support.</p><p>There are six local churches in Nan-Sha: Wan-An-Chiao, Si-Shing, Ji-Shan-Chiao, Jia-Zao, Tou-Peng, and Hsin-Wan-Di. Altogether there are more than one thousand people in the meetings. More than four hundred partake of the table.</p><p>Although there was bombing in Hsiao-Shan, God preserved His own children from harm. Yen Bai-yin's father-in-law was able to bring out two Gentile children, even though he is more than seventy years old. One sister had five buildings in town which were left standing. We praise Him! The God of Abraham is our God! He is our God today! He is the God who is coming soon! We must sing hallelujah. We will sing hallelujah forever. Amen. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Kao Chi-luh<br />[Address omitted]</p>
