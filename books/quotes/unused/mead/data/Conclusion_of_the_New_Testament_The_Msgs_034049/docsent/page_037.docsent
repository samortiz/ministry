   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE FORTY-FIVE CHRIST HIS PERSON 25</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider further aspects of Christ s person in the fulfillment of the types and figures of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>35.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The King of Glory</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Psalm 24:7-10 reveals strongly that Christ is the King of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The King of glory is the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle v. 8 . Psalm 24:7-10 is fulfilled in a full way in Revelation 19:11-16, which speaks of Christ as the Warrior who is King of kings and Lord of lords v. 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the King of glory Christ is Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war Rev 19:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In faithfulness to God and the believers He defeats those who oppose God and persecute the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is true in carrying out God s economy and in caring for those who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He judges and fights in righteousness, His flaming eyes v. 12 carrying out His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the King of glory Christ has many diadems on His head v. 12 , His name is called The Word of God v. 13 , and a sharp sword proceeds out of His mouth v. 15 . Christ has been crowned and glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because He has been crowned with the glory Heb 2:9 that has different aspects, He wears many diadems.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His name, The Word of God, indicates that He is the definition, explanation, and expression of God, even while executing God s judgment upon the rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The fighting of Christ is the speaking of the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As Christ fights against the enemy, He proclaims to the universe that God is sovereign, righteous, and orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The sword that proceeds out of His mouth is the powerful word that judges the rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ defeats the enemy with the sharp sword, the almighty word, that proceeds out of His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the King of glory Christ is the King of kings and Lord of lords, a name that is written on His garment and on His thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ s garment signifies His attributes, especially His righteousness in His humanity, and the thigh signifies His standing strength, His stability.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His title King of kings and Lord of lords is exhibited in His righteousness and stability.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is Christ as the King of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>36.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Fatness of God s House</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Psalm 36:8a says, They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In typology the fatness of the Lord s house refers to the rich produce of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the riches that were offered to God in the house became the fatness of His house.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The fulfillment of this type is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He, with His unsearchable riches Eph 3:8 , is the reality of the fatness of God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Old Testament times God s people could enjoy this fatness only in the place God had chosen for His habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this reason, the psalmist declares that God s people were satisfied with the fatness of His house.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Apart from God s dwelling place, the temple, the Old Testament saints did not have this enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They were bountifully, abundantly satisfied with the fatness of God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today the rich enjoyment of Christ is ours in the house of God, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the church we are satisfied with the riches of Christ, even His unsearchable riches, enjoyed, digested, and assimilated by us as the reality of the fatness of God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>37.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Fountain of Life</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Psalm 36:9a says, With thee is the fountain of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is the fountain of life in the house of God, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In God s house the saints partake of Christ as such a fountain.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Psalm 36:9a is fulfilled in John 4:14.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In His conversation with the Samaritan woman the Lord Jesus indicated to her that she needed the living Son of God as the fountain to become a spring of water welling up within her.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First He said, If you knew the gift of God you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water John 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God s gift includes both His Son and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These two are one gift, for the divine life is in the Son 1 John 5:11-12 , and the Son actually is the divine life John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The thirst in human life can only be satisfied by the One who has been given to us as eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For this reason, the Lord went on to say, Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This water signifies the enjoyment of material and worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only one water can satisfy us for eternity Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He satisfies today, tomorrow, and forever.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, the Lord said, Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life v. 14 . We have received Him, and He has become a spring of water welling up within us into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the one hand, Christ is the fountain of living water; on the other hand, He is the spring.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In God He is the fountain, but in us He is the spring.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When He enters into us and dwells in us, He becomes a spring of water welling up into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever He wells up in us we are brought into eternal life, and our thirst is quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Psalm 36:9a is also fulfilled in Revelation 21:6: I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This spring is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In eternity and for eternity we, the sons of God, shall enjoy Christ as the spring of the water of life.</S>
