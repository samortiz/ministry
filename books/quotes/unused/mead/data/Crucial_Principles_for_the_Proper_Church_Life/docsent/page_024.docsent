   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Different Teachings Being</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Different Categories of Teaching,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not Different Aspects of One Thing</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To speak differently is not to speak different aspects of the same thing; it is to speak different categories of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Apparently, there are four categories of teaching mentioned in 1 Timothy 1: God s economy, the law, myths, and genealogies vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>4, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, myths and genealogies are in the same category as the law.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who taught the law taught it with related myths.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The genealogies mentioned in verse 4 surely refer to the genealogies in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, there are actually only two categories of teaching one is the Old Testament things concerning the law, and the other is the New Testament gospel, which is Christ as life for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The second category is God s economy, but the first is tradition and human opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Old Testament things of the law are not aspects of God s economy and are different from the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There were many different apostles, yet they all spoke one thing Christ as life for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Teaching Things Other Than God s Economy Producing Questionings</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is a danger today that we would be attracted by someone who teaches different things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For many years I have spoken the same thing that all the riches of the Triune God are embodied in Christ, that Christ today has become the life-giving Spirit, and that the life-giving Spirit dwells in our spirit so that the Triune God can dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some saints may be bored of hearing this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If an eloquent speaker comes along who can tell interesting stories and speak concerning deep spiritual matters, many saints, especially the young ones, may welcome such a speaker and even idolize him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To know the truth is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes we think that we know it when we actually do not.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A good Bible teacher may come along who does not teach from the Old Testament but teaches from the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He may teach foot-washing according to John 13.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Foot-washing is not an Old Testament teaching but a New Testament teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such a brother may rebuke all the churches in the Lord s recovery, saying, Brothers, God has given me a burden to tell you one thing that the local churches have neglected foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In John 13 the Lord Jesus set an example for us and charged us to wash one another s feet.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How poor all the churches in the Lord s recovery are, for the saints never wash one another s feet.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to discern such speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some things in the New Testament are not part of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First Timothy 1:4 indicates that teachings other than God s economy produce questionings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we know that foot-washing is not part of God s economy, because teaching it will immediately produce questionings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First, the saints will ask how to wash one another s feet.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They will wonder if brothers should wash only other brothers feet and sisters other sisters feet.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There will be disagreement on this issue.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Another question will be where to wash one another s feet publicly or privately?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Different teachings, such as foot-washing, always produce questionings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once questionings come in, confusion and division will quickly follow.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, a person who teaches differently only creates trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He may present a New Testament teaching, yet he will open the door for questions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By speaking only once concerning a different teaching, he will open the door for all the saints to begin to talk about the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They may forget to pray and contact the Lord and may instead spend their time talking to one another on the phone concerning the teaching of foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some may say, Foot-washing is a wonderful teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This brother is full of love.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brother Lee does not have much love.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Such teachings open the door for many opinions to come in. Some may say, Foot-washing is not necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Others may say, Foot-washing is surely good.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Everyone should try it at least once.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the sisters wash the other sisters feet just once, they will be humbled and will open themselves to the other sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have tried this it is marvelous, full of loving affection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Let us all try it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we wash one another s feet, our hearts will open to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There may be additional questions regarding the way to practice foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everyone will have different opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This proves that some things even in the New Testament do not belong to God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To refrain from practicing foot-washing does not damage God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever someone presents a particular teaching among us, even one based on the New Testament, we need to ask, Does this belong to God s economy?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Does this minister Christ to the saints?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We may realize that, rather than ministering Christ, it produces questions and opens the door for different opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The ministry in God s New Testament economy speaks only of Christ for the church and ministers Christ as life to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not discuss anything that produces questions.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Discussing whether it is proper to use wine or grape juice at the Lord s table, for example, does not minister life to anyone, but it causes much disputation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to learn to avoid bringing up anything that will stir up different opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Ministering Christ as life for the church and to the church will never cause any opinions to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, we must all learn to speak the same thing, that is, Christ as life for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should not speak anything different from God s economy.</S>
