   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Message Nine The Will of God and the Building of God Scripture Reading: Matt 7:21-23; 6:10; 12:50;</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>16:18-19; 21:42, 44; 5:14 In order to enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the coming age, we must do the will of our Father in this age Matt 7:21-23; 6:10; 12:50; Rev 4:11; Rom 12:2; Eph 1:5, 9, 11; 5:17; Col 1:9; 4:12: God is a God of purpose, having a will of His own pleasure, and He created all things for His will that He might accomplish and fulfill His purpose Rev 4:11; Eph 3:9-11; Col 1:9: God s will is His heart s desire, His mingling with man, and the fulfillment of His eternal plan Eph 1:5, 9, 11; 5:17.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The will of God is to obtain a Body for Christ to be His fullness, His expression Rom 12:2, 5; Eph 1:5, 9, 11, 22-23.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The kingdom is absolutely a matter of God s will and completely fulfills God s will; in fact, the kingdom is God s will Matt 6:10.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The ultimate issue of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens is the will of the heavenly Father 7:21.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the kingdom people, we are on earth to do the Father s will 7:21; 12:50.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to do the will of the Father, we need to enter in through the narrow gate and walk on the constricted way 7:13-14: The narrow gate excludes the old man, the self, the flesh, the human concept, and the world with all its glory; only that which corresponds with God s will can enter in. As we walk on the constricted way, we are restricted by a mysterious, invisible, inward control, and we live under this control.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whoever does the will of the Father is a relative of the Lord Jesus 12:50: Christ, the heavenly King, always submitted to the Father s will, taking God s will as His portion and not resisting anything 11:28-30; 26:39.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whoever does the will of the Father is a brother who helps the Lord Jesus, a sister who sympathizes with Him, and a mother who tenderly loves Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The kingdom people need to pray for the Father s will to be done on earth as in the heavens; this is to bring the kingdom of the heavens to the earth 6:10.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Father s eternal will is to build up the church upon Christ the Son as the rock Matt 16:18; Eph 2:21-22; 4:16: God s building is the desire of God s heart and the goal of God s salvation Eph 1:5, 9; 2:8, 10, 21-22; Exo 25:8: The desire of God s heart is to have a dwelling place on earth constituted with Christ and according to Christ Eph 1:5, 9; 2:21-22.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s building is the Triune God as life being wrought into us so that we may become His corporate expression 3:17a, 19b, 21.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God s building is the mingling of God with man; the principle of God s building is that God builds Himself into us and builds us into Himself John 14:20; 15:4a; Eph 3:17a.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God s building is the enlargement, the expansion, of the Triune God, enabling God to express Himself in a corporate way Col 2:19; John 3:30a.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to be enlightened by and fully saturated with the thought that in this universe God is doing only one thing building His eternal habitation Matt 16:18; Rev 21:2-3.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord s word in Matthew 16:18 is the greatest prophecy in the Bible: I will build My church : In His heavenly ministry the ascended Christ is directing and managing the building up of His church Eph 1:19-23; 4:8-16.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The rock in Matthew 16:18 refers both to Christ and to the revelation concerning Christ; this means that the church is built both upon Christ and upon the revelation concerning Christ Eph 2:19-20.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the stone for God s building, Christ is the foundation stone, the topstone, and the cornerstone; in Him and through Him, we are becoming living stones to be built up as a spiritual house Matt 21:42, 44; Isa 28:16; Zech 3:9; 4:7; 1 Pet 2:4-5.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Gospel of Matthew is concerned with the kingdom of the heavens, which is a matter of authority; thus, the church in this book represents the kingdom to reign 16:18-19; 18:18: In the church there is the heavenly rule and government, and there is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Both aspects of the church the universal and the local indicate that the church represents the kingdom of the heavens, having authority to bind and to loose 16:19; 18:18.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus declared that the gates of Hades will not prevail against His church; Satan s power of darkness cannot prevail against the genuine church built by Christ 16:18b.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord s word about a city situated upon a mountain indicates that the kingdom people need the building 5:14: The light is not an individual believer; the light is a corporate city built up as one entity to shine over the people surrounding it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The city is the light; if there is no city, there is no light Rev 21:23-24a.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we are divided, we are finished with the shining; in order to be a shining city, we must keep the oneness and remain one entity, a corporate Body Eph 4:1-6; 5:8-9.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be built up with fellow believers is the Lord s supreme and highest requirement of His faithful seekers according to the divine oneness of the Divine Trinity John 17: The constitution of the kingdom of the heavens is not for individuals but for a corporate people Matt 5:3-16.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Being built up with fellow partakers of the divine life is the highest virtue of one who pursues after Christ according to God s eternal economy Eph 2:21-22; Phil 3:7-12.</S>
