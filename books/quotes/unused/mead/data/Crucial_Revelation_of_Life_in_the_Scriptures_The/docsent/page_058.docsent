   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SECRETS OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Peter's word is very mysterious, yet in this mysterious word are the secrets of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first secret is that all things relating to life and godliness are given to us as the seed of faith 2 Pet 1:1, 3, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God has also given us all the promises.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He not only gives us the seed and promises the rain, but also gives us the growth 1 Cor 3:6 and the harvest 2 Cor 9:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The second secret is that, realizing that God has given us everything, we must cooperate with God to do our part.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God promises to do more, yet this promise is conditional, depending upon what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many of the great promises are conditional.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we do something, then God will do something more.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we sow the seed, God will give the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we sow the seed, God will send the rain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The further giving by God depends upon our cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we do not sow or till the earth, then there will be no rain, no growth, and no harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The third secret of life is that, as we cooperate with God, we should not do anything outside of what He has given.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must develop what He has given.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God has given us the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must do everything to develop the seed by preparing the soil, sowing the seed, and watering the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second Peter 1:4 says, "Through which He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises, that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here the fourth secret of life is shown.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By partaking of the divine nature through the precious promises, we develop virtue, knowledge, self-control, endurance, godliness, brotherly love, and love by the growth in life 1:5-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The precious promises are embodied in the divine Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By pray-reading the promises we partake of and enjoy the divine nature, and by partaking of the divine nature we develop in life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more we pray-read the promises, the more we enjoy the divine nature, and the more we enjoy the divine nature, the more we grow and develop in life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must develop the faith within us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, in our faith we must develop virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Virtue is the explanation of the excellencies of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First Peter 2:9 refers to the virtues, or excellencies, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Virtue is the excellency of Christ expressed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is the excellent expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When anything of Christ is expressed through us, that is something excellent, and this excellency is virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can realize a kind of excellency with many brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With one brother, we may realize the patience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With a certain sister, we may realize the humility of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These virtues are the excellent expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have faith as the seed within us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now this seed needs further development and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This expression is virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to my realization and experience, virtue means the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must develop the expression of Christ in our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our virtue is the expression of Christ in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Virtue is a kind of power, the excellency which comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Mark 5:30 says, "And immediately, Jesus realizing in Himself that power had gone out of Him, turned around in the crowd and said, Who touched My garments?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Luke 6:19 says, "And all the crowd sought to touch Him, because power was going out from Him and curing all."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then in Luke 8:46 the Lord Jesus says, "Someone touched Me; for I knew that power had gone out from Me."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In these portions, "power" may be translated as "virtue" KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In virtue, we must develop knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Knowledge comes after virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If knowledge came before virtue, it would become a frustration to virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need virtue to be developed first, then for further development of virtue, we need knowledge, the proper knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Knowledge in 2 Peter 1:6 refers to the knowledge of Christ, that is, the knowing of Christ in a full and excellent way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The last verse of this book confirms this by saying, "But grow in grace and the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ" 2 Pet 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The full knowledge of Jesus Christ, knowing Christ in a deeper and fuller way, helps us to grow and develop.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After knowledge, we must develop self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Self-control is a restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Self-control is toward ourselves while endurance is toward situations and circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Toward ourselves we need self-control, toward the environment we need endurance, toward God we need godliness, toward the brothers we need brotherly love, and toward the highest needs we need love, the nobler love.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Faith is the seed and love is the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>From faith to love there are seven stages of development by the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The fifth secret revealed in 2 Peter 1 is that by enjoying the divine nature, we enter into the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ v. 11 . To enter into the kingdom is a matter of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>While we are growing, we are entering.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The more we grow, the more entrance we gain.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To enter into the kingdom of the Lord Jesus, we need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we reach the last step of development, we are fully in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should not think that if we are idle with no development after we are saved that we will enter into the kingdom of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we have this thought, we will be cheated.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To enter into the kingdom is different from salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To enter into the kingdom we need the maturity of life, the full growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>DEVELOPMENT BY GROWTH IN LIFE UNTO THE RICH ENTRANCE INTO THE ETERNAL KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have seen three main items in 2 Peter 1: the seed of faith, the divine power, which is the growing power, and the precious promises.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God has given the seed, the growing power, and the promises that He will send the rain, the growth, and the harvest if we cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>With God's giving, we must be diligent to develop the seed of faith by taking the promises, by picking up His word.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The best way to pick up His word is to pray-read the word.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The more we pray-read all the promises, the more we enjoy the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As we enjoy this divine nature, we have the growth in life, the maturity in life, and the harvest of life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This maturity is the entrance into the kingdom of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We all need to grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Second Peter is a book on growth.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Its last verse ends in this way: "But grow in grace ."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Chapter one reveals the way to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We have the seed, the growing power, and the promises that God will send the rain, give the growth, and give the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Now we need to develop the seed by taking His promises, by pray-reading the word of His promises, that we may enjoy His divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>By this we will be developed and grow step by step until we reach maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Then we will enjoy a rich entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</S>
