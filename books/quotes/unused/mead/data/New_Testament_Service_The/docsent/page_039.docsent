   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE JESUS ONLY Scripture Reading: Matt 16:13-17; 17:1-8, 24-27</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we read these passages in Matthew 16 and 17, we see that they are altogether for Christ and about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To serve in the New Testament dispensation, we need to be very clear about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The New Testament service is a matter altogether of Christ, for Christ, with Christ, and in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is altogether a matter of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>WHO IS CHRIST?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the first chapter of Matthew we have seen the conceiving of Christ, and in the second chapter, the finding of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Matthew chapters three and four have shown us the testifying for Christ and the following of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we come to chapter sixteen, however, a real problem is raised that is, who is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is the conceiving of Christ, the finding of Christ, the testifying of Christ, and the following of Christ, but who is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Peter, James, and John, with the others, were all followers of Christ, but there was nevertheless the problem of who Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yes, we follow Christ, but do we know who Christ is?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Matthew 16, the Lord raises this problem, but notice that it was not raised in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was not even in Jerusalem or in the land of Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, it was on the border of the Gentile world, in the parts of Caesarea Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jesus left not only the temple and Jerusalem, but also the holy land.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was in the vicinity of the Gentile world when He asked, Who do men say that the Son of Man is?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Matt 16:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord did not ask such a question in the religious realm.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we are in the religious district, the religious sphere, it is doubtful that we will ask questions about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, once we move outside of the religious world and the religious circle, immediately the question comes, What about Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why did the Lord Jesus not ask this question when He was in the temple?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There was a reason.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why did He not ask it when He was in Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why did He wait until He crossed the border of the holy land and was in the vicinity of the Gentile world?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is quite meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The reason is that the New Testament service is outside of the religious region, the religious circle, the religious sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Bible there are no wasted words.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If there were no significance in this matter, there would be no need for Matthew to say that Jesus and His disciples came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The mention of this matter indicates that to know Christ, we need to leave religion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to leave the temple, the holy city, and even the holy land.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is only when we come into the parts of Caesarea Philippi that we are in the right position to know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Jesus asked this question, the disciples answered that some said that He was John the Baptist; some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He said to them, But you, who do you say that I am?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then Jesus said to him, You are blessed, Simon Bar-jona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens Matt 16:14-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Peter took the lead in answering the question by saying that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is really good.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then the Lord told him that his answer was not of flesh and blood, but it was something that had been revealed from the Father in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To have the revelation from the heavens, we need to be on the border of Caesarea Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The disciples did not receive the revelation of Christ in the temple, in the holy city, or in the holy land.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to be outside of the religious realm.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The revelation of Christ was given outside of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>JESUS TRANSFIGURED</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then in the following chapter, the Lord Jesus brought Peter, James, and John up to a mountain, where suddenly He was transfigured before them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is not something of a doctrine or a teaching; this was a transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Jesus was transfigured before them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was no longer in the lowly form of a little Nazarene, but with a face shining as the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>And then Moses and Elijah came to talk with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At that time Peter acted very foolishly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You are willing, I will make three tabernacles here, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I delight; hear Him!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And when the disciples heard this, they fell on their face and feared exceedingly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>And Jesus came to them and touched them and said, Arise, and do not fear.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone Matt 17:4-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When Peter saw Moses and Elijah, he became excited; therefore he spoke nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we become overexcited, we often speak nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Peter s proposal was to build three tabernacles; one for Jesus, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This means that he uplifted Moses and Elijah to the same level as Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No one knew where Moses was buried or to what place Elijah was taken.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now both of them suddenly appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore Peter thought that surely they all were equal.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord Jesus said not a word; He would not vindicate Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The heavens, however, reacted.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>While Peter was still speaking, there came a voice from heaven saying, This is My beloved Son; hear Him!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In other words, the Father was telling them to forget Moses and Elijah and listen to His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>That stopped Peter s nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then the Lord came and touched Peter and the other two disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>How wonderful the Lord is!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He would not vindicate Himself, but He will always touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Whenever we are frightened, He comes to touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then Peter and the others arose and saw no man but Jesus only.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>How full of meaning this is!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Not only did Peter receive a revelation in chapter sixteen, but in chapter seventeen he also saw a transfiguration with his physical eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Furthermore, he heard the heavenly voice with his physical ears, a voice saying that they should hear Jesus only.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Why would the voice from heaven say this?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Because Moses and Elijah were not there on the mountain simply as two individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They were there representing the law and the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Therefore the voice from heaven said, Hear Him, not Moses or Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This means that we need to hear the living Christ, not merely the written law represented by Moses, nor the written prophets represented by Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In other words, we need to hear the living Christ, not merely the written Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We need to read Matthew 17 again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The voice from heaven told Peter to hear Jesus only.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>And we should realize that Peter had suggested putting up three tabernacles, one for Jesus, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Therefore, Peter was making the law and the prophets equal to Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This was the background.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The concept of listening both to Christ and to the law and the prophets is against the concept of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Therefore, the heavenly voice said, This is My beloved Son; hear Him.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It seems that the Father in the heavens was saying, I do not like to hear you expressing your appreciation for Moses, even though you have a good intention.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>And I also do not like to hear that you care for Elijah, even though that also may come from a good intention.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I, the Father in the heavens, do not care for the law, neither do I care for the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I care for My Son.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is My beloved Son; hear Him.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It was not merely a vision, but a visible transfiguration witnessed by Peter with his physical eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In addition, a voice from the heavens was heard by Peter with his physical ears.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Peter was shocked, and no doubt was deeply impressed.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If you were Peter, could you forget what you had seen and what you had heard?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>You may forget the things you dream, but I do not believe you could ever forget such an experience.</S>
