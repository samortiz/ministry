<h2 class=head1>E. MIGHT</h2><p>Revelation 5:13 says, “To Him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb, be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever.” This verse indicates that might is another of Christ’s attributes. The Greek word for “might” (kratos), denotes manifested power. God’s power toward us is according to the operation of the might of His strength (Eph. 1:19). We are empowered in the might of His strength (Eph. 6:10), empowered with all power according to the might of His glory (Col. 1:11). The Lord’s might is of the Lord’s strength, and the Lord’s strength is for the Lord’s power. Hence, the Lord’s might is the substance of the Lord’s power, substantiating His power toward us.<h2 class=head1>F. RICHES</h2><p>Revelation 5:12 says that Christ the Lamb is worthy to receive riches, and Ephesians 3:8 speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ. Christ’s riches are vast and inexhaustible. In the Scriptures these riches are depicted in types, such as light, the sun, the star, the vine, the apple tree, the cedar, the cypress, the Passover, wheat, barley, the henna flower, Adam, Abel, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Aaron, and Moses. Beneath the surface of the Bible are all the riches of Christ seen in the types. Because these riches are so vast, it is difficult for anyone to say how many types of Christ there are. Just this one matter of the types reveals many of the riches of Christ.<p>Christ’s riches are also portrayed in shadows, figures, prophecies, and in the fulfillment of prophecies. In the Bible the first prophecy concerning Christ is Genesis 3:15, a verse which predicts that Christ as the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent, Satan. This implies that Christ had to become a man born of a virgin, for He was to be the seed of woman. This one verse reveals much of the riches of Christ.<p>Sometimes in the fulfillment of a prophecy concerning Christ in the New Testament something further is added. For example, the Old Testament reveals that Christ will be the Lamb, but in the Old Testament He is not called the Lamb of God. Nevertheless, in the fulfillment of the prophecy regarding Christ as the Lamb, He is called the Lamb of God (John 1:29). The reason for this is that Christ cannot be limited by the prophecies concerning Him. When He came, He fulfilled more than what had been prophesied. Furthermore, our experience of Christ surpasses the fulfillment of the prophecies. In our experience Christ is not only the Lamb of God but the Lamb of eternity (Rev. 21:22-23; 22:1). Thus, the prophecy is short, the fulfillment is longer, and the experience is eternal. When we experience Christ in the fulfillment of the prophecies concerning Him, we enter into the eternal experience of the inexhaustible riches of Christ.<p>Because Christ’s riches are unsearchable, untraceable, all the positive things in the universe point to Christ. For this reason, when He was on earth, He could use many things as illustrations of Himself. Christ with His unsearchable riches is the reality of every positive thing in the universe.<p>All the riches of Christ are for the producing of the church. The church is produced not by teaching nor by organizing but by the dispensing of the riches of Christ into us. As these riches are dispensed into us, we need to digest and assimilate them. By absorbing Christ’s riches in this way, we become His Body as His fullness (Eph. 1:22-23) to express Him. Therefore, the Body of Christ is constituted of the riches of Christ enjoyed and assimilated by us.
