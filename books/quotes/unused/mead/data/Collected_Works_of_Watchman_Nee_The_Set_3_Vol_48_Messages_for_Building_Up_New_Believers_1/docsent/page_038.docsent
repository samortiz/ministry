   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HOW TO JOIN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Finally, how do we join the church?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible does not say anything about joining the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This very fact invalidates the expression joining the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, we are forced to borrow human expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is no better expression; therefore, we still use the expression joining the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A. "Joining the Church" Not Being Necessary,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not Being Possible</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must see that the Bible never speaks of joining the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is impossible for one to join the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is like an ear deciding to join the body to become an ear.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even the best surgeon cannot do such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No one can join the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you are in, you are in; if you are not in, you are not in. Being a part of the church does not mean that one passes a test that qualifies him to be a member of a church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a person wants to "join" the church, he must first be in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a person sees something concerning sin and the blood through God's mercy and if he has received salvation, forgiveness, and a new life, having been regenerated through resurrection by God, He has put such a one into the church already.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is already in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is already in and there is no need for him to join.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some people still think that they can join a church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But if there is a church which one can join, such a church must not be a genuine church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One can join such a church because it is a false church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If it were a genuine church, no one could join it even if he tried to.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As long as you belong to the Lord and are begotten by Him, you are already in the church; there is no need for you to join.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, it is neither necessary nor possible for one to join a church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You cannot join a church even if you try.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And if you are already in the church, there is no need to join it anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who are in are in already; there is no need to join.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Anyone who wants to join is not in it, and there is no way to join it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is what the church is all about.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church is a peculiar institution.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The issue is whether or not you are born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you are born of God, you are already in. If you are not born of God, you cannot get in even if you try to.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You cannot join a church by signing a document, sitting for an examination, writing your resolution, or making up your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you are born of God, you are already in. Thank God that all of us are already in the church; we no longer need to join it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>B. The Need to Seek Fellowship in the Church</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If this is the case, why are we telling you to join the church?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are merely borrowing an expression that you can understand.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You are a member of the church already.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although it is true that you are saved by God, you are also living among fellow human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some may not know you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The brothers may not recognize you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Faith is something that occurs within you; no one else knows it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why you have to seek fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You have to go to the church and tell others, "I am a Christian; please receive me as a Christian."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If my father is Chinese, I do not have to join the Chinese race; I am already Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If I am a believer, and the church does not know me, I can go to the church and say, "You do not know me, but I am a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Please receive me into your fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Please receive me as one of your own."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the brothers realize that you are indeed one of them, they will have fellowship with you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is what it means to join the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You are already a person in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What you need to do now is to seek fellowship among God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You have to seek the fellowship of the members, the fellowship of the Body, and learn to serve God properly in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once your eyes are open to this, thank the Lord, you have taken another step forward.</S>
