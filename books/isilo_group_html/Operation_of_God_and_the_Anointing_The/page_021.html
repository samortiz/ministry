Not Being to Subdue Us but to Break Us</h2>
<p><em>Question: I am a talkative person. When the Holy Spirit does not allow me to talk, I submit. Can this be regarded as accepting the discipline of the Holy Spirit?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The discipline of the Holy Spirit that we are speaking of does not refer to the Holy Spirit restricting us within but to the circumstances that we encounter in our environment. It is not that the Holy Spirit restricts you from within, prohibiting you from talking. Rather, He will arrange an environment in which you will be in trouble because you talk too much. Without the enlightening of the Holy Spirit, we cannot understand a message, even if we exercise our mind. The basic purpose of the discipline of the Holy Spirit is to break us; it is not a matter of our being in subjection. For example, the Lord arranges for a brother to have a difficult wife. This is the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Because of his personality, temperament, and disposition, this brother needs this kind of wife in order to deal with him every day. If this brother thinks that he understands a message concerning the discipline of the Holy Spirit, he may bow his head in subjection and say, &ldquo;I am willing to be subject to the discipline of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This kind of subjection is wrong. God gave this brother a precious wife so that he would be broken, not for him to be submissive.</p>
<p>I know a brother who has &ldquo;subjected&rdquo; himself to the discipline of the Holy Spirit, but his self has only become stronger. He said that when he first got married, his wife was good, but she gradually became worse. The more he tried to reason with her, the more unreasonable she became. Eventually, he said, &ldquo;Now I understand that this is the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, I am willing to submit. I will no longer argue with her. God has ordained this.&rdquo; At the beginning of his marriage he could be likened to an unfurled steel sheet. When he began to &ldquo;submit,&rdquo; he rolled himself up like an iron ball. Instead of fighting with his wife, he prayed, &ldquo;O God, vindicate me at the judgment seat.&rdquo; His self became stronger because of his wrong understanding concerning the discipline of the Holy Spirit. It was possible for him to receive the breaking when he was not willing to submit; however, he cannot receive the breaking when he merely submits.</p>
<p>The discipline of the Holy Spirit is not for man to be subdued but to be broken. The discipline of the Holy Spirit is not to ask us to be silent but to break our talkative nature. This question shows that we receive the discipline of the Holy Spirit according to our natural man, not according to the intention of the Holy Spirit. The understanding that the discipline of the Holy Spirit is to subdue us is in the principle of correcting our mistakes. Formerly, you liked to talk, and you argued with your spouse. Later, you decided to submit and would stop arguing. This is a correction. Similar to the teaching of the anointing, the purpose of the discipline of the Holy Spirit is to change our person. The Holy Spirit disciplines us in order to break our talkative nature.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing to See the Light</h2>
<p><em>Question: Will a person who receives the teaching of the anointing and the discipline of the Holy Spirit still make mistakes?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This question shows that we still have not been delivered from our concept of right and wrong. Let me say again: God does not care about right or wrong, nor does He care about sinning or not sinning. He cares about Christ. Even if we did not commit any sins, we would not be valuable. If we could live to be ninety years old without sinning, God would still not want us. If an ordinary stone did not have any dirt on it, I would not consider it to be a treasure. A stone cannot become a pearl. Our heart is filled with the thought of sinning or not sinning. We think that we are precious and spiritual if we do not sin. This is a human concept. God&rsquo;s concept is not related to sin but to whether we are men of clay or men of gold who contain the element of Christ.</p>
<p>These questions concerning being right or wrong are from the mind; they lack light. We cannot do anything if the Holy Spirit does not enlighten us. God&rsquo;s goal is to deliver us from the self so that we can live Christ. We must be delivered from the concept of good or evil and right or wrong in order to see that the goal of the Holy Spirit is to use all kinds of environments to put us to death so that Christ can be lived out from us. This is the goal of the work of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit wants to put us to death. This is what we must see and consider. It is best for us to say, &ldquo;Lord, I thank and praise You because You are the anointing. I know only Christ and Him crucified; I know only the killing work of the cross. I do not care about being right or wrong, or about sinning or not sinning.&rdquo; Then we can receive salvation.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Operation of God and the Anointing &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
