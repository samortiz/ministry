   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INSISTING ON NOTHING BUT CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should not insist on anything, but keep the unity for the church life in spite of all dissenting matters.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must be delivered from the divisive elements of all different opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How can we be delivered?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is only possible by caring only for Christ and the church!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must be filled with Christ and strong in our spirit for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose I am a brother who loves to practice a certain thing which to me is very scriptural, and when I come to a certain local church, I find that the church opposes that very thing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But regardless how much they oppose it, they are still the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am for that thing, because it helps me enjoy Christ; but since the church opposes it, I should not insist on practicing it in the public meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I am at home, however, I will still practice it very much.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then I will be so burning with Christ that when I come to the meetings, I will come burnt and burning.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I will not speak of that very thing, but I will be burning with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If there is the slightest opportunity, the fire of Christ will get into the meeting through me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whoever I contact, whether he be an elder or a brother, will be burnt.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Perhaps after a certain time, the entire church will be burned by me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not be for anything but Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If I am one who is so much for doctrines and teachings, it is certain that I will cause trouble in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I come to a certain local church and feel that they do not have any order, I will move to correct them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if I do this, it proves that I do not know Christ so well as life and that I am not strong in the spirit for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If I am full of Christ and strong for the church, I will not care what they do or what kind of doctrine they have; I will only praise the Lord that here is a local church on the proper ground where I can minister Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I will be afire in the spirit and so full of Christ that when I come to the meetings, I will minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I will be for Christ and the church nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I will not care for the right thing or the wrong thing; I will only care for Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If I am such a person, most of the seeking ones sooner or later will be helped by me, and the Christ whom I experience and minister will also be a living experience to them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This will keep the unity and strengthen the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is by keeping the unity of Christ that the church is enriched; it is the unity of doctrines or different opinions that damages the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually the people in that place will not care for anything other than Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They will not care for what is right or wrong; they will just care for Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE WAY TO KEEP UNITY</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here is the way for us to keep the proper unity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must not try to convince others of our opinions, but just be strong in the spirit, rich in the experience of Christ, and care for the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are always two things that cause problems in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first is that people continually desire that others be the same as they.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The second is that people want regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They always ask, "Which way is right?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Is this the right way?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are all like this, and we must by all means be delivered from these things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What we need is not regulations, but to be filled with Christ and rich in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not be for this way or for that way, but just for Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In everything other than Christ and the church, we must be liberal and general.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is no need for us either to oppose or impose anything other than the Lord as life and the church as His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Perhaps some will think that I am too liberal and do not care for the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But I would ask them to read Romans 14 again and care for this chapter as they care for the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Apostle Paul is so liberal and general in this chapter, and he tells us to be such.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Book of Romans not only has chapter 12, but also chapter 14.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>People today pay much attention to chapter 12, but neglect chapter 14.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But without chapter 14, it is impossible to have the real Body life of chapter 12.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Body life of chapter 12 requires the liberal and general attitude of chapter 14 that its unity may be kept.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Otherwise, it will be damaged by dissenting opinions and different concepts in certain matters.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we do mean that we care for the Bible, we must care for this chapter, Romans 14.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Perhaps there are some who do not like to hear everyone saying "Amen" in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But those who say "Amen" do have the ground to say it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the people of Israel came into the land of Canaan, the entire congregation said "Amen!"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Deut 27:11-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>And in Revelation 5:14 and 19:4, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders said, "Amen!"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They will turn to you and ask, "Where is your ground for not saying Amen'?"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Who is right and who is wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In any case, we must be liberal with all things like this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must not care for all such things, but only for Christ and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I have a deep conviction that in these last days the Lord will recover the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He will not care for these doctrinal things, just as He did not care for such things when He first came.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At that time the Lord Jesus and His forerunner, John the Baptist, abandoned all the religious customs.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They did not surrender God, but they gave up the religion of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I believe that now, at the time of His second coming, the Lord will repudiate all the forms, regulations, and dead doctrines of Christianity.</S>
