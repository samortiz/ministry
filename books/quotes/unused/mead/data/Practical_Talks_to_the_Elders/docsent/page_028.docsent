   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO HONEY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>These days I have been working on the three Epistles of John.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The last one does say, The friends greet you 3 John 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And the Lord Jesus did say, Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep John 11:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There was a kind of friendship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But that friendship was a spiritual friendship; it was not based on natural affection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What I mean is this: natural affection should be kept aside.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is typified by the word not to put honey in the meal offering Lev 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Natural affection is not that evil, like leaven; it is something sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Well, there must be no honey in the Lord s work, no honey in the church leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The relationships should be pure; the fellowship should be genuine, in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must avoid honey, natural affection, especially in the church responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once our family comes in, there is a real impureness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This doesn t mean that our wives and children shouldn t come into the Lord s interest.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They should.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the line should be drawn.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some sisters may come to your home to help with the cooking in some instance, but you must draw a line.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you don t draw a line, you will have trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sometimes such relationships can lead into sinful things like fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Draw a line.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In human society there are always some who are fond of helping others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since you are a leader, they would especially like to help you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since you are a leading one in this kind of work in society, if they are allowed to help you, they feel honored.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Don t take advantage of their offers to help.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not allow this kind of thing to come in. It comes in mostly through the family.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>DELICATE SURGERY</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I hope my word is clear to you all.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It involves a lot of things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You have to understand it in a very clear-cut way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You have to be a surgeon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In doing surgery, you must be discerning in order to know which part to keep and which part to cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not that we reject all the brothers and sisters from coming to contact us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to have contact with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In a positive sense, the elders should be those who are open to others, who easily contact others, and who are easily approachable.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you are not this way, you cannot effectively carry out your responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet there is a peril.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You must draw a line, allowing the relationship to go only so far.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I can testify that many times the saints would have liked to have further contact with us, but we stopped it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we had wanted to, we could have gone further.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then, however, they and we would both have fallen into a relationship which would not have been healthy to our spiritual life nor to the church life nor to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>AVOIDING NATURAL AFFECTION</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Suppose one of you brothers comes to fellowship with me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That is fine.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But after many times of fellowshipping together, there will be the peril that the two families might get involved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His wife will come in, and so will my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here is the peril.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That is why we must draw the line.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We can only go so far to have fellowship in the spirit; if we go further, we fall into natural affection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The churches have been in the same localities for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The longer we stay in the same place, the easier it is for all of us to become involved with certain families and to develop a natural affection for them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even if you have saints staying with you, you have to draw a line.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not let that hospitality bring in a kind of natural affection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Regardless of how long the guests are there with you, keep a distance.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Otherwise, whatever you do for the Lord will be damaged by your natural affection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The only thing to be built up is the spiritual fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There should be no natural affection, no friendship.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We who are co-workers should be intimate brothers, yet still not friends.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All these years I have never built up a friendship with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You might consider me a cold person.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I may be; I don t know.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Yet I do realize that the Lord has been preserving me from trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When I look into the past, I thank Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If I had developed some friendships, I surely would have gotten into trouble and would have suffered because of it.</S>
