We hope that you will come to Manchuria soon because there are some matters in which we cannot proceed with full assurance. In the Lord's work, I think that there must be a few praying in one accord before something spiritual can be realized. A small number of people have to wrestle in prayer, bring about some changes through prayer, and touch the things that the Lord wants to tear down and the things that He wants to establish, before they can say that they are co-laboring with Him. One must serve in prayer before he can serve in the ministry of the word. What a small number of people touch will spread to the many. If a small number purge themselves of all judgments, views, or decisions, and if they come before the Lord as empty vessels for Him to speak to, work on, and judge, there will not be any problems in the Lord's manifesting Himself. The Lord is desperate. The key matter is whether or not we will let Him come out. What the Lord wants to tear down in many must first be torn down in a few. What the Lord wants to judge in many must first be judged in a few. The service of the co-workers and the elders depends on this. If a few are willing to pursue the Lord, setting themselves aside to meet the Lord, we will know that everything is Christ. Authority, work, and position all belong to Christ. We are empty; we are nothing.</p><p>There are still problems in the service in Manchuria. When everyone comes before the Lord, there is still the lack of one accord. This is related to our background. When I was in Shanghai, I planned to fellowship openly with you, but I did not have the opportunity because the Lord's time had not yet come. It is very difficult to get through these matters without discussing them, and they are creating endless problems. In my private prayer, I beg the Lord to tear down all that is of our flesh and human opinion, and to establish what is of Himself. I am no longer silent, but am learning to stand firm with the Lord. I also deeply desire that I would have a right spirit, free from individual feelings, in opening the situation in Manchuria to you. Indeed, the service of some has posed a real problem. These are truly days for the Lord to cleanse His church. He will not let our flesh go. We are waiting for reminders in fear and trembling. We want to repent while it is still today, lest we bring our mistakes to the judgment seat. I really do not want to pay attention to my slight pain. I only want to receive the cleansing judgment. If you cannot come to Manchuria soon, could I make a trip to Shanghai to receive your instructions? If I cannot do this, some matters will be left untouched, and the church will suffer real spiritual losses.</p><p>For many years, Brother Xun-tian and Brother Xi-nian have given up their money and time with sweat and blood for the Lord's testimony in Manchuria. During the Japanese occupation, they were put in jail for several months for the Lord's testimony, but they never renounced the Lord. They paid a price for the Lord's business in Ch'ang-ch'un. I deeply feel that we cannot ignore what they see before the Lord, so I hope you will fellowship with them.</p><p>With regard to the matter of the brothers' occupation in Ch'ang-ch'un, there is an oil factory (mechanically producing soy oil) that is completely run by the brothers. There is a newly established textile factory, but it is very small. Last year Brother Xun-tian started the Canaan Soy Sauce Factory, and the Lord has greatly blessed it. Recently, a large soy sauce factory was put up for sale. The lot is very large, and it can employ thirty to forty people. It will require a capital investment of seven hundred to eight hundred million yen. The brothers in Ch'ang-ch'un may be able to put the money together, and it will be managed by the Canaan Soy Sauce Factory. These brothers are all consecrated and have the heart to strive for the Lord's work. In this way, the brothers' occupations will be resolved.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Hua Tien-min<br />August 20, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: 9 Tongxun Alley, West 4 Road, Ch'ang-ch'un</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_091.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_093.html">Next</a> </body></html>
