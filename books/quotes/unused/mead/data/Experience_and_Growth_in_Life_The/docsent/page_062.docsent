   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: How do we deal with our disposition?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Should we pray concerning our disposition, or should we seek more experience of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Answer: The Lord does not seem to answer this kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Romans 8:13 says, "If by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The practices of our body are part of our character.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Habitually, we always do things a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to put to death our habits by the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The only thing that can solve the problem of our disposition and character is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to take the cross to put our disposition to death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may be willing to put to death the members of our body in relation to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, our body has many practices every day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All these practices are according to our habits, and they also must be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to pay attention to the matter of opinion and always condemn our opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A brother may come to us and say, "Let us go to visit people by knocking on their doors."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we have learned the lesson of putting our disposition to death, we will say, "Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, we may feel that we have the right to express our opinion and that we should not follow this brother blindly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only the death of the cross can deal with our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our old man, the "I," has been crucified with Christ Rom 6:6; Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we have to let our opinion, our disposition, remain on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the breaking of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Question: Since our opinion affects how useful we are and how well we can work with others, how can we fellowship and coordinate with one another in the work?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Answer: We must put our opinion aside.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is hard for Christians to discuss the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is even hard to talk about being in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In February of 1986, about five hundred co-workers and elders came together for a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The subject of that conference was the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, that conference became the source of a turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When three gospel team members come together, if one would say something to maintain the one accord, he may offend the other two.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because the one accord is a difficult matter, many Christians are like politicians.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They say they agree with something when actually they do not.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It seems they do not have any opinion, but actually they have many opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Question: What should we do if something comes out in our fellowship that we strongly feel is not right?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Answer: We must take the lead to be without an opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Let the others with whom we fellowship say what they will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should simply say, "Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I will go along with you."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then the others will follow our example.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we argue and correct others, we will set up a model of arguing and correcting, and the others will also argue.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we have learned the lesson of dealing with opinions, we will be an example of a person with no opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then the others with us will also learn the lesson of dealing with opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Often when I propose something, the brothers with me will propose something different.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When this happens, I quickly go along with them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the other hand, when the brothers propose something, I do not like to say something different.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I prefer to go along with them and say, "Very good.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Let us do it."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is the matter of opinion, our disposition, that makes us stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We do not like to be changed or corrected.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We like to insist on our way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we do not break through to have our way this time, we will try again the next time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we are like this, the older brothers cannot use us, and the younger brothers will not work with us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As a result, we will become isolated and useless.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should always go along with the brothers, with no opinion, putting our disposition to death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then we will be useful.</S>
