<h2 class="head1">THE EFFECTIVENESS<br />
OF THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD</h2>
<p>The Chinese have a saying that a single statement may cause a nation to rise or to fall. This shows the serious effect of words. Words can save a person&rsquo;s life or destroy a person. Words can also cause a country to rise or to fall. Likewise, the building up or the tearing down of a church depends on the ministry of the word. The brothers serving in the ministry of the word must realize the importance of their responsibility. If we minister the word in a poor way, the church will suffer loss, but if we serve well, the church will benefit. Hence, whether the church suffers loss or is benefited depends on us. One day we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ to give an account to the Lord. The Lord will surely question us concerning this matter.</p>
<p>The brothers who minister the word must not blame the saints or the church for not doing well. Instead, we must bear the blame and admit that the problems are a result of a deficiency in our ministry of the word. We must not shirk our responsibility. We may blame the church, but when another worker, who can supply the church with a strong ministry in the word, comes, the condition of the church will change. The ministry of the word causes the saints to rise up. It is wrong for a mother to beat and scold her children because they are thin and sickly in appearance. The condition of the children is the result of poor nutrients. A mother may think that she gives her children sufficient nutrients, but the food she prepares tastes like medicine. She may think that the food is nutritious, but to the children it tastes like bitter medicine. Similarly, the speaking brothers may feel that the message they give is rich, but the saints do not receive a supply. The brothers may blame the saints and even rebuke them for their lack of comprehension. However, the saints do not eat, because the brothers prepare only &ldquo;bitter medicine.&rdquo; Therefore, we should not blame the &ldquo;children&rdquo; for being thin and sickly. We should rather make sure that the food we give them has flavor. We must understand that the root of the problems in the local churches is related to the ministry of the word.</p>
<p>If the word of the gospel is properly preached, crowds of people will repent and be saved, but if the word is not properly preached, few people will be saved. Therefore, the word that is spoken makes a difference. This applies to the word spoken to sinners and to the word spoken to the believers. Therefore, we must pay attention to the ministry of the word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD BEING WITH GOD AND<br />
THE WORD BEING GOD</h2>
<p>The word that we are referring to is the word of ministry spoken from the podium, not the common words spoken in the world. The brothers who serve in the ministry of the word must grasp a basic principle&mdash;the word that they minister must be God. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; John did not begin the sentence with <em>the Word was God.</em> He first said, &ldquo;The Word was with God,&rdquo; and then, &ldquo;the Word was God.&rdquo; The spoken word must be with God so that the saints receive God. Oftentimes when we listen to a message, the word that is spoken is not God and does not have the presence of God. Such words are empty and can be idle talk.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD BEING SPIRIT AND LIFE</h2>
<p>The words spoken by the brothers must cause the saints to see God. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life...the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (6:63). The words released through the ministry of the word should always be the utterance of God, and they should be spirit and life. The apostles wrote the Epistles according to this principle. For example, sometimes the apostle Paul spoke his own words, but he felt that God was in his words (1 Cor. 7:10, 12, 25, 40). This is what makes the Bible special and proves that the Bible is God&rsquo;s Word. Most people are afraid to speak about themselves, but much of what Paul said was concerning himself. It seems that Paul in his Epistles spoke more about himself than about the Lord Jesus. He never mentioned where the Lord Jesus was born, but he gave a clear account of his own background. While most people today dare not speak about themselves, Paul spoke about himself, particularly in the books of 1 and 2 Corinthians. However, as we read the words concerning Paul, we sense God. Paul even said that it was necessary, not expedient, for him to boast and that he boasted like a foolish man (2 Cor. 12:1; 11:16-17). In these words Paul did not speak about God, the Lord, or the Spirit. However, when we read them, we sense God, because Paul spoke forth God. Even though Paul spoke concerning himself, his words conveyed God.</p>
<p>It is possible for us to say &ldquo;God&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; in every sentence but have nothing of God when we speak. What Paul said was full of the element of God. Hence, when we read Paul&rsquo;s words, we touch God. Paul&rsquo;s words are God, the Spirit, and life. If we want our words to convey God, the Spirit, and life, our words must pass through God and be in God.</p>
