God's original goal is for man to have His life. However, man fell and complicated God's work. Today God not only needs to give life to man, but He also must deal with the things that prevent Him from reaching His goal.</p><p>Therefore, God's work in us has two aspects: The first aspect remedies man's shortcomings, whereas the second aspect fulfills His goal. The remedial aspect deals with sins, which hinder man, whereas the fulfilling aspect dispenses God's life into man. In reading through the Bible, we can see that God's work has two aspects and that they are both accomplished through the death and resurrection of Christ. The Lord Jesus said that no sign or miracle would be given except the sign of Jonah (Matt. 12:39; 16:4). The sign of Jonah points to death and resurrection. What is a miracle? A miracle is something that God alone can perform. Aside from death and resurrection, there is no other sign. God's work is altogether centered around death and resurrection. The death and resurrection of Christ have four aspects&mdash;two are negative, and two are positive. The two negative aspects of death and resurrection are for dealing with sins; the two positive aspects of death and resurrection are for dispensing God's life to man. These four aspects of death and resurrection enable us to reach God's goal. In this conference, we hope to see the relationship between these four aspects of death and resurrection. Tonight, for the sake of clarity, we will only touch these four aspects in a brief way. This will give us a clear picture as we consider each one in detail later.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FOUR ASPECTS OF<br />THE DEATH AND RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</h2><p>The death and resurrection of Christ have four aspects: First, the substituting death and resurrection; second, the identifying death and resurrection; third, the releasing death and resurrection; fourth, the denying death and resurrection, that is, the self-denying death and resurrection. In the Bible these four aspects of death and resurrection are distinct and different. If we are not clear concerning these four aspects of death and resurrection, our work will only produce confusion.</p><p>The substituting and identifying death and resurrection are for dealing with sins. The releasing and self-denying death and resurrection are for the fulfillment of God's purpose. We can consider Christ's death in these four aspects: substituting, identifying, releasing, and denying. In the future we also will look at resurrection in these four aspects. These four aspects of death and resurrection are my subject in this conference. Brothers and sisters, do not think that these four aspects of death and resurrection are too difficult to comprehend. If you consider them carefully, you will see that the first two aspects are for dealing with sins and the last two aspects are for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</p><p>In the Bible the first aspect of death is denoted by the blood, the second by crucifixion, the third by the flesh, and the fourth by the bearing of the cross. The Bible shows us the blood, the crucifixion, the flesh, and the bearing of the cross. These four things are the various aspects of the work of Christ.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 43: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (3) &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
