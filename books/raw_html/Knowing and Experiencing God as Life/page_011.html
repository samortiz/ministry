        <h2 class="head2">The Element of Ascension</h2>
<p>God also has the element of ascension. The Lord ascended and entered into heaven with His humanity. We should not consider heaven to be merely a place. Of course, heaven is a place. However, when the Bible speaks of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; ascension into heaven, it does not refer merely to heaven as a place but to the nature of heaven. When the Lord Jesus ascended, He entered into not only the place of heaven but also the heavenly nature.</p>
<p>Our old man is out of the earth and is earthy (1 Cor. 15:47). Earth is not merely a place but also a nature. Hence, to say that man is earthy means that earth is the nature of man because he is made of earth. Similarly, to say that the Lord Jesus ascended to heaven refers more to the nature of heaven than to the place of heaven. The Lord Jesus is not only in heaven as a place but also in the nature, condition, state, characteristic, and atmosphere of heaven. Hence, He brought man not only into God but also into heaven. Now He is enabling man not only to have the glory of God but also to have the nature of heaven.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEVEN ELEMENTS</h2>
<p>In summary, God possesses seven elements: the element of divinity, the element of humanity, the element of human living, the element of death, the element of resurrection, the element of man entering into God, and the element of ascension. If a person in the Old Testament had received God into him, only one element, the element of divinity, would have entered into him. But God is no longer in the Old Testament. He became flesh, lived as a man, died, resurrected, brought man into God, and ascended into heaven. Hence, these seven elements are within Him. As a result, when we receive Him into our spirit, His seven elements enter into us.</p>
<p>I beg you to use your spirit to absorb this word and to use your mind to memorize it. Our ability to remember this word will affect our life practices in the future. We must be clear that the Triune God is now the Spirit with many rich elements. He has the elements of divinity, humanity, human living, death, resurrection, man entering into God, and ascension. As long as a person is saved, the Triune God is his life; hence, he should immediately begin to experience these seven elements. Even a new believer who has been saved for only two or three months can still experience these seven elements.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING THESE SEVEN ELEMENTS</h2>
<p>When we received the Triune God into us, we received the divine nature; the Holy Spirit brought God into us. Hence, we are human beings, and God is within us.</p>
<p>We also have the Lord&rsquo;s humanity. Some may say that they are already human beings. This is true; however, we should consider whether we were more proper as human beings before we were saved or after we were saved. Many believers were not very proper before their salvation; they did not have much weightiness. After their salvation, however, they began to have some weightiness and to conduct themselves like proper human beings. If they will pursue the Lord more and be filled more with the Holy Spirit, they will become more proper and weighty as human beings. This is the experience of God working within man. A person who has God within him is much weightier than a person without God. In other words, the God who enters into this person brings with Him the element of humanity so that this person can live the life of a proper man.</p>
<p>We have also received the element of human living. After a person is saved, his conduct changes. Prior to his salvation, he may have been careless in his speech when he interacted with others. After he is saved, there is no need for him to be taught; he spontaneously becomes sober and clear. His relationship with others, regardless of their gender or age, is no longer careless; rather, it is sober. He can discern whether a matter concerns females or males, whether it is related to the elderly or to the young ones, and whether it should be dealt with by only believers or also unbelievers. He can also discern how to speak with others, based on their situation. When we allow God to live in us, we will take care of our living and our walk; we will be conscious of our measure. The life that has entered into us has an element that causes us to know how to live as proper human beings.</p>
<p>Some saints have the erroneous concept that it is sufficient to have God and be filled with the Holy Spirit. They think that they do not need to take care of their living. Such Christians neglect the aspect of their human living; they do not take care of the way they dress, the way they live, or the way they deal with others. This is not proper. The thought that a person who is spiritual does not have to care for a proper living is a wrong concept. The more spiritual we are, the more we will live in the Lord, and the more He will cause us to live as proper human beings.</p>
<p>Miss M. E. Barber was a sister from the West who served the Lord in China for many years. She was very spiritual and knew the Lord. For a period of time, there was a group of young brothers and sisters who often went to her to be taught. Some of these young saints neglected being proper in their human living because they pursued being spiritual. Sometimes Miss Barber would call one of the sisters into her room, bring out a mirror, and ask, &ldquo;Please look in the mirror, and see how you combed your hair. Have you combed your hair in the last three days?&rdquo; Miss Barber would speak frankly, saying, &ldquo;Sister, it is right that you are pursuing spirituality, but you are not a spirit or an angel. You are still a human being; hence, you need to learn how to be a proper human being. You should care for your appearance, just as you care for spiritual matters.&rdquo; Miss Barber was right. The more a person grows in the Lord, the more human he will become; he will bear a strong aroma of a proper humanity.</p>
<p>When the Triune God enters into us, He brings with Him the element of death. As long as we pursue the Lord, fellowship with Him, and enjoy His presence, the power of death will operate within us to cause us to die to the world, to sin, to the flesh, and to fleshly reactions. The closer we draw to the Lord, the more we will be filled with Him. The more we allow Him to operate in us, the more we will sense the killing power of death in relation to all things. The power of death is in the Lord&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>We will also experience being in resurrection; nothing will be able to suppress, imprison, oppress, or restrict us. A brother&rsquo;s wife might have a physical weakness; there might be various problems or difficult situations pressing upon him. From the human point of view, he might not have the strength to bear his environment. However, he can experience a power that enables him to gradually stand in the midst of his problems and difficulties. This is the element of resurrection.</p>
<p>Not only so, as believers, we sense that we are in glory. This is not pride, nor is it a boast, but it is a spontaneous sense. In our daily living we should be persons in glory, persons in God.</p>
<p>We might argue with a taxi driver over a small matter such as the taxi fare, but there is no glory in this situation. Rather, it shows that we are still earthy and do not see how glorious we are. At times I also have wanted to argue with the taxi driver, but when I was about to open my mouth, a voice within me said, &ldquo;Do not forget that you are a man in glory.&rdquo; Immediately, I would drop my argument. Sometimes I have even given the driver a little more money.</p>
<p>Whether or not we are right, we can never feel good when we argue with others. We will always feel that we are earthy and short of glory. In contrast, if instead of arguing we concede to others, we will sense that we are in glory. We will also sense that we have entered deeper into God.</p>
<p>When I have contacted people with a high social status, I am respectful toward them, but I do not feel lower than them. We should not be proud, but we have entered into God; the lowly have entered into glory. I believe that we all have had such experiences.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as believers, we sense that although we live on earth, we do not belong to this earth; we belong to heaven. We are persons not only in God but also in heaven. Earthly things will not touch us because we transcend the earth; we are in ascension.</p>
<p>These points are not doctrine; they are experiences of God for us. The more we touch life and are filled with the Spirit, the more we will experience these elements. The element of divinity and the element of humanity will cause us to be weighty. The element of human living will enable us to be proper persons. The element of death kills the things within us that are not God. There is also the element of resurrection that gives us the power to break though everything that suppresses us. We also have the element of glory that gives us the sense that we are men in glory, men in God. Not only so, we also sense that we are heavenly. Even though we live on earth, we belong to heaven; we are persons living in the heavenly realm of ascension.</p>
<p>Such experiences can be our experience when God is life to us. God has passed through incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection. He has also brought us into Himself as well as into the heavenly realm. All that He has passed through has become His elements. All these elements are in the Spirit, and the Spirit has entered into us. Hence, all these elements have become ours. The more we live by God as our life, the more these elements will increase within us and become stronger and more apparent.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
