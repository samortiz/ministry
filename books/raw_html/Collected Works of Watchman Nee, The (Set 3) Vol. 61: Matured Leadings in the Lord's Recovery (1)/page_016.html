<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING CHURCH AFFAIRS</h2><p>We need to speak two things in relation to church affairs. First, we have to be watchful of the leading brothers. Do not let them take matters too lightly. Second, meetings should be held weekly because a week is a unit for a Christian.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE RESPONSIBLE BROTHERS<br />IN THE CHURCH</h2><p>Brother Hsu is a very good brother. Brother Liao has good recommendations from many sources, but I do not know him and therefore cannot say anything about him. Brother Chien loves the Lord very much, but his experience is not deep enough; it needs to take deeper root. Brother Chen is young but is pure before the Lord. Brother Ku has a good disposition. He does not have a hot temperament, and he is meek. It is easy for him to get along with others. But while he is a friendly person, he cannot exercise such friendliness in managing the church. He is short of one thing&mdash;strictness. Everyone who bears responsibility for the management of the church has to be strict. Moses was meeker than any person who lived on earth (Num. 12:3); yet at the same time, he was very strict. When he saw the people worshipping the golden calf, he did not wait for another word to smash the stone tablets. He forced the Israelites to drink of the ground powder from the golden calf and called upon the Levites to kill their own brothers (Exo. 32:19-29). All the responsible brothers have to be strict.</p><p>I do not know that much about the spiritual perception of Brother Shang. Has his understanding increased during the past few years? He is also a pure person, a good man. Unfortunately he is short of spiritual understanding. Today if anyone is short of spiritual understanding, he cannot be a responsible brother. Whether or not a man can easily change depends on the amount of spiritual understanding he has.</p><p>A responsible brother should not hold everything in his own hands. Rather, he should learn to assign responsibilities and to supervise the brothers and sisters in their work. He should not monopolize everything.</p><p>The responsible brothers should come together at least twice a week. First they should be together one day per week to let the brothers and sisters know that at least they are available. Second, there should be a co-workers' meeting in which the co-workers fellowship about going on in the work and about problems among themselves. The co-workers should take care not to relax in the matter of Christian fellowship. Problems among people and with things should be dealt with and taken care of in a thorough way. No procrastination should be allowed. Every meeting should begin with prayer and end with prayer. The ending prayer should be a prayer that leads to some kind of solution. Arrangements and charges should be made concerning those who are rebellious.</p><p>Business affairs, once they are made clear after fellowship, should be assigned to the brothers and sisters for execution. Be high in your expectation of the brothers and sisters. It is better to be high than to be low. If the standard is too low, the result will be low even if the standard is attained. Learn from A. G. Gordon, who said that one should put a nail on the wall as high as possible. The responsible brothers have to set a high expectation for the saints. If they do not, the saints will never advance. Business affairs should be based on whether or not it is right to do something, not on whether or not it is hard to do it.</p>
