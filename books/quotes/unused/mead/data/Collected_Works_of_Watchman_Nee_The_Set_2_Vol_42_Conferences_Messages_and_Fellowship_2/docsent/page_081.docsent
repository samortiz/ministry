   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FIRST SECTION:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OUR INHERITANCE IN CHRIST SIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This verse points out the central thought of the first three chapters of this book; it contains a most important point.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to Paul, this book is not about earthly things, but about heavenly things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God has given man every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I was in Changchow, some brothers wondered how we have all the blessings in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I used the illustration of a water bucket to explain this matter to them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's salvation is like a well.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He has no intention that we draw out water with a water bucket, as the Samaritan woman did.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is too unreliable for man to draw the water himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The rope may be too short and not reach the water.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One may not have enough strength to draw up the water.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There- fore, God has given us the whole well.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He has given us everything that we need once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Samaritan woman's thought was only on the water bucket.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But God has prepared everything for us in Christ Jesus His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Chinese has an idiomatic expression: "As long as the green mountain remains, there is no fear of shortage of firewood."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a whole mountain is yours, you do not have to worry about running out of firewood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But man thinks that as soon as he stops cutting wood, he will run out of firewood.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is our "green mountain," and as long as this "green mountain" remains, we have all the provisions we need; there is no need for us to worry anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Ephesians 1:4-14 then speaks of how God selected and predestinated us unto sonship, how He redeemed and forgave us, and how we have received the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All these are the heavenly blessings mentioned in verse 3.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since we have already received these things, why are we still so poor?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>My answer is that we are all millionaires, but that we are poor millionaires.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose a prodigal son does not realize that his father has left him a will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He will continue to live in poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When he takes out his father's will from the safe and reads it, and when he begins to claim his inheritance, he will become a rich millionaire.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Spiritually speaking, we often are poor millionaires.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If our eyes are veiled day after day, we will surely live a life of poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We will live a life that is beset by sin and frustrated by temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We will not see that God has given us everything in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our eyes must be opened to see the inheritance that God prepared for us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is why Paul continued to pray for the saints in verses 15 through 23, after he mentioned God's heavenly blessings in verses 4 through 14.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He prayed that our eyes would be opened, and that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation to know of our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Everything depends on God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need God's revelation before we can see the riches in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A preacher may preach the doctrine of salvation, but he may not be able to save others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A preacher may preach the doctrine of victory, but he may not be able to help others overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord said, "He who has an ear, let him hear."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many people have the first part of this sentence, but do not have the second part.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They have ears, but they do not hear and they do not receive anything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to pray and ask God for revelation to see the riches of our inheritance in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Mr. Hudson Taylor, the founder of the China Inland Mission did a good work in China, but at one time there were a few sins that he could not overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He could not sustain an uninterrupted fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One day he read in John 15 that the Lord is the vine and that we are the branches, and that those who abide in Him will bear much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He thought that he had not been abiding in the Lord continually, and he prayed day and night to be a branch in the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He wrote to his sister, saying, "For a few months I have been praying to be a branch, but have not experienced it yet.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I am in much turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Please pray for me."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Later, in another letter he wrote to his sister, saying, "The scales have fallen off from my eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I saw that the Lord's Word clearly says that I am a branch.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Yet I was still praying to be a branch.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How foolish I was."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He saw that he was a branch, and that there was no more need to beg earnestly to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once his eyes were opened, he realized that the Lord is the vine as well as the branches, the water, the sap, the soil, the root, the sunshine, and the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord is everything to the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As long as he remained in the vine, everything would be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>From the day he saw this, his spiritual life took a great turn.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Here is a glass cup.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It does not have to pray to be a glass cup.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You are Ching-fan Chan.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You do not have to pray to be Ching-fan Chan.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A man can stumble upon salvation accidentally, but he cannot stumble upon victory accidentally.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As soon as a man aspires to be holy and victorious, he will try all he can to seek after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But once his eyes are opened, he will see that he has inherited everything in Christ already.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He will say what Hudson Taylor said in jubilation: "From now on I am a new man."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In chapter two, Paul went back to the time before man's salvation and told how God leads man step by step and guides his footsteps.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Verses 11 through 22 tell us how we start from the point of being Gentiles, and how we are led from the lowest pit to the highest plane.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In 3:1-13 Paul goes on to say that he was appointed by God to be an apostle to the Gentiles, and that the Gentiles are now able to receive the same grace.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>According to doctrinal sequence, verses 14 through 21 should immediately follow the last verse of chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Ephesians 2:1 3:13 is actually a parenthesis; it describes our condition as sinners, our position as Gentiles, and Paul's apostleship for the deliverance of man.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Ephesians 1:23 is joined to verse 3:14.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>These two passages are Paul's prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>What is the goal of these prayers?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The prayer in chapter one is for us to "know" something through the revelation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The prayer in chapter three is for us to be "granted" something through the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Chapter one is on revelation; it enables us to know what we have.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Chapter three is on the strengthening of the inner man; it enables us to be rooted and grounded.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Chapter three does not tell us what we are in Christ, but what Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If there is no air, we cannot survive.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>However, even if there is air, we cannot live if we cover up our nose.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In order for a man to live, he must be in the air, and air must also be in him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Chapter three's emphasis is not on us being in Christ, but on the Holy Spirit being in us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Thank the Lord that the air that I am in is also the same air that is in me.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In the first prayer, Paul mentioned revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Revelation shows man that everything is accomplished in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the second prayer, Paul mentioned faith.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Faith is believing that what God has done is real.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Revelation is always linked to faith.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>There are three main points in chapters one through three: 1 God's provisions, 2 God's revelation, and 3 man's faith.</S>
