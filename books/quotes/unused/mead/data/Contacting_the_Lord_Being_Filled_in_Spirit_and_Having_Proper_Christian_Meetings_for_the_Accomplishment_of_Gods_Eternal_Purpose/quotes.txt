[1]  Contacting the Lord, Being Filled in Spirit, and Having Proper Christian Meetings for the Accomplishment of God s Eternal Purpose CONTENTS
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THREE GREAT MATTERS IN THE SCRIPTURES Scripture Reading: Eph 3:11; Gen 1:26; 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17 GOD S MOVE IN THE UNITED STATES
[3]  Before I moved to the United States, I had no thought that I would ever do so.
[4]  One night while I was in San Francisco, I told the brother with whom I was staying that I had the definite sense that the Lord wanted to do something on the West Coast of the United States.
[5]  How does God accomplish that which He has purposed?
[6]  Question: Can you tell us what kind of spiritual movement you are starting?
[7]  This man died on the cross to put the entire old creation to an end, and then in resurrection He was transfigured into the Spirit so that He could impart His life into all those who believe into Him v. 45 . Those who believe into Him and receive Him as life into their spirit are the Body of Christ.
[8]  We do not want to have any kind of movement; rather, we realize that the Lord is going to deliver us from the negative things, bring us back to the original state of the church, and lead us to have a very simple church life.
[9]  Today if we want to realize the church life, we need to rid ourselves of all the foreign things in Christianity, forsake all the divisions, and be simple, general Christians, coming together in the place where we are, to worship God in Christ through the Spirit and to experience, exalt, exhibit, express, and preach Christ.
[10]  If they would begin to love the Lord more and would offer themselves to the Lord, the Spirit would have the ground within them and would be able to work in them and cause them to desire to take this way.
[11]  CHAPTER TWO THE WAY TO CONTACT THE LORD Scripture Reading: Rom 9:23; John 6:51; 7:37-38; 2 Cor 13:14; Matt 28:19; 1 Cor 15:45; John 20:22; 2 Cor 3:17; John 6:63 MAN CREATED AS A VESSEL TO CONTAIN GOD
[12]  God s central thought and eternal intention is to work Himself into us to become life to us and even to become everything to us.
[13]  We feel empty because we were made to contain God, and if we do not have God within us, we are merely empty vessels.
[14]  To believe in the Lord Jesus is not merely to believe that He is our Savior; to believe in the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into our spirit John 1:12; 2 Tim 4:22 .
[15]  When we believe in the Lord Jesus, God in Christ as the Spirit enters into our spirit and begins to dwell within us.
[16]  After we have believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him into us, we can be filled with Him by eating and drinking Him.
[17]  Since we have received the Lord into us, the question is, How do we partake of the Lord day by day and moment by moment as our food, drink, and life supply?
[18]  We will be able to fellowship and converse with the Lord continually, and as we do this, gradually we will be filled with the Lord until our whole being is full of the Holy Spirit.
[19]  Question: Is there some significance to spending this time with the Lord in the morning?
[20]  This happened because in the eighth year I was helped to learn how to contact the Lord in a living way by reading the Word prayerfully and praying to the Lord in a prevailing way.
[21]  If you ask me what has kept me pursuing and serving the Lord, I would say that it is this one matter contacting the Lord in a living way by reading and praying over His Word.
[22]  If the believers in a certain place would practice to contact the Lord in this way every morning and then would come together in the evening and on the Lord s Day to express, exalt, and exhibit the Christ whom they have experienced, they would become a most wonderful church.
[23]  We must contact the Lord in the morning and then come together in the evening and on the Lord s Day to fellowship with one another and to share the Christ whom we have experienced as an exhibition and a testimony to the whole universe.
[24]  CHAPTER THREE THE WAY TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT
[25]  Since our need today is to be filled and saturated with the Spirit, we must consider what we need to do in order to experience the Spirit.
[26]  The Lord s Word reveals that on God s side everything is ready.
[27]  I went to the meeting not to see the Lord but to see if anything strange would happen there, but when I got there, the Lord met me, and I was saved.
[28]  We must come to the Lord in a definite, purposeful way, not to pray for various things but to meet the Lord and to be met by Him.
[29]  Suppose a person who lives by the Lord, walks in spirit, contacts the Lord in his spirit, and is filled with the Holy Spirit were to come to a religious service in today s Christianity.
[30]  We received the Lord as our Savior and all-inclusive Lord, we fully received the gospel that had been preached to us, and we absolutely received everything in the Bible.
[31]  In addition to abandoning all the things that were foreign to the Scriptures, we knew that we also needed to pray.
[32]  We prayed much, and gradually the Lord began to lead us to go on in a new way.
[33]  One thing that we began to see was that when the Lord s children come together, they must bring something of the Lord with them to the meeting and offer something of the Lord to God.
[34]  For example, suppose there is a person whom you cannot love by yourself, but because you experience the Lord as love, you are empowered to love that person by, through, in, and with the Lord.
[35]  If day by day you experience Christ in many different ways, and all the other brothers and sisters do the same, when we come together, we will all have something of the Lord to bring with us.
[36]  You may come to the meeting with the Lord as your love and patience, I may come to the meeting with the Lord as my peace and joy, and another brother may come to the meeting with Christ as his rest and satisfaction.
[37]  When we come together, we can exhibit the Christ whom we have experienced, and we can offer our Christ to God.
[38]  The hymn may be an old hymn, but since we all have experienced Christ during the week, we can sing it in a new and living way, and as we sing, we can praise the Lord.
[39]  Question: You have mentioned how we should begin the meeting, but how should we end the meeting?
[40]  Answer: In principle, we should end the meeting in the same way that we begin the meeting according to the leading of the Spirit.
[41]  You love the Lord, and I love the Lord; you experience the Lord, and I experience the Lord.
[42]  As long as a person believes that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God, that He was incarnated to be a man, died on the cross, was resurrected on the third day, and is now in the heavens as our Redeemer, Savior, and Lord, that is good enough.
[43]  If we are faithful before the Lord to practice to have proper Christian meetings in a way that is truly spiritual and full of life, when others come among us, they will appreciate what we are doing and realize that it is of the Lord.
