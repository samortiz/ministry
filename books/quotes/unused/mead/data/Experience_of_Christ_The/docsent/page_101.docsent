   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Although the situation in Philippi was very good, unlike the situation in Corinth, there was still a problem because the saints there were not all thinking the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thus, Paul besought Euodias and Syntyche, two of his co-workers in the gospel, to think the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is possible that one of the sisters was in favor of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whether or not this was so, the fact remains that they were not thinking the one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the first chapter of Philippians, there was envy and rivalry even in the preaching of the gospel vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Surely this was an indication that some were not thinking the one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the reason that in chapter two Paul asked the saints in Philippi to make his joy full.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If there was any fellowship in spirit, any comfort of love, any compassion and mercy, they were to make Paul's joy full.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He wanted them to make his joy full by thinking the same thing, having the same love, and being one in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We all need to learn to think the one thing, that is, to be occupied with pursuing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not be concerned about foot-washing, head covering, speaking in tongues, or any other such matters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let us leave these things alone and think about the experience and enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to pray, "Lord, teach me how to persecute You.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I don't care for so many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I only care to pursue You."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not be troubled by things such as the playing of a tambourine in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Playing a tambourine is not our goal, prize, or enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our enjoyment, experience, goal, and prize are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If others want to play the tambourine, I shall not oppose it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After they play the tambourine for a certain period of time, there will eventually be an opportunity for me to share Christ with them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This illustrates the fact that we must all learn that for us there is simply one thing: Christ as our experience, enjoyment, goal, and prize.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not insist on anything, and we do not oppose anything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we take this way, we shall maintain a good spirit in the churches for the experience and enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to honor Christ and allow Him to do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not persecute Christ regarding things such as speaking in tongues, foot-washing, or playing the tambourine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead, persecute Him until He becomes your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to say, "Lord, it is not up to me whether or not Your people speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Lord, I persecute You so that You will be my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Lord, when the opportunity comes in the meeting, I would like to share with Your saints something concerning my experience of You."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the only thing we need to do.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us all do the same thing and think the one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not have any other consideration, and do not be bothered by all the different practices.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is only one thing for us to do: pursue Christ and let Him become our experience, enjoyment, goal, and prize.</S>
