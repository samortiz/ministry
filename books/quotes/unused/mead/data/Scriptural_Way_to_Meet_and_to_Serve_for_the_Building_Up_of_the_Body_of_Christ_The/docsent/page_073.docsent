   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE THE ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE GOSPEL VISITATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 12:2; Matt 28:19; Phil 1:21</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am very burdened that we see the absolute requirements for the gospel visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we hear the term door-knocking, we may think of some activity without gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Actually, however, preaching the gospel by visiting people is a very respectable matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, we have to practice our gospel visitation in a way that is full of respect and that is according to some absolute requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>BEING ONE WITH CHRIST AND</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>IN THE ORGANIC UNION WITH THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we want to go out to preach the gospel by visiting people through knocking on doors, we must be one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 2 Corinthians 12:2 Paul told us that he was a man in Christ, and in Philippians 3:9 he aspired to be found in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He wanted to remain in Christ all the time, doing things in Christ, acting in Christ, and living in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other words, he wanted to be one with Christ that people might see him in Christ, find him in Christ, and meet him in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was a person altogether in Christ and one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To go out to visit people for the gospel preaching, we need to be persons who are one with Christ and in the organic union with the Triune God Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have been baptized into the Triune God, and we have to remain in the organic union with this Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as we are persons in Christ and in the organic union with the Triune God, we are qualified to visit people for gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we go out to visit people for gospel preaching, we are authorized as the representatives of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A nation or a country authorizes ambassadors to represent it in their dealings with other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These ambassadors must be persons of regard, full of gravity, commanding people s respect.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should not go out to visit people in a common, ordinary, loose, or light way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to go out as the Lord s authorized representatives.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must be the ambassadors of Christ 2 Cor 5:20 , representing Him to go out to visit people and bring Him to people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>LIVING CHRIST IN THE DAILY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be persons who are always one with Christ and in the organic union with the Triune God, we need to live Christ in our daily life Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to make Christ our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Philippians 1:21, Paul said, To me to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all have to say this and practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Day by day, we need to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ is not only our life but also our living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since He is our life, He has to be our living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we live Him, we will spontaneously represent Him and have the proper gravity that will cause people to regard and respect us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>PRAYING INTO THE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>OF BEING ONE WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must also pray ourselves into the practical experience of being one with Christ Acts 4:24-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Regardless of how much we have been living in Christ, we are still in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our flesh still exists, and our natural man still lives.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we are living on this earth, there are many factors that cause us to be distracted away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because many factors in our daily life, in our family, in our home, in our place of business, in our school, or elsewhere unconsciously distract us from Christ, we need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This was the reason that the Lord Jesus charged us to watch and pray Matt 26:41; Eph 6:18; Col 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To watch and pray is to preserve ourselves in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to be watchful that we are not out of Christ and pray that we would be brought back to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Prayer always either keeps us in Christ or brings us back to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to pray ourselves into the practical experience of being one with Christ because we might be distracted from Christ and not be in Christ in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the spiritual and divine fact, we are in Christ all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But according to our daily, practical experience, quite often we are not in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then we have to pray ourselves into Christ again.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Prayer brings us into Christ and into the practical experience of being one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need this kind of practical experience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many times we have the sensation that we are not in Christ in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our talk, our doing, and even our purchasing of certain things prove that we are not practically in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Positionally we are in Christ, but experientially we may not be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, we must pray to preserve ourselves in Christ and also pray ourselves back to Christ when we are away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Before going out to visit people for the gospel, we must spend at least twenty minutes in prayer with the Lord to get ourselves back to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then we will go out for the gospel visitation one with Christ, and we will go out in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Acts 4:24-31 is an account of how the believers in the early church prayed themselves into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The disciples with the apostles in Jerusalem, being under the persecution and threat of the Jewish leaders, prayed together.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No doubt, their prayer kept them in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As they were praying, they were all filled with the Spirit outwardly, once more experiencing the outpoured Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As a result, they had the boldness to speak the word of God and even to testify to the very Jewish leaders who were persecuting them Acts 5:28-33 .</S>
