   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Father s Word and the Father s Words</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 6 says, They have kept Your word, and verse 8 says, For the words which You gave Me I have given to them, and they received them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In these verses we see in the Greek that the Father has two kinds of words: logos, the constant word, in verse 6 and rhema, the instant words, in verse 8.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Both the logos and the rhema are used by the Lord to impart eternal life to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The logos, the constant word, is always the same.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The written word in the Bible is the logos.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But when you read the logos, the Spirit will use a sentence, a phrase, or even a single word to inspire you, and that word will become the instant word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Take the example of John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As the written word in the Bible, John 3:16 is the logos.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One day, as you read this verse, the written word becomes the instant word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Suddenly the words, God so loved the world, stand out, and you say, Oh, God so loved me!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By this we see how the constant word becomes the instant word, how the logos becomes the rhema.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Both the constant word and the instant word, the logos and the rhema, are for imparting eternal life into the believers who receive these words.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Father s words are not mainly for teaching or instruction; they are mainly for imparting life into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the words, God so loved the world, stood out to you and you were inspired, saying, Praise God, You loved me, life was immediately imparted into you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You received the Father s life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Father s life is the Father s reality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we have the life of the Father, we also have the Father and enjoy the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Where is the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Father is in His life, for His divine life is the reality of the name Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we received the word of God, we were regenerated by that word 1 Pet 1:23 and became the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this way, God became our Father and we became the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord came to reveal to His disciples that God is the Father, the source of life, who intends to bring forth countless sons.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the Lord brought the word of God to His disciples, who, by receiving the word, became the reborn sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They became the sons of God, and God became their Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Consequently, they have the name of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now they can call God their Father because they have the life of God which makes them the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To Be Kept in the Father s Name a. By the Father s Life</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verse 11 the Lord said, And I am no longer in the world, and they are in the world; and I come to You.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Holy Father, keep them in Your name which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To be kept in the Father s name is to be kept by His life, because only those who are born of the Father and have the Father s life can participate in the Father s name.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Son has given the Father s life to those whom the Father has given Him v. 2 . They share the Father s name by being kept in it, and they are one in it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, the first aspect of oneness is the oneness in the Father s name by His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the World</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Son s believers are still in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They need to be kept, that is, separated, from the world that they might be sanctified, made holy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In verse 11 the Son prays that the Father, who is holy, will do this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By the Holy Father</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In verse 11 the Lord addresses His Father as Holy Father.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Father s life is a holy life, a life that is separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although we have this life, if we stay far away from the Holy Father, we shall have problems.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all need to be kept in the Father s name by the life of the Holy Father.</S>
