   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE EIGHT THE KING S ANOINTING 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 3:1 4:11 is concerned with the King s anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This section of the Gospel of Matthew is in three parts: the King recommended 3:1-12 , the King anointed 3:13-17 , and the King tested 4:1-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message and in the message following we shall deal with the recommendation of the King.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I. RECOMMENDED A. The Recommender</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Matthew chapter three covers the recommendation and the anointing of the King.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this chapter firstly the recommender of the King, John the Baptist, is himself recommended.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Matthew 3:1 says, Now in those days John the Baptist came.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Born a Priest</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John the Baptist was born a priest Luke 1:5, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the life-study of Genesis we saw that the birthright included three items: the double portion of the land, the priesthood, and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Reuben, Jacob s firstborn, should have received all three items of the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, due to his defilement, he lost the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a result, the double portion of the land went to Joseph, the priesthood, to Levi, and the kingship, to Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The main function of the priesthood is to bring the people to God, and the main function of the kingship is to bring God to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the Bible, the priests brought others to God so that they might obtain God s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The kings were those who represented God and brought God to others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, the kingship is the ministry that brings God to other so that they may gain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Through this traffic of coming and going, man and God, God and man, have real fellowship, true communication.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, man and God become one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the ministry of the priesthood and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first ministry in the Old Testament was the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Following the priesthood there was the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the books prior to 1 Samuel were on the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But beginning with 1 Samuel the second section of the Old Testament is on the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the book of 1 Samuel, Samuel represents the priesthood and David represents the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Samuel, the priest, introduced David, the king.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The priesthood introduces the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is the same in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are genuine priests, then we shall also become kings, for the priesthood always introduces the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First we are priests bringing others into the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we become kings bringing God to them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Every true evangelist is a king.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you are not a king, you are not qualified to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 28:18 and 19 the Lord Jesus, the King of the kingdom, said, All authority has been given unto me in heaven and on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Go therefore and disciple all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here the Lord told the disciples to go with His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who go with this authority are kings in the kingdom of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Without doubt He shares this authority with us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, we must go and disciple the nations, that is, preach the gospel to subdue the rebellious ones.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As we go to preach the gospel, we must be kings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many Christians do not know God s secret in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When you are burdened to preach the gospel, you must first carry out the function of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order to preach the gospel you must first go to God as a priest and bring others to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Through the priesthood you will be authorized and anointed, and then you will come out of God s presence to be a king.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The proper preaching of the gospel is the issuing of a kingly edict.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is the utterance of a kingly command.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Consider Peter s preaching on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although he was a young Galilean fisherman, he nonetheless was a king.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every proper evangelist must be a king.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have seen that the priest introduces the king.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The first occurrence of this was Samuel s introduction of King David.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Matthew chapter three we see another Samuel, John the Baptist, who was born a priest of the tribe of Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Matthew 3 testifies to the consistency of the Bible, for here we see one from the priestly tribe, the tribe of Levi, recommending One from the kingly tribe, the tribe of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Matthew 3 John appeared as Samuel and Jesus appeared as David.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There in the wilderness John was bringing people to God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, he was a genuine priest.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As he was bringing others to God, the King came, and John introduced Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This King brought God to man.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>John brought others to God, and Jesus brought God to them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As sinners we came to God through John s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By repentance we came into God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>That was the ministry of the priesthood, the ministry of John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We all have come into the presence of God through John.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It was John who brought us back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then the new King David, Jesus Christ, brought God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Through John s ministry of repentance and Jesus ministry of imparting life, we have all been made priests and kings.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today we are the continuation both of the priest, John the Baptist, and of the King, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If you are a proper Christian, then you are firstly today s John and secondly today s Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Young people, as you go to the campuses, you must be real priests.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You need to say, Lord, have mercy on these people.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>O Lord, remember all these young people.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I bring them to You.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the priesthood, the ministry of John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After you bring others to God, immediately, in a sense, you will become Christ bringing God to them so that they may gain God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is today s priesthood and kingship.</S>
