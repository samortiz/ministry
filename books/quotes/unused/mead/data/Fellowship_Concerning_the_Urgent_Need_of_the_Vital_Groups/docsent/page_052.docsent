   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED OF THE RECOVERY TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO GAIN THE INCREASE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the near future we will train the vital group members to go out to contact people with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I do believe that we will gain some people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>So, immediately we will all need to know how to nourish the newborn spiritual babes that they may be kept and preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After a short time, we will all need to bring these babes into our vital groups to perfect them through mutual teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although in the past we have baptized many people, our rate of increase has been very low.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the past eighteen years, since 1974, the number of local churches has increased substantially.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the present time there may be more than twelve hundred local churches on the earth outside of mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the number of members in many of the churches is quite small.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Southern California there are now forty-nine churches, and the total number of saints is approximately three thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that on the average, each church has only sixty members.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In spite of the increase in the number of churches, our rate of increase still has not been satisfactory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we must find a way to change our present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today in the Lord s recovery the greatest need, the primary need, is to gain the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A house cannot be built without materials.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to save sinners through the preaching of the gospel that they may become material for the building up of the church as the house of God 1 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In general, the rate of increase depends on the way we labor in the gospel, and also on the environment and the people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Russia, in a short time of approximately one year, two large churches have been raised up, one in Moscow and another in St. Petersburg.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There the rate of increase has been very high because the way has been somewhat right, the environment is very favorable, and the people are very suitable.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For a number of reasons the rate of increase in the United States has been much lower.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The rate of increase among the churches in Taiwan has been similar to that in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The churches in Taiwan have been in existence for more than forty years, yet the number of saints in the churches today indicates that the rate of increase has been lower than ten percent per year.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we mean business with the Lord for His recovery, we need to consider our present situation seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not be comfortable concerning the present situation of the Lord s recovery, especially regarding the matter of increase.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With the exception of Russia, the situation everywhere in America, in Europe, and in the Far East is about the same with regard to the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to be aware of the present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not allow ourselves to be drugged, thinking that the situation among us is so wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No doubt the recovery is wonderful, but some aspects of the recovery are not encouraging, especially the matter of increase.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is why in 1984 I went to Taiwan purposely to study this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I feel that in order for us to be rescued from our present situation, we definitely need the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The vital groups are a matter of life or death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From now on, none of us should act, move, or do anything in the meetings lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we speak, we must say something that is worthwhile, and we should say it officially.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Otherwise, we should remain silent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even when we are sitting still and are silent, we should do so in a stately manner, not in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do things lightly, how could we have the Lord s blessing?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to bring this matter to the Lord and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The recovery is not only yours or mine; it is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we all should consider it seriously as a matter of life or death.</S>
