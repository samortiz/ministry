We used flying on a jumbo jet as an illustration of the Lord as the way into God, saying that &#8220;Jumbo Jesus&#8221; is the way to the Father. Simply by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus we are brought by Him and in Him to the Father. After that message was given, a Chinese lady, who had been invited to the meeting by a friend, told us how she experienced Christ as the way to the Father. Before the meeting, she was an unbeliever. But as a result of the meeting, she believed in the Lord and called on His name. She testified that by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus she was immediately brought into the Father. She also said that this was much faster than any jumbo jet. I appreciated her testimony very much.<p>No matter how fast a jumbo jet may go, it still must travel a certain distance before it brings you to your destination. However, our &#8220;Jumbo Jesus&#8221; does not have to take us any distance at all, for He is both the way and the destination. This means that when we get into Him as the way, we arrive at the Father as our destination, because the Son is one with the Father. Therefore, to be in the Son is also to be in the Father. Once we are in Christ Jesus, there is no longer any distance between us and God. Hallelujah, because we are in Christ we are immediately brought into the Father! We in the Lord&#8217;s recovery can testify that this is not a mere doctrine-it is a spiritual fact. From experience we can testify that when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we are immediately in the Triune God in an experiential way. The Lord Jesus is the way for us to enter into God.<h2 class=head1>THE DISPENSING OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>Thus far, we have covered three signs found in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John: the sign of the Father&#8217;s house, the sign of the Son&#8217;s going and coming, and the sign of the way, the reality, and the life. With this message we shall begin to consider the fourth sign in these chapters-the sign of the divine Trinity, which is for the dispensing of the Triune God.<p>Many Christians treasure chapters fourteen through seventeen of John&#8217;s Gospel. But many readers have not seen that these chapters actually are on the divine Trinity. Of course, the entire Bible reveals the Triune God. Our God is triune: He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Although this revelation is found in the Bible as a whole, no other portion of the Word reveals the Triune God as fully as these four chapters do. As one who has been studying John 14 through 17 for more than fifty years, I can say that these chapters are deep, profound, and mysterious, far beyond our ability to understand fully. After years of study and experience I can say that these four chapters certainly are concerned with the Triune God. From God&#8217;s side, these chapters reveal how the Triune God dispenses Himself into the believers. From our side, these chapters reveal the way for us to enter into the Triune God, enjoy Him, experience Him, and possess Him. On the one hand, the Triune God is dispensing Himself into us; on the other hand, we may enter into Him, experience Him, enjoy Him, and possess Him.<p>Because chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John reveal the Triune God both from the aspect of His dispensing Himself into us and from the aspect of our experience of Him, these chapters are extremely crucial. The most vital point in these chapters concerns the Triune God Himself. Through my study I have found ten matters related to the Father, seventeen matters related to the Son, and eleven matters related to the Spirit. After giving a preliminary word in this message, we shall go on to consider in the messages following all the points related to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. As we shall see, these matters will require much further study.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_149.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_151.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John &nbsp; pg 150</div><br></body></html>
