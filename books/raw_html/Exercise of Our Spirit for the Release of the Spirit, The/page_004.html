 <h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: Should we use our mind to think before we begin to pray?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Many times when we go to the Lord, we are thinking. However, there is no need to think before we go to the Lord and pray. When we go to the Lord, we must forget about everything and simply go to Him to contact and deal with Him in a real way. We must learn to know nothing except that we are contacting the Lord in the spirit. Then when we come to the meetings, we must be active, positive, and living, and our spirit must be released. When our spirit is released, the Holy Spirit within us will automatically be released, and there will be a current flowing in the meeting. This will be a great help to all those in the meeting. This is what a Christian meeting must be like.</p>
<p><em>Question: How is the filling of the Holy Spirit that you are speaking of different from what people experience in the Pentecostal movement?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This matter is absolutely different from the experience in the Pentecostal movement. People in the Pentecostal movement do not actually care about the Holy Spirit. Instead, they are concerned with manufacturing and creating a certain kind of atmosphere in their meetings, which is wrong. Thus, we should not justify the Pentecostal way of meeting. However, neither should we justify the so-called fundamental meetings, which are utterly dead. We should not be like those who criticize the Pentecostal movement yet do not say anything to condemn the condition of the fundamental meetings. The Pentecostal meetings are too much to one extreme, and the fundamental meetings are too much to the other extreme. Many fundamental meetings are dead; there is hardly anything in them but death. We should not follow that way of meeting, nor should we pick up the Pentecostal way of meeting.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s eyes, death is much more defiling than sin. There are many types in the Old Testament that prove this (Lev. 11:39; 17:15; Num. 19:11, 13). Whenever someone in the Old Testament touched something that was dead, he had to be kept away from the sanctuary of the Lord for a certain number of days. However, although death is more defiling than sin, we are more sensitive to sin than to death. When we commit a sin, we immediately sense that we are wrong, but when we bring death into the meetings, we do not have the same sense. We must realize that God hates death and that death is the last enemy that the Lord must conquer (1 Cor. 15:26).</p>
<p>We do not agree with the Pentecostal way of maneuvering, manufacturing, and creating an atmosphere in a natural way. However, we must condemn even more the deadness of the fundamental way of meeting. We do not want to go along with either of these ways. Rather, we want to go along with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is living, moving, and acting all the time. Thus, when we come to the meeting, we must exercise our spirit to cooperate with Him.</p>
<p>Those in the Pentecostal movement do not take care of others&rsquo; feelings when they meet together. They simply act according to what they like and do not consider what others may think. This spoils the meeting. When we meet together, we must forget about everything and exercise our spirit. However, when we exercise our spirit and take care of the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit will automatically guide us to be considerate of others. This does not mean that we must be silent in the meetings; rather, we must be even more exercised in being considerate of others. We need to be flexible in order to have a proper Christian meeting.</p>
<p>According to the fundamental way of meeting, when we come to the meeting, we must wait for a certain time until we can begin the meeting. This is too formal and traditional. I believe that when the Christians met in the early days of the apostles, they also designated a certain time to meet together, but their meetings were not so formal. I believe that they met in a living way. We do not need to wait until the exact time to begin the meeting. We should simply come and exercise our spirit. If we arrive early, we should not sit and wait for the meeting to begin. Rather, we should exercise our spirit, and then the meeting will start in a spontaneous way, not a formal way. If a meeting is scheduled for eight o&rsquo;clock, we should arrive fifteen minutes early so that we can exercise our spirit and help others to do the same. Then the meeting will be living and not so formal and dead.</p>
<p><em>Question: Should we exercise our spirit by praying audibly, or should we exercise our spirit inwardly?</em></p>
<p>Answer: In the meetings it is better to pray audibly. However, this is not something legal. You may feel that you should pray quietly or silently, or you may feel that you should pray audibly so that others can hear. There should be nothing legal about the way we exercise our spirit.</p>
<p>For many years I have considered and studied the way in which Christians should meet. Several years ago I came to the conclusion that the so-called fundamental way of meeting is absolutely traditional and that the Pentecostal way is absolutely extreme. Thirty years ago I spent much time with those in the Pentecostal movement in order to study their way of meeting. I discovered that they were too extreme and that this hurts and damages the spirit. This way of meeting does not build up.</p>
<p>In the early days of the apostles the Christians did not meet together in the Pentecostal way or the fundamental way but in a flexible way. There were no forms or regulations, yet the meetings were very proper, orderly, living, and free. There was no program, formality, or bondage, and nothing was enforced, such as performing emotional activities. Rather, the believers came together and exercised their spirit. The meetings were very living; everyone had the freedom and liberty to release his or her spirit by singing a hymn, praying, reading a verse, or giving a short testimony. I believe that this is the way the early Christians met and that this is the proper way. If we would practice to meet in this way, our meetings would be uplifted.</p>
<p>The next time we go to a meeting, we should go with the sole purpose of exercising our spirit to worship and exhibit the Lord. We should forget about what time the meeting is supposed to begin and simply exercise our spirit. If we have the sense to pray silently, we should pray silently. If others have the sense to pray audibly, even loudly, we should exercise not to be bothered by that. This is the proper way to meet. We should even be familiar with many of the hymns so that there would be no need for someone to formally announce a hymn. If everyone knows a chorus, someone can lead everyone to sing it at the proper time. This breaks down the barriers and paves the way for the Holy Spirit to go on and have a free way to move. In such a situation everyone is very orderly and well-behaved and yet very living.</p>
<p>We must have a fire burning in our meetings so that when people come, they will be burned and will burn others. We should not have a meeting in which people come together, sit, and look at or listen to something. This is not the building up. We must have a meeting in which the Holy Spirit is released and in which we can be released. This kind of meeting will refresh, renew, release, and satisfy both others and ourselves. This is what the Lord needs, and this is what we need.</p>
<p>When I go to the meetings today, I do not focus on teachings because what I need is something living. When you invite me to a meal, what I care about is not the menu that you give me but the food and drink that you serve. What we should care about is giving others something to eat and drink. Whenever we come together to meet, our meeting should be living, a meeting in which the Holy Spirit moves and is released. This kind of meeting will bring others to the Lord. The unbelievers will be saved, the believers will be edified, nourished, strengthened, delivered, and enlightened, and the Spirit will be released. The Spirit is so rich; He will meet every need, even if there is no formal teaching. We must believe more in what the Holy Spirit can do than in what doctrinal teachings can do.</p>
