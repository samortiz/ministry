[2]  This book includes messages given during a conference held by Brother Witness Lee in New York City in the spring of 1975.
[3]  This message is the first in a series of several on the First Epistle of John.
[4]  This divine Person is what lies between God's creation in the beginning and God's building at the end. This life is the means or procedure through which God will accomplish His purpose.
[5]  Only here do we have a saying like this: "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us; That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us" 1 John 1:1-3 .
[6]  The purpose of this declaration is not that its hearers may have life, as is the case with the Gospel of John John 10:10 ; rather, it is that they may have fellowship with the apostles, whose fellowship "is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ."
[7]  If we are in the fellowship and allow that fellowship to bring us into God, there in the source God as light shines over us.
[8]  He tells us further how grace operated in him and for him in 1 Corinthians 15:10: "But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me."
[9]  CHAPTER TWO THE MYSTERY OF FELLOWSHIP Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:3, 5-10; 2:1-2; 4:13, 16b A CONTINUATION
[10]  It is clear from the first verse of 1 John that this Epistle is a continuation of the Gospel of John.
[11]  "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life" are the opening words of the Epistle, dealing, like John's Gospel, with the Word which was from the beginning.
[12]  Chapters fourteen and fifteen refer to this, where the Lord says, "In My Father's house are many abodes" 14:2 and "If anyone loves Me We will come to him and make an abode with him" v. 23 . "I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit" 15:5 . The abode means that we become God's dwelling and that He becomes ours.
[13]  This fellowship is what brings in the proper church life.
[14]  We do not necessarily have the church life by merely coming together as believers in Jesus.
[15]  As believers we all have some apprehension of the truth.
[16]  Until we are brought into God Himself, we may be under the shining of the light, but we are not in the light.
[17]  "If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin" v. 7 . To say that we apply the blood is an indication that we are not in the light, but rather avoiding it.
[18]  Because of this tendency of ours to remain under condemnation, 1 John 2 begins by telling us that if we sin, "we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world" vv.
[19]  CHAPTER THREE THE MYSTERY OF ABIDING Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:5-6, 24, 27-28; 3:6a, 24; 4:4, 12b-13, 15-16; 5:20; John 14:17, 20; 15:4a; 17:21
[20]  If we were totally unfamiliar with the Bible and its teachings, and someone came and said to us, "I am in God, and God is in me," we would probably think he was a mental case.
[21]  How can a man be in God and God in him?
[22]  We do not stop to consider what a mystery it is that God, the Person Himself, can actually abide in us and we in Him.
[23]  But a God who cannot be seen or touched or sensed is it not sheer superstition to claim that we are now in Him and that at the same time He is in us?
[24]  Over and over again, beginning with the Acts, the little word "in" is used to describe our relationship with the Lord.
[25]  "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus .But of him are ye in Christ Jesus" Rom 8:1; 1 Cor 1:30 .
[26]  "But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him" 1 John 2:27 .
[27]  We who have been born of God now have eternal life, are in the fellowship, and abide in God.
[28]  When we say that we abide in God and He abides in us, our concept of what "God" means and what "abiding" means may be somewhat vague.
[29]  When I was a young Christian, I found out that I had been crucified with Christ.
[30]  According to some books I read, when Christ was crucified, I was included in Him.
[31]  He is called the almighty God, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of life, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[32]  The proportions of the spices used is also meaningful.
[33]  CHAPTER FIVE THE MYSTERY OF THE ANOINTING 2 Scripture Reading: Exo 30:25-31; Psa 133; 1 Pet 2:5; 1 John 2:18-20, 22-24, 27 A MUTUAL ABODE
[34]  The central thought of the Bible is that God desires to mingle Himself with humanity, in order that man may become His dwelling place and that He may become a dwelling place to man.
[35]  God will be the abode of man, and man will be the abode of God.
[36]  When Moses said in Psalm 90:1, "Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations," he was declaring that the highest experience we as human beings can have is to experience God as our dwelling place.
[37]  How could this divine Being, who is pure, holy, and righteous, be one with us?
[38]  When Adam and Eve disobeyed God by partaking of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, they were in fear of the judgment to which God would sentence them.
[39]  No doubt many of you have to some extent experienced this, even though you may not have identified it as such.
[40]  Similarly, when we take in this Spirit by setting our mind upon Him, by walking according to Him, by staying attached to Him, we experience His salvation.
[41]  CHAPTER SIX THE MYSTERY OF THE DIVINE BIRTH Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1, 4a, 18 A FURTHER WORD ON THE ANOINTING
[42]  Here the matter of the divine birth is brought in. Then in chapter three, the first verse is, "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God." From here to the end of chapter five, this thought of divine birth is mentioned repeatedly, and the phrase "born of God" occurs a number of times 3:9; 4:7; 5:1, 4a, 18 .
[43]  " Every one that doeth righteousness is born of him" 2:29 .
[44]  Do not misunderstand and think that doing righteousness is a condition, or term, of being born of God.
[45]  The meaning here is that if you are born of God, you will surely do righteousness.
[46]  "Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God."
[47]  Now look at 4:7: "Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God."
[48]  Again, the meaning here is not that if we love others, we shall be born of God; rather, the evidence of our being born of God is that we love.
[49]  In the Gospel of John we have the key.
[50]  "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit" 3:6 .
[51]  The same one who wrote 1 John tells us in his Gospel, "As many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God" John 1:12-13 .
[52]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE MYSTERY OF THE DIVINE SEED Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:13, 24, 25; 3:15b; 4:4; 5:11, 12, 20, 16; Rom 8:2, 6, 10, 11 THE SEED OF LIFE
[53]  We have still another mystery in this short book of 1 John.
[54]  Previously we have covered the mysteries of life, fellowship, abiding, the anointing, and the divine birth.
[55]  "His seed remaineth in him" 1 John 3:9 tells us, meaning that whoever is born of God has the seed of God abiding in him.
[56]  This seed of the divine life and nature needs to grow.
[57]  To say that the Spirit of God who raised Jesus from the dead makes His home in you, is to indicate that you are giving more ground to Him as the indwelling Spirit.
[58]  He is the seed, the Person, and the eternal life which was from the beginning 1 John 1:1-2 .
[59]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE MYSTERY OF THE WATER, THE BLOOD, AND THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 1 John 5:6, 8-12; John 1:31-34
[60]  Since we have received God's life and nature as a seed of life within us, we have this wonderful Person abiding in us as the Holy Spirit, a living, moving, active One.
[61]  Once we see that we have been terminated, that God has chosen and redeemed us, and that He wants to bring to fruitfulness the life He has germinated in us, we shall cease from our doing.
[62]  CHAPTER NINE SEVEN ISSUES OF THE SEVEN MYSTERIES Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:13-17; 3:8; 4:4; 5:18-21; 2 John 9-11; 3 John 9-10
[63]  We have now finished the seven mysteries mentioned in 1 John: 1 life; 2 fellowship; 3 abiding; 4 the anointing; 5 the divine birth; 6 the divine seed; and 7 the water, the blood, and the Spirit.
[64]  If we are in the reality of these mysteries, there will be seven things which characterize us.
[65]  "And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ.
[66]  The doctrine of Christ is that Christ, the Son of God, was incarnated and, after thirty-three and a half years of living on this earth, was crucified in our stead, shedding His blood to redeem us; He was buried and arose from the dead to become the life-giving Spirit; today we have His blood and His Spirit.
[67]  The last issue is found in 3 John 9-10: "I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.
[68]  Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church."
