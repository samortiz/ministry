Even with Paul, the Lord Was Wary of His Exceeding Exaltation of Himself, So He Let Him Have a Thorn in His Flesh from Satan</H2><P>Even with Paul, the Lord was wary of his exceeding exaltation of himself, so He let him have a thorn in his flesh from Satan (2 Cor. 12:7). Concerning the thorn, Paul entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from him. Nevertheless, the Lord said to him, "My grace is sufficient for you" (v. 9). The Lord seemed to be saying, "Paul, I will not remove the thorn, because My grace is sufficient for you. I will give you sufficient grace." Why is it that Paul might be lifted up? It is because no one had ever seen a vision and revelation higher than that seen by Paul. Not only was he born on this earth, but he had also been down to the Paradise in Hades and even had been up to the third heaven. Because the visions and revelations which Paul received were so high, so great, and so many, the Lord, being concerned, permitted a thorn to be given to him in his body.</P><P>Now I am also afraid that the visions I have seen may be too high, so I pray daily, "O Lord, I humble myself at Your feet; I am a slave and You are the sovereign Lord. I am truly in fear and trembling, Lord." I am in fear and trembling that I may be lifted up. Sometimes when I receive numerous letters of appreciation, I am also afraid that people may regard me too highly. Therefore, be cautious; do not praise people carelessly. Your praise may damage them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. A New Convert Should Not Be an Overseer, Lest Being Blinded with Pride He Fall into the Judgment Prepared for the Devil</H2><P>Hence, the apostle Paul taught that a new convert should not be an overseer of the church, lest being blinded with pride he fall into the judgment prepared for the devil (1 Tim. 3:6). Here, new convert, literally, "newly planted one," denotes a person who has recently received the Lord's life but has not yet grown and developed in it. Blinded with pride literally means "beclouded with smoke." Pride here is likened to smoke that beclouds the mind, making it blind. This is a serious matter. When a person is proud, he follows Satan, and consequently he will be judged with him to suffer the judgment prepared by God for him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Always Remember That Humility Saves You from All Kinds of Destruction and Invites God's Grace</H2><P>Pride means destruction. Once you become proud, your family is destroyed; once you become proud, your married life is destroyed; once you become proud, your job is destroyed. Always remember that humility saves you from all kinds of destruction and invites God's grace for you (James 4:6). God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble. If you are humble, grace comes. If you are proud, grace goes away; you have hindered grace.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_033.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_035.html">Next</a> </body></html>
