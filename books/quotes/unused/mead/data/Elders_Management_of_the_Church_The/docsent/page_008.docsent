   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD'S AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order for the elders to know God's government, they must first know God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without authority, there is no government.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Government is absolutely a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How can there be government and administration without authority?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The matter of administration is a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the whole universe, God's administration hinges on His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever we mention the administration of a church by the elders, we should immediately have the concept of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today, however, due to the degraded background of Roman Catholicism on the one hand, and the so-called democracy of the age on the other hand, God's children do not like to hear about the matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once the matter of authority is brought up, immediately people question whether we are in Roman Catholicism or whether we are having a pope again.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It seems that among the Lord's children, once authority is mentioned, they cannot have a democracy anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some would even say that authority is now being assumed, as if authority is a matter to be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brothers and sisters, the Pope should be condemned, and autocracy should be condemned, but authority can never be annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to see that in the universe, there is God's administration, and there is God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No matter how much man talks about democracy in these days, everywhere in the universe you are met with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes, man has stretched the meaning of democracy to such an extent as to make it an excuse for lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet he still cannot overturn authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the whole world and among human society, in everything you see the matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the family there is authority, and in the school there is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In a business institution there is authority, and in the civil government there is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is not a place where there is no authority.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As a child, you have your parents as your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a citizen, you have the government as your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a student, there are the teachers and the principal above you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even when you walk on the street, the traffic policeman is an authority to you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the whole universe, everywhere you will touch authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But God's children are so bold today as to say that the church does not need authority and that everyone is equal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What a strange thing this is!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore we have to see that either we do not mention church administration at all, or we have to mention it by firstly touching the matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without authority, there is no administration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order for the elders to manage the church, on the one hand, they have to know God's government in the universe; on the other hand, they have to know God's authority in the universe.</S>
