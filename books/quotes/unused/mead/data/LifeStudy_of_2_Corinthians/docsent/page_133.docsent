   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CARED FOR BY GOD IN A MIRACULOUS WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From his study of the Old Testament, Paul realized that God takes care of His people s needs.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is able to feed His people in a miraculous way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There were more than two million children of Israel in a barren wilderness, in a wasteland where nothing grows.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The wilderness was not a place suitable for farming or ranching.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But throughout a period of forty years, God fed His people by miraculously raining down manna from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I do not believe that anyone can explain what manna was or where it came from.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But it is a fact of history that God fed His people with manna in the wilderness for forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It certainly was a miracle that more than two million people could survive in the wilderness for such a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Both the raining down of the manna and the application of the manna were miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul refers to this in 2 Corinthians 8:15 where, quoting Exodus 16:18, he says, He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to Exodus 16:18, an omer was used to measure the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Both those who gathered much and those who gathered little eventually had an omer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is God s heavenly balancing of the manna gathered by His people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No matter how many omers certain ones may have gathered, after the manna was measured, the result was that miraculously there was an omer for every person Exo 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the sixth day of the week, the children of Israel were allowed to gather a double portion of manna to provide a supply for the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But on other days of the week, they were not allowed to gather more than what they needed for one day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who tried to save manna for the next day found that it bred worms.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates that it is not God s principle for His people to save up something for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To save in that way is to be motivated by greed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No doubt, as Paul studied the Scriptures, the thoughts and concepts of the Scriptures entered into him, inspired him, and governed him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually these thoughts motivated him to write chapters eight and nine of 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In chapter eight he was encouraging even the poor saints to give to the needy ones in Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because he had a deep knowledge of God s economy, he had the courage to ask the saints to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this chapter Paul seems to be saying, You don t need to consider your poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Simply give to take care of the needy ones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, you do not take care of your own needs.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Your heavenly Father is the One who supplies your needs.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He supplies the manna, and in this way He takes care of you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I can assure you that you don t need to worry about the future.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because your future is under the care of the Father, I encourage you to give to the needy ones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In a miraculous way, the Father will send manna.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From the children of Israel s experience of gathering manna in the wilderness, we learn that our income is actually a kind of manna.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The supply of manna did not depend on the gathering by the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the contrary, it depended on God s raining.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If God had not sent down the manna, how could the children of Israel have gathered anything?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Their gathering of manna was altogether dependent upon God s raining of the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The principle is the same with your income.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You may think that your income depends on your working or on your job.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But who gave you that job?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The job was provided by God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But if you think that you obtained that job through your ability or education, God may cause something to happen in your company so that you lose your job.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then you may realize that your income does not depend on your ability, but depends on God s sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is very important for us all to understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we think that our income depends upon our education, ability, or skill, we are superficial and shortsighted.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>SOWING AND REAPING</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By using the illustration of sowing and reaping in chapter nine, Paul shows that God also uses natural law to feed His people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sowing and reaping are matters of natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To give is actually to sow.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But where do we get the seed used in sowing?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The seed is supplied by God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The source of seed is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to 9:10, He bountifully supplies seed to the sower.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not think that just because we sow seed, we are sure to have a rich harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, we need to pray, Lord, I have sown the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But whether or not I have a good harvest depends on Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The growth of the seed sown depends on God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If He changes the weather, what we have sown may not yield anything.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As a result, we would not have any food.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, we need to worship the Lord and say, Lord, even if my supply seems to come from reaping, the food is actually given by You.</S>
