   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Peter told us in his first Epistle that we have been regenerated through the living and abiding word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As fallen men, we were like withering grass and fading flowers, yet we heard the living word, which is abiding forever.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This living word brought the eternal life into us to regenerate us, and we received the eternal life for our daily enjoyment.</S>
