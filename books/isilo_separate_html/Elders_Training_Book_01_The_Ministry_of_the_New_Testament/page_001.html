<h2 class="head1">FOREWORD</h1>
<p>During February of 1984 over three hundred and fifty brothers from six continents gathered in Anaheim, California with Brother Witness Lee for a two week international elders&#8217; training. The messages that were released at that time are the contents of this four volume set. Book one presents the essential aspects of the ministry of the New Testament; book two sets forth the vision of the Lord&#8217;s recovery; book three covers the way to carry out the vision; and book four emphasizes other crucial matters concerning the practice of the Lord&#8217;s recovery.</p>
<p>Those of us that were in these meetings were deeply convicted of our need to be further enlightened by the Lord concerning God&#8217;s economy and concerning the intrinsic essence of the New Testament ministry which is for the carrying out of this divine economy. As the Lord&#8217;s recovery is continually spreading throughout the world, these messages are more than crucial and urgently needed. We believe that they will render a great help in preserving all the saints in the central lane of God&#8217;s economy, without any deviation, for the fulfillment of His eternal plan. Our hope and expectation is that these messages will become a governing and controlling vision for all in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. May we prayerfully consider all the points presented in these books and accept them without any preferences.</p>
