   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Christ as the Word of God in Three Forms 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Form of a Person Christ Himself</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This person is the Word, and we are His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must also be the word to those around us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spoken Word</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When He was prophesied by the prophets of the Old Testament and spoken by Christ with all His brothers as His members, the sons of God, it is the spoken word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Written Word</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the spoken word is written down, that which can constitute the Bible is the written word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>E. The Spoken Word Becoming Spirit and Life</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the word remains in us, it is the speaking of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When it is spoken by us and received by others, it becomes spirit and life John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When it remains in them, it is again the word, but when it is spoken forth by them through the Spirit 1 Cor 7:40 , it becomes spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this way Christ being the Word of God implies Himself as the word in the form of a person, the spoken word, and the written word the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All these define, explain, and express God as the revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ as the Word speaks for God through the creation, through the incarnation, through the Lamb, the Spirit, the ladder, and through the prophethood plus the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have a double status.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are prophets and sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Both statuses qualify us to speak for God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we speak, that is Christ speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Satan wants to prevent the believers from speaking for God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the meetings of the church, all the saints should be the speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our praising in the Lord's table meeting is also the Lord's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Recently in the church in Anaheim, we had a Lord's table meeting that was full of high speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We praised the Lord in this way: "Lord, when we touch the loaf, we touch Your mystical Body organically.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we touch the cup, we touch Your redeeming blood judicially.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We praise You that Your judicial redemption and organic salvation constitute us into Your Body, and this Body will consummate in the New Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have attended the Lord's table for over sixty years, but I never attended one as high as that one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to come out of our oldness and the traditions of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to drop our old concepts and our old, doctrinal language.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must learn the new language with the new vocabulary of the new culture of the Lord's present recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we will become living and refreshing, and others will be refreshed by us when we speak to them.</S>
