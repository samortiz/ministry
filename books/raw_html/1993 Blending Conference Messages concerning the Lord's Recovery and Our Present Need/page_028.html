<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>In the Son's Redemption and<br>His Constituting Us into His Inheritance</H2><P>Verses 7 to 12 of Ephesians 1 is another section, showing that we all have received redemption in the Son. Before we were redeemed, we were fallen sinners who were in the depths of sin and far away from God. That was our condition and position. But one day we believed into the Lord Jesus. God not only regenerated us but also redeemed us in Christ (v. 7). This means that He rescued us out of the depths of sin, brought us back to Christ, and put us into Christ. We were there in sin, but now through the Son's redemption, we are here in Christ. The little word in indicates an organic union. God's redemption has brought us out of sin and into Christ; now we are in an organic union with this wonderful, all-inclusive Christ.</P><P>When we remain in this organic union with Him, day by day He dispenses His divine element of life with all His riches into us to make us a treasure to God. We were sinners in sin condemned by God but today we are in Christ. Day after day by His secreting of His divine life into us, He makes us pearls, treasures, to make us God's inheritance (see Rev. 21:21, note 211, and Matthew 13:46, note 461&#151;Recovery Version).</P><P>There are two major items in the blessings of the Son. One is redemption and the other is our being made the inheritance of God (v. 11). Today we have become God's inheritance, and God is waiting to inherit us. God is not going to inherit sinners. He wants to make us a treasure for Him to inherit. This is why verse 18 speaks of the riches of the glory of God's inheritance in the saints.</P><P>These are the blessings God has given us in Christ. We were in sin, but now we are in Christ. Christ put us into Himself, and He is secreting His life element around us to constitute us pearls, a treasure, for His inheritance. This is the divine dispensing. The dispensing of Christ as life into us day by day makes us more and more a treasure. Then we all become God's inheritance. This section of the Son's blessings closes in verse 12 with the phrase "that we would be to the praise of His glory."</P>
