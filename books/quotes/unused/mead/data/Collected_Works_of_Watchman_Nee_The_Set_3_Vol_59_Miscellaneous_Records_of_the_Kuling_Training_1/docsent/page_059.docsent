   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE ULTIMATE EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF GOD'S AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE BODY OF CHRIST Date: June 25, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Place: Kuling Mountain INTRODUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today we will speak about the ultimate expression of God's authority and where it lies.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God is authority, and God also ordains authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In creating the universe God exercised His authority, and He instituted authority in the world, in human government, and in all human relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God also established a kingdom and instituted His authority in this kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God desires to manifest authority through Himself, through His kingdom, and through all human relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For God to manifest His authority is for Him to manifest Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, these institutions merely express the principles of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although there are many things in the world that enforce outward submission, man is not submissive at heart.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rebellion characterizes half of all human activities, while lip service characterizes the other half.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God has not fully secured the authority which He intends to build up in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His authority has not found the proper expression in all these areas.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's authority is not manifested in many human governments or human relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Mainly, God has received man's lip service.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many people submit to authority outwardly but not in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the reason God's plan is still not fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, God needs an instrument or institution to express His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This institution is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE PERFECT MANIFESTATION OF GOD'S AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God desires to express His authority through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many people do not realize that the church is a crucial and solemn institution.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God must carry out His will fully through the church; the church cannot afford any hindrance to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a man does not see the seriousness of this matter, he may presume the church to be nothing but a gathering of Christians, a society of brotherly and sisterly love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He may consider the church a mere gathering of men with the same faith or same love who cherish the same future hope.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, God has a different view toward the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In man's eyes the church is an organization, a gathering of men with kindred love, but God's view is different.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He considers the church to be the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God has made Christ the Head of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church is the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23 ; it is not merely the gathering of men with similar goals.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The relationship between Christ and the church in God's ordination is a relationship between the Head and the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No institution on earth can express the submission of the human body to its head.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The submission of the body to the head is the ultimate expression of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The union and harmony between the head and the body is altogether profound.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nothing manifests divine authority more profoundly than the submission of the body to the head.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is a possibility of dissolution in social relationships as between father and son, master and servant, and husband and wife.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, the body can never be detached from the head.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One cannot dissolve the relationship between the body and the head because this would deny the very existence of the life of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the bonds between husband and wife, father and son, and master and servant are broken, each can still exist.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This, however, is not true of the body and the head.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No submission, such as that of servants to masters, wives to husbands, or sons to fathers, can be as perfect as the submission of the members to the head.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The obedience of the ears and the eyes to the head is the most perfect obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Between the members and the head, there is authority, and there is life union; this relationship is living and organic.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even the most submissive person in the whole world cannot compare his submission to that which exists between the hand and the head.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As soon as the head decides, the hand acts.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The eyes do not need the head to tell them explicitly what to see; they do not need explicit commands to see.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The instant the head desires to see something, the eyes see it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is a oneness and submission that come out of an inward harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Body life is the ultimate and perfect manifestation of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God has not found such a total and ultimate manifestation of authority in the universe, the world, or any human relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He has to begin with the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>From this Body He intends to build up His system of authority in the universe, the world, and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God twice appointed a head in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The first, the original archangel of the universe, rebelled.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The second, Christ, accomplished God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God has established His authority in six spheres.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The first is the original universe.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The second is the present world.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The third is the kingdom of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then there is the church, which is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Fifth, there is the kingdom, and finally, there is eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Body of Christ is in the middle of these six spheres.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The first three spheres are linked to and ushered into the future kingdom through the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Satan rebelled, and the world as well as the kingdom of Israel have failed God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The church, however, as the Body of Christ, will bring in God's system of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After the Body of Christ there is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After the kingdom, the entire universe will belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The first three attempts of God's work failed, but the last three moves will succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the middle there is the transition, or the turning point, which is the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We are not here to engage in exegesis or Bible study.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Our intention is not merely to understand the doctrines of the Bible but to be those who echo God's heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We have to realize the importance of our position.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God has given us the highest place and the greatest honor.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>No other group of people is as blessed as we are, and no other group has as much expectation and hope as we have.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>However, this means that God's demand for the church is much higher.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we do not see authority, we are basically unqualified to meet God's demand, and there is no way for us to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Privately, I have been praying, "God, open my eyes to see what the church is."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God's church is a group of people who bear the responsibility of expressing God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>God has bestowed this honor upon us for the purpose of accomplishing His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If authority is not manifested among us, we have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If we do not settle this issue among us, it will not be settled in any other place.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The whole church bears the responsibility of expressing God's authority before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>All of us have to bear this responsibility.</S>
