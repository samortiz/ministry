   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. To Be Separated unto God Positionally</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order for us to be holy, we first need to be separated unto God positionally.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>With respect to our family, neighbors, colleagues, and friends, we need to be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many Christians, however, are saved, but not separated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Normally, once a person is saved, he should also be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the reason a believer is called a saint.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Consider the majority of Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are virtually the same as the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With them, there is no separation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many of their relatives and friends do not even know that they are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But to be holy is to be separated unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This, of course, is a matter of position.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By the Redeeming Blood of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have been separated unto God by the redeeming blood of Christ Heb 9:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But we cannot see the power of the blood of Christ in many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All Christians believe that they have been redeemed, but in some there is no sign of the redeeming blood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The sign of the blood is a sign of separation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you have been redeemed by the blood, then you should bear the sign of separation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Others may be free to say or do certain things, but you are not.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even if you can do those things, you refrain from doing them because you have been redeemed by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>With you there is a sign that you are different, separated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Other people may utter certain words, go certain places, or buy certain things, but we cannot because we are separated and bear the sign of the redeeming blood.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The blood has sanctified and separated us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We also are separated unto God by the Holy Spirit 1 Cor 6:11; 1 Pet 1:2; Rom 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because the power of the Spirit overshadows us, we cannot use certain words, go to certain places, or do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But this does not mean that we are under regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No, it simply means that we are under the redeeming blood and in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Name of the Lord Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have a sanctified position, not only by the blood and by the Spirit, but also in the name of the Lord Jesus 1 Cor 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because we bear the name of the Lord Jesus, we should not shame His name by being common.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Others may go to sporting events or to the movies, but we would not go because we do not want to shame the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His name must keep us separate.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not ask whether a certain thing is sinful or not sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Separation is not related to whether or not something is sinful; it is a matter of whether we are common or separated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must bear some sign that we are under the blood, in the Spirit, and in the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Admittedly, separation is not a very deep matter; it is merely positional.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But do not think that position is unimportant.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It means a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have a position as saints, as separated ones, and we need to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before Justification</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to doctrine, this aspect of sanctification comes before justification 1 Cor 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Positional sanctification precedes justification, but dispositional sanctification follows justification.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before we are justified, we are sanctified by the blood, by the Holy Spirit, and in the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
