   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A WORD OF FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING BROTHER T. AUSTIN-SPARKS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our relationship with Brother Austin-Sparks was not based on the ground of the church; rather, it was based on spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We were clear concerning the Lord s desire for us in the East; we also felt that we should receive a supply from other ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even though other ministries might not have a clear ground, position, or background, they do have a portion in the spiritual ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This principle applies to those who are alive and to those who have passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Madame Guyon, for instance, had a spiritual ministry, but she was a Catholic.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The fact that she was in Catholicism should not be a reason for us to reject the spiritual supply from her portion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, this does not mean that we will receive the things of Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to this principle, we should receive the supply from Dr. F. B. Meyer, Andrew Murray, and Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We received all the spiritual riches that we could find in the books written over the centuries, whether they were related to the gospel, life, or truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, we rejected their stand, that is, the organization they represented, because it did not correspond with our testimony and would even damage our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Brother Nee fellowshipped with Brother Austin-Sparks concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brother Nee also did his best to receive the spiritual help from Brother Austin-Sparks group, but the ground of the church was not a factor in our relationship with Brother Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason, Brother Nee said that Brother Austin-Sparks was not as clear as we were related to the ground of the church, and we did not ask Brother Austin-Sparks his position concerning the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>OUR ATTITUDE TOWARD BROTHER AUSTIN-SPARKS</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brother Austin-Sparks group in London has left the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, he is clearer in his standing than Andrew Murray and more advanced than Dr. Meyer or Mrs. Penn-Lewis.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, on the positive side, he is nearly irreproachable.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the negative side, however, he is not as definite as we who are in the East.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We saw that the ground of the church is unique and that there should be only one church in one locality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We were very clear concerning this point from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even though we differ from Brother Austin-Sparks regarding the ground, this did not cause us to reject him or his spiritual supply.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our attitude was to receive the spiritual supply from all the ministries the Lord has given to His church over the centuries, regardless of their standing or background.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We would not be affected by their background.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since Brother Austin-Sparks view differs from ours related to the ground, Brother Nee said that the time had not yet come to invite him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not only so, Brother Austin-Sparks also has a certain spiritual influence on others; hence, if we had invited him to China, it would have caused a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was not until later that we understood this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am mentioning this so that we can see our testimony and the proper attitude we should maintain regarding this testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>PROBLEMS BROUGHT IN THROUGH</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>BROTHER AUSTIN-SPARKS SECOND VISIT TO TAIWAN</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brother Austin-Sparks first visit to Taiwan was for our spiritual supply.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It did not cause any problems because we did not touch the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It was a very pleasant time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His second visit, however, caused us much grief.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brother Austin-Sparks should have maintained the attitude of ministering a spiritual supply and should not have touched the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If he had done this, there would not have been any problems.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, in his second trip Brother Austin-Sparks overstepped the boundary of his ministry and not only inquired concerning the practice of the church ground but also interfered.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A brother suggested that perhaps I misunderstood Brother Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I had also hoped that it was a misunderstanding and that Brother Austin-Sparks did not oppose us on this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>During his visit a number of saints began to waver, considering that it was not necessary to pay attention to the ground but that it was sufficient to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This proves that it was not a misunderstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brother Austin-Sparks reprimanded us openly, not just in private conversations.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In a meeting he openly said, You limit Christ to a locality and thus make Christ a small Christ and the church a small church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This word proves that he insisted on his view.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This was the problem we encountered.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should be clear concerning the testimony the Lord desires us to keep in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We thank the Lord for anyone among us who is powerful in the gospel for the salvation of souls.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, we will be troubled if you act or speak in a way that affects the ground and our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As long as what you do does not affect this testimony and the ground, you can exercise your portion, and we will welcome you and regard you as a co-worker, a dear brother or sister.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are not narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For example, there was a sister in Hong Kong who did not see the ground but had spiritual fellowship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This sister had a burden to serve the Lord in the East.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because she wanted to be with a group of God s children whom she considered to be pleasing to God s will and who were spiritual, she chose us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Her joining us was related to the spiritual supply, not the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We, therefore, received her as our co-worker even though she was not clear concerning the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is because, spiritually speaking, she truly was our co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>She did not interfere with our practice concerning the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>She endeavored to exercise her portion so that the brothers and sisters could be edified.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We recognized her supply, and we did not compel her to be one with us concerning the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>She did not have problems with us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, she needed to be clear that she joined a group of brothers and sisters who were standing on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They were united on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even if the leading ones among them turned away to love the world, they would still take this way, because this is the way the Lord desires.</S>
