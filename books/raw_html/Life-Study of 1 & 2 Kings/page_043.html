<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE REIGN OF ASA OVER JUDAH</H2><P>Verses 8b through 24a speak of the reign of Asa over Judah.

Reigning for Forty-one Years in Jerusalem</H2><P>Asa began to reign over Judah in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel and reigned for forty-one years in Jerusalem (vv. 8b-10a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Doing What Was Upright in the Sight of Jehovah<br>with a Perfect Heart All His Days</H2><P>Asa did what was upright in the sight of Jehovah with a perfect heart all his days, as David his forefather had done. Asa put away the male cult prostitutes out of the land and removed all the idols that his forefathers had made. He also removed his grandmother Maacah from being queen mother. She had made an abominable image for Asherah, but Asa cut it down and burned it at the brook Kidron (vv. 11-14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Bringing Sanctified Things<br>into the House of Jehovah</H2><P>Asa brought into the house of Jehovah the things his father had sanctified and also the things that he himself had sanctified to God (v. 15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. War Being Waged between Asa<br>and Baasha King of Israel All Their Days</H2><P>War was waged between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. Asa made an alliance with Ben-hadad, the king of Syria, in order to overcome Baasha (vv. 16-22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Being Diseased in His Feet in His Old Age</H2><P>Asa was diseased in his feet in his old age. He slept with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of David (vv. 23-24a).</P>
