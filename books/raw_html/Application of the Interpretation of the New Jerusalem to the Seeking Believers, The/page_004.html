<h2 class=head3>3. The Human Wife of the Redeeming God</h2><p>According to its humanity, the New Jerusalem is the human wife (with the divine life and nature) of the Lamb— the redeeming God (21:2, 9). This human wife can marry a divine Person because she has the divine life and nature. This qualifies her to match the redeeming God. On the one hand, she is human. On the other hand, she is divine. Because she is human, she can be the redeeming God’s human wife. Because she is divine, she can marry Him, a divine Person.<h2 class=head3>4. The Divine Husband of God’s Redeemed Elect</h2><p>According to its divinity, it is the divine Husband (the redeeming God in His consummated embodiment, Christ, with the human life and nature) of God’s redeemed elect. The wife is human, and the Husband is divine. How can a human wife marry a divine Person? Because she has the divine Person’s divine nature and life. How can the same entity also be a husband? Because the New Jerusalem is divine. The divine God is a part of its constituent. Therefore, on the one hand, it is a wife. On the other hand, it is a husband. The New Jerusalem is the wife according to its humanity and the husband according to its divinity. But as the divine Husband, the New Jerusalem has the human life and nature. In its humanity and in its divinity it is both a mutual abode and a couple, a wife and a husband.<h2 class=head1>II. ITS BASE</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Pure Gold</h2><p>The base of the New Jerusalem is pure gold, signifying the divine nature of God as the base for its building (21:18b). The New Jerusalem is a golden mountain. Because we are the constituents of this New Jerusalem, we must be gold. We were made of dust, but when we received Christ as our life, we were regenerated into gold. In regeneration we received the divine life, the golden life. In the old creation, represented by Adam, we were dusty men, but when we were regenerated, we became golden men.<h2 class=head2>B. The Solid Foundation of Its Throne for the Divine Administration</h2><p>The base of the New Jerusalem is the solid foundation of the divine throne for the divine administration (22:1b). The river of water of life, signifying the Spirit, proceeds from this administration in the middle of the New Jerusalem’s street as the supply to the entire city (v. 1a). In the river grows the tree of life, signifying Christ, as the main supply to the entire city through the river (v. 2). The divine and human communication, signified by the street, proceeds from this glorious center to reach all twelve gates of the city, in order to bring the entire city into the submission to the one divine administration and to blend the entire city into the oneness of the one divinity-mingled-with-humanity communication, fellowship (21:21b).<p>The throne on which God reigns is the center of the glory of the New Jerusalem. It signifies God’s ruling, God’s reigning. A street comes out from the throne. This street connected to the throne is for communication and mainly for the throne’s administration. The divine ruling has the divine administration.<p>On the street there is the traffic, the going and coming. First, the street is for God’s going and coming, which are for God’s administration. Eventually, this street becomes a “fellowship street.” This fellowship is between the redeeming God and His redeemed people. The redeeming God and His redeemed people must have going and coming fellowship. Not only so, God’s redeemed people must have going and coming fellowship among themselves.
