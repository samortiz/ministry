   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH The Power of Resurrection Being Deposited</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Church and Operating in the Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us move on to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church is where the Lord is the Head and we are the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is the relationship between the church and resurrection, and what is the relationship between the church and the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ephesians 1:19-20 speaks of the surpassing greatness of His power which God caused to operate in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church is the place where God demonstrates the operation of the might of His strength, according to the power which He caused to operate in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to pay attention to the words according to.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They mean that God is causing the same degree of might and strength that operated in Christ to now operate in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who have might do not necessarily have strength, and those who have strength do not necessarily have might, but here we have "the might of His strength."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The same might of strength which God caused to operate in Christ is now similarly operating in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church can now experience the same might and strength that the Lord experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church is the same as the resurrected Lord not only in nature but also in power.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If this were not so, everything about the church would be vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Just as God broke through all barriers in the Lord, He is breaking through all barriers in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the church should be the same as the resurrected Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It should be as powerful, as free, and as unfettered by any limitation as the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Otherwise, it cannot be called the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The might of God's strength not only operated in Christ, but it continually operates in the church as well.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today the church is the depository and storehouse of the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Anything less than this will not do.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, this might and strength cannot be anything less than they should be.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Following verses 19 and 20, verse 22 says that God has not only caused Christ to rise from the dead and to transcend all things but that He has also "subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is resurrected, and He is in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is no longer a humble Nazarene, but the victorious Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All things are under His feet today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Lord was on earth, He was a perfect man, but He was not yet the Head of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was the Head but not the glorified Head.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At that time death was not yet totally annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many Bible teachers in their foolishness insist on finding the church in the four Gospels, but no one can find the church in the four Gospels, because Jesus in the four Gospels was a limited man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If there was only this first portion of the Word, the church would only be a limited and finite institution.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may think that the Lord's power and authority on earth were great enough, but God said that this was not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He had to pass through death and resurrection, and the Holy Spirit had to come before He could commit the power of resurrection to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today the church has received this power supply from the ascended and glorified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, there is no problem that the church cannot solve and no temptation that the church cannot overcome because the power of the church is the resurrection power of Christ, the same power that subjected all things under His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is no less than the very power that operated in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the Lord was on the earth, there was no church, because Christ was not yet resurrected; everything was bound.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church was produced after Christ rose from the dead, ascended to the height, and poured forth the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church became the Body of Christ after the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church is filled with all that He is; it is the very vessel which holds the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the meaning of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord Jesus has passed through everything and has inherited everything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Nevertheless, He is only the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church is His Body; it bears His characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church is what Christ is in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Just as Christ is unlimited, the church is also unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Nothing can match the relationship between Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The body is the best analogy because the head and all the members share the same life and bear the same characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If I make a chair, I can make it without one leg, but the Body of Christ cannot be short of a leg.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Holy Spirit Manifesting</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>the Resurrection Power of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>through the Church</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We believers were given to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This Spirit constitutes us the one Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, when two persons on earth touch the resurrection of Christ, whatever they bind will be bound and whatever they loose will be loosed Matt 18:18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The minimum number for the church to function is two.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If two persons touch the power of resurrection and stand on resurrection ground, everything will have to obey them and go along with them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the past the church did not know this.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Perhaps we have to go through many years before we experience this, but now we know what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Once we know the church, all problems go away in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We might have had a hard problem in the past which we could not overcome personally.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Now our problems are settled in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today the church is the depository of the resurrection power of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What is the Holy Spirit doing today?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He is manifesting the resurrection power of Christ through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All the problems are over now.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord said that the gates of Hades cannot prevail against the church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Personally, I believe that the gates here refer to all the gates of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They are all open to the church, and they cannot prevail against the church because Hades represents death, and the church represents resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is the reason the church is victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whether or not the Lord has a way on earth today is not a matter of changing our behavior or knowing some truth.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Some must be ready to pay the price to know resurrection, to know the Holy Spirit, and to know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When we know these things, the church will have a glorious testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Practically speaking, every one of us has touched a little resurrection at one time or another.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Personal salvation is an example of the operation of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But the power of resurrection can do more: A man is able to suffer for the Lord or even to die and be martyred for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>First Corinthians 15 speaks of the truth of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Verse 58 concludes with us abounding in the work of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The power which sustains us in such a work is the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>A man also can bear the cross, receive spiritual training, see light, and be sanctified through the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Throughout the last two thousand years this truth has been released a little here and a little there.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Today the truth is revealed in its present advanced stage.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is a great thing when a person stands on resurrection ground today.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I feel that we have not seen enough of the Lord's resurrection today.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He is powerful to subdue everything and to transcend everything.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Yet by Himself He is only the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The amazing thing, however, is that the Lord wants to become one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This corporate man is not limited by anything; he is able to manifest God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is too great a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Unless we know this revelation and bear this testimony, we cannot make any progress.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We will save ourselves much time and energy if we receive some light from the Lord and have our eyes opened to this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>May the Lord be merciful to us and open our eyes to see resurrection, the Holy Spirit, and the church.</S>
