<p>Matthew 5:27 through 32 concerns lust. In verses 27 and 28 the Lord said, &ldquo;You have heard that it was said, &lsquo;You shall not commit adultery.&rsquo; But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.&rdquo; The Old Testament law demands that man not act on lustful thoughts outwardly, but the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens demands that man not have lustful thoughts inwardly. A person under the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens must not only abstain from lustful conduct but also from lustful thoughts. Therefore, this demand is also more complete and perfect than the demand of the Old Testament law.</p>
<p>The Lord warned that if the sin of lust is not properly dealt with, a person is in danger of being cast into Gehenna. If our eye sins, we should deal with our eye, and if our hand sins, we should deal with our hand. We must not tolerate our sinning members. Verses 29 and 30 say, &ldquo;If your right eye stumbles you, pluck it out and cast it from you...If your right hand stumbles you, cut it off and cast it from you&rdquo; (vv. 29-30). This does not mean that we should literally pluck out our eye or cut off our hand. On the night that the Lord was betrayed, Peter sinned by cutting off the right ear of the slave of the high priest with a sword, but the Lord did not cut off Peter&rsquo;s hand (John 18:10-11). To pluck out an eye or cut off a hand is equivalent to putting to death our members according to Colossians 3:5, which says, &ldquo;Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth.&rdquo; This means to put to death the sinning function of the eye and of the hand. Any member of the body that has a sinning function or sinning activity should be put to death. This is also spoken of in Romans 8:13: &ldquo;By the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body.&rdquo; If we continue to sin in our thoughts and deeds instead of putting to death the sinning function of the members of our body by the Spirit, we will suffer dispensational punishment through fire, being salted with fire (Mark 9:49), so that the corruption within us may be eliminated.</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:31 and 32 the Lord spoke concerning divorce. The Old Testament law says that divorce is permitted with a certificate of divorce, but the kingdom of the heavens forbids divorce. Divorce indicates that the matter of lust has not been dealt with. People have anger and lust but do not deal with them. Therefore, the Lord spoke of dealing with anger and lust as requirements of the kingdom of the heavens. If we are able to accept the heavenly rule concerning anger and lust, most of our sins and wrongdoings will be dealt with. There are not many sins that a person would commit if he does not have the elements of anger and lust. Man&rsquo;s sins are the issue of his temper, temperament, flesh, and disposition. These elements involve anger and lust. To deal with anger and lust is to deal with one&rsquo;s temper, temperament, flesh, and disposition. The demand of the kingdom of the heavens is that we deal thoroughly with our temper, temperament, flesh, and disposition.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING WORDS</h2>
<p>Verses 33 through 37 are related to our words. The Old Testament law requires man to keep his oaths (v. 33). The kingdom of the heavens, however, requires that we not even swear. A person swears when others do not believe his word. He swears so that others will believe him. The Old Testament law allowed man to swear an oath so that he would not be dishonest or irresponsible with his words. People swore an oath to show that they were responsible. Therefore, the Old Testament law required that people not break their oaths (Num. 30:2).</p>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens requires that we not even swear: &ldquo;Let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no&rdquo; (Matt. 5:37). It is up to others to believe; we do not have to swear in order to persuade them to believe. If we live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, we must be simple and honest; there is no need for pretense. If we have learned the lesson of the kingdom of the heavens, we will not need to convince others to believe us with an oath. This type of speaking differs from giving a message in a meeting. When giving a message, a brother tries his best to explain things clearly in order for others to understand. Generally speaking, we do not need to speak much, nor do we need to convince people to believe us.</p>
<p>In verses 34 through 36 the Lord said, &ldquo;I tell you not to swear at all; neither by heaven, because it is the throne of God; nor by the earth, because it is the footstool of His feet; nor unto Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King; neither shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black.&rdquo; This word shows our smallness in the universe. Neither heaven, the earth, nor Jerusalem is ours. Even the growth of our hair is not under our control. Nothing is in our hand or under our control. Therefore, we are not qualified to swear by anything.</p>
<p>In verse 37 the Lord said, &ldquo;But let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no; for anything more than these is of the evil one.&rdquo; Therefore, we must be careful, because Satan can be behind our words. Those who are experienced in spiritual warfare know that in order to engage in spiritual warfare, they must speak carefully and not leave any loopholes for Satan&rsquo;s attack. Satan is able to work in the churches and attack the churches because many people are not careful with their words and speak too much. When we speak too much, we provoke Satan&rsquo;s attack.</p>
<p>Concerning our words, the kingdom of the heavens requires us to be simple and honest; we should neither say too much, nor should we swear in order to persuade others to believe us. Rather, we should realize that we have no standing. This demand requires that we deal with our temper and our self, because those who have a temper and the self speak many words. The kingdom of the heavens demands that we deal with our temper and the self in relation to our words.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Living and Principles of the Kingdom People &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
