   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"Whoever loses his soul-life for My sake."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is the denying of the self and taking up of the cross spoken of above.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To lose the soul means the same as denying the self.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord reckons that if a man is willing to forsake all the pleasures of the soul for His sake and suffer according to God's will, he "shall find" his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that whoever is willing for the Lord's sake to forsake his own mind and what he takes pleasure in, to prohibit his heart from finding satisfaction in the things of the world, and to endure much pain and suffering, the Lord will cause him to gain what his heart takes pleasure in, obtain satisfaction, enjoy blessing, and become happy at another time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After reading the above verse, we know what the meaning of the salvation of the soul is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This verse shows us that salvation of the soul means to make the soul happy, to follow what the heart desires, and to gain satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Losing the soul means to deprive the self of happiness, not following what the heart desires, and not having satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, to lose the soul is definitely not what we usually refer to as perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord Jesus shows us that saving the soul means to be unwilling to deny the self or take up the cross, and losing the soul means to be willing to deny the self and take up the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is obvious that this is not related to what we commonly know as salvation or perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If saving the soul means gaining eternal life, why does the Lord Jesus say that one should lose the soul for His sake?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If losing the soul means going to the lake of fire, is it conceivable that the Lord Jesus wants us to go to the lake of fire for His sake when He told us to lose our soul?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, this verse does not refer in the slightest to the matter of gaining eternal life and going to the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Losing the soul in the first part of the verse must mean the same as losing the soul in the second part of the verse.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we take "whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it" to mean that whoever does not deny himself shall go to the lake of fire, then the next part "whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it" would have to mean that whoever goes to the lake of fire for His sake shall find eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is absurd.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, the meaning is simply that if a saved Christian will not let his soul all his senses suffer, his soul will certainly suffer in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If he is willing to let his soul suffer for the Lord's sake, in the future his soul will certainly not suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, if saving the soul means gaining eternal life and losing the soul means going to the lake of fire, what the Lord Jesus says here is not connected to what went before.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This word was spoken to the disciples who had eternal life already.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, a non-Christian could never deny himself, take up the cross, or follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the Lord wanted them to gain eternal life, the Lord would certainly have told them to believe; He would definitely not have told them to deny the self in order to gain eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only one who has already gained eternal life possesses the possibility of denying the self, taking up the cross, and following the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What a sinner, who is without eternal life, should do is not follow the Lord, but believe in Him so that he can gain eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul-life?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our Lord continues to speak of the unprofitability of a man losing his soul through saving it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He means that if a man does not deny himself, take up the cross, and closely follow Him, but acts according to the pleasure of his soul in order to give satisfaction to his soul, even to the extent of gaining the whole world, a time will come when he will lose his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A momentary saving of the soul with the result of losing it in the end is unprofitable in the Lord's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although a man can gain much happiness through going after his own desires, the Lord says that in the end he will lose his soul and lose all happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to the Lord, gaining the soul at the end is much better than gaining the soul at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He says that there is nothing a man can exchange for the satisfaction of the soul at the end. This means that a man should lose his soul beforehand rather than to lose it at the end.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord tells us that whoever will save his soul will lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At what time will he lose it?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a man saves his soul now, when will he lose it?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord says that whoever loses his soul for His sake will find it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When will this be?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To answer this question, He goes on, "For the Son of Man is to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each man according to his doings."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"His doings" means his deeds in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"His doings" can be divided into two aspects: the saving of one's soul in this life and the losing of one's soul for the Lord's sake in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To "repay each man according to his doings" is to cause those who save their soul to lose it and to cause those who lose their soul for the Lord's sake to find it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the Lord's word, when will he who saves his soul lose it, and when will he who loses his soul for the Lord's sake find it?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He says that it will be at the time of His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, we need to see clearly that if a man cares for himself now, makes himself happy, and is not willing to suffer for the Lord, at the Lord's coming, he will be rebuked by the Lord, not obtain the Lord's glory, and may even weep and gnash his teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a man is willing to forsake his rights now, be totally separated from the world, and faithfully submit to the will of God, at the time of the Lord's coming he will win the praise of the Lord, enjoy the joy of the Lord, and be fully satisfied in his heart and mind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord's coming and His repaying particularly refer to His kingship in the kingdom because after the Lord tells us of His coming, He tells us where His coming is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 28 says, "The Son of Man coming in His kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, the Lord means that when He comes to earth to be king for a thousand years, some shall reign with Him, but some shall not.</S>
