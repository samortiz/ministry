It is a short but deep hymn that was composed by Alexander Carruthers, probably a Brethren writer who lived during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Even though this writer did not use the terms economy or dispensation, by reading his hymn, we can tell that he saw something concerning God\u2019s economy. "}]}
