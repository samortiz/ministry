        <h2 class="head1">THE NATURE OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE</h2>
<p>The first section of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching in Matthew 5 through 7 concerns nine blessings that the people of the kingdom of the heavens possess. Most Christians speak of the eight Beatitudes when they come to this section, but there are in fact nine blessings.</p>
<p>Although the Lord began this teaching with nine blessings, He was not merely emphasizing blessings. Rather, He was emphasizing the kind of people who are in the kingdom of the heavens. These nine blessings describe the people in the kingdom of the heavens and their nature. Whoever has these nine blessings is blessed, because these blessings prove that he is living in the kingdom of the heavens. We need to ask ourselves whether we have these blessings.</p>
<p>In this section the Lord presented two aspects of the nature of the people of the kingdom of the heavens. The first six blessings speak of the inward aspect of the kingdom people, and the last three blessings speak of their outward aspect. The inward aspect refers to the condition of their heart, and the outward aspect refers to the condition of their living.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Poor in Spirit</h2>
<p>The first aspect of the nature of the kingdom people is in Matthew 5:3: &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; Being poor in spirit refers to having a deep, inward feeling of dissatisfaction. When a believer feels dissatisfied deep within his being, he is poor in spirit.</p>
<p>Being poor in spirit is affected by our outward environment, but it is not related to our environment. For example, a brother may be very rich and have all the enjoyments of human life, but he still feels inwardly dissatisfied. Such a person is poor in spirit. Another brother may not be wealthy, but he does not feel inwardly dissatisfied. Such a person is not poor in spirit.</p>
<p>The first condition of the heart is to be poor in spirit. A person living in the kingdom of the heavens and partaking of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens must be poor in spirit. Someone who is poor in spirit, who is inwardly dissatisfied, is not seeking the material possessions of the present age; rather, he is seeking God, who is Spirit. A person seeks what he lacks. Many people want to be rich, because they think that they lack money, that they are not wealthy. People also seek knowledge, promotions, and entertainment. People seek what they lack, that is, the things in which they are poor.</p>
<p>A person who is poor in spirit is not satisfied with the material possessions of this age. He needs God to be his satisfaction, and he sees that only God can meet the need in his spirit and satisfy him deep within. Hence, he desires God and seeks God.</p>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens&rdquo; (v. 3). People who are poor in spirit and seek God are blessed, because the kingdom of the heavens is theirs. The material enjoyment, the material world, causes man to indulge his flesh and not be restricted by God. When man is not satisfied with the material possessions of this age and is willing to forsake the seen things in order to seek God, he will come under God&rsquo;s dominion and will be ruled by the kingdom of the heavens. Such persons possess the kingdom of the heavens. Being poor in spirit is the first condition of the heart of those who live in the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Mourning</h2>
<p>The second condition of the nature of the kingdom people is mourning. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.&rdquo; Someone who is poor in spirit and who desires and seeks God will be enlightened to see his evil, corrupt, and rebellious nature. He will also be enlightened to see that he resists God. As a result, he will mourn.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when he gains God, he will sense that many Christians do not want God, are not ruled by God, and do not give God the ground within them. This will also cause him to mourn. On a larger scope, a person who is poor in spirit and seeks God will mourn because his surroundings, the present generation, and the people in the world do not want God, resist God, and rebel against God.</p>
<p>From the context of Matthew 5 through 7, mourning is not related to disasters or illness but to the fact that people do not want God and do not submit to God. Such mourning may seem unpleasant, but it is sweet. The people of the world mourn often because they are in sin and have sicknesses and tribulations. However, this kind of mourning is ugly, low, and worthless. Only mourning on behalf of God is beautiful, precious, glorious, and of eternal value. The Lord promised that those who mourn on behalf of God will be comforted.</p>
<p>Comforting includes the satisfaction of having the Lord in us today and the comfort that we will have in the coming kingdom and in the new heaven and new earth. When the overcomers enter into the coming kingdom, their enjoyment and condition will free them from the grief of this age; hence, they will be satisfied and comforted. In the New Jerusalem in eternity future the portion that they receive will comfort them further. In the New Jerusalem God will be everything to man, and man will be fully under God&rsquo;s rule. Our grieving heart is comforted by gaining God and by coming under His authority; our heart is also comforted when we see our fellow seekers desiring God and being under His rule. However, our comfort will be greater and richer in the coming kingdom and in eternity future.</p>
<p>A person who lives in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens often mourns. He does not mourn over the tribulations that he suffers but over not gaining God. The object of such mourning is God and His dominion, and the reason for such mourning is the loss of God and the loss of His dominion. Such mourning is noble and holy. Those who mourn will be comforted by God.</p>
<p>Revelation 21 says that when the New Jerusalem descends from heaven, God will tabernacle with men (v. 3), and &ldquo;He will wipe away every tear from their eyes&rdquo; (v. 4). This refers to the nations, but verse 17 of chapter 7 also speaks of the Lamb wiping away every tear from those who stand before the throne of God. Surely, the kingdom people who mourn will be comforted in the New Jerusalem; they will have no reason to mourn.</p>

 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
