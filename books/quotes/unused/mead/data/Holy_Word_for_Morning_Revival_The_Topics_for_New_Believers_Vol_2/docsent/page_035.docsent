   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 12 DAY 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Eph 4:24 ...Put on the new man...</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>6:11 Put on the whole armor of God...</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rev 1:12 ...I saw seven golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The New Man</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church is also the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>218 Ephesians 2:14-16 shows us that Christ s death on the cross abolished the barriers between the Jews and the Gentiles, breaking down the middle wall of partition between them, that in the salvation of the power of His life the two may become one Body, which is the one corporate new man, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>219 Then in Ephesians 4:22-24 we are told to put off the old man and to put on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This new man is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To put on the new man means to live a life by the Body....We should put off the old man with the old social life, and we should put on the new man, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>220 What then is the difference between the Body and the new man?...The Body of Christ is a matter of life, whereas the new man is a matter of person....Both the life and the person are Christ....On the one hand, the church is the Body of Christ, and we take Christ as our life to act, to work, and to bear responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the other hand, the church is the new man, and we take Christ as our person to make plans and to decide on how we should live.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whether it is the Body or the new man, whether in working and moving or in living and in deciding, everything is corporate; nothing is individual.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>221</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Counterpart of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In his exhortation in Ephesians 5:22-33, Paul presents the church as the counterpart of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This reveals that the church is actually a part of Christ, for the church comes out of Christ and is unto Christ, just as Eve came out of Adam and was unto Adam Gen 2:21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church is the bride, the wife, of Christ, who is the Bridegroom John 3:29 , the Husband....To us He should be the attraction, the pleasure, and the satisfaction....In 2 Corinthians 11:2...we see that Christ is the believers Husband, the unique Husband for us to love....Now we should care only for Him, allowing nothing to replace Him in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our love for Him should be pure, and our whole being should be focused on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>222</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Warrior</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Ephesians chapter six we see that the church is a warrior to defeat God s enemy, the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order to fight the spiritual warfare, we need both the power of the Lord and also the whole armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church is a corporate warrior, and the believers are parts of this unique warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must fight the spiritual warfare in the Body, not individually.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>223 It is the plural you that must put on the whole armor of God, not the singular you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Satan is not afraid of individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is afraid of the church....We must meet the devil on the ground of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even in our private prayers we should stand by faith on the ground of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>224</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Golden Lampstand</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The book of Revelation shows us...the golden lampstands, the churches, in chapter one....Every local church is a golden lampstand v. 20 . 225 The seed of the revelation concerning the golden lampstand is sown in Exodus 25.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then in 1 Kings 7 it sprouts; in Zechariah 4 it is developed; and finally in Revelation it is harvested....</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The picture in Exodus 25 first shows us that the substance of the golden lampstand is pure gold; second, that the one piece of gold is beaten into a golden lampstand with a form; and third, that the golden lampstand has seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The meaning is this: First, according to biblical typology, gold signifies the nature of God....Second, the form of the lampstand signifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The incarnated Christ is God s form, God s solid expression Col 2:9 ....Third,...the seven lamps of the golden lampstand in the book of Zechariah are the seven Spirits of God in Revelation 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, the seven lamps signify the expression and shining of the Spirit....In other words, the testimony of the church is the solid expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>226</S>
