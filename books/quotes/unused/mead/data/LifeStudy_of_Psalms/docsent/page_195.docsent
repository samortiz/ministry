   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>X. THE PSALMIST'S ENJOYMENT OF GOD IN HIS HOUSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Psalm 61 is about the psalmist's enjoyment of God in His house.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A. Enjoying God as His Refuge</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>by Dwelling in the Tent of God</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verses 1 through 5 we see that the psalmist enjoyed God as his refuge by dwelling in the tent of God under the covering of His wings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verses 3 and 4 say, "You are a refuge to me,/A strong tower before the enemy./Let me sojourn in Your tent forever;/Let me take refuge in the covering of Your wings."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that the psalmist enjoyed God in His house to such an extent that he wanted to dwell in God's tent forever.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This shows us that the psalmist was close to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 5 continues, "For You, O God, have heard my vows; /You have given me the inheritance of those who fear Your name."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here the psalmist's thought is that since he was one who feared Jehovah, he had a share of God's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He feared God's name, and God gave him a portion of the inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>B. Asking God to Add Days to His Days</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verses 6 through 8 the psalmist asks God to add days to his days.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"You will add days to the days of the king;/May his years be like generation after generation./May he dwell forever before God;/Appoint lovingkindness and faithfulness, that they may preserve him" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not easy to translate the Hebrew word for "appoint" in verse 7.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The American Standard Version says "prepare," and Darby says "bestow."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The psalmist is asking God not simply to give but to appoint lovingkindness and faithfulness that they may preserve him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"So will I sing psalms to Your name forever,/As I repay my vows day by day" v. 8 . The psalmist's word here seems good, but it actually involves a kind of commercial transaction between him and God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God appoints lovingkindness and faithfulness, and then the psalmist repays God by singing psalms to His name.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that the singing of psalms to God's name is the psalmist's "payment" for the "purchase" of God's lovingkindness and faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here the psalmist is acting somewhat like a businessman.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In principle, we may do the same thing today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, we may pray, "Lord, we praise You, for You love us so much."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This praise is a kind of commercial transaction.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What would we do if, to our impression, God did not love us so much?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Real love is a matter not of receiving but only of giving.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we love with the expectation of receiving something in return, that is not genuine love it is trade, business, commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Peter had such a commercial concept in Matthew 19.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After the Lord Jesus had spoken about the way for a rich man to enter into the kingdom, Peter said to Him, "Behold, we have left all and followed You.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What then will there be for us?" v. 27 . Peter, like the psalmist, was thinking in commercial terms.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If he had said, "Lord, no matter what happens, I will still love You," that would have been real love.</S>
