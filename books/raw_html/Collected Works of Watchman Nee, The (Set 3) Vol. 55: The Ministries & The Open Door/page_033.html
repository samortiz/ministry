<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE MINISTERS</h2><p>NATURE:To show the way to serve, to help the serving ones and the churches in the different localities go on, and to solve the problems related to the ministry.</p><p>TIME OF PUBLICATION:Temporarily set at bimonthly.</p><p>PRICES:A) In order to prevent those who do not need this publication from carelessly disposing of it, we are forced to temporarily set the following prices: The three issues of this half year are temporarily priced at two gold dimes in national coinage. (National and international postage is not included in the price. Air or surface mail postage costs will be added.) B) We will consider giving the publication to those who really need it but cannot afford it. C) We will receive gladly from those who are able to make a donation to help with the cost of publication.</p><p>SUBSCRIPTION:Whoever would like to subscribe to this publication should fill out one of the cards provided, and mail it to the Shipping Department, Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 5008, Shanghai. (In every place with a local church, please contact the local church there.)</p><p>WIRING MONEY:If you are wiring money through the post office, you will need to include our post office branch name. Please mark on it: Jingan Temple.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE KINDS OF PUBLICATIONS</h2><p>Beginning September 1, we have changed the price of our publications to the following gold yen values:</p><p>1) The Ministers:Issue Nos. 1 through 3 in the second half of this year will temporarily cost a total of two gold dimes.</p><p>2) The Way:Issue Nos. 1 through 3 in the second half of this year will temporarily cost a total of six gold dimes.</p><p>3) The Present Testimony: Issue Nos. 1 through 3 in the second half of this year will temporarily cost a total of two gold dimes.</p><h2 class="head1">ATTENTION</h2><p>1) Whoever subscribes after September 1 must calculate their price in gold yen.</p><p>2) We will not ask for more money from anyone who did not receive this issue of the publication or did not know that we had changed the price to gold yen and had sent their money to us according to the old prices.</p><p>3) Please do not send us stamps in lieu of money. Because large pieces of mail require high value stamps, we cannot use stamps of small value. If you are in a locality which truly cannot wire money, then please send us stamps of high value (at least one gold penny per stamp) in place of your money.</p><p>Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 5008, Shanghai<br />September 1, 1948</p>
