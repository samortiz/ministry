   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-SEVEN CHRIST BEING GOD'S THINGS Date: December 1940</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Unrecorded</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Col 3:4, 11; John 8:24, 28</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If all that a Christian knows is that he has embraced the Christian faith and that this is a noble thing to do, I do not believe that such a person can go on in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This thought may be noble, but only in a negative sense.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What we need is light in a positive sense.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>CHRIST OUR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A Christian who does not know that Christ is his life does not know what reality is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Unless a man receives God's light and sees the things in Christ, he is like a blind man who is oblivious to all the physical objects around him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those in the world only know the things of the world, and we call them the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if a Christian only knows the "things" in Christ, such as love, work, virtues, etc., he will still be short of God's standard.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These things resemble Christ and are actually very close to Christ, but they are merely things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Too few Christians today are after Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Most of them are after the things of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These things have filled their whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, many other Christians can testify from their own experience that the things they once treasured have turned out to be nothing but dead "things."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>FIVE THINGS THAT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>CHRISTIANS CONSIDER IMPORTANT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are certain things that Christians consider very important.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without these things, they seem to feel that they can no longer be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you remove these things from them, they will feel that they are no longer Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They will feel very strange when a person calls himself a Christian yet does not have these things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Experience</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are two kinds of Christian experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some experiences are Christ, while other experiences are things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With the latter, you cannot say that Christ is not in the experience, but neither can you say that Christ is the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many experiences begin as Christ but end up as things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many experiences are part Christ and part things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The same is true with many works and behaviors they are part Christ and part things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How can one say that an experience is all Christ, without any trace of "things"?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many experiences of Christ were real the first time a person experienced them; they were living, but they have become dead.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the eyes of the Lord experience should not be limited by time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no past tense in spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some testify, saying, "On such-and-such a date, the Lord led me a certain way, and I experienced certain things."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you check with them again whether or not they really had such an experience on that certain date, they confidently say "yes."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But those who testify about their own experience are only testifying about things; they are not testifying about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These things might have been Christ at the time they experienced them, but they have become things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In our testimony, we should say, "On such-and-such a date, I experienced Christ for the first time."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that we have continued to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When some people testify about their salvation, they feel they have the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yet they are only testifying about a thing or an event.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many people come to us with a hope.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They see others receiving a revelation, and they hope to have the same.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, they become disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who hope to find do not find, because their hope rests on a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord does not give us things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He does not intend to give man merely things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many people do not ask for the Lord Himself; they merely ask the Lord to do something for them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the thing is done, the Lord is set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They want the Lord to visit them and give them the things that are spoken of in others' testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They want the experiences for the sake of giving good testimonies, not for the sake of gaining Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only those who seek after the Lord alone will see; those who seek for experience will not see.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In fact, only those who seek after the Lord will have the experience; those who seek after the experience will not find it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those who seek after the Lord will have the experience of Romans 6; those who seek for the experience of Romans 6 will not find it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They may be able to speak and pray about it, but they will not have the experience of it.</S>
