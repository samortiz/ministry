   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>JEREMIAH'S COMMISSION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 9 through 19 speak of Jeremiah's commission.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. Touched on His Mouth by Jehovah's Hand</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 9a says, "Then Jehovah stretched out His hand and touched my mouth."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since God is absolutely spiritual, how could He have touched Jeremiah's mouth with His hand?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not know and we cannot explain this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We only know that Jeremiah was in fact touched on his mouth by Jehovah's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>B. Jehovah Putting His Words</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>into Jeremiah's Mouth</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After touching Jeremiah Jehovah put His words into his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jehovah said to him, "Behold, I have put My words in your mouth" v. 9b . This enabled the prophet to speak for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The principle is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When God puts His words into us, we have much to speak for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>C. Jehovah Having Appointed Him</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>over the Nations and over the Kingdoms</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"See, I have appointed you this day / Over the nations and over the kingdoms / To pluck up and to break down, / To destroy and to tear down, / To build up and to plant" v. 10 . On the negative side there was to be the plucking up, the breaking down, the destroying, and the tearing down; on the positive side there was to be the building up and the planting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here we are reminded of the two meanings of Jeremiah's name: "Jehovah exalts" and "Jehovah tears down."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The plucking up, the breaking down, and the destroying are Jehovah's tearing down.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The building up and the planting are Jehovah's exalting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Surely every negative thing everything of Satan, sin, and the world must be torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Along with this we have Jehovah's building up and His planting, both of which involve His word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's word is a building up of Christ and a planting of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is for the exalting of Christ.</S>
