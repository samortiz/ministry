<h1 class="series">CHRIST IS OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS</h1><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class="title">THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 3:21-28, 31</h1><p>Every time we consider our salvation, we realize that it comes to us because God loves us. At the same time, we should remember that it was not an easy thing for God to prepare such a salvation for us. This is because God has His nature and His ways, just as man has his nature and his ways. Man's way is man's method and habit of doing things. Man's way is related to man's nature. God also has His ways. God works according to certain rules, procedures, and methods. These are called God's ways. The Bible shows us that God's glory is just God Himself, while God's holiness is God's nature. The Bible also shows us that God's righteousness is God's way.</p><p>God's righteousness is God's way of doing things. Every person has his own characteristics; every person has his way of doing things. When we see the things a person does, we know what kind of person he is. For example, a person may be very thorough and carry out things according to clear procedures. Whenever he takes up a task, he is never sloppy; he is always reliable and clear-cut in carrying it out. Every person has his own particular way of doing things. When we see a certain way, we know that a certain person has done the work, because others do not do things in the same way. The same is true with God. God's works also have their own characteristics. These characteristics are His ways. God's ways have very much to do with Himself; they have very much to do with His nature. God's way is righteousness. He cannot do anything unrighteously. God must do everything in a righteous way.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S SALVATION MUST CONFORM<br />TO HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>Even though God has a desire to save us, there is a problem. On the one hand, He wants to save us. On the other hand, He cannot do anything that would contradict His way. A man cannot do anything that contradicts his own nature. If he does anything that is contrary to his own nature, he will suffer and not feel comfortable. The same is true with God; He cannot do anything that is contrary to His own nature. God is love. But even though He sees man's pitiful condition and realizes that He has to save him, God has to save him in a way that satisfies Himself. God must save us in a way that does not contradict His way.</p><p>Is God satisfied with the salvation that we have received? Yes, God is satisfied. God considers this salvation proper. We are, of course, glad when we receive salvation. But in order for God to give us His grace, He has to give it in a way that He Himself is satisfied. God cannot save us and say at the same time, "Oh, this is not what I really wanted to do. I did it just for their sake." God has His nature, and He has His way. God must work in a way that He Himself is satisfied, and that He Himself can say is good and right. When God restored the earth and the heavens, He saw that everything He did during the six days (except the day He created the firmament, for which He had other reasons) "was good." If something is not good, God has not done it. God's work always bears one characteristic; He works according to a particular procedure and a particular way. He does everything in an absolutely righteous way. He is not pleased with anything that is unrighteous.</p><p>God is a righteous God. Hence, while it is easy for Him to condemn man, it is not easy for Him to forgive man. Suppose a very righteous man sees someone sin. It would be easy for him to judge the other according to righteousness, but it would not be easy for him to forgive the other. Anyone who sins perishes; this readily manifests God's nature and righteousness. But it is much more difficult for God to forgive a sinner and, at the same time, manifest His nature and righteousness. If a man admits that he has sinned when he goes to God, he should perish; this is very righteous. But would it be righteous if God forgave him easily? Of course, it would not be righteous, and God cannot do this. He cannot do anything unrighteous.</p><p>We must remember that in preparing a salvation for us, God faced one great problem. On the one hand, He wants to forgive man's sins. But on the other hand, He must do it in a way that matches His nature. This makes things very difficult for Him. If God did not have to act according to righteousness, it would be very simple. All He would have to do is forgive. It would also be easy and simple if God decided to not forgive our sins and let us perish. It would be easy for God to choose either way. But God did not choose one of these ways. We have sinned, and we should perish. God wants to save us, yet He cannot be unrighteous. When we put these four things together, it presents a big problem. God wants to save us, but He cannot lower the standard of His righteousness. On the one hand, He wants to save us. On the other hand, He has to do it in a righteous way. On the one hand, God wants to have mercy on us. On the other hand, He has to judge our sins. On the one hand, He wants to save us. On the other hand, He has to maintain His own righteousness. Putting it in human terms, God is the Legislator and He is also the Executor. Just imagine this! What should our God, who is both Legislator and Executor, do? What way should He take in order to both save men and maintain His righteousness? In preparing a salvation for us, the first question He had to settle was how He could do it and still be in conformity with His righteousness. He has to show us that His forgiveness is absolutely righteous; He cannot let us get by easily.</p>
