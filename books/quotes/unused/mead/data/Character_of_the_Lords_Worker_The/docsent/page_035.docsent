   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Those who have the intention to work will always find work to do.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Those who have no intention to work are always afraid that work will come their way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A diligent person always waits on God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As soon as he is free, he goes to the Lord and looks for things to do.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is always seeking an opportunity to work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A brother once said, "Brother So-and-so is not doing his job.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So many brothers from out of town are here, and he will not spend any time to fellowship with them."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Another brother asked, "Why do you not tell him?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first brother answered, "Does something like that have to be said?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is right.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A servant of the Lord should always be waiting on God for things to do.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of course, this does not mean that he should move around and make a fuss ostentatiously.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But it does mean that the Lord's servant should always be seeking God and looking to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He should build up the habit of lifting up his eyes and looking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If he is truly busy, God will not burden him with further work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But as soon as his time becomes available, he should ask, "Lord, what do You want me to do?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as we will lift up our eyes, we will find that many people need our service.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who always have nothing to do have only one reason they are used to being lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They live a lazy life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are lazy by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When something is put in their hands, they take more than ten days to finish what others can finish in a day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They have no motivation for work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brothers and sisters, we have to actively seek for work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we have not looked to God for work, prayed for work, and found work, we are lazy, and we will not be able to accomplish much work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even if we are given five or ten more years, we still will not get very far with our work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A basic requirement of a worker of the Lord is to be quick with his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As soon as a need arises, he should know what to do and how to move.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without this trait, he will not find any work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our spirit has to be sensitive to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are not sensitive, we will be slow to react to things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to pay attention to lifting up our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not follow what others say.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not assume that there are four months to the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to hear what the Lord is saying: "Behold, I tell you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are already white for harvest."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is amazing that some walk by the fields every day and yet have no eyes to behold.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They think that they still have to wait four more months!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They walk by needs every day, yet they do not find anything to do!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Their hands have already touched the things that they should do, yet they still say that they do not know what they should do.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How strange this is!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Brothers and sisters, we have never seen God use a man who was slothful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those whom God uses are men who expend their energy, who always look for things to do, and who are never loose.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They jealously guard the passing moments and never put off until tomorrow what can be done today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those who are loose with their time have little use in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some people will not move unless they are pushed to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They are like grandfather clocks; others have to set them in motion before they do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If no one pushes them, they will not move by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Such ones are of little use in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No matter where we go, as long as we find brothers who are laboring and diligently working, we find results.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God has done great works in many places because many people labored diligently behind the scene.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In some places God's work suffers a setback because some have been slothful.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have never seen a lazy person who was greatly used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Often the underlying reason for failure in the work is nothing but slothfulness.</S>
