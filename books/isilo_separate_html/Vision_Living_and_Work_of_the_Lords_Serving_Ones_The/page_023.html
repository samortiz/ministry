the Building of God</h2>
<p>I left Taipei in April and returned in October. On our return trip, I stopped in Hong Kong and held a conference there. After seeing the situation of the most spiritual place in the West, I began to consider the building up of the church. Hence, in that conference I released messages concerning the building of God for the first time. However, those messages were not complete. After I returned to Taipei, I held another conference, and I released more messages concerning the building of God. These messages were more complete. In one message I said that I went to the West with the specific intention of seeing the most spiritual place in order to see the building. Although their messages were spiritual, they did not have much building. Several of their elders had grievances, and even Brother Austin-Sparks said that he was considering moving to another place because they did not submit to his authority. After this speaking, the dissenting brothers among us began to plot about how to oppose me.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Experiencing the All-inclusive Spirit<br />
in the Midst of Adversities</h2>
<p>From that time onward, the &ldquo;sun&rdquo; blazed on me, the &ldquo;rain&rdquo; pounded on me, and &ldquo;ice and sleet&rdquo; fell on me. I experienced adversities in my human life. Later the Lord led me to America, a Christian country with numerous seminaries and theologians. The light that we received from the Lord caused some believers in traditional Christianity to rise up to oppose us. They despised me as a Chinese man teaching Westerners. They published books to attack me. Taking words out of context, they alleged that I teach pantheism, because I said that Christ is our rock, our living water, our clothing, and our dwelling place. They also asserted that calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name and pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word were derived from Oriental Buddhism. They used every means possible to slander me; there are more than two hundred sixty publications opposing us, and the attacks are aimed at me.</p>
<p>Through the oppositions and attacks, I experienced adversities in my human life. However, the Lord whom I serve, my wife, and the saints who are around me can all testify that none of the adverse situations touched me. Before I went to America, the Lord used sixty years of adverse situations to prepare me. During the past twenty years, the Lord has used this ministry immensely. Three hundred fifty churches have been raised up in North America, South America, Central America, Africa, Australia, and Europe. The Lord has truly blessed His recovery. At the same time, the persecution and opposition has reached its zenith; this is the problem from the outside. We also have trouble within, that is, the rumors from dissenting ones among us. All of these constitute the adversities in my human life.</p>
<p>Paul says, &ldquo;For me this will turn out to salvation through...the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:19). By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace, I can testify that I have experienced the all-inclusive Spirit&mdash;the all-inclusive death of Christ and the human living of Jesus in the all-inclusive Spirit. Hence, most of what I understand of the Bible comes from my experience and not from doctrinal knowledge. How can I say that there is the element of human living in the all-inclusive Spirit? I learned it from my experience. This message is a testimony of my experience of the all-inclusive Spirit and the all-inclusive death of Christ. Our Lord Jesus was incarnated, lived a human life in His humanity for thirty-three and a half years, died, resurrected, and ascended. Through this process He became the life-giving Spirit. Through His death and resurrection, the two elements of human nature&mdash;including human living&mdash;and death were added to the Spirit. Today the life-giving Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> </body></html>
