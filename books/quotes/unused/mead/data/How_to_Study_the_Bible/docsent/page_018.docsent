   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Examples of Similarities a. Dissatisfactions with the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many impressions in the Bible have to be studied by the way of contrast.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the case with the five examples mentioned above.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Other examples show similarities, and one has to put them together to form an integrated picture.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1 The Lord Falling Asleep in the Boat</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Matthew 8:23-27 speaks of the instance when the Lord Jesus crossed the sea with the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Suddenly a great tempest rose up in the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord was asleep, and the disciples were afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Matthew's record the disciples said, "Lord, save us; we are perishing!" v. 25 . But Mark 4:38 has something more to say: "Teacher, does it not matter to You ?" That means that they questioned how He could sleep so soundly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus rebuked the wind and the waves, and they were stilled; then He turned and rebuked the disciples for their little faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Notice the order of events according to Mark and Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before the Lord rebuked the disciples, He rebuked the wind and the waves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord had a basis for rebuking the disciples because He had said that He would cross to the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since He had said it, it must be so.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There was no need to worry even if there were winds, waves, or whatever along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus was teaching them the lesson of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What were they putting their faith in?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They should have trusted in the Lord's word: "Let us go over to the other side" Mark 4:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With the Lord having said that they would go over to the other side, it was not possible for them to end up at the bottom of the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet the disciples did not have faith in this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the reason the Lord rebuked them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is interesting that we never find the Lord apologizing to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Under normal circumstances, the more lessons a man learns before the Lord, the more he has to apologize to others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The more disciplined a person is, the more he discovers others' dissatisfaction with him, and the more frequently he will need to apologize to them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus is unique in that He never had to apologize to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It seems as if the disciples thought that they were right and the Lord was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The winds and the waves were fierce, and the disciples were perishing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Did this not matter to the Teacher?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the Lord did not wake up to apologize.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The absence of an apology is an expression of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He knew that He did not oversleep, and He knew that He was not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When He said to cross to the other side, He meant that they would cross to the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There was not one wasted word in Him, and no one can make Him apologize for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This shows the glory of our Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>2 The Touch of the Woman with the Flow of Blood</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Mark 5 we have the story of the woman with the flow of blood who came to touch the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here we find the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the woman touched the Lord, He turned around and asked who had touched Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The disciples said, "You see the crowd pressing upon You and You say, Who touched Me?" v. 31 . This was said in somewhat a rebuking tone.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord did not say, "I am sorry; I asked the wrong question."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead, He turned around to see who was touching Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was, in effect, saying, "Someone is touching Me, but you do not know it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Your eyes are on the pressing ones, but My eyes are on the touching one."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Outwardly speaking, the Lord appeared to be wrong; it seemed as if the disciples were justified in their indignation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But in reality the mistake was with the disciples, not with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord never apologized once to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is most glorious, and our heart cannot help but worship Him.</S>
