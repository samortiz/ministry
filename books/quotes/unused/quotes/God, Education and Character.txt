You may say it is the Word, the church life, the Body life, or to be burning in spirit, but if you have God, you have all these things
From preschool to kindergarten, elementary, junior high, high school, and university-we study books from the time we are four years old!
If you would not spend twenty years for education, you might be a wretched person, never knowing that you need God
The fact is, if you do not take my word, you will regret it when you pass the age of twenty-four, but that will be too late
It is a problem for the country of the United States that many of the young people today do not like to go on past high school
You need to be adjusted; you need to be instructed; you need to be corrected in many ways, not in only one way
When there is a fire, everyone is burning, but when the brother sat in his room by himself, was he still on fire?
By the age of twenty-four, you must have God, you must have an education, and you must have a proper character
