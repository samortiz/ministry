[2]  God's plan and purpose are fulfilled through the church.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE KNOWLEDGE OF AN ELDER Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 5:17; 3:5; Acts 20:17, 28
[4]  All the verses that we have just read show us that the church is managed by the elders.
[5]  Thank the Lord that during the past years, not only has the Lord set up many local churches, but He has set up a number of elders in each local church.
[6]  However, although these brothers have been constrained by the Lord's love to manage the house of God, due to the fact that they have never done this before, they are at a loss both in their understanding of the biblical principles and, in addition, in their practice as to how to manage the church.
[7]  The first thing that the elders should know is God's plan for the church.
[8]  In order for an elder to manage a church properly, obviously he must first of all know God's desire and plan for the church.
[9]  If the elders lack knowledge in this matter, their administration of the church will surely be unsatisfactory both to others and to God.
[10]  Although many elders are faithfully and diligently serving the church, their oversight of the church is often unsatisfactory to God because they do not have adequate knowledge concerning God's plan for the church.
[11]  There is a concept in Christianity today that is basically wrong.
[12]  Man considers the church to be something on earth today, and in heaven in the future.
[13]  B. God Desires Those Who Are Part of This Body
[14]  Every elder should realize in a sober and profound way that the eldership is a matter of government in the church.
[15]  Every book of the Bible shows us God's government and administration.
[16]  The New Testament revelation shows us that the government of the church is very simple and practical: All the government of a church is entrusted to the elders.
[17]  I would like the brothers and sisters to know that if the elders are truly managing and governing the church, the church will surely be strong.
[18]  The New Testament shows us clearly that the authority of the church is entrusted to the elders and is completely in the hands of the elders.
[19]  Although the elders are appointed by the apostles, God has not entrusted the authority of the church to the hands of the apostles.
[20]  Unless you are an elder in a local church, you have no authority to directly touch the affairs of the local church.
[21]  No matter how much help a worker renders to a local church, even if the church there has been established by him, if he is not an elder there, the authority of the church is not in his hands.
[22]  It does not mean that you should boast that you are the authority of the church, or that you are a delegated authority!
[23]  If we read the whole Bible carefully, we can see that God's plan and His purpose are fulfilled in the church.
[24]  If a local church has no elders, strictly speaking, it is as if there were no church.
[25]  If we see this, we will worship the Lord.
[26]  We will prostrate ourselves in the dust and admit that in God's view and according to His plan, there is no other group of people whose importance exceeds that of the elders.
[27]  We say this not for the elders to be proud; rather it shows all of us the important position in which the grace of God has placed the elders.
[28]  Please remember, however, that a broad heart is not a matter of a method, but a matter of the person.
[29]  If an elder realizes his own problem, and he humbles himself and confesses that his heart is indeed narrow, and that from now on he would try to be broad, brothers and sisters, this is but a method.
[30]  When I heard this, immediately my countenance changed, and I said, "Brother, you are not an elder.
[31]  I admit that this lesson is difficult to learn.
[32]  A person who reasons well may not be competent at managing a church, and neither is a person who has resources for everything necessarily competent at managing a church.
[33]  CHAPTER THREE THE HEART OF AN ELDER I. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE HEART TO THE ELDERS
[34]  We have mentioned before that in doing anything, the person who is doing the work must be the right person.
[35]  If we do not have the proper person, or if the person is not the right person, we cannot expect things to be done well.
[36]  If a person is narrow, his heart is narrow.
[37]  If you study the cause of this trouble carefully, you would discover that it had nothing to do with their love for the Lord; every one of them loved the Lord.
[38]  The strange thing, however, was that every one of the three or five responsible brothers was narrow-hearted.
[39]  He gives you that piece of clothing, not because he loves you and feels that you need some clothing, but because he wants you to do something for him.
[40]  All those who try to manipulate do so in order to evade and avoid difficulties.
[41]  But the more you try to evade and avoid, the harder it is for you to deal with the problems.
[42]  When we say that the heart must be upright, we do not merely mean that it should not be crooked.
[43]  For the elders to oversee the church, they must have a heart that can say before God that their help to the brothers and sisters and their leading of their spiritual pursuit are with absolutely no motive.
[44]  With this type of heart, God will have a way through you; He will be able to use you to oversee the church, and you will become a real profit to all the brothers and sisters.
[45]  CHAPTER FOUR THE CHARACTER OF AN ELDER I. THE IMPORTANCE OF CHARACTER
[46]  I want to repeat soberly to the brothers and sisters that whether a matter is carried out in a good way or in a poor way depends absolutely on the person.
[47]  If you neglect these few points, no matter how well you pray and how spiritual you are, I can conclude that you will be ineffective as an elder; the situation of the church will be helpless under your hand.
[48]  Brothers and sisters, if you have ever tried to be thorough, you will discover how much man is not at all thorough.
[49]  Sometimes the elders have caused much confusion in the church among the brothers and sisters because of a lack of thoroughness.
[50]  For example, some of the brothers and sisters may present a matter to you, but you merely listen casually to them and assume that you have understood clearly what they said.
[51]  Sometimes a brother may tell me, "Oh, Brother Lee, Brother So-and-so has a high fever."
[52]  If you say, "Wait until I get a piece of paper so that I can write down what you say," you can be sure that if you put the paper on the table and write down point by point what she says, she will change her tone.
[53]  I have been to some local churches and have met some elders who, if I suggest some meetings on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evenings, would frown at the idea and say, "I am afraid that the brothers and sisters may not be able to take it."
[54]  Let me tell you that it is not the brothers and sisters but the elders who cannot take it.
[55]  Once, a brother who was responsible for the co-workers' dormitory spoke to others in my presence, "Whoever manages the dormitory cannot possibly bear Brother Lee.
[56]  If you visit a local church, you will know whether the elders there are diligent or slothful.
[57]  Sometimes, when you go to a local church and observe the condition there, you will find out that the gospel has not been preached as it ought to have been preached, and the saints have not been edified as they ought to have been edified.
[58]  Brothers, never think that all you have to do in overseeing a church is to pray a little and wait for the Lord a little and expect God to do it all for you.
[59]  For example, a word may have come to you; you have heard it, but you do not make a final decision about it until you have considered it well and have taken suggestions from all sides.
[60]  When a problem arises in the church, and it appears that you need to deal with it, deal with it you must, but you should not panic or be hasty.
[61]  The thing everyone fears the most in the church is fluctuation; it bothers people to see things changing back and forth.
[62]  Before you are clear about a particular matter, go slowly.
[63]  Frequently, problems in the church come from the panicking of elders who are unstable in character.
[64]  Things may not have been so serious at the beginning, but an unstable character makes things worse and rumors multiply.
[65]  A person who has no concern for others cannot serve the Lord, much less be an elder.
[66]  If a brother comes to you today, a sister comes tomorrow, an unemployed person the third day, and if people come to you when they quarrel, when they are sick, when they need to buy a coffin, or a grave site, or when they do not know how to read the Bible or cannot have their prayers answered if all these ones come to you you are functioning quite well as an elder.
[67]  All these matters depend on a concern for others.
[68]  If you feel that you are the elders, and that all you have to do is go to the meetings and make a few announcements, such an attitude will disqualify you from being an elder.
[69]  I really wish that the brothers and sisters in the church could come to the elders on any matter, whether large or small, spiritual, family, business, or having to do with one's daily living.
[70]  CHAPTER FIVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF AUTHORITY I. AUTHORITY AND ADMINISTRATION
[71]  Whenever we talk about the administration of the church, we should consider the question of authority.
[72]  How regrettable it is that Protestantism has been affected by the poison of Catholicism, which has an abnormal concept of authority.
[73]  Nevertheless, brothers, we have to admit before the Lord that as long as there is a church, there is the need for administration, and, as long as there is administration, there is the need for authority.
[74]  You can be "naughty" in many other things, but if you touch authority, you will know yourself that there will be no way for you to go on in life if you are "naughty" in this matter.
[75]  If the reality of the church and the presence of the Lord are truly among us, authority will definitely be present.
[76]  If you ask me what this authority is, I cannot tell you.
[77]  In overseeing a church, the elders must first touch something called authority.
[78]  In the church there is such a thing as God's delegated authority.
[79]  Once you try to annul it, there will be no administration of the church, and there will be no reality of the church.
[80]  If you go to a group of Christians and you do not touch authority there, you have to put a big question mark on that place.
[81]  In the church not only is there the question of submission to authority, but there is also the question of being the authority.
[82]  To be an authority means that authority is with you and you should act as the authority.
[83]  If you are an elder in a local church, but you can never be an authority, you have to realize that you have utterly failed.
[84]  Since an elder is the authority, how should he exercise authority?
[85]  If the elders in the church have the attitude that they are the elders, that they have the authority, and that they are here to exercise their authority, that would be one of the ugliest things there is!
[86]  If you and I are to be the elders and are to oversee the church, we have to learn on the one hand to submit to authority, and on the other hand to be God's delegated authority.
[87]  In some local churches, I have seen brothers who act as elders by putting on a front.
[88]  I must tell you that there is nothing more ugly in the church than to see such a thing.
[89]  Whether toward the whole church, or toward a few brothers and sisters, you must remember that if you do not have any love, you must never exercise your authority, and you must never try to be involved in the affairs of others.
[90]  If you do not have love as the basis of authority, you will not have the ground for you to step on, and it will not work for you to try to be the authority.
[91]  Towards the church, towards an individual, or towards a group, if you have never exercised love and have never laid a groundwork of love, you might as well forget about being involved in their affairs, for if you do, you do not have an adequate realization concerning yourself.
[92]  The Lord said that the elders in the church are likened to shepherds of the flock.
[93]  You can understand what this means by watching a shepherd: while he rules over the sheep, he is loving his sheep with a fervent love.
[94]  You cannot say that you are an elder, and that you are an authority in the church, and therefore you will assume your authority and will deal with matters and manage things your way.
[95]  Whether or not a matter should be handled by you, whether or not you should say something, and whether or not you should go to a brother and have some fellowship with him, these matters should not be determined by your position as an elder.
[96]  You cannot say that something is within the jurisdiction of the elders, that the elders should take charge of the matter, and that it is therefore right for you to deal with it.
[97]  Unfortunately, I have met many elders in many localities who are willing to check if they are in spirit in their daily lives, but who neglect the matter of being in spirit when confronted with matters related to the management of church affairs, because they think that these are their rightful duties and that they should take charge of them.
[98]  In addition, the elders' meetings should be conducted in spirit.
[99]  When you learn to touch the affairs of the church in spirit and to handle the affairs of the church in spirit, you will impart to others a sense of life.
[100]  Suppose you need to announce something to the brothers and sisters; you must first put this matter to the death of the cross, to test it and to filter it.
[101]  Another two years passed, and their meeting was moved from the hilltop back to the plain.
[102]  If you visit him, you pray with him, and you tell him not to be discouraged to serve again, and when he is well, you teach him again, you lead him on, and you have patience with him time after time, by the second or third year, he will have learned.
[103]  An elder's ability of discernment is definitely related to the management of the church.
[104]  An elder who has no discernment concerning people and things will surely be unable to manage a church.
[105]  An elder must also be able to discern whether a brother or sister has passed through the death of the cross and whether he or she is a person living in resurrection.
[106]  Therefore, in any matter which brothers or sisters suggest to us, although they may be good and may be for the church, the elders must discern if the persons have passed through the cross and if they are in resurrection.
[107]  Perhaps you will ask, "What then shall I do?"
[108]  It is not a matter of what you should do.
[109]  If you fellowship with him in such a way, you will be not only a severe judge, but a serious doctor; he will have no other way but to submit to you.
[110]  When elders encounter problems, they must also be able to discern whether the matter is according to the truth.
[111]  The elders should have the ability to discern the truth concerning the way of the church, the ground of the church, the nature of the church, and the position of the church.
[112]  If you judge your motive and intention in everything before God, and if you judge and condemn everything that has impure motives or mixed intentions, it will be very easy for you to touch the motive and intention of the brothers and sisters; you will be able to sense them right away.
[113]  If you have never seriously studied the truth or practically learned it, you will not be able to have any discernment when you are confronted with any question regarding the truth; you will feel that everything is more or less the same.
[114]  In the chapter regarding authority we have mentioned that the authority of the elders requires coordination.
[115]  If there is no coordination among the elders in a local church, regardless how strong an individual elder may be, his strength is of no avail.
[116]  Hence, we see that God's will depends on the church, and the church is fully a matter of coordination and building, while the coordination and building of the church hinges fully on the elders.
[117]  It is not enough for an elder to be capable on one point, in one area, or with one part only; elders have to be capable in everything.
[118]  It is regrettable to see elders serving together without having the consciousness that they have to be in coordination in order to be capable in everything.
[119]  If we see that members of the same body do not have the same function, we will realize that the gifts of the elders are also different.
[120]  For example, you cannot expect every elder to have discernment; some elders need others to be their discernment.
[121]  With some, you have to admit that as soon as the Bible is put in their hand, it becomes transparent.
[122]  Many times, I am distressed about the elders in certain localities, because among them you do not see any coordination.
[123]  The elders should know the place the Lord has put them in, whether as the authority, or as those under authority.
[124]  They should know in what order the Lord has placed them, whether they are the first or the second.
[125]  If you feel that you are an elder and that others are also the elders, and if everybody feels the same way, what you have is just like a board of directors in the world.
[126]  In order for the elders to be coordinated, everyone must also be willing to be broken.
[127]  All those who do not open themselves to the brothers are keeping themselves whole.
[128]  If you never open up yourself or share your feeling with others, but you hold on to what you consider as right, misunderstanding and misinterpretation will very easily result.
[129]  If you are one who visits others, you need to be balanced a little by administration.
[130]  If you are one who administrates, you need to be balanced a little by the ministry of the Word.
[131]  If you are one who cares for the spiritual direction among the brothers and sisters, you should be balanced a little by the gospel.
[132]  If you are one who is very zealous for the preaching of the gospel, you have to be balanced a little by the administration of the church and the edification of the saints.
[133]  You have to accept the suggestions to such an extent that others will realize that it is not a rejection of the idea of gospel preaching, but a lack of time that there is no gospel preaching, and it is not a refusal to have a Bible study, but an impossibility in the schedule that there is no Bible study.
[134]  The elders in the church are the ones who conduct the administration of the church.
[135]  When the elders do the work of the deacons, they will neglect the work that they themselves should do.
[136]  For example, they should know how to lead different kinds of people on in the church.
[137]  For example, concerning certain matters, the elders should only talk to other elders about them; it is not convenient for them to talk these things over with the other brothers and sisters, because there is a question of responsibility involved.
[138]  The elders must also be able to discern the timing of events.
[139]  Strictly speaking, only in the elders' meeting can the elders speak openly and freely, without reservation and without concealment, about things pertaining to the brothers and sisters, the church, and the testimony of the Lord.
[140]  You must distinguish clearly whether a matter belongs to one local church or to another local church.
[141]  On the one hand, all the work everywhere is for the church.
[142]  The workers are either there to establish a church, or there to edify and build up the churches.
[143]  What we use daily to supply the brothers and sisters and to apply in the church may only be a few very practical and spiritual items that are full of life; we may not need to use the other items in the same way.
[144]  First, we shall speak something concerning the matter of fellowship.
[145]  If we know the principle of God's work, we will see clearly that a basic principle for God to bestow grace is fellowship.
[146]  Not only should the elders themselves live in fellowship all the time and have dealings before God, but in serving together as elders, when they are confronted with problems in the church which require their handling, their solving, or their facilitating, they need to bring these matters corporately before God and have fellowship with God.
[147]  All the management in the church, all the decisions, work, promotions, and leading in the church, and everything that passes through the hands of the elders must be brought before God and carried out through fellowship with God.
[148]  I can guarantee all of you here that the best way to be a proper elder is to fellowship every day.
[149]  Perhaps you may say that you do not have much to fellowship about.
[150]  Suppose you would simply come together to talk, then pray, then talk again, about your problems, my problems, your condition before God, and my condition before God.
[151]  After you have talked through everything about yourselves as the elders, you would talk about the condition of the brothers and sisters, the condition of the church, the number of sinners in your place, and the way to preach the gospel.
[152]  By 1943, the church in that place had a great revival.
[153]  We then felt that it was not enough to fellowship once a week, but that we must hold meetings every evening and gather for fellowship each afternoon.
[154]  At those fellowship meetings we always discussed such things as the direction of the flow of the Holy Spirit, the manner in which different ones had a spiritual turn, the meeting the night before, the feeling for the meeting that evening, and the persons we must look for and contact.
[155]  In order for the responsibility of the elders to be strengthened in your place, not only do you have to fellowship with God individually, and not only do you have to bring the corporate matters before the Lord and fellowship thoroughly over them, but more important than these things, the elders themselves have to fellowship one with another.
[156]  It is true that if the elders do not take the proper way of eldership and are still serving as elders in a natural way, the day will come when the church becomes too big and the districts so large that they are divided, and they will find themselves out of a job.
[157]  For example, here are two elders who are particularly good at administration.
[158]  The two of them should coordinate together to fellowship with the responsible ones of the thirty-five districts on administration alone.
[159]  The elders should also do their best to contact and fellowship with all of the brothers and sisters.
[160]  Although the churches in all the localities are administered locally, and although the authority of oversight and administration is vested in the hands of the local elders, in their normal condition the elders should do their best to fellowship with all the other places.
[161]  Do not say that you have no time, and that as an elder in Taipei, already you do not have enough time to take care of the problems in Taipei, let alone take care of the fellowship with other places.
[162]  The church is the Body of Christ, and all of us have to learn not to lose any blessing from any part of the Body.
[163]  Even when others are lower, weaker, and poorer than you are, when you fellowship with them, you will discover that you can still be helped by the weak and supplied by the poor.
[164]  From our past experiences and our knowledge concerning the truth in the Scripture, we have found clearly through our practice that the practical service in the church is in three areas:
[165]  It is one thing to have life; it is another thing to be living.
[166]  Here you need to take out the files of the brothers and sisters and read them carefully.
[167]  Sometimes you should not read them alone, but with the other responsible ones from the district.
[168]  Sometimes you have to fellowship with the brothers and sisters directly to touch their real inward condition.
[169]  If the elders would classify the brothers and sisters according to their condition and would try to make the dead ones alive, how busy they would be!
[170]  The elders have to spend time on this point also.
[171]  You have to consider what needs to be done first, what kind of arrangements you need to make, and what kind of people you should bring in. You must not only look to the Lord yourself, but fellowship with those who are serving together with you.
[172]  For example, if you want to bring a brother into the service, not only do you have to fellowship with the elders, but you must ask those who are frequently in touch with this person.
[173]  The elders cannot bring people into the service and leave them there.
[174]  For instance, when you bring someone to clean the windows in the meeting hall, you should not merely pay attention to whether he is cleaning them or not.
[175]  Not only do you have to bring someone in, but you must observe him while you are bringing him in. You must find out what kind of function he has, and through which kind of service he should be perfected.
[176]  If the elders can touch the brothers and sisters to find out if they have life and if they are living, and if the elders can bring them into the service, perfect their functions, and encourage their gifts, you can be assured that there will be many gifted ones in the church.
[177]  Some brothers and sisters give you the impression that they are very good.
[178]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ELDERS 2 I. Helping Others to Solve Their Problems
[179]  If your child does not have any clothes to wear, you cannot say, "Good, just go and pray!
[180]  The elders should not only help the brothers and sisters to solve their problems, but should also help them in a definite way to receive some burdens from the Lord.
[181]  Although you are simply an elder, and not an apostle, you can still help them to receive such a burden.
[182]  Not only do you have to bring them into the service and to accept the arrangements in the service of the church, you have to help them to have some genuine coordination.
[183]  After an elder has helped a brother or sister to receive a burden, immediately he should take them along to learn to do the work.
[184]  After he understands what you are doing, you have to ask him to do the same, while you are by his side to correct him.
[185]  It is all right if you have a humble heart, and you want to assume a learning position and to listen to an academic lecture.
[186]  But the question is: do you have a laboratory to experiment in?
[187]  If you are willing to put in the labor, even if you cannot cook, you will learn in half a month, and even if you do not know how to take care of children, you will learn in a month.
[188]  Brothers, do not expect an angel to come to your place to have a week's conference, and the church where you are will be revived.
[189]  Not only do the elders have to exercise patience to help the brothers and sisters learn, they have to help them to become proper vessels.
[190]  It is at this point that we can have genuine coordination.
[191]  The central work in the management of the church by the elders is to coordinate the brothers and sisters.
[192]  If one of your children was bitten by a dog today and ran home to tell you, "Daddy, Mommy, I have been bitten by a dog," would you pat his back and say, "Just pray, the Lord is almighty"?
[193]  Of course, you have to pray, but you must face the real situation also.
[194]  If the elders do not try to solve these problems, there will be no problem, because all the brothers and sisters will know that the elders cannot solve problems, and they will not come to the elders.
[195]  In their management of the church and in bringing the brothers and sisters into the coordination, first the elders have to take the gospel as their direction.
[196]  The church must have not only zeal for the gospel, but also the power of the gospel.
[197]  For the brothers and sisters to preach the gospel, there must not only be the zeal and the power without the truth; the elders have to spend the time to help them to know the truth.
[198]  If the brothers and sisters do not know how to preach the gospel or are not familiar with the skills of preaching the gospel, the church will not be a proper church.
[199]  But I hope that the elders would have an impression that there are no lofty theories to the elders' management of the church; everything is a matter of practice.
[200]  If the elders do not practice, there will not be much to do.
[201]  We will continue to consider the administration of the elders.
[202]  He is not only saved, and he is not only living a normal Christian life; he is not only consecrated, and he has not only learned the lessons of fellowship and is living in the fellowship, but he is a person who accepts the cross, who is delivered from the old creation, and who has entered into resurrection.
[203]  a. The Position of the Church in God's Plan
[204]  God's purpose concerning the church must be viewed from eternity, from God's desire and from God's plan, for everything in God's plan is related to the church.
[205]  In eternity, God had a plan, and this plan is to produce in the universe the church, which comes out of the created beings, the human race.
[206]  In order to perfect the brothers and sisters and to help them to know something concerning the church, at least we have to have these eight points.
[207]  We must not only help the brothers and sisters to understand the nature, the function, the appearance, the ground, the history, the present condition, the recovery, and the building up of the church, but we must help them to understand that the church is an organism and a body.
[208]  The brothers and sisters must be led to know that they themselves are the members and that they are fellow members with other saints in the Body of Christ.
[209]  If you can do a good job in both aspects, the knowledge of the church and the knowledge of the Body, the church where you are will be a built-up habitation to God.
[210]  If the church where you are has been properly managed, once it preaches the gospel, others will be able to tell that the preaching here is different, that it is the result of training, and that it is not wild.
[211]  If you have learned the art of flower arrangement, and I walk into your home, I will be able to tell right away that your flowers are not arranged in an ordinary way, but they are arranged as a result of training.
[212]  We have previously spoken of three directions in the management of the church into which the elders are to lead the brothers and sisters.
[213]  Suppose the brothers and sisters are properly trained in the gospel preaching, and there are different degrees of spiritual condition among them, some being newly saved and some beginning to be helped along; some are passing through their crisis of consecration, some are quite mature and know the cross and the resurrection, and some know the church and see the Body.
[214]  The epistles of the apostle Paul are clearly divided into two categories.
[215]  The first one is from the book of Romans to 2 Thessalonians, which can be compared to the soul of the church; it deals with the spiritual aspect of the church.
[216]  With the Holy Spirit, there is a matter of degree in life.
[217]  It may be that your degree of life is quite deep and quite high, and you are quite experienced, but your present condition before the Lord is somewhat off, and your fellowship with the Lord is not very good, even somewhat weak.
[218]  If a church has just started and there are no elders appointed yet, the principle is still the same.
[219]  Among the brothers and sisters, a few who are more elderly, who love the Lord more, and who are more spiritual should come together for fellowship.
[220]  In the church, every time you encounter some business arrangements, you need to lay hold of this principle of handling matters.
[221]  Even with purely business matters, you need to keep this principle.
[222]  If you do this, it would be terrible; the church would become a social organization, and the authority of the Holy Spirit would be completely sacrificed.
[223]  If you fear the Lord in your heart, and you are without any personal opinion, and if you are not autocratic, but allow the Holy Spirit to exercise His rule, the Holy Spirit will give you wisdom and will show you the best way even in matters like making chairs.
[224]  In the arranging of these business affairs, the managing ones need to continue to have ideas.
[225]  Now that a church is raised up, what kind of activities should it have?
[226]  But ideas are merely the beginning; when a decision is to be made, you still need to follow the same principle; you need to ask a few brothers and sisters to come and discuss.
[227]  But if you would joyfully pray, saying, "Lord, even if I have to sleep a little less and labor a little more, I am still willing; here is a need: should we prepare a meeting hall or not?" right away you will have a feeling within urging you.
[228]  If you are willing to labor, the work will be blessed by the Lord, and the number will increase continually.
[229]  Right away you need to come up with new ideas again, such as building a meeting hall, subdividing into districts, and establishing responsible ones for the districts and the groups.
[230]  After you have come up with the idea of a business office, you also need to come up with ideas on what to do, who should take care of the things, and how to take care of the things.
[231]  If you want your spirituality to have a direction, your fellowship with the Lord to be useful, your preaching of the gospel to have an issue, your care of the saints to have a result, you need to realize that all these hinge upon the management of the church.
