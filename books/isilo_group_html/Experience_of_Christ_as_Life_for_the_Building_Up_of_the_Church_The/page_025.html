Tongues will cease, prophecies and knowledge will be rendered useless, but Christ as love never falls away (v. 8). He never fails, fades out, or comes to an end.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Prophesying Builds Up the Church</H2><P>The main thing that chapter fourteen reveals is that prophesying builds up the church (v. 4b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>No Legality in the Church Life</H2><P>In verse 31 Paul said, "You can all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be encouraged." But in 12:29 Paul said, "Are all prophets?" Thus, chapter twelve indicates that we are not all prophets, but chapter fourteen says that we can all prophesy. Also, chapter eleven says that women can pray and prophesy (v. 5), but chapter fourteen says that the women have to be silent (v. 34). These varying portions of the Word show that we should not be legal. Today is the age of the Spirit. We should not make any practice a legality. In his preface to The Normal Christian Church Life, Brother Watchman Nee said that he was afraid that people would take his book as a manual to make something legal.</P><P>Today is not the age of the law. In the law everything is mentioned clearly and definitely with no room for discussion. But in 1 Corinthians 11:34 Paul said, "The rest I will set in order when I come." This indicates that the apostle did not give instructions for everything related to the practice of the church. For "the rest" we need to seek the Lord's leading, based on and governed by the principles set forth in the New Testament. Paul spoke to the Corinthians about division in chapters one and three, about a sinful brother in chapter five, about a lawsuit in chapter six, about idol worship in chapter eight, and about head covering and the Lord's table in chapter eleven. But Paul did not tell them everything. If the apostle Paul could not come to us, what should we do? Paul cannot come, but the Lord is here.</P><P>If some say that we all have to pray-read, they have made pray-reading a legality. If others say that we should not pray-read, they have made this a legality. Nothing is right as long as it is a legality. When anything becomes a legality, that brings in death. We should say, "Lord, we thank You that You have not told us everything. We thank You that we have to open to You all the time." Should we have a piano or an organ? Should we have a hymnal? We should not make anything a legality. May the Lord be merciful to us that we would never be legal. If we are legal with anything, we are finished.</P><P>In 1 Timothy 2 Paul told the sisters that they should dress in modest apparel (v. 9). We cannot define the standard of modesty. How modest is modest? Who can make the decision to set the standard? On the one hand, the revelation of the Bible is complete. On the other hand, we need the living Spirit to guide us into the reality of all things. With the law there was no room for debate. But in the New Testament many details are left up to the inner leading of the Spirit. Of course, things concerning idol worship, heresy, and immorality are not debatable, but things concerning forms and practices should not be legal.</P><P>How long should our meetings be and at what time should they be? The Bible does not tell us these things. Then what should we do? This is why Paul said, "The rest I will set in order when I come." With so many questions and problems, we have to look to the Lord's presence. We should say, "Lord, we cannot find any regulation in Your Word, but You are the living Word." We need a living contact with the Lord. We have to take all the regulations and instructions of the New Testament in spirit. The letter of the Old Testament and of the New Testament is killing. It is the Spirit who gives life (2 Cor. 3:6).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Experience of Christ as Life for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 25</div><br></body></html>
