<h1 class="title">THE SINLESS ONE MADE SIN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: 2 Cor. 5:21</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The sinless One is Jesus
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Jesus as God incarnated, does not have a sinful nature.</li>
	<li>Jesus never sinned, even when He was judged. All the examinations of men could not find any sins in Jesus. Even He Himself said, &ldquo;Which one of you convicts me of sin?&rdquo; (John 8:46).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We are sin
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We were born in sin.</li>
	<li>We grew up in sin.</li>
	<li>We are living in sin.</li>
	<li>We live out sin.</li>
	<li>We both possess a sinful nature and commit sinful acts, so we are sin.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The sinless One became sin
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God caused Jesus to be our substitute. He caused the sinless Lord Jesus to replace us, who are sin, by becoming sin for us.</li>
	<li>God caused the Lord Jesus to become sin in order that He might receive God&rsquo;s righteous judgment on the cross for us.</li>
	<li>When God judged the Lord Jesus, He actually judged us. By terminating the body of Jesus, He terminated us.</li>
	<li>Jesus could become sin for us because He became a man in order to be united with man.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The result of His becoming sin
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>He became sin for us that we might become righteousness.</li>
	<li>We are sin and Jesus is righteousness. When He caused us to be righteousness, He caused us to become Him.</li>
	<li>He caused us to become Him means that we may be joined to Him. Here &ldquo;in Him&rdquo; refers to this joining.</li>
	<li>This righteousness of His is not only before man but also before God. Not only does it fulfill the requirement and standard of man, but also that of God. Therefore, His righteousness is God&rsquo;s righteousness. So when He became sin for us, He caused us to be joined with Him and in Him to become righteousness before God.</li>
