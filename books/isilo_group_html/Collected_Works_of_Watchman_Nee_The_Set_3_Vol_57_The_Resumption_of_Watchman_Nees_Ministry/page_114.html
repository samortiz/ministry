You may speak something with a smile, or you may speak the same thing with tears. The issue is not how you speak; the issue is how much of your inward man is released. Today the extent that a man is broken determines the amount of ministry he has. We all have to be dealt with by the Lord in these matters. We love to meet some whose outward man is broken. Once we see such people, we touch their inward man. The purpose for which we are disciplined and restricted is that our outward man may be broken. A man can be talking about sad things on the platform, yet not feel sad at all. He can be talking about happy things, yet not feel any joy. This kind of person can only perform; he cannot preach. Some people are so hard in their outward man that they have no response no matter what is said. They are like the men at the time of John the Baptist, who would not dance when others played the flute and would not mourn when others sang a dirge (Matt. 11:17).</p><h2 class="head2">No Short Cut</h2><p>The basis of a man's ministry is his knowledge before God. But whether or not the ministry can be released depends on whether the outward man is broken. When we began to learn to be a minister of the word, we learned to have the proper knowledge before God. However, the more we go on, the more we have to see that there can be no real ministry unless the outward man is broken. If the rubber tree is not cut, the sap will not flow out. It is impossible for a person who has no wound to have a ministry. There is no short cut. Even today some people still do not know what it means to utter something from their inward man.</p><p>Never forget that a man can only have a certain ministry if he is dealt with by the Lord. After a man has been dealt with, his spirit will be more pure. Whether or not a man's spirit can be released depends fully on whether he has been dealt with. At the same time whether or not a man's spirit is clean depends on whether he has been dealt with. Once the outward man is broken, the inward man can be released, and a person's word will be able to reach others' hearts. Many people think that as long as a person can help others become excited and bring in an exciting atmosphere, everything will be all right. But those who have never been cut open in their outward man will not be of much use. Christian service is based on brokenness. The degree of brokenness and the amount of wounding determine the amount that will be released.</p><p>How should a man speak in order that his spirit can be released? The only way for his spirit to be released is for his outward shell to be broken. Whether or not a man's outward shell is broken determines whether his inward spirit is released. If a man wants to have a spirit that can be used, his outward man must be smitten. At the time we are regenerated, the Lord comes into our spirit. At that time our spirit is like the Holy of Holies; it is full of light and life. However, whether or not the Lord can be released depends on whether our outward man is broken. If the outward man is broken, outward things will no longer be a hindrance to us. On the contrary, they will all become outlets for the spirit to be released. If our mind and emotion are broken, they will no longer become a hindrance to the flow of life. On the contrary, they will become the channels for the inward man to be released. After a man has been broken, his mind and emotion will become the gateway for his inward man to go out. Every city in the world has only four gates. Only the New Jerusalem has twelve gates (Rev. 21:12). Whether Christ can be released from us depends on whether or not we have been broken.</p><h2 class="head2">The Need for the Strongest Point to Be Broken</h2><p>The nose is the most conspicuous part of the human body. If a man bumps into the wall, the first thing that hits it is his nose. For many people, when they express themselves, the strongest and most obvious things that come across to others are their cleverness or their thoughts. In order for a person to serve the Lord, the strongest part of his outward man must be broken. Only then will his inward man be released. We should not be Christians for so many years and yet still remain whole and unchanged.</p><p>You can say that you have not received great revelations before the Lord. But you cannot say that for all these years you have not received the discipline of the Holy Spirit. The goal of the discipline of the Holy Spirit is for you to be a broken man. One day, when you receive God's mercy, you will be able to say that at last you understand what it is to be a broken man. By that time, you will realize how easy it is for your spirit to be released. In order for the inward man to be released, there is the need for severe dealings from the Lord. Those who have never been dealt with cannot afford the Lord a way to go on.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_113.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_115.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 57: The Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry &nbsp; pg 114</div><br></body></html>
