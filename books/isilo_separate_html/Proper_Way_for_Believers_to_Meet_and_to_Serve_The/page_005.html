BEING THE QUALIFICATION FOR<br />
THE BELIEVERS TO MEET AND TO SERVE</h2>
<p>The characteristic of Christians is that the Triune God has entered into us to regenerate us, and He is living in us as our life so that He can live out of us. Hence, we can meet and serve together. Christian meetings are not based on the Chinese life, on the American life, or on an individual life. Our meetings are based on the Triune God as life in us. This is also the basis of our service.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD DWELLING IN US AS OUR LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Father, the Son, and the Spirit<br />
Dwelling in Us</h2>
<p>Concerning the Triune God dwelling in us as life, we must see that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit dwell in us. This is neither a saying nor a doctrine; it is the clear revelation of the Bible. Ephesians 4:6 says, &ldquo;One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.&rdquo; The Father is over the believers, passes through the believers, and dwells, remains, in the believers. This proves that the Father dwells in us. John 14:20 says, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you,&rdquo; and 15:5 says, &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him...&rdquo; Just as the branches abide in the vine, and the vine abides in the branches, so also the Son dwells in us and we in Him. Furthermore, 14:17 says, &ldquo;The Spirit of reality...abides with you and shall be in you,&rdquo; and Romans 8:11 says, &ldquo;He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life...through His Spirit who indwells you.&rdquo; These verses prove that the Spirit dwells in us.</p>
<p>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not three Gods; God is one. God the Father dwells in unapproachable light, God the Son came forth and was manifested among men, and God the Spirit reaches and enters into man. The Father is not separate from the Son, and the Son is not separate from the Spirit. Our spirit is the organ that we use to receive God. In order to receive something, we must use the proper organ. Our stomach is the organ for receiving food, our ears are for receiving sound, and our eyes are for receiving light and seeing colors. Only our eyes can perceive colors. The Triune God is the Spirit; hence, in order to receive Him, we must use our spirit. The divine Spirit has entered into our human spirit. This is mysterious yet real.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Father, the Son, and the Spirit<br />
Dwelling in Us as Life</h2>
<p>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit, that is, the three in the Godhead, dwell in us as our life. In John 14:23 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&rdquo; Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; Romans 8:2 says that the Spirit is the Spirit of life. The Spirit of life dwells in the believers. Hence, the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;dwells in the believers as their life.</p>
<p>Our experience as believers also proves that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit dwell in us as our life. When we call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we are calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, but we feel that the Spirit is dwelling in us and that the Father who regenerated us is wonderful. When we call on the Lord Jesus, we receive the Spirit and sense the sweetness of the Father. When I was a new believer, I found it confusing to pray. I wondered whether I should address God as Father, Lord, or Spirit. At that time some brothers said, &ldquo;You should pray to the heavenly Father. Every once in a while you can pray to the Son, but you should never pray to the Spirit.&rdquo; However, when I prayed to the Father, I would unconsciously begin praying to the Son and say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Moreover, because I touched the Spirit, I also addressed the Spirit. After some consideration, I would repent and confess this mistake. Soon I was completely confused, not knowing whether I should call on the Father, the Son, or the Spirit. Eventually, I realized that it is not a problem to address either the Father, the Son, or the Spirit in prayer. For example, depending on the situation, we may address Brother Yueh as Mr. Yueh, Brother Yueh, Professor Yueh, or Classmate Yueh.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Walking according to the Triune God<br />
as the Spirit</h2>
<p>The Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;dwells in us as our life. Hence, we need to live and walk by the Triune God who is our life. For this reason, Galatians 5:25 says, &ldquo;If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.&rdquo; However, this is not an easy matter to practice. When I lived in Yantai over forty years ago, very few homes used electric lights; most homes used kerosene lamps. From the time I was a young boy until I became an adult, I replenished the kerosene and wiped the lamps. Later, a brother installed electric lights in my home. Initially, when I returned home after a busy day, I would light the kerosene lamps, and my children would make fun of me. I would say to myself, &ldquo;Why am I so foolish? It is not necessary for me to light the kerosene lamps. I only need to turn on the switch, and the electric lights will shine.&rdquo; However, it still took several months before I was accustomed to using electric lights.</p>
<p>Using this illustration, we may say that before we were saved, we were kerosene lamps that frequently smoked. Now that we are saved and God lives in us, we can say that electricity has been installed in us. In spite of this, we are accustomed to lighting our kerosene lamp; that is, we still like to live by ourselves. When we are provoked to anger, we still exert much effort in order to endure. However, we no longer need to light our kerosene lamp. We can turn on the electric lights instead. We do not need to live by ourselves any longer. Instead, we should &ldquo;switch on&rdquo; by calling &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; This is to live by the Spirit.</p>
<p>I began serving the Lord when I was still young. People often asked me to tell them the most effective method to stop losing their temper. In those days I had not experienced calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name; hence, I would say, &ldquo;When you are about to lose your temper, you should say to yourself, &lsquo;Do not rush.&rsquo; This is good, because it is according to James 1:19. Moreover, when you are about to lose your temper, you should go pray.&rdquo; Being slow to anger and quick to pray is a very good practice, but it does not work.</p>
<p>Today I have learned the lesson. We have a &ldquo;switch&rdquo; that is always in us. The moment we call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; divine electricity comes. Sometimes I travel out of town and stay in others&rsquo; homes. My host usually shows me to my room and leaves immediately. Thus, I often need to spend a long time searching for the switch. We thank the Lord that He is our switch, and He will stoop down to reach us; we do not have to search for a long time. It is very convenient to turn on this switch. When we are about to get angry, we simply call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; and electricity flows immediately. This way is very effective. Over twenty years ago someone said that this practice was merely psychological. However, calling &ldquo;O Washington!&rdquo; will not make an American feel happy, nor will something happen when a Chinese calls &ldquo;O Confucius! O Confucius the sage!&rdquo; But the Lord Jesus comes and fills us immediately when we believers call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; and we experience Him. This is to let the Triune God be our life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASIS OF<br />
THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; MEETINGS AND SERVICE</h2>
<p>The Triune God being our life is the basis of our meetings and our service. The proper way for believers to meet and to serve is for them to take the Triune God as their life. We must be persons who live by the Triune God. For us to live is the Triune God; that is, for us to live is Christ. Only then can our meetings and our service be proper. It is not sufficient to meet or to serve according to the letter of the Bible. We must also live according to the Triune God as our life. When we live by Him, we are qualified to meet with the saints and to serve Him. Otherwise, we are not qualified to do anything. May we put this into practice.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> </body></html>
