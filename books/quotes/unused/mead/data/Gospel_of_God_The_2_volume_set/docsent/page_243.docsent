   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Furthermore, the word Lamb is never mentioned related to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But in the new heaven and new earth, the Lamb is indeed mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The throne is of God and of the Lamb 22:1 ; the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of the city 21:22 ; and the Lamb is the lamp of the city 21:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That the Lamb is mentioned related to the new heaven and new earth indicates that this will be an age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we come to the end of Revelation, the church, the kingdom, and the tribulation are no longer mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead, we find only that all who are thirsty can come and take of the water of life freely.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that you are invited to the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everything is free.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And that it is free means that it is of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the new heaven and new earth are entirely different from the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The new heaven and new earth are freely given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the teaching of Revelation, we can say that in the new heaven and new earth God deals with man in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the kingdom, however, He deals with the Christians in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we have to admit that it is in the kingdom that God chastises us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the new heaven and new earth everything is received freely.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this we see the relationship between today and the future.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we love the world today, walk by the flesh, and live a loose life, in the age to come we will be chastised by God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But if we love the Lord today and forsake everything for the Lord's sake, we will receive God's grace and His reward.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the biblical teaching concerning these three ages.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am not responsible for what I am speaking here.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am only speaking God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's Word says that in the coming age there will be these things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God Himself is responsible for all of His own words.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I only know that the Son of God has said these words.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is true that a man can enjoy eternal life today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the kingdom is the time when God will deal with His children.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you live a loose life today, you will be disciplined in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, we have eternal security, but we also have temporary danger.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have the security of the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But we also have the peril of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the kingdom we may suffer severe punishment and chastisement.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whereas salvation is settled by the work of the Lord Jesus, reward is judged by one's work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Salvation comes by the work of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Reward comes by our own work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are rewarded because we obey the will of God and walk not according to our own will.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>May we treasure the grace that we have received, and may we receive the warning from God and pursue after the reward of the kingdom.</S>
