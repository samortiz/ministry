   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His love for the Lord was precious, but his natural strength had to be denied and dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord allowed Peter to fail utterly in denying the Lord to His face three times, so that his natural strength and self-confidence could be dealt with.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They all must learn this one lesson: to reject the natural strength and ability.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our natural strength and ability must be dealt with and put on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then they will be in resurrection and full of the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then whatever we do in the church service will be a ministry of the divine element to others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If our natural strength and ability are not dealt with, we will minister something natural to people by our church service.</S>
