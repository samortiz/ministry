   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SAFEGUARD OF FAITH, LOVE, AND HOPE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verses 4 through 11 we see the safeguard of faith, love, and hope.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 4 Paul reminds us that we are not in darkness that the day should overtake us as a thief, and in verse 5 he points out that we are sons of light and of the day, and thus are not of the night nor of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then in verse 6 he exhorts us to watch and be sober: "So then, let us not sleep as the rest, but let us watch and be sober."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To sleep here is to be unwatchful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Watch is versus sleep see v. 7 , and sober is versus drunk.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 7 Paul says, "For those who sleep, sleep in the night, and those who are drunk, are drunk in the night."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here to be drunk is to be in a stupor.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christians are familiar with the word watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, we probably do not know the real meaning of this word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What does it mean to be watchful?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our answer will be too vague if we merely say that to be watchful is not to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this case, as with many other things, we may take for granted that we understand what the Bible says, when actually we do not understand the matter at all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The same is true about what it means to be sober.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be watchful and to be sober are related to safeguarding the three basic structures of the holy life for the church life: faith, love, and hope.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 8 indicates this: "But we who are of the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and a helmet, the hope of salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The words breastplate and helmet both indicate spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The breastplate is of faith and love, covering and protecting our heart and spirit according to God's righteousness Eph 6:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The helmet is the hope of salvation Eph 6:17 , covering and protecting our mentality, the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Faith, love, and hope are the three basic structures of the genuine Christian life as depicted in 1 Thessalonians 1:3.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Faith is related to our will a part of our heart Rom 10:9 and to our conscience a part of our spirit 1 Tim 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Love is related to our emotion, another part of our heart Matt 22:37 ; and hope is related to our understanding a function of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All of these need to be protected that a genuine Christian life may be maintained.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such a life is watchful and sober.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the beginning of this Epistle, the apostle praised the believers' work of faith, labor of love, and endurance of hope 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here, at the conclusion of the Epistle, he exhorts them to keep these spiritual virtues covered and protected by fighting for them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>HOPE IN THE LORD'S COMING BACK</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The hope spoken of in verse 8 is the hope of our Lord's coming back, which will be our salvation from both the coming destruction and from the slavery of corruption of the old creation Rom 8:21-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Salvation in verses 8 and 9 is not salvation from eternal perdition through the Lord's death, but salvation from the coming destruction through the Lord's coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to verse 8, we need armor to safeguard our faith, love, and hope.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we would protect these aspects of the basic structure of a holy life for the church life, we need to be watchful and sober.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, being watchful and sober is part of the living we should have as we hope in the Lord's coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have pointed out that in chapter four Paul comforts us with this hope, telling us that at the Lord's coming we shall be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We shall be transported into a state of ecstasy to meet with the Lord in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, this hope requires a living of watchfulness and soberness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need a life of watchfulness and soberness in order to wait for the Lord's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, as we exercise our hope in the Lord's coming back, we need a watching life and a sober life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are watchful and sober, we shall protect, safeguard, the basic structure of our Christian life.</S>
