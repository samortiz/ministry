<h2 class="head1">THE SECOND STEP OF GOD&rsquo;S PROCEDURE<br />
TO FULFILL HIS PURPOSE&mdash;<br />
MAN RECEIVING GOD&rsquo;S LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Placing Man in Front of the Tree of Life</h2>
<p>Even though Genesis 1 ends with God&rsquo;s creation of man, man did not have God as his content. He was only a vessel to contain God, just as an empty soda bottle is a vessel to contain soda. God created man in Genesis 1:27. This was the preparation of the vessel. Adam was like a &ldquo;bottle&rdquo; to contain God. Therefore, after God created man, there was the need for a further step in order for man to receive His life. This is revealed in 2:8-17.</p>
<p>After creating Adam, God put him in front of the tree of life. This can be compared to making a soda bottle and then putting it before a soda dispenser in order to be filled. If we could ask God why He put Adam in front of the tree of life, He might ask in return, &ldquo;Is it not evident that I put Adam there in order to put My life into him?&rdquo; Nevertheless, there is a still a distinction between man and a soda bottle. Soda must be poured into a soda bottle, because the soda bottle is passive. God, however, did not force His life into Adam. God wanted Adam to take the initiative to receive His life because Adam was a living person with a God-given free will.</p>
<p>Verses 8 through 14 say, &ldquo;Jehovah God planted a garden in Eden, in the east; and there He put the man whom He had formed. And out of the ground Jehovah God caused to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, as well as the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. And a river went forth from Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four branches. The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one that goes around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there. And the name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one that goes around the whole land of Cush. And the name of the third river is Hiddekel; it is the one that goes east of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.&rdquo; After God created Adam, He put Adam in the garden of Eden in the east. In the Bible the east refers to a bright place of glory (Ezek. 43:2). In Hebrew the word <em>Eden</em> means &ldquo;pleasure.&rdquo; A garden refers to a beautiful and gratifying place. The garden of Eden must have been a bright, glorious, beautiful, gratifying, and pleasant place. This is where God put the man whom He created.</p>
<h2 class="head3">God&rsquo;s Thought in the Garden<br />
Being Related to a Tree and a River</h2>
<p>Even though all kinds of created things were in the garden, Genesis 2:8-14 focuses on two things&mdash;a tree and a river. The Bible is special. It shows that God&rsquo;s thought in the garden was related to a tree and a river.</p>
<p>God focused on the tree of life because it was related to life. The tree of life speaks of the matter of food. Food is related to being healthy; it is related to life. Hence, when the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He said, &ldquo;I am the living bread which came down out of heaven...given for the life of the world&rdquo; (John 6:51). When the Bible speaks of the tree of life, it is in reference to food, and food is a matter of life. This is the thought in the Bible. It is crucial for us to see this thought in the Bible.</p>
<p>The record of God&rsquo;s creation in the first two chapters of Genesis is particular. God created myriads of things, but in the record of God&rsquo;s creation only a few things are mentioned, because God&rsquo;s central thought is related to life. God wants us to see that His desire in creation is to work His life into man so that man would have His image and dominion. This is the central thought of God. Hence, in the record of creation God reveals things that are related to His desire and that express His desire. We must not regard creation as something ordinary; rather, we must see the line of life in it.</p>
<p>Likewise, when reading Genesis 2 concerning the garden of Eden, we must understand that God&rsquo;s central thought is focused on life. After God created man, He put man in the garden of Eden so that man would receive His life. Hence, even though there were myriads of things in the garden, God does not mention them. When He spoke of the garden, He spoke of the tree of life, which was related to food. He said that the tree of life was in the middle of the garden (vv. 8-9). We should pay special attention to these three words: <em>tree, food,</em> and <em>life.</em> The tree of life was a matter of food, and food is necessary for life. This means that life was in the middle of the garden. Therefore, the first matter that man encountered after he was created was how to contact this life. This life is God Himself.</p>
<p>The tree of life was not the only tree in the garden of Eden. In addition to the tree of life, there was also the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. When man touches the tree of life, he receives life, but when he touches the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he receives death. Man receives life or death depending on which tree he contacts. The tree of life is crucial in the Bible. Both man and the tree of life are at the beginning of the Bible and at the conclusion of the Bible. Whether man lives or dies depends on how he relates to these two trees.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
