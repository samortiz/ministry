   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this lesson we will continue from the previous lesson to see Christ in His first coming as prophesied by the Old Testament prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is the child, the Son Emmanuel ; the King; the One coming forth from Bethlehem; the Desire of all the nations; and the Messenger of God and the Angel of the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We will also see that at the birth of Jesus the aged Simeon prophesied that Christ would be the glory and consolation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE CHILD BORN OF A VIRGIN,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE SON EMMANUEL</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>GIVEN BY THE ETERNAL FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Isaiah 7:14 and 9:6 are two of the greatest prophecies in the Bible concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These prophecies speak of a child being born and a Son being given.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word child in these verses implies God, man, God becoming a man, and God and man mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such a child was a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This child born of the human nature by a human virgin was also the Son given in the divine nature by the Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A. A Child Born of a Human Virgin</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This divine-human child was begotten in the virgin Mary of the Holy Spirit Matt 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The divine essence of the Holy Spirit was generated in Mary s womb before the child Jesus was delivered out of her womb.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God was born into Mary and remained in Mary s womb for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then the One who was of the Holy Spirit in Mary was delivered out of her womb as a God-man with both divinity and humanity v. 23 . This God-man was named Jesus Jehovah the Savior by God v. 21 . Jesus is not only a man but also Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, He is not only Jehovah; He is Jehovah becoming our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, He is our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was called Emmanuel God with us by the ones who experienced Him v. 23b . The child born of Mary was a God-man child.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before His birth, there had never been such a human being, a man mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This God-man is Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is God coming from divinity and with divinity into humanity to be Jehovah the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the negative side, He saves us from sin, and on the positive side, He saves us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He brings us unto God from a fallen situation, a situation of having our back turned to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>B. The Son Given by the Eternal Father</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The child born of a human virgin is the Son given by the Eternal Father Isa 9:6a; John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The prophecy in Isaiah 7:14 concerning Emmanuel sees its fulfillment in Matthew 1:20-23.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The prophecy in Isaiah 9:6 concerning Christ as the Wonderful One sees its fulfillment in John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Isaiah 9:6 says, A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>John 3:16 says, God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, John 3:16 is based upon Isaiah 9:6.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Son was given by a child being born.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the birth of this child there was a gift given by God His Son, the One who became the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His Son, the gift given to us, is also the Mighty God and the Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This clearly reveals that the child born of a virgin is also the Son given by the Eternal Father; and this Son is the Mighty God and the Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Gospel of John also contains the same revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>John 1:1 and 14 say that He was the Word, the very God, who became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was the Word, and then He became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His becoming flesh was His coming with the fullness of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His becoming flesh was God s incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, the Son became God s embodiment Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By bringing us grace and reality, He becomes our portion and our reality so that we can receive and gain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The child born of the virgin is Jesus, whom man called Emmanuel, and this child is also the Son, as the gift to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This Son, this gift, is the Mighty God and the Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we received Christ, we received Him as so many marvelous items.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is Jehovah our Savior to save us from sin into Himself, and He is Emmanuel, God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We enjoy this One as grace, which is God Himself as our portion for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The issue of our enjoyment of Him as our portion is that He becomes our reality.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What a blessing this is!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>THE KING</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Isaiah 32:1-2 says, Indeed a King will reign according to righteousness, / And the rulers will rule according to justice.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>/ And a man will be like a refuge from the wind / And a covering from the tempest, / Like streams of water in a dry place, / Like the shadow of a massive rock in a wasted land.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Here Isaiah prophesies that Christ in His first coming would be a King as well as a man for supplying, caring, and covering His people.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Gospel of Matthew reveals that Christ is the King, as prophesied in the Old Testament, who brings the kingdom of God to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He is not only God but also a man.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He is very human and even lowly in order to take care of all the needs of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This man who is the King, Christ, is a refuge to us from the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we face a storm, we can hide in Him to receive His protection.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He is also a covering from the tempest.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A tempest is much stronger, more troublesome, and much harder to face than wind.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When we are facing a tempest, Christ covers us so that the tempest cannot bother or damage us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This God-man is also streams of water in a dry place to supply, comfort, and satisfy us so that we can be watered in a dry place.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Christ is also the shadow of a massive rock in a wasted land.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>A wasted land signifies a place damaged and wasted by man.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This wonderful Christ is the shadow of a massive rock that becomes a sheltering shade as our covering.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>These items are various aspects of the care and supply rendered to us, the kingdom people, by Christ as the King in His kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The prophecy of Isaiah concerning Christ as the King has been fulfilled in Christ s first coming.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Ultimately, at Christ s second coming, this prophecy will be consummately fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>At that time, in the millennial kingdom, Christ will be the King to bring in the restoration of Israel.</S>
