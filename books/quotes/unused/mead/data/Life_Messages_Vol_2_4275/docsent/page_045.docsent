   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"NOTHING FROM HIMSELF"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was a person of strong character.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He had a distinct personality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His will was strong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His emotions were strong enough that He could weep.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His mind was clear and sober.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His words were eloquent.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet this striking Person said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, this also the Son does in like manner .I can do nothing from Myself" John 5:19, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Son lived by another Person's life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His own person was not His life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This One of such strong character did not live by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He lived by the Father; He lived the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was in this way that the Son expressed the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Father's life was revealed in the Son's living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>GOD'S ONLY CONCERN</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the principle which should govern our living also.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may have a strong character, but we must live by Him, not by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After I was saved, I began to seek after holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because I am a quick person, I would easily lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I hated my hot temper and wanted desperately to be victorious over it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now I have come to realize that God's intention is not for me to be victorious or spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His intention is that I live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>My problem was not that I was defeated, natural, and unholy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was that I was short of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Christ victory over everything is mine.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Holiness and practical spirituality are mine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God, even from eternity past, never had the concept of gaining a group of "holy" people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is not concerned about your "holiness."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If He wanted to, He could cure you of your temper without any effort on your part or on His.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What God wants is to have a people living by Christ that they may be Christ's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is a full picture of this in the Old Testament type of the tabernacle with the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the wilderness over two million Israelites went from place to place, carrying the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They would reach a certain point and then encamp around that tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Day after day this was all they did.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They were victorious over their enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They had God with them in the pillar of fire by night and in the pillar of cloud by day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The tabernacle was God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the children of Israel were right with the tabernacle, all went well.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When they neglected it, they were carnal, worldly, and defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today all too many Christians are ignorant of this testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God wants us to live by Another's life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He wants Christ to be our life, our love, our kindness, our righteousness, and our holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He does not want us to aspire after any thing; in Christ is all we need.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>CHANGING OUR CONCEPTS</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Yet you are concerned about losing your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You keep regretting that you have not kept your marriage vow to love your wife or to submit to your husband.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How you need your concepts changed!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For you to live is Christ, not spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For you to live is Christ, not love for your wife or submission to your husband.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Stop trying to be even-tempered.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God does not care about your being delivered from your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A statue never loses its temper, however much it is insulted.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do you think God wants you to be like that?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God wants you to be full of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even if you are a very hot-tempered person, you can still live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What we need is what God wants Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God wants Christ to be lived out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There's a Man in the glory</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whose Life is for me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>His peace is abiding;</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How patient is He!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He's joyful and radiant,</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Expecting to see</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>His Life in the glory</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Lived out in me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hymns, #505</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God wants a people corporately living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This vision, which was made so clear the first ten years of the recovery in this country, must be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>May we all re-see the vision.</S>
