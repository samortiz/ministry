<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION<br>OF THE REVELATION IN THE BOOK OF JEREMIAH</H2><P>Finally, I would like to ask a third question: What is the ultimate consummation, the ultimate issue, of the revelation in the book of Jeremiah? The ultimate consummation of the divine revelation in this book is the New Jerusalem. We know this by the fact that the entire Bible consummates in the New Jerusalem.</P><P>The New Jerusalem is the consummation of God's new creation. In the book of Jeremiah, the new creation is indicated by the new covenant in chapter thirty-one. The new covenant produces something new, and this new thing is the new creation. God's new creation is His increase, His enlargement, becoming His fullness.</P><P>We use the word fullness here to denote not the riches of God but the expression of God. This word denotes not the riches of what God is but the expression of these riches, the full expression of the rich being of God. We may use a glass of water as an illustration. A glass that is full of water is rich in water. But when a glass of water is so full that it overflows with water, we have not only the riches of water but also the outflow of water as the fullness, the expression, of the water. God's fullness, therefore, is His expression in full. The New Jerusalem, the consummation of the Bible, will be the fullness, the expression, of God.</P><P>Eventually, according to the new covenant, Israel will be redeemed, saved, and renewed so that God will be their God and they will be God's people to participate in the enjoyment of the riches of the Triune God. This participation will be in the millennium in the coming age of restoration and will ultimately consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity.</P>
