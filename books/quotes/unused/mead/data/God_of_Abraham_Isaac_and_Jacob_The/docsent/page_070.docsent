   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>No Pretense in Dealing with the Natural Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The natural life must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yet we cannot pretend.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Pretension is not Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christianity does not make us persons we are not.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we are adults, we will spontaneously have the appearance of adults.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are children, we will spontaneously have the appearance of children.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The same is true with God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is He who touches our natural life and removes its strength.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As a result we cannot do anything by ourselves any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to allow the Holy Spirit to manifest Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not want to be natural, yet we do not want to be pretentious either.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is an uncomely sight for a child of God to pretend to be spiritual; it frustrates his natural life from being dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many Christians pretend to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more humble they appear, the more uncomfortable they make others feel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With many Christians, it would be better for them to speak of worldly things because they would at least be somewhat genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the minute they talk about spiritual things, others cannot help but pray, "Lord, be merciful to him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is talking about things that bear no reality at all."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many Christians appear very meek, but one cannot help but pray, "Lord, forgive this man's meekness; we do not know where this meekness comes from."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Indeed, nothing frustrates the Christian life more than pretension.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to be unpretentious and genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we want to smile, we should smile.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we want to laugh, we should laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must never perform and never pretend.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord deals with the natural life, and the Holy Spirit accomplishes this work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must never exhort others to be what they are not.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a man is humble, he is humble.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If he pretends to be humble, his pretension is worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a Christian pretends to be spiritual, his natural life will become even harder to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God does not need this kind of person, because his pretension is a frustration to God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the last century, there was a brother who was greatly used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One day he was a guest at another person's house.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A young sister was also invited as a guest.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The sister was surprised to find that this brother was also a guest.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She wondered if this brother would put butter on his bread.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She thought that a spiritual person would surely be different from others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But to her disappointment, he did not fit her expectation of what a spiritual person should be.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He appeared to be just a normal man!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She was disappointed that he was merely a man!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She observed that he buttered his bread just like everyone else and chatted while he ate.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She did not see much difference in him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>She wondered why such a spiritual man would be the same as others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She did not realize that his difference did not lie in eating unbuttered bread or in restraining himself from conversation at mealtime, but in his special knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What was special about this man was his experience in the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should never think that dealing with the natural life is pretending to be a special kind of person, one who is found neither in heaven nor on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We do not need to pretend or imitate.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is God who touches our natural life and God who deals with us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God touches the seat of our natural energy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He strips us of our own ways so that we can struggle no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Peniel is God's work; it is not something that we conjure up.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord wants us to be genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should neither strive to become genuine nor "act" genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One sister appeared very genuine before others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But while she appeared to be "genuine," her heart was saying, "See!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How genuine am I!"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This kind of "genuineness" has no value before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>She was faking her genuineness; it was a kind of self-boasting genuineness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to remember that the natural life is not touched when we pretend to be what we are not.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God alone can deal with our natural life; we cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to be unpretentious.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should be what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God will deal with our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Brothers and sisters, we have to be thoroughly clear that there is a big difference between anything that comes from ourselves and anything that comes from God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Anything that comes from God counts, while anything that comes from us is worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Anything that comes from ourselves only makes us someone we are not.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Only that which comes from God will make us Israel.</S>
