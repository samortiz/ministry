<h2 class="head1">WEARING OUT SAMSON'S CONSECRATION</h2><p>Samson's failure was not as serious as the loss of his consecration. He could not afford to lose his testimony of separation. Once he lost his consecration, he lost his power; once he lost his testimony, he lost God's presence. Samson was a Nazarite. Satan knew that the source of Samson's power was in his consecration; therefore, he focused his efforts on this very crucial thing&mdash;he tried to take away Samson's consecration. How did Satan do it? He used Delilah, who pressed Samson daily with her words. Eventually, Samson's soul was vexed unto death, and he told her all that was in his heart, revealing the source of his power. The result was that he fell into Satan's snare; he lost his consecration, his power, his testimony of sanctification, and God's presence. This daily, pressing work is the work of the enemy.</p><p>If the Lord opens our eyes, we will see that Satan uses many methods to wear man out. He can wear us out physically, circumstantially, or spiritually. He does not attack fiercely; rather, he wears out slowly. Therefore, we have to be aware of his wearing out. We must not allow him to continue his wearing-out work; we must oppose it.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING DISGUSTED WITH SATAN'S WEARING OUT</h2><p>When Paul was preaching in Macedonia, he met a girl possessed by a spirit, who followed him, crying out, "These men are slaves of the Most High God, who announce to you a way of salvation" (Acts 16:17). She cried out this way for many days, until Paul felt disgusted at heart. He turned to the spirit and said, "I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her" (v. 18). The spirit came out that very hour. Spiritually, we need such a feeling of disgust. We need to be disgusted not with men but with the demons. Paul was truly disgusted with the spirit; he was not disgusted with the girl. When Paul charged the spirit to come out of the girl, he was treating the girl as a third party. When the devil tries to wear us out, we should have the same feeling of disgust as Paul.</p><p>If you know that Satan is wearing you out, you have to pray for God to give you a feeling of disgust, that is, a feeling of disgust and anger with Satan! Many people can get angry at men, but they cannot get angry at the devil. If others offend them, they break out in a fit of anger, but when the devil wears them out, they do not feel a thing. Paul was worn out by Satan to the extent that he became angry. Once he opened his mouth to rebuke the spirit, the spirit went away. Hence, we must not keep our mouth shut all the time; we have to declare something. It would be wonderful if God's children would become angry with Satan and rebuke him. If anyone becomes angry with Satan, we will say, "Hallelujah, this is wonderful!" Some people are very weak; they allow Satan to wear them out. This is too poor. God's children should become angry with Satan. They need to be disgusted with him. Once they become angry and disgusted, everything will be set right.</p><p>We often keep silent and endure while Satan is wearing us out; we try to suffer silently. But at a certain point, we become disgusted and angry, saying, "I do not agree with this! I do not want this!" This speaking and anger will deliver us and stop the wearing-out work. God's children should stand up to reject Satan in disgust; they should rebuke Satan. Some people have never experienced deliverance or release because they still have the "strength" to endure. A man who endures Satan's wearing out and allows Satan to waste his energy, joy, and spirit has fallen into Satan's trap. We are not saying that we should be angry with those men whom Satan has used; we must be patient with them and still love them. But we should oppose and reject the strategies and methods of Satan. If we oppose Satan's work, we will be freed and liberated.</p><p>The power to reject Satan comes from realizing his pressure. Some believers have been deceived and attacked by Satan. They withstand it and oppose it, yet they do not feel that they have any strength. This is because they have not seen the pressure of Satan. We often oppose and reject him, yet we do not have any energy to raise our voice. This is because we have not seen Satan's pressure. Whether or not we can reject Satan depends on whether we are disgusted with him. If we are not sufficiently disgusted with him, our speaking to him will be like speaking to the air; it will not produce any effect. But when we truly become disgusted and angry with him, the anger will become our strength, and the minute we open our mouth, he will go away.</p><p>Such a feeling of disgust comes from revelation. Once we see that Satan is wearing us out, we must oppose him. Once we see this, Satan cannot do anything more; he will realize his hopelessness. May the Lord be merciful to us so that we see Satan's wearing-out work. As long as we tolerate and endure him, his work will continue. But the minute we feel disgusted and become angry with him, Satan will go away. We must realize that no other kind of withstanding will work. Satan will withdraw only when we withstand him with our words. If we do not see this and allow him to go on, he will not stop. When we see that Satan is doing the work and plotting everything, we must say, "I do not want this. I oppose this." God will then bless our withstanding, and it will become effectual.</p><p>Finally, let us read Ephesians 6:13. Paul said, "Having done all, to stand." We must stand and not allow Satan to continue wearing us out. May the Lord open our eyes to see Satan's wearing-out work on God's children. We have to reject this, and we have to speak up. We have to say, "I reject this. I oppose this. I do not accept this wearing out." We must not accept any kind of wearing out from Satan; we should oppose it and reject it. If we do this, we will witness the Lord's deliverance and release, and we will be freed from Satan's wearing-out work.</p><p>Such words require the covering of the blood. May God cover us with the blood.</p>
