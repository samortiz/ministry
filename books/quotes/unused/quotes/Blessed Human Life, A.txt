We must consider what human life is exactly, what the meaning of human life is, and what the purpose of man's existence is
If we were to stand in front of the mirror and look at ourselves-at our eyes, nose, and ears-we would find them fascinating
Since human beings were created according to God's design, what they are and the reason for their existence lie in the God who created them
There are countless volumes of books whether philosophical literary scientific or religious that have something to say about human existence
These discussions are incomplete, just like the proverbial blind man who tried to discern an elephant by feeling only one part of it
In other words human existence came out of Gods creation and also lies in Gods creation and it is entirely for the purpose of Gods creation
Although it is very difficult for us to describe God's image and likeness, the Bible portrays who God is in various ways
Throughout history and over the whole earth, regardless of race or color, every human being has love within him
Even though we are fallen we still retain the qualities of love light holiness and righteousness because God created us with these qualities

Even though they are great statesmen and entrepreneurs, some of them give the impression that they are quite confused
The earlier a person gets to know the mystery of the universe, the earlier he takes hold of the direction for his life
Some people wish to marry early, but actually the earlier a person gets married, the more troubles he brings upon himself
God created us with a stomach as the organ to digest food, and He also created us with a body to absorb all the nutrition
As Christians, we also need entertainment, but our entertainment should not be excessive, and it should be proper
Our human life needs balance and relaxation, and the church life as a balance can best help us to enjoy a proper human life
If you keep this principle from your youth you will surely receive the greatest blessing and the maximum benefit throughout your entire life
May the Lord give grace to each one of you that starting at a young age your eyes would be opened to understand the mystery of the universe
Religion talks about moral conduct and cultivation of behavior, and Confucianism talks about human relationships and ethics
The Islam religion was produced by copying the stories from the Old Testament and adding some of the stories of 'Isa' in the New Testament
Since gold is gold, it cannot be replaced by anything else; neither copper nor any kind of gilding can replace gold, because gold is gold
The mystery of the universe lies in God, the mystery of God lies in Christ, and the mystery of Christ lies in the church
The Chinese philosophy can also be considered the most pure and proper philosophy, without any myths and without any strange or absurd ideas

In the history of humankind and in the writings of the Bible, there is only one person who told people again and again that He is life
The Gospel of John says that Jesus is the Son of God and that He came that we may have life and may have it abundantly

Though with the animal life there are distinctions of lower and higher forms, it is still not the highest form of life

At the time this Jehovah bore the human image and had a human body because He had His feet washed and ate the meal Abraham prepared for Him
Even though man was made in God's image and according to God's likeness, he still did not have God's life within
Some are for man to take in as food, such as chicken, duck, and fish; some are for man's employment, such as the horse, donkey, and camel
Since man was made in God's image and according to God's likeness, the life of man is very similar to the life of God
Because our life is similar to God's life, the two can be grafted into one; the life of God is able to come into our human life
Even in Christianity there is a group, the Pentecostals, who mostly focus on how God performs miracles, but they never talk about life
These two passages show us that the Son refers to Himself as 'I'; this Son will ask the Father, and the Father will give us the Spirit
Since this God is a person with personality, He has love, mercy, kindness, and even anger; He has the entire range of emotions
Pember, which includes the great prophecies concerning the Jews, the Gentiles, the church, and the entire world

Everything that is nutritious to the body is transported to all parts of our body, causing each part to manifest its function
If our ears were artificial and not able to facilitate the organic operations of the body, we would not be able to hear
Christ with the church is God's organism that operates and works on the earth for the expression of God as the eternal life
In addition, we do not use the old way but the new way, which is to knock on doors house by house to find the sons of peace
In the past two years, the Lord has given us a new way, to have us go from house to house, bringing the gospel with us
Go to Africa, South America, North America, and Europe; go to all parts of the world and go to all of the nations to knock on doors
When we go door-knocking, we find sons of peace and they are saved to become the Lord's sheep who need to be fed by us
We need to go out door-knocking every day, seeking out the sons of peace so they may be fruit, be regenerated, and become the Lord's flock
We not only know the Bible and the Spirit, but we are soaked with the Lord's word and filled with the riches in the Holy Spirit

In the Bible there are not only words of profundity and wisdom but also prophecies concerning the world situation throughout the ages

History shows us that in the Old Testament God had gained the patriarchs throughout the generations and also the people of Israel
If we travel to the land of Israel, we will see that everything is according to the letter, superstition, ritual, and religion
There is a very great gap between what they possess and what we have received in the church in the recent years
As to the church, in the last two thousand years we can see the Catholic Church, the Protestant churches, and the Eastern Orthodox Church
Even today in Taiwan, there are many pastors and believers in Christianity who are no different from the people in the world
Even though God created man, accomplished redemption, and produced the church, it seems that He has gained nothing
In the Bible, the early rain and the late rain are mentioned not in reference to the church but to the children of Israel
To be in the Lord's recovery is to turn around, by the Lord's grace, and stand against the tide that is going downhill
With great sorrow we say that to this day, even in His recovery, the Lord has not been able to gain the group of people He wants to gain
By changing the system and taking the new way we mean that we drop the old things and begin anew with a new way
What the Lord desires today is to gain a group of people that fully meets His standard, living on the earth for Him
The Bible does not say that eating should be held in high regard, but it says, 'Let marriage be held in honor among all'
The traditional but incorrect concept is that when we begin to love the Lord, we do not care about eating, marriage, and clothing

If you go and ask a pastor, 'Is there a statement in the Bible concerning virgins going forth to meet the bridegroom'?
One picture was that of Nero, whom Panton claimed would become Antichrist; this was also the Caesar Nero who killed Paul
The other picture was that of the Italian prime minister Mussolini, whom Panton speculated to be the coming Antichrist
At that time the Antichrist could not have appeared, because spiritually the preparation of the gospel was still inadequate
Fifty-one years afterward, which is half a century later, the gospel still has not been preached in the whole inhabited earth
Every letter sent to us from the major continents all over the globe has fellowshipped with us regarding the need for people to go
We do not have enough people even to meet the need of Taiwan, or even just Taipei, not to mention the whole earth
The reason Christianity does not like us, the Lord's recovery, is that we keep the unique ground of the church
Today those who truly pursue the Lord are willing to open to this recovery because this recovery is waging a war with a cause

The Lord's recovery does not merely belong to us who are only a small number, but the Lord's recovery belongs to all of God's children

We should not merely read them and quickly forget about them, like the Chinese who read the books written by Confucius and Mencius
We need to pray to the Lord, because although we do not have the strength to do this, the Lord is the bountiful supply within us
In addition, we should learn at least one other foreign language, be it Spanish, German, French, Japanese, or Korean
We need to know history, recognize the situation and the tide of the world, and be aware of the condition on the earth today
In this way, we will be able to advance toward the goal to gospelize Taiwan, Japan, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand

When we have the Lord Jesus, we have the source of blessing, and when we have the source of blessing, we have a blessed living

There are more than six hundred churches altogether in the East and the West, scattered throughout the six major continents of the world
Although we were raised up by the Lord in China, the Lord's recovery was not merely for the Chinese people but for the whole world
In 1949 before we left Shanghai, there were more than four hundred churches, with co-workers in thirty-three provinces
After World War II, having become the leading nation in the world, the United States spread its influence throughout the entire earth
As a result, after the Lord's recovery came into the United States, within ten years it spread to the Americas, Europe, and Australia
Even if we send up to a thousand full-time workers, still they would not be enough to meet the need of these places
We planned to first gospelize Taiwan and then bring the truths of the Lord that had been recovered among us to every corner of the world
The raising up of the churches in Australia, Europe, Africa, and America is mainly through the literature in the Lord's recovery
During this period, they should come back every few months to continue to study foreign languages until they can listen, speak, and write

Especially today, seeing the development of this new way, it is truly a broad highway and a rising sun, with a boundless prospect
If the new way solely relies on the working saints to go out knocking on doors in their spare time, it will truly not be adequate
The past forty years that we have gone through proves that the dream has been fulfilled, and now we are still on this broad highway
In this universe there are many galaxies, the sun, the moon, and constellations, which constitute what we call heaven
The earth created by God in His wisdom is not only rich in minerals, but it also produces all kinds of living things
A seed, for example, after being buried in the ground brings forth many grains; this is the propagation of the seed
In verse 12 Paul first mentions gold silver and precious stones and then mentions wood grass and stubble that is first minerals then plants
Paul also says that when a person's work is proved by fire, if it is in the nature of plants, it will be consumed
If it is built with gold, silver, and precious stones, his work is in the nature of minerals; it will remain, and he will receive a reward
In the New Testament, however, pearl is produced not out of the plant life but out of the animal life, out of oysters
When a grain of sand gets into an oyster, not only does it wound the oyster, but the foreign particle also stays within the oyster
When the grain of sand enters into the oyster, the oyster secretes its life-juice, which coats the grain of sand layer by layer
After a period of time it increases to twenty pounds, and after another period of time it may be over a hundred and thirty pounds
The reason human life has such a manifestation is that it is constituted with the elements of minerals, animals, and plants
We know that although jade, crystals, and other such things come from dirt and sand, they are gems and are precious
Without God we are only compositions of minerals, plants, and animals; with God we have a precious element within us that makes us precious
On the one hand we are dirt, sand, wood, grass, and stubble; but on the other hand we are filled with the element of gold
As saved ones, we have truly been blessed with God's special grace, so we should go and preach the gospel everywhere

Generally speaking, after a church service, everyone would simply go home separately, and no one bothered anyone else
If we would choose the Lord and spend time learning to serve Him, we have made the super-choice, the excellent choice
Most of us have received a higher education, and in the church life we are also immersed in the word of God, in God Himself
At that point the New Jerusalem will still be on the earth, but the earth will have become the new heaven and new earth
The foundations of the wall of the city are all precious stones, with at least twelve different kinds of stones
Our human life is excellent, the meaning of our human life is excellent, and the purpose of our human life is excellent
God wants to mingle Himself with us, who are men of clay, to transform us completely into precious stones and pearl
These two aspects are revealed in the New Testament, especially in the Epistles of the apostle Paul, for our attention
In other words, ministers refers to us, the persons, while ministry refers to the commission we bear, the work we do
He became flesh, passed through human living, and went to the cross to die for our sins, resurrected, and became the life-giving Spirit
