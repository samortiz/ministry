<h1 class="title">THE FIRST GOD-MAN&rsquo;S LIVING<br />
A MAN OF PRAYER</h1>
<h1 class="title">(7)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 21:18-22; Mark 11:20-24; Matt. 24:15-22; 26:20-30, 36-46</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2>
<ol class="upper-roman" start="2">
<li>The divine facts in the mystical human life of the first God-man in the record of the synoptic Gospels concerning the first God-man as the King-Savior in the kingdom of the heavens, the Slave-Savior in God&rsquo;s gospel service, and the Man-Savior in God&rsquo;s salvation:
	<ol class="upper-alpha" start="10">
	<li>In cursing the fig tree so that it instantly dried up, the first God-man taught His disciples how to pray by faith&mdash;Matt. 21:18-22; Mark 11:20-24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first God-man&rsquo;s teaching here was according to God&rsquo;s will to be accomplished for the fulfillment of His economy:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The fig tree is a symbol of the nation of Israel (Jer. 24:2, 5, 8).</li>
			<li>The nation of Israel lost her capacity in fulfilling God&rsquo;s economy because of her rottenness.</li>
			<li>Because their condition of not bearing fruit but having only leaves still remained after the first God-man&rsquo;s ministry among them, God intended to give them up&mdash; Matt. 21:33-43.</li>
			<li>At this juncture, the first God-man cursed her to dry up, according to God&rsquo;s will in fulfilling His economy&mdash;Matt. 21:19.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Based upon this background, the first God-man taught His disciples to pray for executing God&rsquo;s will according to His economy by faith&mdash; Matt. 21:21-22.</li>
		<li>Thus, the praying one could have faith in God without doubting, but believing that he had received what he asked for, and he would have it&mdash;Mark 11:24.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In prophesying that the returned Israel in the future will suffer the great tribulation, the first God-man taught them here how to flee by prayer&mdash; Matt. 24:15-22:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>They should ask God that their flight may not be in winter nor on a Sabbath&mdash;v. 20.</li>
		<li>They should believe that God is the One who controls the weather and the surrounding environment.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In His prayer in Gethsemane before He was arrested, judged, and sentenced to be crucified, He prayed and taught His disciples to learn from Him how to pray&mdash;Matt. 26:20-30, 36-46:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>After the Feast of the Passover He taught His disciples how to remember Him by breaking the bread and drinking the cup&mdash;vv. 20, 26-29.</li>
		<li>He was burdened to go to Gethsemane, a quiet place, deep in the night, with His disciples, to pray&mdash;vv. 30, 36.</li>
		<li>He took Peter, John, and James aside and began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed, saying to them, &ldquo;My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death,&rdquo; and asking them to remain there and watch with Him&mdash;vv. 37-38:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>He went forward a little, fell on His face, and prayed, saying, &ldquo;My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will&rdquo;&mdash;v. 39.</li>
			<li>He went away a second time and prayed, saying, &ldquo;My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Your will be done&rdquo;&mdash;v. 42.</li>
			<li>He left them and went away again and prayed a third time, saying the same word again&mdash;v. 44.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The first God-man&rsquo;s prayer here, like all His prayers in the synoptic Gospels, was prayed by Him in His humanity; this prayer here, made by Him when He was exceedingly sorrowful and deeply distressed, corresponds with the one in Paul&rsquo;s writing in Hebrews 5:7 in which He offered up both petitions and supplications with strong crying and tears, asking God to save Him out of death.</li>
		<li>This prayer was after Christ&rsquo;s prayer in John 17 as the conclusion of His divine teaching in John 14&mdash;16 concerning the union, mingling, and incorporation of the processed and consummated Triune God with His chosen and redeemed people, which was prayed in Christ&rsquo;s divinity. (We will cover this prayer in the summer training on the Crystallization-study of the Gospel of John.)</li>
