These few verses show us the relationship between the death of Christ on the cross and the old and new covenants
These three verses speak of two kinds of relationships the Lord's death has with the old and the new covenants
Although they offered to God animals as atonement for their sins, their sins were only covered; these sins were not removed
Through His death He redeemed man from the sins he committed in the first covenant and became the Mediator of the new covenant
His being the Mediator of the new covenant is based on His redemption of the sins of those in the first covenant
A testament means an arrangement made by a testator for the passing of his possessions to his heir at the testator's death
Since He was willing to bear the sins of those in the first covenant, He is also willing to pass on all that is promised in this covenant
Without His death, the old testament could not be complete, for the requirement of its law would not have been met
If the blood of bulls and goats was not able to remove sin, as we mentioned earlier, how then were those in the Old Testament saved?
Although the animals were innocent, and although they were without blemish, they could not redeem man from his sins
Those who offered the sacrifices in the Old Testament, consciously or unconsciously, believed in a coming crucified Savior
As men in the Old Testament looked to a coming Savior and were saved, in the same way we look to a past Savior and are saved
In reading Hebrews 9:12-15 it would be very meaningful if we link together the three 'eternals' in these verses
The word 'one' means that the Lord's sacrifice for sins was perfect; He only needed to redeem man from sins once
To Him, the cross is not merely an event of a certain time, on a certain date of a certain month of a certain year
Before the Lord Jesus left heaven, and while He was still in glory, He knew the suffering of the cross already
Humanly speaking, those in the Old Testament believed in a coming cross, while those in the New Testament believe in a past cross
If the Lord Jesus had not died and had not broken His body, men could not pass through Him and could not enter the Holy of Holies
In the ancient times, unless the high priest had fresh blood of newly offered sacrifices, he would die before the Lord
Since we have such a fresh, redeeming Savior, we should receive Him and come to God through Him to receive forgiveness and blessing
The angels can never forget this, and those ascended and saved ones can never forget the redemption of the cross
He knew that worldly affairs, distractions, and temptations would come and would secretly rob the freshness of the cross from us
When they beheld Jesus on the cross and the way He suffered and was rebuked by men, the love of the cross inspired them and moved them
It is because we lack the eternal fresh revelation of the cross before us that we despise the love of the Lord
If the cross on which the Lord died for us is forever fresh, our crucifixion with Him will also become unchanging
If we see the eternal freshness of the cross and its ever unchanging nature, our death to sin will also be unchanging
If we stumble by accident and we come to Him and confess our sins He will forgive us and the blood of His Son will cleanse us from all sin
In the night, the Israelites may have been in the camp still murmuring, but the burnt offering on the altar continually interceded for them!
Worthy is the Lamb who has been slain to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing'
