   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>9 August 23, 1934 A LETTER FROM TSINAN, SHANTUNG PROVINCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To the brother in the Lord, Mr. Nee:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We thank the Lord for sending His servant, Brother Chang Kuang Jung, to Tsinan for the past two months.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>During this time, God really opened the door for preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Local ones have gradually been raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The ones who have improved the most and are the best are Mr. and Mrs. Ts'ao Tze Hsien.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are local people, and they are well respected in their social status, knowledge, and occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Their heart for pursuing the Lord is really admirable.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are also others who are very promising.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our brothers and sisters have received much help.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They heard many spiritual things that they never heard before, and we have been supplied with much food in life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our brother is really a good mother.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brother Chang went out once last Thursday.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The day after he came back, he was not feeling very well.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He had very bad diarrhea.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He could not eat or drink for two days, so he became physically weak and could not get out of bed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although he tried many cures, he was still not fully restored.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brother Chang wanted very much to return to Shanghai for rest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We did not want to let him go!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But Brother Chang was determined to go home so we reluctantly let him return to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In considering how he left, I am ashamed that I did not know how to serve him better.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although I have a home, we could not care for him or cure him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, I felt it was my fault that he was so desperate to return home.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A very healthy Brother Chang came to Tsinan and a very sick Brother Chang returned to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The brothers and sisters in Shanghai may blame us!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Please forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After Brother Chang returns to Shanghai, he will still need to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I can tell him the results of the tests on his stool sample later, as well as how he should take care of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brother Chang's departure will surely affect the work in Tsinan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The work has not been fully concluded.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are several brothers who need a little more help to make that last step; they have not come to the meetings yet.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The work is more than half done, but there is still a small portion left to finish.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is really too bad.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>May the Lord accomplish what is left through His other servant.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We hope that Brother Chang can come to Tsinan again when he has recovered from his illness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The door of our meeting and the brothers' and sisters' hearts are open and waiting for him to return to Tsinan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We ask the Lord to send him again to do the work He entrusted to him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brother Nee, how is your health lately?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We heard the news that you also were physically weak.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We pray constantly that God will give you a healthy body to finish His work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We also hope that the day will come when we can leave this body of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>May the Lord bless you!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brother Chou Hsin Yi is doing very well in Tsinan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The brothers are very close to him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We also worry about his health.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I will not write more.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Your little brother,</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Ch'ien Neng Sheng</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>June 28</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The meeting in Tsinan:</S>

   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>LETTERS FROM HANGCHOW, CHEKIANG PROVINCE One</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To Brother Yueh Chiao and the brothers in Shanghai:</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I am very peaceful in Hangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I am well in body, soul, and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The brothers in Hangchow are all lovable in the sight of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Everything among the brothers is peaceful, although there is some persecution from the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Inwardly, there is no crack to be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"Filled with peace" can be used to describe the meeting in Hangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I have been helped by the brothers very much here.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>How could someone as weak and ignorant as myself help the brothers in Hangchow?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But if I can receive some help from them, then I have not come in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>My work is to fellowship more with the newly saved brothers, and sometimes there is a mutual exhortation among the brothers who walk in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Finally, I want to ask you a favor; your little brother who is so weak and ignorant needs your prayers more than ever, so that I will not shame the Lord's name and so that I can serve them faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Huang Tsai Ch'ing</S>
