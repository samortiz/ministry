   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. According to the Purpose of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 11 says that we have been made an inheritance according to the purpose of the One who operates all things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God operates all things according to the counsel of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is a difference between God s will and His counsel: the will refers to His intention, and the counsel, to the consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God operates all things according to the consideration of His intention.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His operation is mainly concerned with us; His intention regarding us is to make us His inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In His counsel He considers how to accomplish this; He does not do it without careful consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, a sister may have the intention to bake a very special cake.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But before baking it, she takes counsel with herself to consider how she should go about it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without such consideration, the cake would be ruined in the process of baking.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Likewise, God is making us an inheritance to Himself in a very thoughtful, careful way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God operates all things according to the counsel of His will that we should be to the praise of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that God is doing the finest work with us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No crude work will bring forth praise or appreciation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is the finest work that causes the highest appreciation, out of which comes the highest praise.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because God is working on us in the finest way, we shall be the cause of the greatest appreciation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Lord s recovery we do not care only for the ground of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are here for God s finer work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Among all of today s Christian groups, it is hard to find one group in which God can do a finer work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Probably we are the only group of Christians on earth who give God the opportunity to do a finer work in them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, in the Lord s recovery we are held responsible to afford the Lord the opportunity to do this finer work upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not want to be shallow or to have a movement that is temporary.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, we want to cooperate with God that He may come in to do a fine work among us to bring forth the highest appreciation in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then whenever the angels look at us, they will appreciate what God has done and utter praise to the very God expressed by us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God s work upon us is not simply to improve our behavior or to make us more loving and humble.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a concept is too low.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to allow God to work Himself into our being, to transform every part of us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This will be the finest product in the universe, a product full of God and full of the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way such a fine work will be highly appreciated by the angels and by all positive things; they will then praise God for the glory of His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The word to in verse 12 is a rather insignificant word in English, but it is a strong word in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It may be translated issuing in. This indicates that some kind of appreciation and praise will be brought forth because of us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We shall be the cause of the angelic praise.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the angels look at us, they will appreciate us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, we have not yet fully reached this point.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to go on until we, the New Testament believers, become the cause of the universal angelic praise of the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>HAVING FIRST HOPED IN CHRIST IN THIS AGE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 12 says that we have before hoped in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Greek word translated before can also be rendered first.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We, the believers of the New Testament, are those who have first hoped in Christ; that is, we have hoped in Him in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Jews will have their hope in Christ in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today we have hoped in Christ, but the Jews, who have not, are in a pitiful condition.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>HAVING HOPED IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>BEFORE HIS COMING BACK</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>TO SET UP HIS KINGDOM IN THE NEXT AGE</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have hoped in Christ before Christ s coming back to set up His Messianic kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But the Jews will have hope in Christ after His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because we are full of hope in Christ, we can be made the cause of the universal and angelic praise of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>V. TO THE PRAISE OF GOD S GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Finally, we shall be to the praise of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As we have seen, God is glorified, expressed, in the New Testament believers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This expression is not visible today, but one day it will be visible.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At that time God s expression through the New Testament believers will call forth the universal praise.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our God will be fully expressed and glorified through us and among us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then the entire universe will praise His glory.</S>
