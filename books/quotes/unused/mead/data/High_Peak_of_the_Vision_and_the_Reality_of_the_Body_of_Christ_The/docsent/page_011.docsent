   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE REALITY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Prayer: O Lord, we pray that You will open our eyes that we may really know You, how You as merely God were incarnated, lived a human life, were crucified, and entered into resurrection to become the consummated God with divinity, humanity, the experiences of human living, and the effectiveness of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Lord, You are such a One.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You have become the Spirit, and today You live in us to carry out a particular work in us to make us God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>O Lord, we pray that You will cause us to see.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We want this kind of seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>O Lord, only Your light can kill us, and only Your light can eliminate all our doings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, we need Your mercy; do really shine within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>May You speak to us today, even with an abundance of light, that we may not merely apprehend or understand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What we need is to see.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We receive You as light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Forgive us again for our shortcomings and mistakes and for our not being absolute and our not being faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We really need Your forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have also done numerous things without You, for all of which we need Your forgiveness and the cleansing of Your precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We cannot depend on any merit or any integrity and perfection of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>O Lord, we can be accepted by You and live in Your fellowship only by Your precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is also by Your precious blood that we can overcome our accusing enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>O Lord, because Your enemy is always on our heels, we can only declare that we overcome him by the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Lord, grant us a good fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brothers, I really have the burden to fellowship with you concerning one thing, that is, how God became man and also how He makes man God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The issue of this matter of God becoming man and man becoming God is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This organism is the union and mingling of God with man, and this organism is also the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is what we want to fellowship tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After this, we will go on to see the reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>GOD BECAME MAN TO MAKE MAN GOD</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, we will speak concerning God becoming man to make man God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to what is clearly recorded in the Scriptures, today Christians in general know that, first, God was incarnated; second, He came to live a human life; third, He was crucified; and fourth, He entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These four points are common things in Christianity; everyone knows them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everyone knows that this incarnated One is Jesus, with the four Gospels as His biographical sketches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This Jesus lived a human life for thirty-three and a half years; then He was put to death on the cross, and after three days He was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These four points are so common that they are known even by some non-Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to see, however, that what people generally know about these four points is altogether superficial and is according to the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When they read and reread the New Testament, all people see is something in letter, something literal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They have seen that the New Testament, especially the four Gospels, is concerned with Christ's birth, Christ's life and walk on the earth, Christ's death, and Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, they invent Christmas and the announcing of the good news to declare that Christ was born in a manger in Bethlehem to be the Savior of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They know only this much; nearly no one knows the real significance of the incarnation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today, some seminary professors and some renowned evangelists teach people concerning the stories of Jesus: how He opened the eyes of the blind and made the lame walk, how He loved people and received the little ones, and how He calmed the wind and the sea and raised the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They talk a lot about these things, but they do not really see the real meaning of Christ's human living.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Preachers preach mainly that Christ died for us to make propitiation for our sins, that He loves us and even gave Himself up for us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Besides this they do not have much to say.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The mystics, the inner life people, began in the seventeenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At that time some of them, including Madame Guyon, still remained in the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As a mystic, Madame Guyon spoke in a very mysterious way that was too difficult for people to comprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Later, in the following century, a brother by the name of William Law was raised up in England.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was originally a mystic, and it was he who improved the teachings of mysticism and made them simple and easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Andrew Murray followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By reading the books of William Law, which simplified the mystical teachings, Andrew Murray received help, so he went on further to preach those truths.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His preaching was very good, and he produced a masterpiece entitled The Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some in Christianity had already translated that book into Chinese, but the translation was not very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>So when I was in Taipei I urged several young people to re-translate it and I completely revised the translation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To this day it is still not easy to read that book.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After Andrew Murray two lines emerged.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the one hand there was Mrs. Penn-Lewis.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>She focused on the death of Christ, stressing its negative aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>She showed us how Christ's death dealt with our old man, crossed out our flesh, and destroyed Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Her speaking was excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We may say that she can be considered the first since the dawn of history who spoke concerning the death of Christ in such a profound yet practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the other hand, there was Brother Austin-Sparks, who undoubtedly saw the principle of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Concerning the resurrection of Christ, his speaking was also excellent, yet it was rather mysterious and not easily comprehended.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Over sixty years ago I read a book written by him entitled The Release of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What I read was a pamphlet in English, since it was not translated into Chinese yet.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>That book tells us that the death of Christ not only solved our problems on the negative side but also released the divine life within Him on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The divine life that He released is He Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hence, that book stresses that Christ was the grain of wheat that died in order to release the life within it and thus produce many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I was helped very much.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>That book actually is on the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The death of Christ is a termination.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It put an end to man so that everything related to man the old creation, sin, Satan, and the world was also ended with the ending of man.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Brother Austin-Sparks showed us that the termination of everything of the old creation is only the first half of the death of Christ, which is the negative aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The latter half of the death of Christ is positive, which was to release Himself who is God , His divinity, and His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One time in the Gospels the Lord Jesus said that He was constrained and He longed to die in order to be released Luke 12:50 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Christ died, and through His death the shell of His flesh, which He put upon Himself when He became man, was broken.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is just like the grain of wheat that was sown into the earth and died, thereby completely destroying the shell of the wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Out from the wheat, life was released and sprouts were brought forth; thus, many grains were produced.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We are those grains.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Later, following what Brother Austin-Sparks said, I went on further to say that these grains are ground into powder to form one loaf, which is the Body of Christ.</S>
