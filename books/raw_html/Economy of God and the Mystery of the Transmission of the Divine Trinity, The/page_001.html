The subsequent chapters go on to explain the profound truths and the experience of life related to these four great matters according to the book of Ephesians, the Gospel of John, and the Gospel of Matthew. Following this, the book proceeds to offer guidance to all those who have a heart to serve the Lord full time concerning the building up of themselves in the matters of life, truth, character, learning languages, knowing the church, living a healthy life, and managing personal finances as living witnesses of the Lord, so that they may become useful vessels in the Lordâ€™s hands.</p><p>Although this series of messages was released in the full-time training, the speaking concerning the economy of God and the mystery of the transmission of the Divine Trinity, as well as the words of earnest instruction to the full-time serving ones concerning life, truth, character, living, and finances are topics and lessons intimately related to all of the children of God today. Hence, this book is necessary reading for all of us!</p> <p>The Editorial Section<br>Taiwan Gospel Book Room<br>August 20, 1998</p></td></tr></table></div>
