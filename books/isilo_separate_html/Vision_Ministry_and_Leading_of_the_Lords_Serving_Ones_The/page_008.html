<h1 class="title">BEING LED CORPORATELY</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 1:4-5, 8; 13:1-4</h1>
<p>The four points that we have spoken of in regard to our service&mdash;calling, vision, gifts, and ministry&mdash;are the &ldquo;capital&rdquo; of a Lord&rsquo;s worker. Just as a businessman needs capital to do business and a teacher needs education to teach, we need these four points as our &ldquo;capital&rdquo; in our work for the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING MINISTRY</h2>
<p>Ministry is the issue of the Spirit&rsquo;s constitution. Ministry can be manifested only in a person who has experienced the constituting work of the Spirit. Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis knew the Lord in a deep way, and she was raised up to minister concerning the cross of Christ. Before Mrs. Penn-Lewis was raised up, there was hardly any book on the cross, despite there being over a thousand years of church history. When Mrs. Penn-Lewis came, she preached for at least a decade on our co-crucifixion with Christ on the cross. She founded a magazine called <em>The Overcomer</em> that spoke only of our co-crucifixion on the cross. She spoke on how the cross of Christ ended the old creation and the old man and accomplished God&rsquo;s eternal will. The commission that she received before God was to preach the message of the cross. Her message, however, did not come merely from gifted utterance but from the deeper constitution of ministry in her being; she was the message of the cross. This shows that ministry comes out of the Spirit&rsquo;s constitution over time.</p>
<p>We have no basis for boasting merely because we may have a gift. Instead, we should focus on the manifestation of ministry in us for the church. Through the constituting work of the Spirit, the operation of the Lord&rsquo;s life in us over time will make us the message, and our message will become our ministry. Although I appreciate gifts in the church, I am more fearful of gifts without ministry. We must look to the Lord for His mercy so that we would experience His message-constituting life in order to manifest a ministry of life. We should not treasure the gift of giving a message more than ministry.</p>
<p>The example of Balaam&rsquo;s donkey speaking human language in the Old Testament is helpful in understanding the limitation of gifts (Num. 22:28-30). Balaam&rsquo;s donkey received the ability to speak a human language, but it was still a donkey. Even though it could speak a human language, the donkey did not become human. There was no change in its constitution.</p>
<p>Some people can speak concerning the cross in a clear and appealing way, but they lose control of their temper once they leave the podium. In contrast, Moses, as a genuine servant of God, not only spoke for God but also became a man of God, especially in his old age. Psalm 90 is entitled &ldquo;A Prayer of Moses, the man of God.&rdquo; Moses not only spoke God&rsquo;s words, but he also was a man of God. God&rsquo;s words were constituted into him over a period of several decades. He was a man, but God&rsquo;s words were constituted in him. Consequently, when he was a hundred twenty years old, his speaking to the children of Israel did not come from gift but from ministry. His words were God&rsquo;s words, and his blessings were God&rsquo;s blessings. He not only spoke the word of God with his mouth, but his words manifested the work of God in his being. This is ministry. There must be ministry in the church; the church is strong only when ministry is manifested.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LEADING OF THE WORK BEING CORPORATE</h2>
<p>In addition to calling, vision, gifts, and ministry, the fifth important item in working for the Lord relates to the matter of leading. We must learn to be led. Those who serve the Lord must be led by the Lord, not by their own views, desires, and choices. All our actions must be according to the leading of the Lord. The matter of being led is a very particular aspect of service, and we must look at it carefully.</p>
<p>The Acts of the Apostles present a clear picture of how to work for God. Although many say that Acts speaks of how to receive the Holy Spirit, it presents another matter that is just as important as receiving the Holy Spirit&mdash;the matter of being led. In fact, the apostles received the Holy Spirit through the Lord&rsquo;s leading. The Lord told the disciples not to depart from Jerusalem but to wait for the promise of the Father, the Holy Spirit (1:4-5, 8). If the one hundred and twenty had left Jerusalem and returned to Galilee, they would not have received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. They received the Holy Spirit by following the Lord&rsquo;s leading. Thus, the foremost matter in Acts is not related to receiving the Holy Spirit but to being led.</p>
<p>Acts also shows that the Lord&rsquo;s leading, especially His leading for the work, is rarely an individual matter; it is a corporate matter. The Lord did not tell only Peter to wait in Jerusalem for the Holy Spirit to descend. The Lord told the disciples to wait together in Jerusalem; this is corporate. His leading was not for Peter, John, or Mary individually but to the hundred and twenty corporately.</p>
<p>There is a principle in the Bible that relates to the first mention of a matter; that is, the first mention of a matter establishes the principle of that matter. In Acts the first mention related to the Lord&rsquo;s leading is corporate, not individual. Thus, in 2:14 we do not see individuals; instead, we see &ldquo;Peter, standing with the eleven.&rdquo; Furthermore, even though chapter 8 records Philip preaching the gospel by himself in Samaria, it also shows that part of the Spirit&rsquo;s work was withheld until Peter and John went to pray and lay hands on the Samaritan believers (vv. 14-17). Only then did the Samaritans, who had heard and believed through Philip&rsquo;s preaching, receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. This shows that the Holy Spirit did not confirm the move of an individual, Philip, but rather, the corporate move of the church. Although Philip apparently was being led individually, his leading was associated with the move of the church.</p>
<p>When the flow of God&rsquo;s work advances, people are not brought separately or individually into the flow. In Acts 13 God&rsquo;s work flowed from Jerusalem to Antioch. Verse 2 says, &ldquo;As they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.&rdquo; Although many are working in Christianity today, everyone is doing his own work. However, the apostles were not led separately but corporately in the flow of the Lord&rsquo;s work. Peter was in this flow, John was in this flow, and Paul was in this flow. The move of those who were saved first as well as those who were saved later was in this flow. The flow that began in a corporate way in Acts 2 also flowed until it reached Antioch in chapter 13 in a corporate way. The flow seemed to turn and go westward. At that time, five prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch were led in a corporate way (v. 1). They were not independent prophets and teachers; they were in the church, and their leading was the leading of the church. This speaks of the principle of a corporate leading in the work.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
