   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Church of God includes a vast number of believers, living at different times, and scattered in different places throughout the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How has it come about that all have been united into one universal Church?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With such differences in age, social position, education, background, outlook, and temperament, how could all these people become one church?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is the secret of the oneness of the saints?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By what means has Christianity caused these people, with their thousand differences, to become truly one?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not that, having a grand convention and agreeing to be one, Christians become united.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christian unity is no human product; its origin is purely divine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This mighty mysterious oneness is planted in the hearts of all believers the moment they receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is "the oneness of the Spirit" Eph 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit who dwells in the heart of every believer is one Spirit; therefore, He makes all those in whom He dwells to be one, even as He Himself is one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christians may differ from one another in innumerable ways, but all Christians of all ages, with their countless differences, have this one fundamental likeness the Spirit of God dwells in every one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the secret of the oneness of believers, and this is the secret of their separation from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The reason for Christian unity and for Christian separation is one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is this inherent unity that makes all believers one, and it is this inherent unity that accounts for the impossibility of division between believers, except for geographical reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who do not have this are outsiders; those who have it are our brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you have the Spirit of Christ and I have the Spirit of Christ, then we both belong to the same Church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no need to be united; we are united by the one Spirit who dwells in us both.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul besought all believers to endeavor "to keep the oneness of the Spirit" Eph 4:3 ; he did not exhort us to have the oneness, but merely to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have it already, for obviously we cannot keep what we do not have.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God has never told us to become one with other believers; we already are one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we do not need to create oneness; we only need to maintain it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot make this oneness, since by the Spirit we are one in Christ, and we cannot break it, because it is an eternal fact in Christ; but we can destroy the effects of it, so that its expression in the Church is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Alas! that we have not only failed to preserve this precious oneness, but have actually so destroyed the fruits of it, that there is little outward trace of oneness among the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How are we going to determine who are our brothers and our fellow members in the Church of God?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not by inquiring if they hold the same doctrinal views that we hold, or have had the same spiritual experiences; nor by seeing if their customs, manner of living, interests, and preferences tally with ours.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We merely inquire, Are they indwelt by the Spirit of God or not?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We cannot insist on oneness of opinions, or oneness of experience, or any other oneness among believers, except the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That oneness there can be, and always must be, among the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All who have this oneness are in the Church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In your travels has it not sometimes happened that on a boat or train you have met a stranger, and after only a few moments of conversation you have found a pure love for him welling up in your heart?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That spontaneous outgoing of love was because of the one Spirit dwelling in both hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such inner spiritual oneness transcends all social, racial, and national differences.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How can we know whether or not a person has this oneness of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the verse immediately following Paul's exhortation to keep the oneness of the Spirit, he explains what those have in common who possess this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We cannot expect believers to be alike in everything, but there are seven things which all true believers share, and by the existence or absence of these we can know whether or not a person has the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many other things are of great importance, but these seven are vital.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are indispensable to spiritual fellowship, and they are at once the minimum and the maximum requirements that can be made of any person who professes to be a fellow believer.</S>
