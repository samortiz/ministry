   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TO HAVE THE FULL MUTUALITY In Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Christian meetings should be full of mutuality in speaking Eph 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To fill the Christian meetings with mutuality is not very easy, but to have the mutuality is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whether we come together with fifty, one hundred, or one hundred-fifty, everyone should function.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This creates a mutuality which fills up the entire meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One speaks for one minute, another speaks for half a minute, another speaks for five minutes, someone may speak for eight minutes, and someone else may speak for ten minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By this practice of everyone speaking according to their measure, we all would produce a meeting that is full of mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I hope that we would improve, grow, and advance to a condition where many would speak.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some would speak for forty seconds, others for four minutes, and another for thirty minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We not only need the short speaking; we also need some longer speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There may be a meeting in which many speak in a short way and one would speak in a new, living, refreshing, and high way for perhaps forty minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This would be wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first chapter of Luke illustrates this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this chapter, there are three different kinds of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The record of Elizabeth s speaking is the shortest vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>42-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Mary, the mother of Jesus, spoke for a longer time vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>46-55 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Finally, Zachariah, full of experiences, spoke the longest vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>68-79 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Zachariah s speaking in Luke 1 contains no wasted words, and it is full of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How long you should speak depends upon your age and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Your experience and knowledge of the word of God constitute the content and the length of your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If everyone in the meeting speaks for a short time, and the meeting is full of mutuality, the new ones who come to the meeting will be convinced 1 Cor 14:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They may be shocked at first, asking what kind of meeting this is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They may have been Christians for many years, but they may never have seen a meeting with such mutuality with everyone speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should also learn not to speak lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must speak with weight.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Otherwise, some may say that our speaking does not have much content.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our speaking must be with content.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This needs the proper learning, practice, and training; therefore, the churches should train the saints to speak with content.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we all learn to give living and weighty words whenever and wherever we speak, we will surely be welcomed by all of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the other hand, if we go to the meetings and only sit without saying anything, we will not be appreciated that much.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Learn to speak, but do not speak lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This needs our daily practice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every morning we should contact the Lord, reading a few verses to enjoy the Lord by enjoying His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should pick up something from the Word and practice speaking the Lord the entire day.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This will enrich our being, our person, and this will constitute the proper speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then wherever we go, we will not only have the boldness, but also the practice and habit of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If I go to visit a church and stay for a few days, I cannot refrain from speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am addicted to speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Wherever I go, I must speak the more, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Build up a habit and taste for speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When you speak, you get the firstfruit of the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>While I am speaking, you get some benefit, but I get the firstfruit of the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why I am so strong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Learn to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To merely listen weakens you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the one hand, listening nourishes you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the other hand, if you only listen to others speaking, it does nourish you but it does not allow you to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more help you receive in this way, the more you will eventually die.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must learn to speak, speak, speak.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It would be marvelous if we would learn to speak every item of the contents of chapter one of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We can tell others, The Christian meeting is linked to the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is linked to Christ who has passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should learn to speak these things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Chapter one of this book is enough for the saints in the churches to speak on for one year, day by day and in every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The contents of all my writings are embodied in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The husbands should speak concerning these things to their wives and the wives to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I have been speaking concerning God s economy and the processed Triune God for nearly twenty-five years in the United States, and I have not yet exhausted this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Speaking concerning the Triune God is like cooking American beef in many different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The beef is the same, but the ways of cooking and serving it are many.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Learn to speak concerning the processed Christ all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In other words, learn to speak the same thing all the time 1 Cor 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In order to fill the meeting with mutuality, the primary thing is speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When everyone speaks, the meeting is always full of mutuality.</S>
