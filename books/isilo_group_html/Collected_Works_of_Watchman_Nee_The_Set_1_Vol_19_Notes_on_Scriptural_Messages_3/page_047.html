The Seventh Answer</H2><P>First Thessalonians 4:15 says, "For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are living, who are left remaining unto the coming of the Lord, shall by no means precede those who have fallen asleep."</P><P>This is a strong reason to these ones. They ask if 1 Thessalonians 4:15 is on the rapture. Yes, it is. But what does this verse say? It says that we who are living, who are left remaining unto the coming of the Lord, shall by no means precede those who have fallen asleep. If one group of people will be raptured before the tribulation, whereas most of the people will be raptured at the sounding of the seventh trumpet (at which time the dead will be resurrected), does this not mean that those who are living will precede those who have fallen asleep? First Thessalonians 4 says that we who are living, who are left remaining unto the coming of the Lord, shall by no means precede those who have fallen asleep. This shows that our rapture will not be before the resurrection of the dead. How then can one say that there will be a group who will be raptured before the tribulation, whereas the rest of the people, including the dead ones, will be raptured after the tribulation?</P><P>This verse is comparatively a more reasonable proof among all the verses these ones have quoted. They say that the rapture of the living cannot precede those who have died. However, my Bible says "who are living, who are left remaining unto the coming of the Lord, shall by no means precede those who have fallen asleep." Not only does verse 15 have the words "living, who are left remaining"; verse 17 has the same words. We should not misread these words. Does not "living" mean that these are in the world? Why is there the need to say "who are left remaining" again? If to be "living" is to be alive, and to be "left remaining" is also to be alive, why is there the repetition? The New Testament does not have such repetition for no reason. What then do the words "living, who are left remaining" refer to? The group who are "living, who are left remaining" includes fewer than those who are merely "living." Saying "living" refers only to the believers who are living. But "living, who are left remaining" refers not to all the living believers, but to those who are (1) living and (2) remaining. Therefore, to be "living, who are left remaining" means that another group who is living have been taken away, while this group is not only living but is left remaining. The group which is left behind are the "living, who are left remaining." Being living is versus being dead, while being left remaining is versus being taken away. The "living, who are left remaining" is versus the living who have been taken (raptured). What does it mean to remain? It means that another group has left first. For example, if ten guests are invited, and if we ask how many guests are here, and the answer comes that ten came but that only five are left remaining, this means that the other five have left. Does this not hint that one group has left?</P><P>Our friends ask, "Would this not mean that even Paul has become the second group?" My answer is that Paul did not go on living and was not left remaining anyway. The word "we" that he used does not refer to any persons in particular; it is only a way of expression. It can be compared to the way, in preaching the gospel, when we say that "we" have committed this and that kind of sins. This does not mean that we ourselves have indeed committed this or that kind of sins. Likewise, when Paul mentioned "we," he did not mean to put himself as one of those who will be left behind. It is merely a way of expression.</P><P>Brothers, in making such discernments on these verses, we can see that the proposal that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation is a vain theory; it is an assumption and does not have any basis in the Scriptures. Those who say that the church will go through the tribulation have more of a basis in the facts. However, it is equally wrong to say that the whole church will pass through the tribulation. The Bible says that only those who keep the Lord's word of endurance and who are watchful at every time and beseeching will be raptured before the tribulation. The rest of the people will be raptured only after the tribulation. This is the teaching of the Bible. At any rate, according to the Bible, a minority will be raptured before the tribulation, whereas the majority will be raptured after the tribulation. As to how many raptures there will be and how the raptures will take place, these are things beyond the scope of this message, and we will not delve into them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCLUSION</H2><P>If we are prepared, we will be raptured. If we are not prepared, we will pass through these many tribulations. Therefore, there is only one thing that is sure: either we have to pass through death today, which means that we have to take the way of death, dying to the self-life and the world, so that we can be raptured, or we will have to wait for that day to pass through death. We have to taste death anyway. During these two weeks, I have had the feeling that many believers will pass through the tribulation and will see the Antichrist. But at that time the Holy Spirit will come in double measure. By that time, tongues, prophecies, and miraculous gifts will increase and will become more prevalent than at Pentecost. Therefore, if a person is unfortunately left behind, he has to be strengthened and stand fast. By that time, everyone will have to face the Antichrist. At the same time, every one of us will have to pass through sufferings that no human being can endure. But at that time, we will endure them. If we can be raptured ahead of time, we will praise the Lord for it. If, unfortunately, we are left behind, there is nothing to do but to fight the Antichrist. All of us have to be prepared to fight, sacrifice our life, and engage him in the final struggle in an unrelenting way, until we die.</P><P>Let me say a few more words. Some take the attitude that as long as they are saved, they are satisfied and they would not be bothered about anything more. They do not aspire to be anything, and they do not want to think about what will happen in the future. But I must tell you that by that time, no one will say that he does not want to think about it, because everyone will be forced to think about it. If we are not prepared, and if we are not ready to offer up everything to God, we will not be raptured but will instead be left behind. By that time, if we are Christians and are still around, we will not be able to get by. It may be that those who are not yet born will be more blessed. But those who are born will surely have to go through these things. May we be those who are watchful and prepared.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_046.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_048.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 19: Notes on Scriptural Messages (3) &nbsp; pg 47</div><br></body></html>
