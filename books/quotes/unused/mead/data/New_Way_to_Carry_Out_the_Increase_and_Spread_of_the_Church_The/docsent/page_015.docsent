   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE WAY TO FORM THE VISITING TEAMS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND TO PRACTICE THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF GOSPEL PREACHING Scripture Reading: John 2:23 3:15; 6:26-35; Acts 11:18 The way to form the teams: Not according to personal preference.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But according to the Spirit s leading and the practical situation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The way to practice the new preaching: Drop the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Use the booklets.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Exercise our spirit and faith with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Make a deal and/or an appointment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to carry out the Lord s new move, we have to be careful not to put the new wine into the old wineskins Matt 9:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Otherwise, we will burst the skins and lose our wine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our practice may be too old.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Oldness means opaqueness, opaqueness means darkness, darkness means death, death means killing, and killing means to bring everything to naught.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Based upon this consideration, the fellowship in this chapter is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE WAY TO FORM THE VISITING TEAMS Not According to Personal Preference</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We want to avoid forming the teams to visit others in an old, natural, and personal way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not form the teams according to personal preference.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In everything involved with the church life, including the forming of teams to visit others, we should not have personal preference or choice.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In anything regarding the church life or the church service, once personal preference comes in, that damages everything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It mainly kills the Spirit, so we must do our best to avoid this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are going to be successful in this new way to knock on people s doors, we must drop our personal feeling, our personal preference.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Otherwise, this will kill the Lord s new move among us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must drop our preference and turn ourselves to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The formation of the visiting teams needs much prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should pray, Lord, we are all in the church, and the church is now picking up the new way to go out to knock on people s doors.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Lord, I need co-workers to go out with me, but I do not want to select them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I do not want to have any preference.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Lord, I pray that You would be sovereign in selecting whom I would go out with.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We believe that the Spirit is really with us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Within each one of us, in our spirit, is the Spirit Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You must go along with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To go out to knock on people s doors is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is a matter of life and death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whether people will perish or be gained by the Lord depends on our visiting them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must consider this matter so seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since October of 1984 when I went back to Taiwan, my heart has been on this one thing the new way to spread the kingdom, the new way to get the increase, the new way to spread the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After our experience in Taiwan, I have the confidence with the full assurance that it is the Lord s way to go out to visit people s homes by knocking on their doors and to set up meetings in every home.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First, we studied the situation, and then we put what we had studied into practice in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The results confirmed my understanding and encouraged me to go out to spread this new way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This new way is being carried to all the churches around the globe in all the six continents, and nearly all the churches are practicing this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The news we have received from the churches tells us that this new way is really workable.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>My burden is to help us to realize the Lord s new move, but even in forming the teams for visiting, we may do this in an altogether old way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our way to form the teams may be too old, and our way to knock on the doors may be too old.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even our way to give a testimony might be considered very good, yet it is too old.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All of our oldness should be fully dropped.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I urge you to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not believe in your old way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One and a half centuries ago people used the mule wagon for transportation, but today if you use the mule wagon you will be behind the times and backward.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You should either use an automobile or travel by plane.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many years ago it took a sailing boat about six months to go from California to the Far East.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today it only takes about thirteen hours to fly from Los Angeles to Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must take the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not stay in the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We cannot change the earth, the earth was created by God, but we can improve our way of travel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Air travel has improved tremendously since the invention of the airplane.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In like manner, we cannot change the truth, the divine revelation in the Bible, but we can improve our way to practice the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Why would we not take any step to have any improvement?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Through all the years I have been in the Lord s recovery, by His mercy, one thing I hate is oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the Bible, oldness equals darkness and death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Spiritually speaking, if you are old, you are like a dead person.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whenever I open to a certain portion of the Bible, I exercise not to have any consideration that I know this particular portion.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Every verse is new to me.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I hope you would take my word and be wise.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A wise man is a renewed man.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you are going to be wise, you have to learn to be new, to be renewed day by day 2 Cor 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to form the visiting teams in a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To do this we must drop our personal opinion, personal preference, personal choice.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You have to pray desperately that the Lord would give you the proper persons to go out with.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When Barnabas and Saul of Tarsus were sent out to the nations, they were fasting and praying with three others Acts 13:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then the Lord, the Spirit, spoke to them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In principle it is the same with us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Do not think that to go out to knock on people s doors, even in our neighborhood, is different from Barnabas and Saul s visit to foreign countries.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In principle, it should be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should not go out to knock on people s doors on our own.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Then our knocking on people s doors might be a damage to them instead of a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We do not want to bring damage to people but blessing, so there is the need of much prayer.</S>
