If we have seen the church, we will never be divided by anything. If we are clear concerning the vision of the church, we will never have hierarchy. For one to place bishops above elders indicates that he has not seen that the church is a living Body, an organism. The church cannot be controlled by human organization. Hierarchy is human organization.</P><P>Because the church is the organic Body of Christ, it can have nothing to do with organization. If something is wrong in our physical body, it is healed organically. The body is an organism. It cannot be touched or dealt with in an organizational way. The church is an organism. The church is not only the Body of Christ but also the new man. Just as the life within our physical body takes care of sicknesses, the life within the Body of Christ can take care of any problem. If there are some problems in a local church, it is best if we keep our hands off of these problems and leave them to Christ, the heavenly doctor. He is the life in the Body. We need to let the life in the Body work within the Body. Our own doing apart from this life is organization, and this will not help the Body but damage the Body. When we see problems in the church, we need to learn to hold back our being and our doing.</P><P>Every problem and trouble in the church is a temptation to the leading ones. If the leading ones in the churches hold themselves back when there is a problem, that is a great victory. The biggest temptation to the leading ones in the churches is the troubles and problems in the churches. They may feel that they have to do something to solve these problems. While we are doing something, however, we can be in the realm of organization, which damages the Body. We need to restrain our doing and let the life in the Body take care of the troubles and the problems. If we do this, it means that we know that the church is not an organization but the organic Body of Christ. If a person cuts his finger, he may need to take care of it in a proper way. But if he takes care of it improperly, he will do more damage to it. Eventually, the cut on his finger will be healed by the life within his body. The church is not an organization but an organism. Church history has shown that organization has damaged the church.</P><P>We all need to see what the church is. If we see the church as the corporate goal of God, whatever we do will be profitable to the Body. Because the defenders of the truth in the past lacked the proper knowledge of the church, they made mistakes that damaged the church. Today in the Lord's recovery we need to see the church, to see the Body. Then whatever we do will be a profit and will never be a loss or a damage to the church. The vision of the church is our safeguard and balance. As long as we stand with the church, we are safe. If we stay away from the church, we are in danger of damaging the church. May the Lord be merciful to us that we may see that opinions, organization, rank, and different teachings damage the church life. This damage takes place because people do not have an adequate vision of the church. Today in the Lord's recovery, the Lord desires to show us the ultimate goal of His purpose&#151;the church life.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The History of the Church and the Local Churches &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
