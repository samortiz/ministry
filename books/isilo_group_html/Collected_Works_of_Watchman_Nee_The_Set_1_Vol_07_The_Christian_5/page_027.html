This was the word of the magi when they were looking for Christ. When Ezekiel in his vision saw the glory of Jehovah returning, it came from the east (Ezek. 43:2). Geographically speaking, in the Bible the east also refers to the east of Jerusalem.</P><P>The eyes of the earnest students of prophecy are concentrated on the uninhabited land of Palestine and on the landless people, the Jews.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED IN THE EAST</H2><P>Mr. ______, the chancellor of the American University ______, said, "The Near East needs many trained people in commerce and sociology." He said further, </P><P CLASS=INDENT1>The local qualified leaders should become the power base of peaceful and honest commerce and politics, and of progress and prosperity in science. Worthless leaders have cast the Near East into a corrupt, cliquish, and conservative age that is intolerant of religion and lacking in real power.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Learned people have realized the need for capable men to rise up to lead the people. Hence, we can see that the kind of person described by Daniel, who is both learned and capable, will soon be accepted as the leader and a power (Dan. 11:36).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHAT THE EAST DOES NOT NEED</H2><P>This same person said,</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>The people of the Near East will no longer be subjected to the masters in the West.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Soon after the War, many rebellions occurred in Egypt. The revolution in Syria has taken place, and Persia has obtained freedom from the hands of England and Russia. Iraq's riots have caused ______ to sign a treaty with King ______, so that it has gained autonomy in most areas. The former dynasty of ______ has been chased out by a Muslim king in northern Arabia. This king, who is not under the influence of Europe, is now ruling that land. Turkey has been freed by its local Christians, and its nation has been removed from the center of European activity; it has abolished compromising treaties and has declared its own independence. Mr. ______ has been killed, the consulate general in Germany has been killed by the Persian refugees, and Mr. ______ has been humiliated.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>The same riotous condition appears in China. The daughter of one writer wrote in her letter that their mission has been attacked. The rioters were not the excited crowd, but nominal Christians who wanted to take over the control of the gospel work in China. They did not recognize Christ as all and in all. They believe that the Chinese should rule China. They have not realized that the ambition that is seen in international politics is no different from the ambition in which Christians vie to please one another.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DESCRIPTIONS OF THE EAST</H2><P>The same professor noted,</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Local leaders have indeed been raised up. The important thing is to have the recognition of suitable leaders. The nature of the people in the East is to dislike interference from the West, and hence in the future there will be much reliance on the proper local leaders, plus men who have great foresight and who have been trained in the new principles in business. Moreover, sociology is one great and pressing work.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Before the War, the Near East was under the ruling of the old regimes. The autocracy of the few and their corruption occupied the main part of their lives. There were few modern and effective methods in commerce, administration, industry, and in agriculture as well.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>In summary, the hindrance toward the prosperity of the countries east of the Mediterranean is a result of backwardness. During the European War, the many battles, famines, and the shifting of population have lowered the standard of society and economic conditions to a great degree.</P><P>What we have quoted shows that what is needed under the situation described is influential and noteworthy men from the West, and not the so-called "local leaders," "men with foresight," "commercial and sociological experts." Satan will produce such a man, because he will gain what he is after in this final work of his.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 07: The Christian (5) &nbsp; pg 27</div><br></body></html>
