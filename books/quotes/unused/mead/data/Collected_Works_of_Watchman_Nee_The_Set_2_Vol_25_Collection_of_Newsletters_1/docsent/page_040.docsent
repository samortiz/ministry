   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Question: Regarding the pastoral system.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Answer: This question involves church organization.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From the Bible, we see, on the one hand, that the church is the house of God 1 Tim 3:15 , and on the other hand, that it is the Body of Christ Eph 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is a household made up of many people, and it is also an organically constituted Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the aspect of the house of God, the church is an organization of many people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the aspect of the Body of Christ, it is an organic entity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although the house of God includes all of God's children, its chief manifestation is within the boundaries of a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although the Body of Christ is seen in many places, its most important manifestation is the inclusion of all of the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The chief manifestation of the house of God is in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The chief manifestation of the Body of Christ is in all the believers throughout the ages all over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The house of God is visible, and it refers to the outward appearance of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Body of Christ is spiritual and in life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is organic and cannot be organized by man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man can do things in the aspect of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, there is no room for man's hand in the aspect of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is the absolute Head and Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since the church has these two aspects, there are also two aspects to its organization offices and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Offices are related to the aspect of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The house of God directs and guides through the offices.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The gifts are related to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Body of Christ is built up and brought on through the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The offices are for managing the affairs in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are only two offices: the eldership and the deaconhood.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These two offices are only for a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are apostles above these two offices.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Apostles According to the Bible, the first office is the apostleship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Apostles are gifts Eph 4:11 as well as an office Rom 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This office is not for one local church; it is for the entire church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The apostle establishes elders and deacons in every locality to manage each local church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Each individual local church only has the offices of elders and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There are three offices in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are the apostles, elders, and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The apostles are for the entire church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The elders and deacons are for the individual local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Elders They are appointed by the apostles Acts 14:23 , or they are appointed by others at the apostles' command 1 Tim 3:1-2; Titus 1:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Timothy and Titus were both directed by the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Timothy himself was also an apostle see 1 Thes 1:1; 2:6 , so he had the authority to rebuke sinful elders 1 Tim 5:20, "the ones who sin" refers to the elders in the preceding verse .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The elders are the overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Acts 20:17 says that they are elders, and verse 28 says that they are overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Titus 1:5 says they are elders, and verse 7 says they are overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The elders work together with the apostles Acts 15:2, 4, 6, 22; 16:4; 21:18; 1 Tim 4:14; compare 2 Tim 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The apostles are responsible for building up the entire church; the elders are responsible for governing a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The elders are responsible for doing the following in their localities: 1 governing a local church as an overseer Acts 20:28; 1 Tim 5:17; 1 Pet 5:1-2 ; the elders are stewards in the house of God Titus 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Acts 15 refers only to the elders in Jerusalem, not the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This proves that the elders are responsible for governing a local church; 2 administrating finances in a local church Acts 11:29-30 ; therefore, an elder must not be "fond of money" 1 Tim 3:3 ; 3 anointing and praying for the sick James 5:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The word elders is plural.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God never uses just one individual to care for a church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Bible always says "the elders" Acts 11:30; 1 Tim 4:14; Acts 15:2, 4, 6, 22; 16:4; 20:17; 21:18; 1 Tim 5:17; James 5:14 ; "appoint elders in every city" Titus 1:5 ; "appointed elders...in every church" Acts 14:23 ; "the overseers" Phil 1:1 .</S>

   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Deacons They are chosen in each locality and established by the apostles Acts 6:3-6; 21:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is not enough for the church to choose them; they must also be established by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The apostles only establish; they do not choose or decide.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The local church chooses and decides on the people, and the apostle comes to establish them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, the elders are not selected by the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The apostle or those whom the apostle appoints select and establish the elders.</S>

   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, the elders are older, and the deacons are younger.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There are also many deacons: "the deacons" Phil 1:1 ; "deacons" 1 Tim 3:8, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There are also deaconesses Rom 16:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The elders can only be men, but there can be female deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Because the man is the head 1 Cor 11:3 , only brothers can be the head to govern the local church as the elders; the sisters may not.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, both brothers and sisters can serve as deacons in the church.</S>
