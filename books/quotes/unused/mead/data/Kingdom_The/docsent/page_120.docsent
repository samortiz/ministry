   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE KINGDOM AS A REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the third point of following the Lord Jesus during the time of His rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>While we are following Him in the kingdom life, we have to realize the kingdom as a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The kingdom does not have an outward, formal appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Religion, on the contrary, has altogether a false appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Religion cares for the outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you visit the so-called Christian churches at the eleven o'clock service on Sunday morning, you will find that everything appears nice outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everyone is neat and clean, kind and good.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But that is a formal, outward falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do you think that the people attending the service are really that clean, kind, humble, and nice?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Look at the choirs and at every aspect of the service do they have reality?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the words of Matthew 15:2, they wash their hands outwardly, but their heart is defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They may cleanse their hands, but their heart is corrupt and dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The so-called church services are outwardly very quiet, and they would condemn us for shouting and praising in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Outwardly, religiously, and formally, the people are quiet and everything is in order, but inwardly, they are full of confusion and corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here is the main point: in the kingdom we must not be concerned about the outward washing of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the outward situation is a mess, don't try to change it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Leave it the way it is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you have long hair, don't cut it short just to appear nice outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may have short hair and appear outwardly to be a very nice person, but inwardly you may be corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not be concerned with the outward appearance; the reality of the kingdom is not in the outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The reality of the kingdom is something inward.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What about your heart?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What about your motive?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What you really are is decided not by your outward conduct, but by what is in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Outwardly, you may be neat, clean, pure, kind, and orderly, but inwardly you may be completely different.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, you are not full of reality, but full of hypocrisy and falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here the Lord Jesus revealed His wisdom to the Pharisees and hypocrites.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He dealt with the actual situation of their inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Pharisees needed to realize that there was nothing good within their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What comes out of our heart?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Does love or purity or honesty or sincerity come out of our heart?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Matthew 15:18-19 the Lord did not mention one good thing that issues out of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a revelation showing us what we really are.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By nature and by birth we are ruined and corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Never think that you are good.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although you may outwardly seem to be good, inwardly you are defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you would say to me that I appear nice outwardly, but that inwardly I am not good, I would say that you are absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sisters, you are lovely and nice outwardly, but not inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By birth and by nature, we are all totally corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord's word shows us what proceeds out of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>So in the kingdom it is not a matter of outward conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Forget about the outward behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The kingdom is not a pretense; the kingdom is a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Don't worship God by the outward washing of your hands.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord does not care for that and even considers that as vain worship Matt 15:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I myself was more than religious.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I was taught, trained, instructed, and even built up in a religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I was trained to come to the meeting in a proper order and with a proper appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Gradually, the Lord showed me that all of this was simply the outward washing of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, if we purposely and intentionally attempt to have a wild religion, that also is entirely outward.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It will be an outward, unpolished religion.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The kingdom is a reality, and there is nothing false in it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What does it mean to be real?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It means that everything comes out of our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Don't pretend.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Let everything proceed out of what you are.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the kingdom life, every point and every aspect must be real and genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Don't be concerned about the outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We all must take care of our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Yet we need to realize that our natural being is ruined and corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should not attempt to change or correct it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What, then, should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The answer is found in the case of the Canaanite woman Matt 15:21-28 .</S>
