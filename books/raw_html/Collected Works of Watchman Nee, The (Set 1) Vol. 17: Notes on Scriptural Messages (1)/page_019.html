<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 PETER 1:3-9</H2><P>Verses 3-4: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, unto an inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in the heavens for you." These two verses tell us that those who received this Epistle have been saved.</P><P>Verse 5: "Who are being guarded by the power of God through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed at the last time." What is the faith referred to here? It is the same faith which the righteous live by in Hebrews 10:38. Although they are saved, they still have not obtained the salvation which is ready to be revealed at the last time. It is good to be regenerated, but it is not sufficient. We still need to gain the salvation ready to be revealed at the last time.</P><P>Verses 6-8: "In which time you exult, though for a little while at present, if it must be, you have been made sorrowful by various trials, so that the proving of your faith, much more precious than of gold which perishes though it is proved by fire, may be found unto praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ; whom having not seen, you love; into whom though not seeing Him at present, yet believing, you exult with joy that is unspeakable and full of glory." These verses say that because of the salvation that is to come, one is able to rejoice in spite of the various trials.</P><P>Verse 9: "Receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls." Again, this verse clearly speaks of the salvation of the soul. Peter is also one who says that those who have been regenerated need a further salvation, the salvation of the soul. When will one receive this salvation? It will be received at the last time, which is the time of the Lord's manifestation on the earth. The final end of every saved person is the same, but in the kingdom there are differences. It is true that once we believe on the Lord, we are saved. But our soul also must be saved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 PETER 2:11</H2><P>"Beloved, I entreat you as strangers and sojourners to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul." When the lusts war against the soul, the soul profits nothing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 PETER 2:25</H2><P>"For you were like sheep being led astray, but you have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls." Let us lay hold of this verse; we do have a Shepherd who oversees our souls.</P><P>Finally, I want to mention two more verses. Let us pay attention to them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 PETER 4:17-19</H2><P>"For it is time for the judgment to begin from the house of God; and if first from us, what will be the end of those who disobey the gospel of God? And if the righteous man is saved only with difficulty, where will the ungodly and sinner appear? So then let those also who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator." Let us lay hold of God's word. We are God's house already. Yet judgment begins from the house of God. Some of the righteous ones are scarcely saved! So brothers and sisters, we must suffer according to the will of God and commit our souls to the faithful Creator! We must not hold back anything for the soul-life or allow the soul-life to have enjoyment. Rather, let us suffer according to the will of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>2 PETER 1:10-11</H2><P>"Therefore, brothers, be the more diligent to make your calling and selection firm, for doing these things you shall by no means ever stumble. For in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly and bountifully supplied to you." The fact that these ones were called brothers shows that they were saved. However, they still needed to be more diligent to make their calling and election firm. Eternal life, once received, cannot be shaken. But in the kingdom, some shall be shaken.</P><P>Let us compare the two phrases: "saved only with difficulty" and an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ being "richly and bountifully supplied." The one is scarcely saved and has not advanced any further than regeneration. It is like obtaining only a mark of 70 when the lowest passing mark is 70. This is a half salvation. We must be one unto whom the entrance into the kingdom is richly and bountifully supplied.</P><P>I will now relate a story to illustrate this point. At the end of the European War, there was a huge celebration in London. The turnout was unprecedented in the history of London. The war had just concluded, and the soldiers were having a victory parade and were there to be welcomed by the crowd. As the soldiers paraded through, the people cheered and applauded. In the minds of many, were it not for the courage of these soldiers, England could not have been saved. The applause persisted as the soldiers marched onward step by step. While the units passed by rank after rank, suddenly, there was a crescendo of applause; in fact, many started weeping. The nobility saluted, and even the king took off his crown. What had happened? Trailing behind was car after car of soldiers who had either broken arms, injured legs, missing limbs, or serious wounds. These were the ones who were wounded in battle. They were received with the greatest honor and respect. The soldiers who marched ahead of them made it; however, the glory they received could hardly be compared to that of these wounded soldiers.</P><P>Those who are scarcely saved will enter into heaven on that day, but they will not have a rich and abundant entrance into God's kingdom. If we have suffered on earth and forsaken things for the Lord's sake, on that day we will enjoy what those wounded soldiers enjoyed in their triumphant procession. The applause will be loud, the praises will be great, and the glory will also be great. Every one of us should endure pain and suffer loss for the Lord's sake. On that day, we will receive a crown on our head. Our soul must be saved. May we be poorer, may we suffer more, and may we forsake all for the Lord's sake. May God bless us.</P>
