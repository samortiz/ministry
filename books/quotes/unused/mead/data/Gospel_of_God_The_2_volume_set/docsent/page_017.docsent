   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO GOD'S LOVE, GRACE, AND MERCY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Tonight we will consider God's love and grace, and we will also touch the subject of God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many times the Old Testament says that salvation is of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that salvation does not originate with us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since sin is committed by man we would naturally think that salvation also originates in man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But even the thought of our salvation did not originate with us; rather, it originated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although man has sinned and is destined for perdition, it is not his intention to seek salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Though he has sinned and ought to perish, it was God who took up the thought of saving him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, the Old Testament mentions again and again that salvation is of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The reason for this is that it is God who wants to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man has never wanted to save himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why is salvation of Jehovah?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why is God interested in man?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In a general way, we can say that it is because God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But more specifically, it is because God loves man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If God did not love man, He would not need to save him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Salvation is accomplished because, on the one hand, man has sinned and, on the other hand, God has loved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If man had not sinned, there would be no place and no way for the love of God to be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And if man had sinned but God had not loved, nothing would have been achieved either.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Salvation is accomplished and the gospel is preached because on the one hand God has loved and on the other hand man has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Man's sin shows us man's need.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's love shows us God's provision.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If there is only the need without the provision, nothing can be done.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if there is the provision without the need, the provision will be wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Salvation is accomplished and the gospel is preached due to the two greatest facts in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first is that man has sinned and the second is that God loves man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These are two immutable facts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are two facts that the Bible emphasizes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you drop either of these two ends, salvation will be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You do not need to drop both ends.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As long as one end is gone, there will be no possibility for salvation to be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God has love and man has sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because of these two facts, there is salvation and there is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>GOD'S LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible never fails to point out the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In our Bible study this time, we will cover the truth of the gospel only in a sketchy way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We will mention a lot of things, but will not consider them in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Tonight I cannot cover every aspect concerning the love of God found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I can mention this matter only briefly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must consider three aspects of the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First, God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Second, God loves man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>And third, the expression of God's love is in the death of Christ.</S>
