   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our Christian walk is a spiritual walk.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our soul should be under our spirit's direction with our body under our soul's usage.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First Corinthians 2 tells us that the spirit of man knows the things of man v. 11a and that the spiritual man discerns all things v. 15a . Without our spirit, we cannot know who we are.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without our spirit we cannot understand the things of man.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our human spirit is the spiritual organ for us to know the things concerning man and eventually to know the things concerning God.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To see these four great things, John needed to be in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to be in our spirit to see all the heavenly visions.</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to follow their example by living in our spirit behaving, acting, and walking in our spirit doing things, thinking things, and speaking things altogether in our spirit.</S>
