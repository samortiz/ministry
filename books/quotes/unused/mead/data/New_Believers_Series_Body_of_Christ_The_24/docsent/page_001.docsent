   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 1:23; 4:11-13; 5:29-30; Gen 2:21-24; 1 Cor 10:16-17; 12:12-30; Rom 12:4-8 I. THE CHURCH BEING OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 2 shows us that God took a rib from Adam and made Eve out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This typifies the relationship between Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Just as Eve came out of Adam, the church comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God made Eve out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Likewise, He created the church out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God gave us not only the grace, power, and nature of Christ, but He also gave us the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has given us His bones, His flesh, and Himself, even as He gave Adam's rib to Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What then is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible shows us that Christ is the Head of the church and the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Individually speaking, every Christian is a member of the Body of Christ and comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is one thing we must take note of: The Body of Christ is on earth, but it is not earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is heavenly, yet it is on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Saul was persecuting the church, on his way to Damascus, the Lord Jesus asked him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Acts 9:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord's word was quite strange.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He did not say, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting My disciples," but "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He did not say, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting My church," but "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This showed Paul that the church and Christ are one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church is one with Christ, so much so that when a man persecutes the church he is persecuting Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This shows us also that the Body of Christ is on earth, because no one could persecute it if it were in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Body of Christ is on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, Paul could persecute it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because the Body of Christ is the church on earth, Paul's persecuting of the church was his persecuting of the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many people say that the manifestation of the Body of Christ is something that will occur in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They say that one has to wait until he is in heaven before he can see the manifestation of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If this were the case, Paul's persecution of the church could not have been considered as his persecution of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord said that Saul persecuted Him when he persecuted the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, the Body of Christ is manifested on earth, not in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church as the Body of Christ is on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to express this Body while we are on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although the Head is in heaven, the Body and the Head are one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Body on earth and the Head in heaven are one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To persecute the Body is to persecute the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To persecute the church is to persecute the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The two are one, and there is no way to separate them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some may ask, "How could the Body of Christ be expressed on earth during Paul's time?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From the time Paul was on earth until now, one thousand nine hundred years have passed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every year countless numbers of people throughout the world are saved and added to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many more will be added in the coming days and years.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How could the church at Paul's time be called the Body of Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One brother in the last century gave a good answer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He said that the church is like a bird.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When it first hatched, the feathers were not well developed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet we can say that it was a bird.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When it becomes full grown, we still say that it is a bird.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Feathers from elsewhere are not added to the bird; they grow from the bird itself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The growth and maturity of the bird are the result of the inward activities of the bird's life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is how the church grows on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although Paul persecuted the church in its infancy, it was nevertheless the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From that time on until today, nothing has been added to it; it has only become more full grown.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although the church on earth today is still very small in size, it is nevertheless perfect within.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The growth of the church issues from within itself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It grows out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The church on earth today is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Apparently, saved ones are being added to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But as far as its spiritual reality is concerned, no one has ever joined the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Body of Christ grows by itself from within.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It grows continually out of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The church is simply the extension of the Body of Christ on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The church dwells on earth but comes out of the heavenly Head.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At the same time, it is a Body in oneness with the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must be clear about what the church is in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, anything smaller than the Body cannot be the basis for the formation of a church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We cannot establish a church based on doctrines, systems, or rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Neither can we establish a church based on the name of a founder or a place of origin.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All these are smaller than the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we want to start a church in a locality, we must learn to stand on the ground of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must welcome and accept all the members who have fellowship in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Whoever is in the Body and of the Body is a brother or sister in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we stand in the position of the Body of Christ, our number may be small, but we will still have a proper basis for forming the church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, if we do not stand on the position of the Body of Christ, we will have no basis to form any church, even though our number may be very great.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Once a church which takes the Body of Christ as its basis is established in a locality, no one should separate himself to set up another church under the pretense of differences in doctrines, views, or opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The basis of the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The desire to uphold a certain doctrine is not a justifiable basis for forming a church.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If the basis of the first "church" is not the Body of Christ, one can, of course, set up a church that is based on the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But if the basis of the first church is indeed the Body of Christ, we must fellowship with it.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We cannot walk away and form another "church" of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>A local church should include all the children of God in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The church takes the Body of Christ as its basic unit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If other brothers and sisters will not come, that is their own concern.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But the church should not impose any condition upon anyone other than the need to acknowledge the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The Body is the only condition for forming a church.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A church cannot be smaller than the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In other words, whoever is of Christ should be in the church; whoever is in the Body of Christ may not be rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>However, to accept anyone who is not in the Body of Christ or to embrace unbelievers is to go beyond the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>That would no longer be the church of Christ; it would be an organization of confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In conclusion, whatever falls short of the Body of Christ or goes beyond the Body of Christ is not the church.</S>
