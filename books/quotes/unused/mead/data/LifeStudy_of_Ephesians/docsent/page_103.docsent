   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-SIX KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians 4:1 says, I beseech you therefore, I, the prisoner in the Lord, to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This verse is somewhat a repetition of 3:1, which begins the apostle s exhortation in chapters four through six.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that 3:2-21 is all parenthetical.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>WALKING WORTHILY OF GOD S CALLING</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The book of Ephesians is divided into two main sections.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first, composed of chapters one through three, reveals the blessing and the position which the church has obtained in Christ in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Chapter three, in particular, reveals how the church comes into existence in a practical way through being constituted with the riches of the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The second section, comprising chapters four through six, charges us concerning the living and responsibility the church should have in the Spirit on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The basic charge is that we should walk worthily of the calling, which is the totality of the blessings bestowed upon the church, as revealed in 1:3-14.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the church, under the Triune God s abundant blessing, the saints should walk worthily of the Father s selection and predestination, the Son s redemption, and the Spirit s sealing and pledging.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In walking worthily of God s calling, the church must have a certain kind of life and also bear responsibility to the full extent.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, in chapters four through six we see, on the one hand, the living the church should have, and, on the other hand, the responsibility the church should bear.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In exhorting the saints to walk worthily of God s calling, Paul spoke from his status as a prisoner in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His status as an apostle of Christ through the will of God authorized him to reveal the things concerning the church, to speak concerning the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, his status as a prisoner in the Lord qualified him to exhort us to walk worthily of God s high calling.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul s living was surely worthy of God s calling.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, he bore the responsibility required by this calling.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 3:1 Paul speaks of himself as the prisoner of Christ Jesus, but in 4:1 he says that he is the prisoner in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To be a prisoner in the Lord is deeper than to be a prisoner of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As such a prisoner, Paul was a pattern for those who would walk worthily of God s calling.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To walk worthily of God s calling, to have the proper Body life, we need firstly to care for the matter of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must keep the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is crucial and vital to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Oneness, strictly speaking, differs from unity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Unity is formed by many people uniting together, whereas oneness is the one entity of the Spirit within the believers making them all one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some Christians may have a certain kind of unity, but we in the Lord s recovery appreciate oneness much more than unity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the Lord s recovery, we are not united that is, we have not formed a certain kind of union but we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our oneness is a Person, even the Lord Jesus Himself realized as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today the Lord is the life-giving Spirit within us, and this Spirit is our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, our oneness is not an objective Person far away in the heavens; it is a subjective Person indwelling us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This oneness is similar to the electricity in many lights that makes them all one in the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although there may be dozens of lights in a large room, they are one in the electricity that flows within them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In themselves, the lights are not one; neither are they united to form one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The unique electricity in the lights is their oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This electricity does not unite the lights; it is the oneness within them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In themselves, the lights are individual and separate, but in the electricity they have oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is the same in principle with the believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Spirit indwelling us is our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 4:3 this oneness is called the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The oneness of the Spirit is actually the Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the illustration of the electricity and the lights, the oneness of the electricity is the electricity itself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is not another element, apart from the electricity, that is the oneness of the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The oneness of the electricity is simply the electricity itself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the same principle, the oneness of the Spirit is not something apart from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the contrary, it is the Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The oneness within us and among us is the very life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, to keep the oneness is to keep the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many Christians talk about unity or oneness but neglect the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This indicates that they make oneness something separate from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The more talk certain believers have had about unity, the more divided they have become.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some can even argue with one another in a fleshly way over the matter of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is no need for us to talk so much about oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Oneness is like a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we do not talk about it, the dove is present with us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But if we talk about it, it flies away.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we talk a great deal about oneness, we are in danger of losing it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We do not keep the oneness by talking about it; we keep it by staying in the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As long as we love the Lord and embrace Him, we keep the oneness; for, as we have strongly emphasized, oneness is the Person of Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Keeping the oneness of the Spirit implies that we already have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we did not have Him, how could we keep Him?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, most Christians live apart from the Spirit most of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Any action taken apart from the life-giving Spirit is divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we are one with the Spirit, living according to Him and doing all things in Him, we keep the oneness without making any conscious effort to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But whenever we act apart from the Spirit, we are divisive and lose the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, instead of charging you to talk about oneness, I would encourage you to take care of the life-giving Spirit, who is the Lord Himself as life within you.</S>
