   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SMALL GROUP BEING THE LIFE PULSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The small group is the life pulse of the present practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the past year and a half, the number of saints in the church has in fact increased, but the rate of increase is not that encouraging.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The reason for this low rate is that the small groups have not yet been worked out and are not strong enough.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If our small groups are strong, we will surely have a great increase in number.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I hope that the saints will change their concept to see that the content of the church life is based mainly on small group meetings and not on big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then in our daily life the small groups can function in mutuality to care for and visit the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we mainly have big meetings, we will be unable to take care of the aspect of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This would be regrettable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I hope that the brothers and sisters will clearly see that only by the small groups can the church life be extended to and realized in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>EVERY MEMBER OF THE SMALL GROUP</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>BEING A CORE MEMBER</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Question: If there are not enough core members in a small group, but the number of people exceeds twelve, should we still divide into two groups?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Answer: I regret mentioning the term core member.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have already said that there are no leading ones, and there should not be any in a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everyone is a leading one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, when we speak of core members, we are referring to every member in the small group.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not consider that some are core members and others are not; rather, we should all labor together.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A change in system is always difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At first we may think that every small group must have some so-called core members to bear the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, if this is our thought, the small group will collapse once these core members are not doing well.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the other hand, if all the saints are willing to bear the responsibility, everyone will be a core member.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we divide the group, making the number smaller, each group will be strong and propagating, even if it is weak temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To bring up the matter of core members shows that this religious concept is still in our blood.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We cannot give our flesh any opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once we give a little ground to our flesh, religion will immediately come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whoever thinks that only a few saints are core members is religious.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the church has a perfecting training for core members, who would be the candidates?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every saint would be a candidate!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all are core members.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I truly hope that there will be a small group meeting in every saint s home.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we would do this, there will be a great revival of the church, and Taiwan will be gospelized.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>EVERY SAINT HAVING A SMALL GROUP MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>AT HOME EVERY WEEK</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In principle, after a Christian is saved, he should have a home meeting at least once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a reasonable thing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Based on the patterns shown in the Bible, we see that if anyone is willing to open his home every week and afford his friends, relatives, and neighbors the opportunity to hear the gospel, the gospel will spread into his whole family, saving his household from sin and temper, while at the same time, bringing in much of the Lord s blessing and shining.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Husbands and wives are prone to quarrel and argue.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the weekly home meeting will save the couple from quarreling.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometimes we may be weak, and we may not have read the Bible for the whole week.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But we will at least read the Bible once a week in the small group.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Reading the Bible fifty-two times a year is also a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I beseech the elders to take this matter seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to know that in order to make the meeting hall or church where we are prosperous and fruitful, we must labor on the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the only way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must do it successfully.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not establish small group meetings merely in the homes of strong believers; rather, ask every saint to open his home for the small group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If every home is opened for the Lord once a week, the Lord will pour out His blessing beyond measure.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>OPENING EVERY HOME RESULTING IN</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A REVIVAL OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our love for the Lord should not be only in word but in deed and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To open our homes for the Lord is the greatest expression of our love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This will not only bring us the blessing but also a revival from God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must see this fact clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have this saying among us, Heaven and earth may pass away, but the small group meetings must never be forsaken.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have labored on big meetings for more than twenty years, and we have delayed much of the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now we must be awakened to work on the small groups and allow the Lord to have a way.</S>
