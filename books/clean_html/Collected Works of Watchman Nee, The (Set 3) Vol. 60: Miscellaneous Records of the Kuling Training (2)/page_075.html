<h2 class="head1">THE LORD'S SECOND COMING<br />RESOLVING ALL THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD</h2><h2 class="head2">Injustice</h2><p>This world has many fundamental problems that man cannot solve. They can only be resolved when the Lord comes again. The first thing that will be resolved when He comes again will be justice. In this world, there are oppressors and there are the oppressed. There are exploiters and there are the exploited. Not only is there injustice in material things but also in nonmaterial things. Throughout history we find people who were so oppressed that they could suffer no longer. As a result, they rose up, rebelled, and revolted. Sadly, however, they became oppressors once they became the kings and the rulers. Isaiah 11:4 says that in the future, the world will be filled with justice and righteousness. This is what the Lord will do when He comes again.</p><h2 class="head2">War</h2><p>Second, when the Lord comes again, all the wars in this world will be over. One problem with this world is war. Human history is full of wars. Since the dawn of human history, there have only been 268 years when there was no war on this earth. There are international wars and national wars. The two greatest wars were the First World War and the Second World War. Now there is still a chance of a third World War. The world is full of big wars and small wars. War comes from passions; it is the result of man's constantly unfulfilled passions. Isaiah 2:4 says that when the Lord comes back again, all the swords will be beaten into plowshares and all the spears will be turned into pruning hooks. No nation will wage war against another nation, and no one will learn war any more. What is this? This is salvation of the entire society.</p><h2 class="head2">Sickness</h2><p>Third, when the Lord comes back, all the sicknesses in this world will be gone. There will be no more sickness. Today the world is full of sickness. Science has invented all kinds of medicines, but with the increase of medicine, there has also been an increase of sickness. Many viruses and bacteria improve their immune system with the introduction of more antibiotics; there is no way to eradicate them. A man can be healed by one kind of medicine. But he can become sick again and need further treatment. No matter how hard man tries, he cannot get rid of sickness. According to Leviticus and Deuteronomy, sickness has much to do with sin; it is the result of judgment on sin. When the Lord comes again and eventually in the new heaven and new earth, there will be the tree of life whose leaves will heal the nations (Rev. 22:2; Ezek. 47:12). In the coming world, there will be no sickness.</p><h2 class="head2">Famine</h2><p>Fourth, when the Lord comes again, He will remove famine from humanity. The Old Testament tells us that the earth does not yield to man because of man's sin. Vegetables do not grow naturally by themselves; they have to be cultivated. However, useless thorns and thistles flourish. It is interesting to note that all vegetation that is beneficial to man does not grow naturally. The only vegetation that flourishes naturally is the kind that is not beneficial to man. Today famine is found everywhere. Even when man applies all kinds of fertilizers, he is not guaranteed good harvests. It seems that man must struggle with the environment before he can find food. Such problems will be solved when the Lord comes back. Isaiah 35:1 and 6 say that the desert will flow with rivers and the earth will no longer bring forth wild weeds. Now, whatever man does not cultivate will not proliferate. Then, man will no longer have to wrestle with nature.</p><h2 class="head2">Education</h2><p>Fifth, when the Lord comes again, the question of education will be resolved. Today some are educated while others are not. Today's education does not help man to know God but to know good and evil and to turn from evil to good. But education cannot solve the problem of sin within man's heart. Today some people know God while others do not. But when the Lord comes back again, no one will need to teach his fellow citizen or brother to know God; from the little one to the great one, all will know Him (Heb. 8:11). When the Lord comes back again, all will know God.</p>
