<h2 class="head2">In the New Testament, God's Desire Being<br />for the Church to Be a Kingdom of Priests</h2><p>This arrangement lasted for over fifteen hundred years. During this time eleven tribes were kept outside the tabernacle. Only the tribe of Levi was admitted into the tabernacle. This lasted until the New Testament age, as Peter said in his first Epistle, "But you are...a royal priesthood'' (2:9). Now every believer has become a servant of God. At the end of the New Testament, when John was about to die in A.D. 95, he said that we have been made "a kingdom, priests to His God and Father'' (Rev. 1:6). God's intention toward the church today is for every believer to be a priest. We are a kingdom of priests. What the Israelites lost, God is recovering through the church. Through their unfaithfulness, the Israelites lost the priestly kingdom. God's intention today is for every Christian to be recovered to be a priest.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE UNIVERSAL PRIESTHOOD</h2><h2 class="head2">All the Saved Ones Serving God</h2><p>Any service that is not in the nature of a priestly kingdom is wrong. The church has been selected out of the world. There cannot be a further selection within the church. As long as there is no sin, no fall, and no golden calf, God forbids any further separation. However many there are who are redeemed by the blood, that many should serve. The number of sons should be the number of servants as well. The number of servants should equal the number of sons. Service should include the same number that salvation includes. Today among God's people, there are only backsliding ones; there are no non-slaves or non-maids. There are only rebellious ones; there are no non-serving ones. Any service should be a service by the whole church. This is the Body service that we are talking about in these days. God is not satisfied even when ninety-nine percent of the people are serving. God wants everyone to be serving. We do not believe that a majority of the people should serve while a minority of the people do not serve. Neither do we believe that a minority of the people should serve while a majority of the people do not serve. Service is not the work of the ministers or the work of a few evangelists. We speak so much about the Body service because it is a matter that belongs to all the brothers and sisters.</p><h2 class="head2">A Person Needing to Forsake Everything<br />to Serve God As Soon As He Is Saved</h2><p>God's Word tells us that we are those who have received God's mercy. But what should we do now? Christianity thinks that a man is saved through the Lord's blood and by His grace and then goes on further to forsake the world. As he advances further, he drops everything to serve God. This is degraded Christianity. According to God's Word, as soon as a man is saved, and as soon as he steps through the entrance, the Lord tells him to take up his cross (Matt. 16:24). A man either does not become a disciple, or he has to be one in an absolute way. The Lord sets the price clearly from the beginning for every saved one. The first day they come, they see the tomb. The first day they come, they are asked to forsake the world. We cannot lower the gospel and make the gospel no longer the gospel. The Lord never lowers the price to attract customers. The gospel is the least expensive thing there is. Yet at the same time, it is the most costly thing there is. If we are to be saved, we have to be saved in a clear way. Only those who have paid a high price can feel joy. When the young ruler returned home, his money remained with him, but so did his sorrow (Matt. 19:22). Where money is, there sorrow remains. When money goes, joy comes along. Salvation requires that a man give up everything totally. Today many brothers and sisters are sorrowful just like the young ruler. They have things in their hands that they cannot drop. The only difference between them and the young ruler is that they have not returned home yet; they are still meeting here. If we want joy, we have to consecrate ourselves fully and offer up everything.</p>
