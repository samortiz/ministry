   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Background of God's Calling Babel 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Forsaking God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now in this message we need to see the experience of the called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But before we come to this, we need to consider the background and origin of God's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When God appeared to Abraham, he was in the darkest background.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His background was exceedingly strong.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first aspect of this background was that man had forsaken God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man's forsaking of God was signified by his building a city.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We saw this in the case of Cain in chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Man built a city because he had lost God as his protection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since man no longer had God as his safeguard, he built a city to protect himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So the building of the city was the sign that man had forsaken God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Man seemed to be saying, "Let God go.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I will build a city to protect myself."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The building of the city was the declaration that man had forsaken God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Exalting Man</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not only did man forsake God, but he built a tower to exalt himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The tower was a sign of man's self-exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When man forsakes God, automatically he exalts himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whenever man builds a city he will also build a tower to make a name for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Denying the Right of God</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, at Babel man also denied God's right over His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Both man and the earth were God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, man would not recognize God's right but instead established the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The establishing of nations signified that man had denied God's right and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we have seen, after the flood God gave man the authority to rule others, but Satan caused man to abuse this God-given authority to form nations that man may have his own dominion, denying God's right and authority over man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Serving Idols</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Finally, Joshua 24:2 shows us that at Babel man turned from God to idols, to other gods.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Behind all the idols are demons.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whenever a man worships an idol, he worships demons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Apparently he is worshipping idols; actually he is worshipping demons.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the background of God's calling we have the city, the tower, the nations, and the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man had forsaken God, had exalted himself, had denied God's right and authority, and had turned from God to serve idols.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do you believe that the situation is any better today?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I do not believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is as bad today as it was then.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The situation is exactly the same.</S>
