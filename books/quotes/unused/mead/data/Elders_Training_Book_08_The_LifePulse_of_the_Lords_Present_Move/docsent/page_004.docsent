   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MEETING TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND TEACH THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ACCORDING TO THE REVELATION OF</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The third principle of meeting is to preach the gospel and to teach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, our preaching and teaching must not be in an unrestricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must be limited by the realm of the revelation of the New Testament economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our preaching and teaching must also be uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Simply to be limited in the sphere, in the realm of the New Testament revelation is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Your preaching and your teaching should be up to the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I do not encourage you to preach in a low way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to preach in a high way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Bible, you cannot see any kind of loose preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the day of Pentecost the first message that came out of Peter s mouth was quite high, full of mysterious points.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some may point out that this message was given to the Jews, who had much knowledge of the Bible in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in Acts 14 Paul gave a message to the Gentiles vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>15-17 , and in Acts 17 he gave a message which was very deep and very high to the Greeks, the philosophical people Acts 17:22-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Paul was speaking on Mars Hill, facing the Greek philosophers, he surely had to give a higher, deeper, philosophical preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the terminology as well as the points Paul covered require much time to study.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not preach or teach in a shallow way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to be restricted within the boundary of God s New Testament economy, and be uplifted to the standard of His New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Just before I left my denomination, the preacher gave a sermon in the Sunday morning service on how to kill flies to promote sanitation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was absolutely outside the boundary of the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this country some pastors speak about politics and even sex in their meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Others speak about biblical prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To talk about prophecy based upon the revelation of the New Testament economy is absolutely all right.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if you talk about prophecy for the sake of prophecy, you are off and you are outside the boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To talk about foot washing in relation to God s New Testament economy is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if you talk about foot washing for the sake of foot washing, you had better set up a foot washing church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This speaking causes division.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you talk about water baptism, and it is not related to the New Testament economy, that causes division.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even to talk about the baptism in the Spirit with no relation to God s New Testament economy causes division.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is why I speak of meeting to preach the gospel and to teach the truth, not just according to the New Testament but according to the revelation of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whatever you teach and preach must be restricted by this, and you must uplift your preaching and teaching to the standard of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>An architect would never allow a high tower to be erected in the middle of a building, unrelated to the rest of it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who uplift speaking in tongues raise up a high tower unrelated to the building.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To those who do this, it seems that the whole body is only a tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The best architect surely would cut this tongue down to its proper size.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul cut in this way in chapter fourteen of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He surely was the wise architect who did much cutting in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a layman architect I designed the meeting hall in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I did not make the drawings, but I made the design.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In my first design I placed an elevator in the middle of one end of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After the concrete was poured, I realized that the design was wrong, and I convinced the brothers to change it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As the unique architect I made many adjustments.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I cut off this corner, and I cut off that corner.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This was a great cutting to some of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although it cost much to take this elevator out, we just could not leave it in. This illustrates that to take the lead is not an easy thing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must learn to take the lead by looking into the holy Word to see the entire view of God s economy, the plan, the arrangement, the design in His New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must have a clear view of God s arrangement, God s design.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To be an architect is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The stairway in the meeting hall also was designed by me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Certain brothers who were carpenters considered the design to be strange and built a sample of their own design to show to me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It seemed as if I was one who knew nothing about carpentry, yet I insisted on my design.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They had no choice but to build it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Eventually, the fire department awarded us an extra ten percent in seating capacity because the stairways and doors were so good.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A layman designed them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today whoever comes to the meeting feels so happy about the stairway.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No one who comes up these stairs has the feeling that he is climbing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>An apostle, an architect, a wise master builder, must be one who can give us the proper design.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To see the basic principles of meeting in the Word is not easy, but to use these principles in the meetings will never cause any division.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This way to meet will never give rise to any opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Perhaps these principles will calm down all the different opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Brothers, take care of the way to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Do not change the way of meeting in an easy way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Whatever way you take to meet, you must take care of the matter of division.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You must take care of the matter of opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The issue of the way of meeting may lead to opinions and result in division, as it did among us in years past.</S>
