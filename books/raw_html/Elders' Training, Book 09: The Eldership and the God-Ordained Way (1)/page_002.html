<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE WAY TO CARRY OUT<br>THE LORD'S NEW MOVE</H1><P>In this chapter we want to make the Lord's new move and the way to carry out His move clear. First, I would like to mention something about what the Lord's recovery has gone through in the past sixty-four years. Our beginning in the Lord's recovery was very difficult. This was because we were new and young, and Christianity was prevailing. Of course, the Lord was merciful to us. He gave us a heart to seek after Him, after His Word, after His truth, and after His way. By His mercy we were absolute in our desire to drop the traditional, unscriptural way of Christianity and simply take the Lord Himself, His gospel, and His Word. However, we did not clearly see the right way to carry out what the Lord had shown us concerning the church. We mostly went to the writings of the Brethren for help concerning the practice of the church life. As young men, we had no choice except to discerningly follow those writings. Later, we found that the practice of the Brethren was neither absolutely scriptural nor adequate to meet our need.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECOVERING THE PROPER CHRISTIAN MEETING</H2><P>Both Brother Nee and I came out from Christianity. Brother Nee's grandfather was a pastor, and my mother was a third generation Christian. We studied in Christian schools. By the Lord's mercy, we began to meet outside of Christianity to have the Lord's recovery. Although we had come out of Christianity, we realized that we still unintentionally maintained some parts of the practice of Christianity as a kind of unconscious tradition in our meetings.</P><P>According to the natural concept, a Christian meeting must be a meeting with a large congregation. However, according to the principle of Matthew 18:20, only two or three are required for a Christian meeting. Nearly all of the local churches began with a small number. In the early days of the Lord's recovery in mainland China, many churches began with not more than five saints. Spontaneously, these localities grew to a larger number.</P><P>Eventually in 1948, Brother Nee began to say that the Lord's Day morning meeting among us was not so good. He uttered his strong feeling definitely to us. He indicated strongly that we should stop the Lord's Day morning meetings and spend that time to preach the gospel (see Church Affairs&#151;chapter four). He told us that our way of meeting was altogether not according to the Scriptures. He pointed out to us that the most clear word in the New Testament concerning the way the believers should meet is in 1 Corinthians 14. He especially stressed verse 26, which says that when we come together, all of us should have something. He also pointed out that the proper Christian meeting should be fully in mutuality.</P><P>He said that the Lord's Day message meeting with one speaking and the rest listening was according to the "customs of the nations." In the Old Testament, God warned the children of Israel that when they entered the good land, they should not follow the customs of the nations (2 Kings 17:8; Lev. 18:3; Deut. 18:9&#151;NASB). Brother Nee compared all the denominations to the nations. The children of Israel followed the nations, but today we are following the denominations. To have one speaking and the rest listening on the Lord's Day morning is a custom of the fallen denominations. If we take this way, we are like the children of Israel who followed the customs of the nations, and this is serious in the Lord's eyes.</P>
