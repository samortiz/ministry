He is the Savior and the Creator. He opened a way for us to pioneer the gospel into the interior regions. He has begun a good work, and He will finish this work until His day. May the kingdom, authority, and glory be to God. The assembly here received X dollars of the Lord's money. We want to designate it for the use of the work in Szechuan. Please distribute it according to the Lord's leading.</p><p>Your little brothers in the assembly in Chuenchow,<br />Yang Shi-chao, Wu Ren-jieh<br />March 25<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Kulangsu, Fukien Province</h2><p>Greetings to X in the Lord:</p><p>Although southern Fukien experiences tension at times, we are still at peace. The meeting in Amoy has stopped for a long time now. It has not been recovered. The meeting in Kulangsu has been preserved and continues as usual. Sister Yien-tze hurriedly returned to Pu-Tien two weeks ago because her nephew was dangerously ill and had not yet believed in the Lord. Sister Yuan-yi is still physically weak. We really need to pray for her. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your weak sister,<br />Chen Wan-ching<br />March 21<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Wu-Yang, Honan Province</h2><p>Brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>We have received every copy of The Open Door. Thank you and praise the Lord. We have been edified by it very much. Missionary Rong and Sister Kao Chui-lan returned to Hou-Ma, Shansi, on February 14. They only sent one letter from Hou-Ma to us before the roads were closed. We do not know how they are doing now. We ask the brothers and sisters in the Lord to pray earnestly for them and for the Spiritual Band. May the Lord stretch out His almighty hand to cover His children and all the co-workers who love the Lord from China and from the West. Peace.</p><p>Your little brothers,<br />Yang Sin-sheng, Chu Huai-an, Wang Hua-min<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Tsingtao</h2><p>Thank the Lord! He really loves us and keeps us safe. God's grace has led us to remain in Tsingtao all the time. Three families left because the brothers lost their jobs. More than ten of the rest have also left. Brother Lee Shi-sin (Tze-jung) has not left. Brother Kao Guei-shu's family and Sister Tan's family have not left either. There are still a few brothers who cannot leave, so there are more than ten people. God protects us every night. Although we have heard people speaking negative things, we still sleep peacefully. I really worry about the brothers in northern Kiangsu. I have not heard news of them for a long time. How is southern Fukien? How is the region of Ping-Yang? We do pray for them, but we would also like to know their real condition.</p><p>Chang Tze-jieh<br />March 23</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_129.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_131.html">Next</a> </body></html>
