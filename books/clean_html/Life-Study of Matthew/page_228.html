<h2 class="head4">b. The Jews Needing to Flee</h2><p>When the abomination of desolation is set up in the holy place, the Jews will need to flee. Verse 16 says, &ldquo;Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.&rdquo; One who is on the housetop should not even come down to take the things out of his house, for the great tribulation has come. The situation will be so urgent that the Jews should not return to their houses for anything. Those who are in the field should not even turn back to take their garments (v. 18). Verse 19 says, &ldquo;But woe to those who are with child and those who nurse babes in those days.&rdquo; Either to be with child or to nurse babes is inconvenient for escape. It will be necessary for the Jews to run as quickly as possible.</p><p>Verse 20 continues, &ldquo;And pray that your flight may not be in winter, nor on a Sabbath.&rdquo; Winter is a difficult time for escape, and on the Sabbath travel was limited. On the Sabbath, one was allowed to walk only a short distance (Acts 1:12), not adequate for escaping. The mention of Sabbath here indicates that the Jews will keep it after the restoration of the nation of Israel. The disciples, the audience for the Lord&rsquo;s word here, had a twofold status, one representing the remnant of the Jews and the other representing the New Testament believers, who constitute the church. In the section of the Lord&rsquo;s word concerning the Jews (24:4-31), they represent the remnant of the Jews; whereas in the section concerning the church (24:32&mdash;25:30), they represent the New Testament believers. In the Gospels, in things regarding circumstances, the Lord treated His disciples as Jews, but in things concerning spirit and life, He considered them New Testament believers.</p><h2 class="head4">c. There Being Great Tribulation</h2><p>Verse 21 says, &ldquo;For then there shall be great tribulation, such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now, nor ever shall be.&rdquo; The great tribulation will occur in the last three and a half years of this age. The great tribulation will have Jerusalem as its center and Judea as its circumference, whereas the trial in Revelation 3:10 will have Rome as its center and the whole inhabited earth as its circumference. No other tribulation will be able to compare with this great tribulation which will take place under the hand of Antichrist.</p><p>Jerusalem has already been destroyed more than once, and it will be destroyed again. The first time Jerusalem was destroyed was under Nebuchadnezzar with the Babylonian army. Later, in the second century B.C., after the rebuilding of the temple, the temple was polluted by Antiochus Epiphanes. Many Bible students realize that he was a type of Titus, who came to destroy Jerusalem in A.D. 70. Certain portions of Daniel refer both to Antiochus and Titus, and it is sometimes difficult to discern which verses refer to Antiochus and which to Titus. Luke 21 indicates that the destruction of Jerusalem under Titus is connected to the destruction under Antichrist. For this reason, readers of the New Testament find it difficult to determine which verses refer to the destruction under Titus and which refer to the destruction under Antichrist. Thus, Antiochus Epiphanes was a type of Titus, and Titus was a type of Antichrist.</p><p>We must be careful not to confuse the verses in Matthew 24 with those in Luke 21, for they do not refer to exactly the same thing. In Matthew there is no reference to the destruction under Titus, which was a shadow of the destruction recorded here. The destruction of Jerusalem under Titus in A.D. 70 was a shadow of the destruction to come under Antichrist. Do not apply 24:15-31 to any time other than the last three and one half years of this age, when Antichrist will rise up to persecute the Jews.</p><p>Verse 22 says, &ldquo;And except those days were cut short, no flesh at all would be saved; but because of the elect, those days shall be cut short.&rdquo; As we have seen, the great tribulation will last only three and one half years. The elect spoken of in this verse are the Jews, God&rsquo;s chosen people (Rom. 11:28).</p><p>How do we know that the great tribulation will last three and one half years? Daniel 9 speaks of the last week of the seventy weeks. The last week will be the last seven years of Israel&rsquo;s history in this age. At the beginning of these seven years, the Jews will make a covenant with Antichrist. But at the middle of these seven years, Antichrist will change his mind and turn his back upon them. In his agreement with the Jews, Antichrist will allow them to worship God according to the Jewish religion. But at the end of the first three and one half years, Antichrist will begin to persecute every kind of religion, set up his image in the temple, and force people to worship him. That will be the beginning of the great tribulation, the end of this age, the last three and one half years. In God&rsquo;s sovereignty and mercy, this time has been cut short. The tribulation under Antichrist will be so severe that no one will be able to bear it. If God had not cut it short, no flesh at all would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, those days will be limited to three and one half years.</p>
