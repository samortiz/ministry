<h2 class="head1">II. CHRIST HIMSELF BEING THE CORNERSTONE</h2><p>Verse 20 reveals that in God&rsquo;s building Christ is the cornerstone. Here Christ is referred to, not as the foundation (Isa. 28:16), but as the cornerstone, because the main concern here is not the foundation but the cornerstone that joins together the two main walls: the wall of the Jewish believers and the wall of the Gentile believers.</p><p>When the Jewish builders rejected Christ, they rejected Him as the cornerstone (Acts 4:11; 1 Pet. 2:7), which joins the Gentiles to them for the building of God&rsquo;s house.</p><p>In Matthew 21 the Lord Jesus indicated, in a figurative way, that the Pharisees would reject Him. Verse 42 says, &ldquo;Have you never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the cornerstone; this was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes?&rdquo; By this word the Lord revealed that after His resurrection He would become the cornerstone to join the Jews and the Gentiles. Referring to Christ, Peter said to the religionists in Acts 4:11 and 12, &ldquo;This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which is become the head of the corner. Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s word shows that salvation implies building. God&rsquo;s intention in saving us is not to bring us into the heavens; rather, it is to join us to the Jews so that He may have His building. Many unbelieving Jews despise the Lord Jesus because they do not want to be joined to the Gentiles. As long as a Jew does not believe in Christ, he may be separated from the Gentiles. But as soon as such a Jew believes in Him, he is joined by Christ, the cornerstone, to the Gentile believers. Whether we are Jews or Gentiles, we have been saved in order to be joined together in Christ for God&rsquo;s building.</p><h2 class="head1">III. GROWING INTO A HOLY TEMPLE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. In Christ</h2><p>Verse 21 says, &ldquo;In Whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord.&rdquo; Here we see that in Christ, who is the cornerstone, all the building, including both Jewish and Gentile believers, is fitted together and is growing into a holy temple.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Growing</h2><p>Since the building is a living one (1 Pet. 2:5), it is growing. It grows into a holy temple. The actual building of the church as the house of God is by the growth in life of the believers. Today the church is growing. However, it is not growing in our natural life, but in the divine life, the spiritual life.</p><p>Verse 21 also says that all the building is fitted together. The word &ldquo;fitted&rdquo; means being made suitable for the condition and situation of the building.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Into a Holy Temple</h2><p>As verse 21 points out, all the building is growing into a holy temple. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;temple&rdquo; means the sanctuary, the inner part of the whole temple. It is in the Lord that the building is growing into a holy temple. This means that the entire building of God&rsquo;s house as His sanctuary is in Christ the Lord.</p><p>At this point I would like to ask you a question: Has the temple of God in the universe been completed? The fact that the temple is still growing indicates that, from our point of view at least, the temple of God is not complete. Verse 21 does not say that all the building has grown into a holy temple; it says that all the building is growing into a holy temple.</p><p>The phrase &ldquo;all the building&rdquo; refers to the universal church. If you consider the past nineteen centuries of church history, you may find it difficult to see the growth of the building. But do not be disappointed. The purpose of God cannot be thwarted. The universal building is still growing. In Matthew 16 the Lord Jesus prophesied that He would build His church. The building in Matthew 16:18 is the very building in Ephesians 2:21. Although the growth of the building is slow and hardly noticeable, it is nonetheless taking place.</p>
