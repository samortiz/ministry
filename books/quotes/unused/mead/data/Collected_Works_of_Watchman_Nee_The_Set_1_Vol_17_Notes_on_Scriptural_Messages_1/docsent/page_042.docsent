   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Read again 2 Timothy 1:12: "For which cause also I suffer these things; but I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit unto that day."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why did Paul say, "I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit unto that day?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What did Paul commit to the Lord when he believed in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He committed his future eternal salvation to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul was persuaded that the Lord was able to keep that which he had committed unto Him unto that day.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He knew very clearly and understood very well that all the matters that he had committed to the Lord would be kept and not be lost unto that day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The few passages that we have read testify that we can know that we have eternal life and that we can know that we are saved while we are still on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Anyone should know today if he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Friends, please do not take the excuse that we do not know whether we will go to heaven or to hell until we are judged before God in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let me repeat: we can know today whether we are saved and whether we will go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now let me mention a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How do we know that we have eternal life and are saved?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, we have to know how one can have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we know the way of justification and the forgiveness of sins, we will know whether or not we have passed that way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we have passed that way, we have eternal life; if not, we do not have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let me now tell you the way to obtain eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many people know this way, and many have heard this from others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But I still want to repeat it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The New Testament mentions at least one hundred fifty times that those who believe will have eternal life; they will have life and not be condemned but will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What does John 3:16, a verse most familiar to us, tell us?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It tells us that God loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How does He love?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To what extent has He loved?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He loved to the extent that He gave His only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God has given His only begotten Son to the world, and Jesus has died for sinners and accomplished the work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What happens after this?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It goes on to say that whoever believes in Him would not perish but have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This verse has three main points.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It mentions a great fact, a great condition, and a great result.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The great fact is that God has sent Jesus to the world to redeem men and to be their Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The great condition is the one thing that everyone should do believe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The great result is too good; it is something man has never thought of: whoever believes will not perish, but have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The great fact is that God so loved the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To what extent did He love?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He loved to the extent that He gave His only begotten Son to the world to die on the cross for men's sins and save all the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the great fact.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nothing is greater and truer than this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now there is a great condition, a great demand placed before every man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Man has to fulfill this condition.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What is this condition?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everyone should believe that God has accomplished such a fact and should believe in God's accomplishment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the unique condition and something that everyone should fulfill.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The great fact is accomplished by God, and the great condition is to be fulfilled by man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What then is the great result?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is that we would not perish but have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since the Lord has said that those who believe in Him would not perish but have eternal life, do you think that after we have believed, that we will still perish?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even if the Lord could be unrighteous, He could not be unrighteous to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Of course, our God is a righteous God!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whoever believes will surely have eternal life and will not perish.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God will accomplish this according to what He says.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once there was a medical doctor who was a very good believer in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He took care of his patients well, and whenever there was the opportunity, he would preach the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once he was treating a widow's sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the course of their conversation, he asked if she was a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>She answered, "Yes, I truly believe in Jesus and have accepted Him as my Savior."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The doctor asked again, "If you have truly believed and accepted Jesus as your Savior, do you have eternal life?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Suppose this sickness does not get cured and you die, will you go to heaven or to hell?"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>She said, "Sir, I dare not say.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I have been a Christian for many years, and I try my best to do good works.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If God sees me fit to be saved and go to heaven, it will be wonderful; otherwise, there is nothing that I can do."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The doctor said, "Wait.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Let me ask you a question.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Since you have been a Christian for so many years, surely you have memorized some verses by heart."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>She said, "Of course, there are many Scripture verses I can recite.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The most familiar one is John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even when I was in kindergarten, my teacher had me memorize it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I have known this verse by heart for the last fifty to sixty years."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then she recited: "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The doctor said, " Very good, but now do you have eternal life?"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>She answered, "Sir, I just told you that I try my best to do good, hoping that in the future God will approve me and give me eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then I will know if I have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Only good Christians like you, doctor, have the boldness to say that you have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I would not dare to say it."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The doctor said gently, "Madam, you have memorized John 3:16 incorrectly."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>She said, "This cannot be.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I have had this verse memorized for fifty to sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>How can I be wrong?"</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The doctor said, "Please recite it again," and she recited it in the same way again.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When she finished, she asked to the doctor, "What did I say wrong?"</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The doctor immediately asked her, "Do you have eternal life?"</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>She replied anxiously, "I have told you two to three times that I dare not say that I have it; I only endeavor to do good, hoping that on that day God will say that I have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>While I am on the earth today, I dare not say that I have it."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The doctor said gently again, "You have still recited John 3:16 incorrectly."</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>She said, "I have just recited it to you without any error.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Yet you say again that I am wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Please do not make fun of me.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>How can I be wrong after having known it for fifty to sixty years?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is you who have memorized it wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Then she stood up to look for a Bible and placed John 3:16 in front of the doctor, saying, "I will recite it again.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Please look at it word by word to see if I am wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>After she had recited it, she said, "Sir, who is wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Was I not correct?"</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The doctor said, "Please calm down.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I just want to ask if you have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>She answered in a furious way, "You said that I recited John 3:16 incorrectly; why do you ask me about this matter again?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Have I not told you three to four times that I dare not say whether I have eternal life, and that I only hope God will say I have it in the future."</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The doctor said again, "You have recited John 3:16 incorrectly."</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>She answered, "I give up.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Would you please recite it for me."</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The doctor said, "Fine," and he went on to recite John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Then the woman said, "How is yours different from mine?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Check and see that what you have recited was exactly what I recited."</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He said, "They are not the same; now let me recite your John 3:16 for you: For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him and endeavors to do good, and after whose death God will judge and say that he may have eternal life, because God has delighted in him, such a one will have eternal life and will not perish.'</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>My John 3:16 says, That every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.'"</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The woman then understood what the doctor meant.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>She had thought that John 3:16 had two parts with the first part ending after "believes into Him," after which one could insert any word before proceeding to the second part "would not perish, but would have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Now she knew that John 3:16 is only one sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.</S>
