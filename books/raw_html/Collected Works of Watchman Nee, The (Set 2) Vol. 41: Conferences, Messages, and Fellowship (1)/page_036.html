<h2 class="head1">THE CAPACITY OF OUR FAITH</h2><p>There are different capacities to faith. Every person has a different capacity of faith before God, in the same way that cups, bowls, and tumblers all have different capacities. Mr. George MÃ¼ller had a great faith; his capacity was great, and God did much through him. However, faith is equally whole in everyone (2 Pet. 1:1). This is the same as saying that fullness is fullness, whether it is in a great vessel or a small vessel. In the eyes of God, the measure of faith can decrease or increase. Revelation gives one sight and faith, but following revelation, one has to exercise his faith. When faith is added to revelation we have reality. Colossians 3:4 says, "Christ our life." For Jesus Christ to become our life, God has to show this to us as a revelation on the one hand, and we have to believe it on the other hand. Philippians 2:13 says, "It is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure." It is God's responsibility to operate, and it is our responsibility to will and work, or putting it another way, it is His responsibility to will and work through me. A ten- thousand-ton ship at a shipyard requires only a little girl's hand to cut the ribbon, launching the whole ship into the water. God's will may be likened to a ten-thousand-ton ship. As soon as I will and work, His purpose is realized.</p><p>The more we see that our sins are alive and the more we acknowledge that we are the chiefest of all sinners, the more we will experience a breakthrough in the matter of overcoming. Victory is not a change for the better. I am an utterly hopeless sinner; fifty years from now, I will still be a sinner. The Lord has no intention to change me for the better. He wants to give me another life. The overcoming life that He gives us is an exchange; it is not a change in our own life. Everything is accomplished by the Lord. From the day we were saved, the Lord has granted us the victory. If our faith is great, we will see more of what God has given us. If our faith is small, we will see less of what He has given us.</p><p>Faith is not acquiring something new. Faith is seeing what God has already given us. If we do not have faith, spiritual things will still exist, but they will appear as if they do not exist at all. The eyes see things, but as soon as the eyes are closed, the things become invisible. The things are still there, but to the eyes, they are gone. Revelation is always available, but it is possible for man to be without faith. The more revelation we have, the more faith we possess. The less revelation we have, the less faith we possess. The more we see the Lord's revelation, the more we will progress; the less we see, the less we will progress.</p><h2 class="head1">FAITH NOT BEING DEPENDENT<br />ON FEELINGS BUT ON GOD'S WORD</h2><p>Faith has nothing to do with natural understanding. Many village women have more faith than college professors. It is not a question of whether or not one has knowledge but whether or not one has living faith. Faith does not come as a result of an artificial believing, nor is it based on one's feelings. Our feelings are not trustworthy; only God's Word is trustworthy. Based on his feelings, a little boy thought that his father would buy him a ball. He invited many of his friends to come to his house and play in anticipation. When his father came, there was no ball because he had never promised to buy his son a ball. Later, the father promised that he would bring him a ball. After the father made such a promise, the child only needed to trust in his father's word. In the same way, we should not go by our feelings or judge God by how we feel. We should trust rather in the Word of God. What counts is what God has said. As soon as we believe, the things will become ours.</p><h2 class="head1">DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN FAITH AND TEMPTATION</h2><p>How can we tell the difference between faith that comes from God and temptation that comes from Satan? The key lies in the source of the spoken word&mdash;whether it is from Satan or from God. When Satan tempted the Lord, he also quoted the Scripture. He wanted the Lord to jump down from the top of the temple, but the Lord would not do it because the word was a temptation from Satan. If God said, "You can jump down," you could jump down even if you had a much higher temple. This is faith. If God has not told you to jump, however, you should not jump no matter how low a temple is. If you do, you are tempting the Lord.</p>
