<h2 class="head2">The Ark in the Land of the Philistines</h2><p>What happened after the ark was taken to the land of the Philistines? The ark was well able to protect itself. First Samuel 5 says, "And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod. When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon. And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the Lord. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again. And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him....But the hand of the Lord was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof" (vv. 1-6). The men of Ashdod were afraid and gathered together the lords of the Philistines and asked what they should do. They decided to send the ark of the God of Israel to Gath. But after the ark arrived there, everyone in the city, both great and small, had emerods, and so they sent the ark of God to Ekron. The Ekronites cried out saying, "They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people" (v. 10). They sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and asked that the ark of Jehovah be sent back to its own place. The ark of the Lord was in the land of the Philistines for seven months. How did they send the ark of the God of Israel back? Chapter six tells us that the priests and diviners among the Philistines came up with a new way. They made a new cart and took two milk cows, on which there had come no yoke, tied the cows to the cart, brought their calves home from them, and put the ark of the Lord on the cart. They also prepared gifts for a trespass offering, five golden mice and five golden emerods, and put them on the cart. They said, "See, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us" (v. 9). The amazing thing was that the cart went straight on until it stopped at a place called Bethshemesh. The lords of the Philistines were subdued. This is why we say that the ark was well able to protect itself.</p><h2 class="head2">The Ark in Bethshemesh</h2><p>What happened after the ark reached Bethshemesh? "And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it" (v. 13). But following this, a tragic thing happened. "And he [Jehovah] smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the Lord, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the Lord had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter. And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy Lord God? and to whom shall he go up from us? And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the Lord; come ye down, and fetch it up to you" (vv. 9-21). The presence of Christ is a blessing, but a man must also be holy in His sight. The men of Bethshemesh looked into the ark of the Lord and did not have a fear of the Lord. Hence, God smote them. After they were smitten, they did not want the ark anymore. Rather than dealing with the reason for being smitten, they decided instead to reject the Lord's presence. What a pity this is!</p><h2 class="head2">The Ark in Kirjathjearim</h2><p>What was the attitude of the men of Kirjathjearim towards the ark? "And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the Lord, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the Lord. And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord" (7:1-2). The ark came out of Shiloh, yet it never went back to Shiloh. It was in the house of Abinadab in Kirjathjearim for twenty years. In Shiloh there was the tabernacle, but there was no ark. How empty Shiloh was! Now the house of Abinadab had the Lord's presence. Brothers and sisters, the ark would never return to Shiloh again. The question now is: Are we like the men of Bethshemesh who feared the Lord's presence, or are we like the men of Kirjathjearim who welcomed His presence?</p>
