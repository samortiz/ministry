<H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING GRACE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS</H1><P>Are we saved by God's grace or by God's righteousness? What part of salvation is accomplished by God's grace, and what part is by God's righteousness?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>Ephesians 2:8 says, "For by grace you have been saved." This indicates that we are saved by God's grace.</P><P>Romans 3:25 and 26 say, "Whom God set forth as a propitiation place through faith in His blood, for the demonstrating of His righteousness..with a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time, so that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus." This shows us that salvation is also by God's righteousness.</P><P>God's grace provides a Savior for us, so that we have the possibility of being saved (John 3:16), while God's righteousness causes salvation to be accomplished upon us, so that God must save us. The part from the Lord's birth through His death and resurrection to His ascension, has been accomplished for us by God's grace, while the part since the Lord's ascension until now is accomplished for us by His righteousness.</P><P>Grace can be given or withheld according to God's pleasure, but righteousness allows no choice. Since Christ has died and been raised, God must save you if you believe. If you believe and God does not save you, then He is not righteous. What does 1 John 1:9 say? Does it say, "If we confess our sins, He is merciful and loving to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness"? No. It says, "He is faithful and righteous." The blood of His Son has cleansed us from all sins. When we believe, God must save us. God cannot be unfaithful, because His word has already been spoken. He cannot be unrighteous because the blood of His Son has been shed. Therefore, we thank and praise God, for He must save us!</P><P>All unrighteousness is sin. God cannot be unrighteous, therefore He must save us. Saying that God may not forgive us is like saying that He is unfaithful and unrighteous. We must lay hold of God's righteousness. He delights in our laying hold of His righteousness. For us to lay hold of God's righteousness is to honor Him.</P>
