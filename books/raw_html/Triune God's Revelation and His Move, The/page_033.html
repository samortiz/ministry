<h1 class=series>THE TRIUNE GOD’S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ELEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>THE TRIUNE GOD’S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>(4)</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>The revelations:	<ol class="upper-alpha" start="10">	<li>The last five items of facts, from I. J. to I. N., reveal to us Christ’s kingdom ministry, beginning from the coming back of Christ to Christ’s judgment at the great white throne over all the dead.</li>	<li>In the kingdom ministry of Christ, the first thing that Christ will do is to judge His believers at His judgment seat (2 Cor. 5:10):		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To reward His overcoming believers with His kingdom that they may enter into the millennial kingdom to partake of Him as the tree of life (Rev. 2:7) and to share His joy and His kingship—Matt. 25:21, 23; Rev. 20:4, 6.</li>		<li>To discipline His defeated believers with the punishment in the millennial kingdom that they may be put away from His glory and enjoyable presence to a place of darkness for their discipline (Matt. 25:30) that they may mature in His life for them to participate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth after the kingdom age.</li>		<li>To marry His overcoming believers as His bride (Rev. 19:7-9).</li>		<li>To defeat Antichrist with his partner, the false prophet, and the nations who follow them in rebelling against God in the war at Armageddon (Rev. 19:11-16). His newly married bride, as His armies, will fight together with Him (19:14; 17:14). Christ and His bride-army will defeat Antichrist and his followers and cast Antichrist and the false prophet into the lake of fire directly (19:19-21). In the meantime, Satan will be bound for a thousand years and cast into the abyss (20:1-3). Then the millennial kingdom of Christ will begin (vv. 4, 6).</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The second thing that Christ will do in His kingdom ministry is to judge, on the throne of His glory, the nations (the living—Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1) who remain at that time: some as goats will be condemned to perish eternally and some as sheep will be justified to enter into eternal life—Matt. 25:31-46.</li>	<li>At the end of the millennial kingdom, Satan will be released and will deceive the nations again to rebel against God; the nations will be devoured by fire from heaven, and Satan will be cast into the lake of fire—Rev. 20:7-10.<br>	Note: Through all the above judgments Christ will clear up all the opposers of God from this earth; this consummates His kingdom ministry.</li>	<li>After the millennium, Christ will be at His great white throne to judge all the dead throughout the generations and cast them into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:11-12, 15). Thus, Christ will clear up the entire universe, preparing the way for the new heaven and new earth to come.</li>	<li>The new heaven and new earth will come, in which the holy city, New Jerusalem, is manifested for God’s eternal enlargement and expression—Rev. 21:1-2.</li>	</ol></li></ol>
