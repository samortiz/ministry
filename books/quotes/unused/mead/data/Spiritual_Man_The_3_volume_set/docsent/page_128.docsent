   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have already seen how a soulish believer becomes a spiritual believer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This does not mean, however, that he will no longer walk according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the contrary, he is always in danger of falling into being fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Satan is always on the watch.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever he has a chance, he will cause the believer to lose his high position and be brought down to a low living.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, it is very important for a believer to always be watchful and walk according to the spirit; then he can always be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans 8 clearly speaks about the importance of walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verses 4 through 6 say, "That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit"; "those who are according to the spirit, mind the things of the Spirit"; "the mind set on the spirit is life and peace."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Walking according to the spirit is in contrast to walking according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a believer does not walk according to the spirit, he walks according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sometimes he may walk according to the spirit and sometimes according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But he should only walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A believer must learn to walk only according to the spirit, only according to the intuition of the spirit, without walking for a moment according to the soul or body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A person who walks according to the spirit will consequently be "spiritually minded."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Being spiritually minded like this makes his whole being "life and peace."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the result of walking according to the spirit is life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Living according to the spirit means walking according to the intuition see Section Five, Chapter One .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Living according to the spirit is to live, work, and act in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is also using the strength of the spirit and being governed by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, life and peace will always be maintained.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a believer does not walk according to the spirit, he cannot maintain his spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, he should know the various functions of the spirit and its law, so that he will know how to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Walking after the spirit is a daily task for believers which must not be forsaken.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should know that while we live on this earth, we do not live according to our good feelings, doing whatever we feel we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Neither should we live according to the good thoughts in our mind, either suddenly or constantly, doing whatever we think.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should act and behave according to the guidance in the intuition of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The small consciousness of the spirit is where the Holy Spirit expresses His thought.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Holy Spirit does not work directly on our mind to make us suddenly think of something.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The work of the Holy Spirit is always done in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, if we want to understand the mind of the Holy Spirit, we should walk according to the intuition in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sometimes our spirit has consciousness but we do not know what it means, what it demands, and what it expresses.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we must spend much time in prayer so that our mind may understand the meaning of the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After understanding it, we must walk accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The mind may suddenly understand what the intuition means.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, if there is no intuition, the sudden thought from our own mind should not be followed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The teaching of the intuition is the thought of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should follow only this.</S>
