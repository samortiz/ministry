   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPERIENCES OF LIFE BEING THE EXPERIENCES OF CHRIST Christ Revealed in Us</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because God is life to us in Christ His Son, the real experience of life is the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God can be life to us only in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is in Christ that God is life to us, so in order to experience God as life, we must experience Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By our experiences and our spiritual knowledge, we know that the experience of Christ as life has steps, or stages.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the Scriptures, the first step, or stage, of the experience of Christ is that God reveals Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the word of the apostle Paul, who in Galatians 1:15-16a says, "It pleased God to reveal His Son in me."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we have the real experience of life, we have at least had this very first step of experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ has been revealed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One day the Holy Spirit reveals Christ to us in a very subjective way, and He brings Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we believe in the Lord Jesus, we receive Him, but in what way do we receive Him?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is by the Holy Spirit revealing Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may classify Christians in three different categories.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some are Christians of Christianity, some are Christians of Christian teachings, and some are Christians of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not be quick to say we are not Christians of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should say, "Apparently I am a Christian of Christianity, yet I am something more."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are also Christians of Christian knowledge and teachings, but we are still something more.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are not only Christians of Christianity and Christians of Christian teachings; we are Christians of Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was born of my mother a Christian of Christianity, although I was not yet reborn.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Later, when I was young I became improved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I became a Christian of Christian teachings by the teachings of the pastors and preachers in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I was taught by Christian teachings to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Praise the Lord, eventually I became a reborn Christian of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One day the Holy Spirit revealed Christ into me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From that time I had a certain experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I knew that Christ is within me as my life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ is no longer merely objective but subjective to me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Formerly I was in Christianity, and I accepted all the Christian teachings, but at that time I did not have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was at a certain time that the Holy Spirit revealed Christ into me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I saw many so-called members of Christian churches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They repented, and they were baptized, but later on they simply gave up Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some who were my age became important members of the Communist Party, which is against Christianity, yet I can recall that when we were young, they were apparently zealous Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, they never met Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ was never revealed to them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be a Christian in Christianity is one thing, to be a Christian by Christian teachings is another thing, and to be a Christian by Christ being revealed in us is a third thing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is to be a real Christian, and this is a real experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first step of the experience of Christ as life is that Christ is revealed into our spirit by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ Living in Us</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The second step, or the second stage, for us to experience Christ as life is Christ living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After Christ is revealed in us, He lives within us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Galatians 2:20 says, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If someone does not know this verse, he has no real part in Christianity.</S>
