   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Saving Us from the Individualism of Our Natural Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being built up together in the Body of Christ saves us from the individualism of our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Individualism is the philosophy, thought, doctrine, and principle of not being one with others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When not going along with others and not being one with others becomes a principle or philosophy, that is individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some brothers or sisters may respect the elders and may realize that the church needs a group of brothers to take care of the administration of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But often these same brothers or sisters may not agree with the elders or may refuse to be one with them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such individualism is difficult to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually, each one of us has this problem of individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to be built into the Body of Christ, we must overthrow individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Conversely, if we are built up in the Body of Christ, we will be delivered from the individualism of our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through Our Cooperation by Presenting Our Bodies as a Living Sacrifice</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are built up in the Body of Christ, saved from the individualism of our natural life Rom 12:5 , through our cooperation by presenting our bodies as a living sacrifice Rom 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the past five years I discovered that the primary frustration to the Lord in carrying out His new way is not our agreement or disagreement with the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The main frustration and difficulty in carrying out the new way is twofold: first, we do not present our body, and second, we do not like to cooperate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we present our bodies and go along with others, we will be in the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not enough to agree with the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must also present our bodies as a sacrifice to the Lord and present our bodies to go along with others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the building up of the Body of Christ, and this is the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In one locality, I know a number of the saints very well.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many of these saints agree with the new way, but there is still very little actual practice of the new way among them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The reason for this is that the saints are short in the presenting of their bodies to the Lord as a sacrifice for the new way, and they are also short in going along with others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the saints would present themselves and go along with one another, immediately there would be the practice of the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To visit people with the gospel is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To visit people requires that we present our bodies to the Lord as a sacrifice and that we go along with others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we go to visit others, the three or four of us that go together should be as one man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this way our visiting people with the gospel becomes very effective.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through Our Cooperation by Not Thinking More Highly of Ourselves than What We Are</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are built up in the Body of Christ through our cooperation by not thinking more highly of ourselves than what we are Rom 12:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We think more highly of ourselves than what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this reason, we see very little of the building up of the Body of Christ and very little actual practice of the new way.</S>
