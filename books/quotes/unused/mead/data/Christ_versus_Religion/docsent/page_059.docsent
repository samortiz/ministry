   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MIRACLES AT THE SEA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Following chapter 20, we have a "P.S.," an appendix, showing us that those disciples were more or less like us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It may have been easy for them to go on in such a seemingly unsettled condition for a couple of days, but for them to continue longer than that was beyond their capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The time came, I do believe, when they had nothing more to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The leading brother, Peter, could stand it no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He said in effect, "Brothers, I'm going fishing, I'm going to get something to eat."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the others said, "Okay, if you go, we're going too."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>So they all went fishing and toiled drearily through the night.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The right time for fishing is not during the day, but at night.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>So they fished at the right time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, some of them were professional fishers, and not only that, but professional fishers on that very lake.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Peter, James and John grew up there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They knew the lake from end to end, from side to side.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet through the whole night they caught nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was the greatest miracle!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Could you believe that professional fishers fishing all night in a sea which they knew so well could catch nothing?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Don't you think this is a miracle?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jesus must have told the fish, "Get away fish!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All kinds of fish, take My order, stay away from My disciples till I tell you to come back."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That was indeed a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was absolutely contrary to natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then the morning came.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They should have been more than disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If they could catch nothing in the night, how could they catch anything in the day?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But in the midst of their despair the Lord Jesus came.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He knew their problem it was a matter of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>So He asked, "Children, have ye aught to eat?" v. 5 . They answered, "No!" Then the Lord replied, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye shall find." He said in effect, "Do it My way; do it according to My word." And they did.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The daytime was not the right time to fish, but this time they fished according to the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They got a net full of fishes, one hundred and fifty-three.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Another miracle!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And then when Peter came to land, he saw that the Lord had some fish there already.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord's implication to Peter was, "There is no need for you to go to sea to fish; even on land I can prepare fish for you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Peter and John, do you need fish?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why don't you ask Me?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am much better than the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even if you go to sea, without My permission you can get nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you only ask Me, though you stay at home, you will have all the fish you need."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Miracle number one was that they caught nothing for the whole night.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Miracle number two was that in the morning, during the day, they caught so many fish.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Miracle number three was that without catching anything from the sea, there was fish already on the land, and it was already cooked, and not only fish, but bread.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everything is ready.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Come and dine!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we put all these points together, we will see that what the Lord said and did to the disciples, including Peter, gives a clear view of the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church life must be absolutely outside of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>With religion, there is always a schedule, an organization, a system, an arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But here there is none.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is only one thing, one living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>And this One is always with us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the open air or under a roof, indoors or outdoors, at home or at the seashore, He is always there.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You simply cannot get rid of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whether you are conscious or unconscious of His presence, He is always with you, and whatever you need He knows.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you need to eat, He will care for you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Don't go fishing He has the fish.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Just enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When problems arise, religion, as we have seen, uses the power of money.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But the Lord Jesus exercises His universal authority.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whenever a work is started for the Lord, the natural, religious concept is always to consider the funds on hand.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>That was why Peter went fishing it was the way to make money for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He felt that he at least needed something to buy groceries.</S>
