<h2 class="head1">THE INCREASE AND SPREAD OF THE CHURCH<br />
BEING ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF FRUIT-BEARING</h2>
<p>According to John 15, we need to bear fruit. When we bear fruit, the church increases. Fruit-bearing is according to a law; it does not depend on our feelings or on a miraculous response to prayer. Fruit is borne according to a law that is assisted by fertilization, watering, and pruning. If there is too much fertilizer, a fruit tree will die, but if there is not enough fertilizer, the tree will not grow robustly. Similarly, if there is too much water, the tree will be damaged, but if there is not enough water, the tree will dry up and die. Thus, we need to pay particular attention to the environment for cultivation, which also includes factors such as sunlight and air. If all these factors work together properly, a tree will begin to bear fruit that will fully ripen in due time.</p>
<p>Today we are branches of the true vine, the Lord, and we have made a vow before the Lord to lead people to salvation. Nevertheless, we must realize that the way to lead people to salvation is not merely to lead them to believe and be baptized; it also involves infusing them with the riches that we have received and experienced through the Spirit so that the divine life can grow in them. In the past we have neglected the law of fruit-bearing, and we were unfruitful.</p>
<p>The law of fruit-bearing involves abiding in the Lord and being in union with the Triune God. Bearing fruit comes out of the law of life, not out of miracles. The law of life, which is the law of fruit-bearing, involves four points: First, we should abide in the Lord, just as the branches abide in the vine, to absorb the life supply of the Lord. Second, we should abide in the Lord to absorb the supply of God the Father as our source of nutrients and the supply of the Holy Spirit as our source of watering and refreshing. Third, we should abide in the Lord to absorb the supply of God as our light and the Spirit as our air. We must receive a supply from God as our nutrients, water, light, and air so that the life within us can grow and bear fruit according to its law. Finally, we need to abide in the Lord and live in the church as the garden of God so that we can be nurtured and protected. We need to live in the church, just as a vine has to remain in the garden, in order to receive protection and care. If a vine is moved to the roadside, it will be trampled to death by traffic. Leaving the church is like leaving the garden that protects and shelters us from loss and damage. When we remain in God&rsquo;s garden, that is, the church, we are preserved. Under these conditions, we will bear new fruit according to the law of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PLANNING FOR THE INCREASE OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In the past you may not have heard that the increase of the church requires planning. However, the Bible shows that God&rsquo;s work, including creation, redemption, the establishment in His new creation, and the building of the New Jerusalem, are all according to a plan. For example, Ephesians 1:4-5 speaks of God&rsquo;s will and of His choosing and predestinating of us according to His will. Our salvation was not an accidental occurrence; we were saved according to God&rsquo;s wise plan, which He carried out with much consideration and prudence (v. 8). People move from place to place, and when they move, they often come in contact with Christians who preach the gospel to them. They may ignore the word of the gospel, but then they may find that their new neighbors are also Christians. Their salvation may seem to be a coincidence, but there are no coincidences with God. We were chosen and predestinated by God for salvation. This indicates that God is a planning God.</p>
<p>The preparation of a plan requires consideration prior to taking action. Planning is essential for businessmen, who must consider such things as the amount of money that is available for expenses and investment, the skill level of the company&rsquo;s manpower, and the amount of other resources that are needed to be profitable. Although these considerations are common in business planning, very few people apply planning to matters related to spirituality, to the church, and to the growth in life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAKING A SCHEDULE ACCORDING TO A PLAN</h2>
<p>God has an eternal plan. Based on His plan, He created the heavens, the earth, and the things in the heavens and on the earth according to a schedule. The increase and spread of the church not only require a plan but also a schedule to carry out the plan. Ephesians 5:15-17 confirms this point, saying, &ldquo;Walk, not as unwise, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.&rdquo; In between the matter of being wise and understanding the will of the Lord, Paul speaks of redeeming the time.</p>
<p>Redemption is related to recovering things that are lost, and in God&rsquo;s eyes, people lose time every day. If a person is not saved, does not love the Lord, does not walk in the will of God, and does not bear fruit according to God&rsquo;s will, in God&rsquo;s eyes the time of his life has been wasted. A believer, however, can redeem the time by being &ldquo;filled in spirit&rdquo; (v. 18). When we walk according to the Spirit and fellowship with the Lord, we do not lose time; instead, we redeem it.</p>
<p>In order to bear fruit for the Lord, we must have a schedule so that our time is redeemed, not wasted. Without a schedule for our daily living, much of our day will be wasted. For example, when we wake up at six o&rsquo;clock on Saturday morning, we may feel that it is too early to get up and decide to sleep a little longer. It may be seven o&rsquo;clock when we are stirred from our sleep again, but because our back is sore, we decide that more sleep is needed. When eight o&rsquo;clock arrives, we may decide to rest even more since we do not have to go to work on Saturday. Finally, at nine o&rsquo;clock we decide to get out of bed but only to drink some water, eat some breakfast, and read the newspaper. By the time we are finished with our breakfast activities, it may be close to the time for a noon nap, which will take up even more of our day.</p>
<p>In contrast, the schedule of a student often prevents him from wasting too much time. Since his classes start every morning at eight o&rsquo;clock, he will use an alarm clock in order to not miss the bus that takes him to school. Even if the alarm clock goes off several times before he gets up, he knows that he cannot continually reset the alarm if he expects to get to school on time. A student needs a schedule, because time and buses do not wait for anyone. If a student comes to the bus stop thirty seconds after its scheduled stop, he will miss the bus. In order to graduate, he needs to redeem the time, arriving at school on time and attending his required courses, day after day, week after week, month after month, and semester after semester.</p>
<p>By applying a schedule of work and rest to an educational plan, a student can complete elementary school in six years, junior high in another three years, high school in three more years, and graduate from college in another four years. If a person works and rests according to a schedule, he can graduate from college even if he is not able to make the highest grades. However, without a plan and schedule, it would be difficult for a student with weak academic skills to graduate. It is difficult to accomplish anything without a schedule. A schedule is the best means to redeem the time.</p>
<p>Many people are restricted by a schedule when they are in school, but after they graduate, it seems as if they &ldquo;graduate&rdquo; from the practice of using a schedule. It is good, therefore, that work also follows a schedule. When we go to work in society, we must follow a schedule. If we are late to work every day, we will be dismissed, and if we want a good job evaluation, we have no choice but to follow a schedule. A person who does not follow a schedule will do poorly in school and probably will be unsuccessful in his career as well.</p>
<p>We have all been saved, but we may never have heard a message about the need for a schedule in spiritual matters. When I was young, I heard many messages on redeeming the time, and I was taught by the Brethren to redeem the time. However, they did not touch the practical point about the need for a schedule for the sake of our spiritual life. It is rare to find anyone who makes a schedule related to his spiritual life. Even if we cannot keep the schedule that we make, it is still good to make a schedule.</p>
<p>A schedule is very important to me. Yesterday morning I woke up at half past three and began to meditate over the contents of this conference. Then I rose up at five o&rsquo;clock and wrote outlines for two messages in preparation for today. This morning I woke up at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning and started to consider the work ahead of me. Nevertheless, I restrained myself from rising up too early in order to not overexert myself physically. I rose at six o&rsquo;clock and quickly completed two outlines for today with the help of an assistant, and I changed the two outlines that I wrote yesterday. If I did not have a schedule, I would never have been able to complete the outlines for these meetings.</p>
<p>All the brothers and sisters in Taipei should make a schedule based on a plan in order to have a new beginning in the church life. Starting from the Lord&rsquo;s Day, we should have a plan for what we need to do every day. We should pray much while making this schedule, because our schedule has to be complete and balanced. Although we must schedule time for morning revival, prayer, and visiting the saints, our schedules will vary based on our individual circumstances.</p>
<p>When considering morning revival, for example, we should not think that we need to set aside an hour and a half in order to be &ldquo;spiritual.&rdquo; Practically speaking, morning revival should be twenty minutes at the most, including ten minutes for reading the Word and ten minutes for prayer. If this is too difficult, we can begin with five minutes for reading the Word and five minutes for prayer. After six months the time can be increased to seven and a half minutes for reading the Word and prayer, and by the end of the year our morning revival can be twenty minutes. In this way, steady progress can be made.</p>
<p>Some localities have a corporate morning revival that is one hour long. However, very few saints can come to a morning revival that lasts one hour. If the majority of the saints are not able to make this time, it is not wise to schedule such a time. Since most people cannot walk on a tightrope, it is not prudent to ask everyone to walk on a tightrope. Hence, the church should not set up or suggest a schedule that most saints cannot meet. A schedule must be appropriate to one&rsquo;s ability. The church in Taipei has asked the saints to schedule ten minutes in the morning for morning revival; this is reasonable. It is useless to set up a schedule that only a few can keep.</p>
<p>The schedule of the meetings of the church should also be considered. In addition to the bread-breaking meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day and the prayer meeting, there are other meetings during the week. When we set a schedule, we must set a suitable schedule. We should not be impulsive and go to meetings when we feel good, but stay at home when we feel cold toward the Lord. We should not be so variable, because this will keep us from advancing in spiritual matters.</p>
<p>The number of meetings a believer should attend must be based on practical daily circumstances. For example, a single sister, who has recently graduated from college and who works only forty hours a week, will have more time at her disposal. In addition to the regular meetings of the church, she can go to one or two additional meetings. This is because her circumstances allow her to attend all the meetings of the church. After this sister is married, she will have a husband and a house that require some attention, and soon she will probably also have children. When she has a house, a husband, and several children to care for, she will not be able to maintain the meeting schedule that she had when she was a single sister. If she tries, her family will suffer. For example, who will take care of her children if her husband must work and she is at a meeting? All these factors must be taken into consideration. If her husband is a brother in the Lord, then the sister should fellowship with him about her meeting schedule. At the same time, the church should also consider the needs of the saints. It might have been possible for a sister to attend every meeting when she was not married, but after marriage and children this is not possible. However, she should not stop meeting altogether, because this would be like having no church life. Rather, she should carefully choose the meetings that she can go to based on her circumstances. At the same time, she should remember her vow before the Lord to bear fruit every year. Bearing fruit requires time, and even though she has a husband and children, she should set aside some time during the week to pray for others and to do some gospel work such as writing letters, sending books, or visiting others. She should do these things even if she has to give up one meeting. This is the principle of setting up a schedule.</p>
