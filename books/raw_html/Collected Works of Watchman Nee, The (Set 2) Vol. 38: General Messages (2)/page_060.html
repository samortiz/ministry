<h2 class="head1">THE OPERATION OF THE LAW OF LIFE</h2><p>On the practical side, we need to learn to know how the law of the Spirit of life operates within us. The Lord uses the law of the Spirit of life to deliver us from the law of sin and of death. He uses one law to overcome another law, and He uses today's law to overcome yesterday's law. How does this law manifest itself in a Christian? How can we detect the law of the Spirit of life in a Christian? We can examine several aspects.</p><p>We can consider first the aspect of knowledge. The law of the Spirit of life will manifest itself in God's children in the way of knowledge. There should not be any ignorant Christians. All Christians (referring to genuine Christians) should have proper knowledge. Whatever we encounter, the Spirit of life in us will give us knowledge concerning it. No Christian can say that he does not know. Every Christian has to admit that the Lord has spoken already. At the most we can say that we have not heard the Lord's speaking; however, we cannot say that the Lord has not spoken. Can we really say that we do not know the Lord's mind? Can we say that we do not know whether or not we can do a certain thing? We can never say this. We may be a weak believer, having just believed in the Lord Jesus and just received life into us. Yet as soon as we believe in the Lord and as soon as the Spirit of life dwells in us, the law will be instructing us within. Many servants of the Lord have met many of God's children in various places, and they have all come to the conclusion that there is not a child of God who does not know His will. There are no ignorant children; there are only disobedient children. When we talk too much, do we not feel something restraining us within? Sometimes when we open our mouth to speak certain things, is there not something within telling us to stop? Do we not have a feeling that we should stop? Brothers and sisters, this life is in us, and it is always manifested through its law.</p><p>It is strange that some of God's children think that they have received the life of God but have not received the law of this life. It would be strange for a man to have life without having the law of that life. We need to realize that both the life and the law of life are linked together. Where there is life, there is also the law of life. Life is inseparable from the law of life. Where there is life, there is also the law of life. If we have God's life, whenever we need knowledge, we will find it within. This is true not only with big matters but also with very small matters, matters that we feel are insignificant. Sometimes when we go to someone's house, our steps may be a little too heavy as we are walking up the stairs. A voice within may say, "This is not right." Walking up stairs is not a big thing, but when the sound of our footsteps becomes a little too heavy, our inner being will tell us that this is not right. Sometimes we want to take a book from someone else's bookshelf and read it, but inwardly a voice says, "This is not right because the book does not belong to you. You have not asked, and you have not been given permission. How can you take it and read it?" Brothers and sisters, the law of life is in us; indeed, it is in us. The problem is that many are not willing to walk according to this law. If a person lives by this life, his feeling will become very sensitive. We have a law within, and this law will tell us that we cannot trespass against others. It will tell us that we cannot be so loud, that our laughter is not proper, or that our motive in saying a word is wrong. We may encounter tens of thousands of things, but the law within will tell us what we should do in each case. Even if a person is not refined or educated, the law of life will be in him as long as he has the Lord's life. The law of life will give him knowledge, and through this knowledge he will express God in his living.</p><p>Why do some Christians always stand in the wrong place and remain unaware of it? Why do some of them always do wrong things and remain ignorant of them? It is not because they do not have life or the law of life, but because they have not learned to follow the law of life within.</p><p>This law also manifests itself in love. Sometimes you feel that a certain brother is really troublesome and that you cannot settle things with him. You need to exert much effort to love him. You may say, "I will love him; I intend to love him. I will pray to the Lord to enable me to love him." But when you are with him, you simply cannot love him. It seems as if you can only nod at him. You may think, "I am a Christian, and I must speak a few words with him or else my conscience will not be at peace." Please remember that this is an act of your will. You are doing it by your will; you are not doing it out of love. If you are a Christian, you do not need to will to love others. Many times even prayer is not necessary, because there is a law within you. When you see such a brother, you know that you can never get along with him, you know that he is very troublesome, and you know that his very presence will irritate you. However, when you stand in front of him, you will spontaneously feel that it is wrong to hate him. Your inward being will not say "amen" to hating him. Instead, something within will love him and tell you, "He belongs to the Lord; he is your brother; he is the Lord's beloved." There is such a feeling within you. There is such a speaking within you. Brothers and sisters, when you are in this kind of situation, you do not need to do anything before the Lord; you do not even need to pray. All you have to do is lift up your head and say to the Lord, "I cannot do it! You can do it." You do not need to exert any effort. You only need to say, "Lord, since You say that he is lovable, I will love him."</p><p>The biggest failure of many Christians at this point is exercising their will. When you feel that a brother is not lovable, you hastily exercise your will to treat him well. Whenever you have a problem, you exercise your will immediately to try to solve this problem. When you meet a person whom you cannot love, you immediately force yourself to love him. Yet in spite of your great effort, you still cannot love him. At such times, you should stop and say to the Lord, "I do not have any strength to love him. Lord, I know that there is a life in me, and this life loves him." Simply remain in His presence. There is no need to think or ask. All you have to do is say, "Lord, I want to live fully by the law of life." You do not need to exert any effort at all, because you believe that there is a law within you, a law that loves the brothers. This gives you the boldness to see him and talk to him. The strange thing is that when you do this, you will unconsciously (note the word unconsciously) converse with him. You will unconsciously love him and unconsciously treat him like a brother. You will talk with him and fellowship with him. Later, even you will be surprised, saying, "I did not do anything. Yet the Lord brought me through beyond my comprehension." Brothers and sisters, this is the law of life; it enables you to unconsciously overcome, without any need of your willpower.</p><p>If we know God, we will realize that the law of the Spirit of life, like the law of sin and of death, is spontaneous. Hallelujah! It is spontaneous. Sinning requires no exercise of the will; the law of sin does it for us. Neither do we need to set our will to do good; it is the law of the Spirit of life that does it for us. Lying, coveting, and losing one's temper require no exercise of the will. There is a law that causes one to lie, covet, and lose his temper. Holiness, righteousness, love, and purity also require no effort of the will; there is a law in us that produces all of these things. The exercise of the will is man's work, not the Lord's work. Herein lies the basic difference. The Lord has given us a law, and this law is spontaneous.</p><p>Many times you realize that you talk too much, speaking words that should not be spoken. You even feel sick and do not understand why you always talk so much. In the course of contact with other people, you worry and say, "I am a Christian. I need to glorify the Lord's name. I should not talk so much." Then what do you do? You exercise your will, and make resolutions, saying, "Today I will be careful not to speak too much." You hold yourself back for an hour or two. You feel no freedom at all, and the longer you hold back, the more unbearable it becomes. You utter countless prayers, saying, "Lord, I should not be talkative. If I continue to be talkative, I will not behave like a Christian. Lord! Have mercy on me. Please protect me! Please watch over me!" However, your will is useless when it comes to controlling your speaking. The Lord lives in you, and the Lord's life is in you. This life has a law, and when this law is manifested in you, there is no need to worry at all. You can say to the Lord, "I am going to So-and-so's house. I will no longer make any resolution. I cannot control my mouth. I know what kind of person I am; I know that I talk too much. But Lord, I believe; I deeply believe that the law of the Spirit of life which You have given me has freed me and delivered me from that law of talking too much." This does not mean that when you go to that house you must continue to consciously say, "I believe the Lord's Word." If you do, you are exercising your will once again. If you really believe, you will forget it, set it aside, and go in a spontaneous way without even thinking about it. The strange thing is that when you do not exercise your will to hold yourself back and when you believe in the Lord's Word, you will not need to make any resolution, worry, or even think about it. Even when the thought of talking too much comes to your mind, it will not bother you any longer. You will be able to sit for two or three hours or even stay for two or three days without feeling troubled. When you come home and think about it, you will say, "I was not concerned and not paying attention to the matter. I did not have to consciously keep myself from talking too much. Why did I not talk so much?" Brothers and sisters, this is the operation of the law of life; it frees you from your incessant talking. This is the Christian life. It is not the work of the will; it is a law. This law is a life; it is spontaneous. The Christian life is a spontaneous life. The law of life in you, like the law of sin and of death, is a law. Just as the law of sin and of death is a very spontaneous law, the law of life that you have received is spontaneous as well.</p><p>O brothers and sisters, we can say much more about this matter. We can relate innumerable experiences to prove this point. Our victory is not a victory of the will but a victory of the law of life. When we need knowledge, there is a law in us that continually gives us knowledge of what is right and wrong. When we are faced with a task, there is strength within us which carries us through in a very spontaneous way. In all of our living, we see the effects of this law. Many Christians live in too much pretension and performance. Many Christians "act out" their Christian life. Their daily life is nothing but a performance. Oh, the moment we see the law of life, the first thing we will do is drop our own work! Many people use spiritual terms and adopt spiritual behavior, yet they are the ones who are doing these things. Once a person sees the law of life, the first thing he will do is drop his own work. Performance is the most damaging thing to the Christian life. Many Christians who perform think that the better they perform, the better Christian they will be. The outward expressions of spirituality of many Christians are artificial; they are the work of the will. When we see the law of the Spirit of life, we will cease all of our outward performance. All of our expressions will be spontaneous; all of our words will be spontaneous; all of our prayers and our living will be spontaneous. With this law in us, how spontaneous our living will be! We will not need to expend any effort; our will will not be required to purpose anything; we will live very spontaneously. After going through a day this way, we will say when we lie down at night, "Today I did not try to be a Christian, yet I lived as a Christian. Today I did not try to do anything, yet the Lord brought me through." Brothers and sisters, when you put aside your will, you will not be any worse than you are today. When you throw aside the crutch of your will, you will not fall. On the contrary, you will become very spontaneous. Formerly, you prayed and asked for this or that from the Lord, just as Jacob did when he wrestled with God. But when you walk before God, you will see that you have become a soft person in His hand. You will not have to pretend to be soft; you are soft already. You will live a simple Christian life, yet throughout your life the Lord's name will be glorified. The Lord has given you life. It is a life that operates in you, a life that speaks in you. There is no need for your own striving or working.</p><p>In conclusion, let us return to Romans 8:1-2: "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." God uses the first law to deliver us from the second law; God uses a new law to save us from the old law. I would like to ask you a few questions. How much do you know of this new law? Is your Christian life governed by your will or by the manifestation of this new law in you? Are you living your Christian life, or is there a spontaneous law, a spontaneous power of life in you that directs you to live the Christian life in a spontaneous way? Brothers and sisters, you can boast about your knowledge; you can boast about your power; you can boast about your work; you can boast about your sacrifice; and you can boast about your intelligence. You can be proud of all these things, but if you do not have this law, you have nothing to be proud of, because you have not learned the first lesson of the Christian life. The first lesson in the Christian life is that the Christian life is very spontaneous. The life in Romans 8 does not require any effort; everything is spontaneous in this life. Oh, may the Lord grant us grace so that we may truly say to Him, "I am willing to live in Your presence. I believe Your Word. I believe that I received the law of life when I was born again. This law is greater than the law of sin and of death. With the law of sin and of death, I sin spontaneously. With this law, I trust You spontaneously, serve You spontaneously, and glorify and praise Your name spontaneously!"</p>
