   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Ministering the Eternal, Heavenly, Spiritual, Living, and Refreshing Things</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On the negative side, Christ is typified by Aaron, while on the positive side, He is typified by Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Aaron as the high priest of the people of Israel helped the people to offer their sin offerings and trespass offerings for their redemption and reconciliation to God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Melchisedec, on the other hand, brought bread and wine to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He did not offer sacrifices for redemption and reconciliation on the negative side, but he ministered something into Abraham on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After Abraham gained the victory, Melchisedec did not come to meet him, saying, "Abraham, you are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now I have to offer sacrifices on your behalf to reconcile you to God and redeem you from your fallen situation."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, he came in a positive way with bread and wine to minister something eternal, heavenly, spiritual, living, and refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hebrews 8:1 says, "Now in the things which are being said the chief point is this: We have such a High Priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While Christ was on the earth, He was a High Priest according to the order of Aaron to offer a sacrifice for our sins and reconcile us to God by the shedding of blood in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After His resurrection and ascension, however, Christ is in the heavens as our High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec, coming to meet us to minister the heavenly bread and the spiritual wine to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>While we are fighting the battle for God's kingdom on this earth, Christ comes from the heavens to meet us as the eternal One, the One without beginning of days nor end of life, to minister and strengthen us with the eternal bread and the heavenly wine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is wonderful and glorious!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although many times we gain the victory in our fighting, we are tired afterwards, and we need the bread and wine as a refreshment and strengthening to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Leaving the Word of the Beginning of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After speaking about the order of Aaron in the last part of chapter four and in chapter five, the writer of this book goes on to speak concerning the order of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He tells his readers that they are childish, that they need to leave the elementary teachings and go on to understand the higher and deeper matters 5:11 6:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even today nearly all of Christianity remains in chapters four and five.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Most Christians know Christ only according to the order of Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They often speak of how Christ loved us, shed His blood and died for us, and redeemed us and reconciled us to God so that we may be justified by faith and forgiven of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same way, the Hebrew believers were in "elementary school," so in chapter six the writer urges them to go on and leave the elementary teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The elementary teachings are good, but we must advance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not remain in the ABCs for so many years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not talk only about how the Lord loves us, how He died for us on the cross, how He bore our sins and shed His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do, this means that we do not know Christ in the heavens, how He resurrected and ascended to the heavens, and what He is doing in the heavens today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is something higher and deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must know Christ according to the order of Melchisedec, the One who comes out to meet us to minister the heavenly bread and wine.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hebrews 6 is a turning point.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After this chapter, Hebrews 7 begins to speak of the heavenly things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It speaks not of a Christ on the earth, offering a sacrifice for sins, but of a Christ in the heavens, ministering the eternal, heavenly, spiritual, and mysterious things into us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a Christ brings us into the heavens and brings the heavens into us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To bring us into the heavens is to bring us into our spirit, and to bring the heavenly things into us is to bring the all-inclusive Spirit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must know this heavenly Christ according to the order of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is such a High Priest according to the heavenly order to minister the life supply to us, not according to the law of a fleshy commandment but according to the power of an indestructible life v. 16 , not merely to redeem us, reconcile us, and deal with our sins, but to minister into us the heavenly life supply, the heavenly power, the heavenly strength, and the heavenly riches, as Melchisedec did to Abraham.</S>
