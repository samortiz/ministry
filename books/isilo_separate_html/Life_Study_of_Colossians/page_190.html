The first three chapters of Ephesians cover the revelation concerning the church. The second three chapters are concerned with the walk worthy of God&rsquo;s calling. Likewise, the first two chapters of Colossians present a profound revelation of the all-inclusive and extensive Christ, whereas the last two chapters cover the proper Christian walk.</p><p>In Colossians 1 and 2 Paul covers many aspects of the all-inclusive Christ. He shows us that Christ is the portion of the saints, the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation, the Firstborn from among the dead, and the mystery of God. According to 1:27, such a Christ dwells in us as our hope of glory.</p><p>Colossians 3:1 says, &ldquo;If therefore you were raised together with Christ, seek the things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s use of the word therefore in this verse indicates that chapters three and four are the outcome of chapters one and two and are based on those chapters. After presenting so many marvelous truths concerning Christ, Paul tells us to therefore seek the things which are above, where Christ is.</p><p>In 3:3 Paul says that our &ldquo;life has been hidden with Christ in God.&rdquo; Notice that Paul does not say that our life is hidden with Christ in heaven. Rather, he tells us that our life is hidden in God, in the living, divine Person. This indicates that God Himself is the realm, the sphere, in which we should live and walk.</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE CRUCIAL MATTERS</h2><p>In this message we shall see that we are one with Christ in the things above. In the following messages we shall consider the renewing of the new man, the arbitrating peace of Christ, the word of Christ inhabiting us, and persevering in prayer. If we are one with Christ in the things above, we shall have the renewing of the new man. Then, in a practical way, the new man will be realized through the arbitrating peace of Christ. Then we shall have the word of Christ inhabiting us, and we shall persevere in prayer. These five points are crucial aspects of chapters three and four of Colossians. If these points were removed from Colossians 3 and 4, these chapters would be lacking in substance.</p><p>These five important matters have much to do with our Christian walk. They are very different from the ethical teachings commonly given to Christians. According to those ethical teachings, believers are charged to improve their behavior, to be good neighbors, to be submissive, and to be loving. There is no doubt that those things are in the Bible. However, they can easily be understood according to the natural concept. Man&rsquo;s natural mind would never conceive of matters such as being one with Christ in the things above, experiencing the renewing of the new man, or having the peace of Christ arbitrating in us. Of course, in the book of Colossians Paul has something to say about husbands and wives, masters and slaves, parents and children. But his word is related to the new man, the peace of Christ, the word of Christ, and persevering in prayer.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_189.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_191.html">Next</a> </body></html>
