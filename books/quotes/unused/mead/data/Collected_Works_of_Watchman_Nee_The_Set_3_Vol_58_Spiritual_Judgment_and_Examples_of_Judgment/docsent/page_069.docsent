   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 49 Date:August 30, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER S. C.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1937 I saw that I was a sinner and believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At that time I was very zealous, but later I became cold and backslidden.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At a certain point I repented in tears, yet I dared not turn back to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The brothers exhorted me to go back to the meetings, but I dared not go.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>While I was praying one day, I cried, "Lord, be merciful."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I felt like a prodigal son returning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I began to read the Bible and to pray again.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I came to John 18, I felt like I was Judas, the Lord's betrayer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I loved money and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I could not help weeping and repenting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Later one of my sons became ill, and I prayed much.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord did not answer my prayer, and he died.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I began to wonder why God treated me in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After that I began to love my wife and children more than the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am not worthy to be called the Lord's disciple.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our brother has to learn to exercise his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He has to judge people and things by his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To judge means to discern.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some brothers and sisters first discern with their mind and then with their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am not saying that we should not use our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am saying that we should first exercise our spirit and then explain things with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we only exercise our mind, we are just a psychologist.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our spirit should be very available.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It should be like an ink pad; others' words should easily leave an impression in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I like what Brother Yu wrote in the first issue of The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He said that the spirit is not the organ for understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When our spirit is calm and available, we will have a clear impression of others' testimonies, and their spirit will make its mark on our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We will be able to sense others' peculiarities.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to learn to free our spirit from all distractions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This will enable us to know others' spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A worker must learn this lesson sooner or later.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are not like the doctors, who use instruments to diagnose their patients.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have our spirit which examines the true condition of every person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we continue to exercise our spirit, our whole being will be held solemnly in check like a thousand horses held silently by reins; it will wait earnestly for a command.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When a man comes to us, we will have a strong spirit to discern him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A worker must serve others by exercising his discerning organ the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must be able to exercise our spirit as freely as we exercise our emotion, mind, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brother Yu said that the spirit is not the organ for understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The organ for understanding is the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a unique statement.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not try to guess what others are doing by our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, we should try to get an impression of others with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A subjective person cannot exercise his spirit, nor can a confused person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The spirit is the organ which receives impressions.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After we receive an impression, we interpret it immediately with the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This interpretation is like developing an image on photographic film with chemicals.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must stop all noise around us before our ears can pick up singing at a distance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should exercise our spirit like a man who concentrates himself to pick up sounds from far away.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once there is a little interruption, the ear will not hear clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to listen with our spirit and receive impressions with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the reason our outer man must be broken and torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the only way for the inner spirit to remain calm.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is our way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>First we exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then we exercise our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our brother's pathway has been relatively straight, and we have much hope for him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But he needs to go through deeper lessons and experience deeper dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He needs to receive a severe breaking that comes with the discipline of the Holy Spirit before he can launch into the deep in spiritual matters and before the living water will flow.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord will tear you down in a deeper way and follow up with a deeper breaking work in you, in addition to all the fragmentary breakings that He has done.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The goal of this breaking is to straighten your pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some people receive a series of dealings from the Lord, but there is a big question as to whether or not these dealings are deep enough.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As for the time that you were backslidden, perhaps the Lord was dealing with you to turn you from trusting in yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There is profit to not sinning, and there is profit even to sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Sometimes God breaks down our self-confidence through our failures.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we fail, not only should we stand up again, but also we should learn some lessons through our fall.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the future we will experience more discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>At any rate, we have to dig the ditch deep before water will flow in. The Lord allows many failures to happen to us for the purpose of breaking our self.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There are blessings for falling, and there are blessings for not falling.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should not only learn to stand up when we fall, but also we should learn the proper lessons in the midst of our falling.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Romans 8 says that all things work together for good to those who love God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This means that even when we fall, the Holy Spirit can turn it into our good.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have to learn deeper lessons through our falls.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should learn not only to refrain from sin the next time but also to give up our self-confidence and self-righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What we need is not just to learn how to stand after we fall, but also to learn how to fall through our falling.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We must daily experience the breaking and tearing down by God before we can experience the building.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God has to tear down our self-justification, self-arrogance, and self-trust.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>All these things will be torn down through our falling.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Jeremiah 1:10 says, "To pluck up and to break down,/To destroy and to tear down,/To build up and to plant."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>May the Lord remove our self-confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>May He break us day by day so that we can be built up.</S>
