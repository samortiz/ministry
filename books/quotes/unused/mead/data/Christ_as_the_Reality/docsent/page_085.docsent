   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST AS OUR TRESPASS OFFERING Scripture Reading: Lev 5:1-19; 6:1-7; 7:7; 1 Pet 2:24; Isa 53:6b, 10a, 11b THE SIN AND THE TRESPASS OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The last of the five offerings is the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may have a problem trying to understand the difference between the sin offering and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In reading Leviticus 4 and 5, many have become confused.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is because chapter five is for the trespass offering, yet the sin offering is also mentioned several times.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let us look at some of the verses in Leviticus 5.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the Lord; one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering" Lev 5:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a trespass offering, but part of it is for a sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the end of verse 9 it says "it is a sin offering."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that these two offerings are closely related to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Leviticus 4 speaks of the matter of doing wrong unwillingly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That needs the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Chapter five concerns the trespass offering, yet notice verses 17 and 18: "And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the Lord; though he knew it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning the thing wherein he sinned unwittingly and knew it not, and it shall be forgiven him" lit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>. Although it is speaking of the trespass offering, it is the same as the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What is the difference between an apple tree and an apple?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may say that one is the seed and the other is the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In a sense there is a difference, but in another sense there is nearly no difference.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When you sow a grain of wheat into the earth, it produces many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The many grains are the fruit of the one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually every grain of the fruit is the same as the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is the same with the trespass offering and the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They are alike, yet there is also a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>NATURE AND DEEDS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First Peter 2:24 tells us that the Lord Jesus in His own self bore our sins in His own body on the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But 2 Corinthians 5:21 says that He was made sin for us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was made sin for us, and He bore our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sins are the trespasses, iniquities, and transgressions which we have committed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But sin is different.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What then is the difference between sins and sin?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sin is in our nature, but sins are our actions and deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Using the illustration of the seed and the fruit, we see two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first aspect is the seed in our nature, and the second aspect is the fruit in our deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In other words, sin refers to our sinful nature, and sins refer to our sinful deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One is the nature, and the other is the deed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are all the same in nature, but we may vary greatly in our deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You may hate people, and I may love people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You may be proud, and I may be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You may have killed several people, and I have killed none.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are so different in our actions, but we are absolutely the same in our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do you think that you are better in nature than a bank robber?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do you think that your nature is better than those who have committed the worst crimes?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As far as our nature is concerned, there is no difference.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whether we are good or bad, whether we are moral or immoral, we are all identical in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But our deeds and actions may be very different from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>So we have two problems: the problem of sin in our nature and the problem of sins in our actions and behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Suppose a man is proud and full of hatred and that he has done much damage to his family and friends.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yet another man is very good; from the day he was born until now he has hardly done anything wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is such a good person.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are all very clear that the bad one needs the blood of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Jesus died on the cross for all his sins, and when he trusts in Jesus, he appreciates His blood so much.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But does the good person need the blood of the Lamb of God?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The blood is for the cleansing of sins, but he seemingly does not have any sins.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is apparently so perfect and fine.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Why should he need the blood of Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yet we must realize that he is only fine and perfect outwardly in the eyes of man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Inwardly he is just sin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Regardless of whether people are good or bad, inwardly everyone is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We all need Jesus, because Jesus not only bears our sins, but He was also made sin for us.</S>
