 <h2 class="head2">I. Satan&rsquo;s Six Great Undertakings in the Universe</h2>
<p>Satan has done much work in the universe. Of these works, six are quite important and every Christian should memorize them. After these six great tasks, Satan&rsquo;s destiny will come to an end.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Rebelling</h2>
<p>See Isaiah 14:13-14.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Stealing Away the First Adam</h2>
<p>See Genesis 3:1-4.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Tempting the Last Adam</h2>
<p>See Matthew 4:1-11.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Killing the Righteous One (the Lord Jesus)</h2>
<p>See Acts 3:15 and 7:52.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Being Incarnated as the Antichrist</h2>
<p>The Bible shows us that one day Satan will also become flesh to be the Antichrist. The coming Antichrist will be the embodiment of Satan, just as Christ is the embodiment of God. As Christ is the proper mingling of God and man, Antichrist will be the illegitimate mixture of Satan and man. See Revelation 12:9-12, 13:2, and 2 Thessalonians 2:8-9.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Deceiving at the End of the Millennium</h2>
<p>See Revelation 20:7-10.</p>
<h2 class="head2">J. Satan&rsquo;s Judgment</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being Cast Out from the Holy Mountain of God</h2>
<p>Satan was originally God&rsquo;s anointed cherub, who stood before God upon the holy mountain where God dwelt. When he rebelled against God because of his pride, he was cast out by God from the holy mountain. This is recorded in Ezekiel 28:16-17.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being Judged and Destroyed<br />
by the Lord on the Cross</h2>
<p>On the cross, the Lord not only bore man&rsquo;s sins, He also destroyed Satan. Through death, the Lord Jesus destroyed the devil, who has the might of death. See Hebrews 2:14, John 12:31, and 16:11.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Being Cast Down to the Earth</h2>
<p>As soon as the overcomers are caught up to heaven, Satan will be cast down from heaven to the earth. See Revelation 12:8-10 and 13.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Being Bound and Cast into the Abyss<br />
for One Thousand Years</h2>
<p>See Revelation 20:1-3 and compare with Isaiah 14:15.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Being Cast into the Lake of Fire</h2>
<p>See Revelation 20:10. The ultimate end of Satan will be to be cast into the lake of fire.</p>
