   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DIVISION, THE FRUIT OF EMPTINESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why does emptiness bring in division?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is because on the one hand you are empty and on the other hand you will not give up.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You are taking care of a church, and the church has become empty, and you have become empty.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The reason the church has become empty is because you have taken the lead to be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yet you won t give up.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You still want to keep the church and keep things as they are.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This desire to keep the church and to keep things as they are offers a chance for the ambitious ones to step in. In every age, in every stage, there have been ambitious ones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the one hand the churches have become empty, and on the other hand they would not let go of what was in their hand; this situation has opened the door for the ambitious ones to step in.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The gifted ones at first are not that ambitious.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But, because of your ability, you have accomplished something, and what you have done tempts you to be ambitious.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you had not succeeded in anything you did, you would not have thought about becoming great.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Your successful work becomes a temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then you will go on to do more, and the more successful you are the more you will be tempted by ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then a division will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If all the churches are full of Christ, full of life, full of spirit, full of truth with light, I tell you there will be no opening for any ambitious ones to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is a history of this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the Christians in England two centuries ago had not been empty, I don t think John Wesley would have had that much opportunity to become great.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A revivalist is raised up because of the lukewarmness of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Their indifference offers an opportunity to the outstanding ones to take some action.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Such action issues in division.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>NARROWNESS, AN EVIDENCE OF POVERTY</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Along with this point, we must be aware that the more you are full, the broader your heart and mind are.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more you become empty or poor, the more narrow you are in your heart, in your concept.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You will be exclusive, especially in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then you will take the position of assuming more authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You will say, We are the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We don t agree with this brother, or with that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We don t agree with that brother doing what he is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, you are not open to all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such an attitude, you must know, will shut out much of the Lord s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you are rich, full, you become greathearted; you are open to take others in. Some of the elders forgive me for saying this are to my observation very narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You are open only to yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You do not give others a chance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You care only for your own concepts, your own ways, your own doings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the one hand, you may be excluding some saints who are there from participating; on the other hand, you may be shutting the door for more to come in. Do you know what the result will be? You will be dried up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Of course, to embrace everyone blindly is foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But to take this as an excuse in order to carry out your narrow kind of practice will dry up and even kill the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is such a danger.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>STAYING TOO LONG IN ONE LOCALITY</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From our experience and observation we feel this danger arises when the elders are in one locality too long.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I hope I have the proper utterance to express myself rightly and not to damage you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For an elder to be in one locality for too long a time raises this danger.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You will become indifferent.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You will become narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You will not embrace others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you are zealous, you will not be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is only when you become indifferent, lukewarm, and therefore poor, that you become narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You are not rich, yet you still want to keep your position; you want to keep things in the church just as they are.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order to do this, you become exclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>DRYNESS AND DIVISION IN THE HIGH PLACES</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The result is that the water will not flow to your place.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The water means the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The blessing will take another way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To have the blessing, you must be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Your elevation must be leveled.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Why doesn t the blessing come?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Why doesn t the water flow?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is because your place is too elevated.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You have to lower yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You must cut down the elevation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the Old Testament a high place is a negative term.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The high places were where idols were worshipped.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Lukewarmness and indifference create the high place.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You become dry.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even if the water would like to re-enrich you, it cannot stay.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You have no reservoir to preserve even the rain water; there is no need to say that the river cannot flow up to your high place.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All these troubles are of one source: the loss of zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To my observation, some of the churches have become narrow already.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The eldership cannot embrace in an inclusive way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You may say, I don t control things.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But I don t mean that you control things.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>To control is one thing; to be narrow is another.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Simply not to control is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You need to include others.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But a poor man cannot embrace others.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>To do so, you must be rich in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You must be full of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is not easy for the eldership not to control.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is even harder for the eldership not to be narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>These are cause and effect, and cause and effect create a cycle.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is a serious danger.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The high places not only represent indifference.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Every high place is a division.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The people were all to go to Jerusalem, the center of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The high places were divisions with idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Don t think this is just the Old Testament history.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It is also the New Testament story.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Among Christians, the story is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The earth is full of high places.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>These places are dried up, full of narrowness because they are poor.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Zeal will kill the source of the indifference.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Thus, regardless of how long you have been an elder in a local church, as long as you are zealous, there is no danger.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When your zeal is gone, the danger is present.</S>
