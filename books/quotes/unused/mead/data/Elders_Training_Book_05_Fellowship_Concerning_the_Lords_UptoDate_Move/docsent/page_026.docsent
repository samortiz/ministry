   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE AGES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Between eternity past and eternity future there are basically three ages: the age of the old creation, the age of the new creation, and the age of restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From God s creation of the heavens and the earth in Genesis 1:1 to the beginning of the age of grace is the time span of the age of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The age of grace is the age of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Most of the promises in the Old Testament are related to the age of the new creation, the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A small portion of the promises in the Old Testament are related to the coming age such as the ones from Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the age of the old creation God created mankind and the entire universe, and when what he created became fallen he came in to heal, to restore.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To restore the fallen creation is to recover and maintain it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God firstly created and then God restored.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can see from Genesis to Malachi how God healed, recovered, and maintained His fallen creation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Part of this maintenance was the keeping of His chosen people under the custody of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the age of grace, God is doing neither a work of creation nor a work of restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The age of grace is the age of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The old creation is merely the creation without God in it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The new creation is the old creation born of God with God as its new element.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The old creation, because of the addition of God to it, becomes the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The old creation does not have the divine nature, but the new creation, the believers born again of God, does John 1:13; 3:15; 2 Peter 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, they are a new creation Gal 6:15 , not according to the old nature of the flesh, but according to the new nature of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The work of God in the age of grace is to produce the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the coming age, in the millennium, God will neither create nor produce the new creation, but he will do a work of restoring the old, fallen creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This restoration work does not include us because by that time we will have become the new creation already.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Matthew 19:28 describes the age of restoration, the coming kingdom age Acts 3:21 , after the Lord s second coming And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you that you who have followed Me, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of His glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Greek word for regeneration in this verse is also used in Titus 3:5.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This Greek word is different from the word for born again 1 Peter 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Matthew 19:28 this word is used for the restoration of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Titus 3:5 it refers to a change from one state of things to another.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The second birth which the Lord speaks about in John 3 is something of the divine life, the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But regeneration in Matthew 19:28 does not denote anything related to the inner life but rather something related to a change of condition, a restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Acts 3:21 also refers to the times of restoration in the millennium, as prophesied in Isaiah 11:1-10 and 65:18-25, referred to by Christ in Matthew 17:11 and 19:28.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Acts 3:21 tells us that heaven must receive the Lord Jesus until the times of restoration of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The coming age will be an age of restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Restoration is not to regenerate with the divine life but to restore the fallen things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the Bible, the three ages related to God s work of creation are the age of the old creation, the age of the new creation, and the age of restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The entire creation became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Out of this fallen creation God chose some out of mankind to be regenerated with His life and even with Himself to make them a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Second Corinthians 5:17 tells us that if anyone is in Christ he is a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the Lord comes back, the age of the new creation will be over.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By that time many of the descendants of Adam will have died already; some will still be living on the earth and the Lord will judge them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Second Timothy 4:1 tells us that the Lord Jesus is the Judge of the living and the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As the righteous Judge 2 Tim 4:8 , He will judge the living on His throne of glory at His second appearing Matt 25:31-46 , and He will judge the dead on the great white throne after the millennium Rev 20:11-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His judgment of the living at His coming back is fully revealed in Matthew 25.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He will gather all the living nations to Himself and He will divide them into sheep and goats.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The goats will go to the lake of fire and the sheep will be transferred into the millennium on the earth to be the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These sheep have never been and they will never be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Revelation 20:8-9 tells us that at the end of the millennium some of the nations will be instigated by Satan to rebel against God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After the Lord s judgment on these rebellious ones, the remnant of the nations will be in the new heaven and the new earth to be the nations outside the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Revelation 21 there are two categories of people the peoples of God on the new earth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>3-4 and the sons of God in eternity vv.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>5-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The sons of God are regenerated to be the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The peoples of God are not regenerated but restored to their created condition which was lost due to the fall of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Through Christ s redemption, the heaven, the earth, and all created things were reconciled, redeemed back to God Col 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Redemption is not a matter of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To be redeemed is not to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For the heavens and the earth to be redeemed does not mean that they were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ s redemption is not only for us, the regenerated people, but also for all the things in the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The sheep in the millennial kingdom and the peoples of God outside the New Jerusalem will be the restored ones and the redeemed ones, but they have never been and will never be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the new heaven and the new earth, the tree of life has two functions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One function is to produce the fruit to feed the believers and the other function is to produce leaves for the healing of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Healing is something miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The miraculous healing through the leaves of the tree of life is related to the physical body of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The fruit of the tree of life which feeds the believers is related to the divine life within them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Let us now summarize in a brief way what we have fellowshipped concerning God s work in all the dispensations.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God created the universe and His creation became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then God came in to regenerate His chosen people, who were part of the old creation, to make them a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At the Lord s coming back, He will judge the living.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some of these living ones will be the peoples on the new earth at the time of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>At the end of the millennium some of these peoples will rebel and God will judge them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The remnant of these living ones will be transferred into the new earth and will be the nations, the peoples of God around the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>These peoples will have been restored and even redeemed, but they will never have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the new heaven and the new earth, God will have a new creation plus a restored part of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At the consummation of God s work in the new heaven and the new earth is God s new creation with Himself in this new creation as its life and its everything.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This new creation is actually the New Jerusalem, which is a mingling of the Triune God with His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified people.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In eternity future there will also be the restored old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must realize that the new heaven and the new earth will not be another heaven and another earth.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The new heaven and the new earth will be the old heaven and the old earth restored but not regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The new heaven and the new earth and all the nations are the restored old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In the center of the restored old creation is the new creation, the New Jerusalem.</S>
