This universal increase, Christ&#8217;s bride, is the aggregate of all those who have been regenerated. It is a living composition of all regenerated human beings. This is the bride as the universal increase of the unlimited Christ.<p>How can we become parts of the bride as Christ&#8217;s universal increase? This is possible only as we receive the rhema of God so that we may be filled with the life-giving Spirit. If we receive the word and are filled with the Spirit, we shall enjoy eternal life. The result is that we become the bride, the universal increase of the unlimited Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE IMMEASURABLE SPIRIT</h2><h2 class=head2>The All-inclusive Compound Spirit Typified by the Compound Ointment</h2><p>Let us now consider the immeasurable Spirit. The word &#8220;immeasurable&#8221; not only denotes the sphere of the Spirit, but also denotes the contents and nature of the Spirit. The immeasurable Spirit is immeasurable in sphere. It is immeasurable also in contents and in nature, that is, in what the Spirit is. The immeasurable Spirit is actually the all-inclusive compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25. (For the details concerning this see Life-study of Exodus, Messages 157 to 166.) The immeasurable Spirit as the all-inclusive compound Spirit is not simply the Spirit of power or the Spirit of life. This immeasurable Spirit is actually the consummate expression of the Triune God.<p>The immeasurable Spirit is beyond our understanding. It is beyond our ability to speak concerning this all-inclusive Spirit. We simply do not have the utterance adequate to describe this immeasurable Spirit. We know that culture gives rise to words and terms in language. We do not yet have the spiritual culture necessary to have the language adequate to describe fully the immeasurable, all-inclusive Spirit.<h2 class=head2>The Life-giving Spirit</h2><p>The immeasurable Spirit is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). In resurrection Christ became a life-giving Spirit for imparting life. As the life-giving Spirit, He is ready to be received by those who believe in Him. When we believe into Him, He enters our spirit, and we are joined to Him as the life-giving Spirit. In this way we become one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17).<p>Today some oppose the truth that Christ in resurrection is the life-giving Spirit. They say that as Adam became a living soul through creation, so Christ became a living Spirit through resurrection. However, they deny that the life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45 is the Holy Spirit who gives life. However, they admit that the Holy Spirit gives life. This is an improvement over the concept that the Holy Spirit is simply an instrument or power and not a person. But Paul says that the last Adam, Christ in the flesh, became not only a spirit, but a life-giving Spirit. This does not denote merely the spirit of Christ as a being. Christ, of course, does have a spiritual being. In the Gospel of Mark we are told that when Christ was on earth, He perceived matters in His spirit (Mark 2:8). Furthermore, when He was dying on the cross, He committed His spirit to God the Father (Luke 23:46). We also know from the book of 1 Peter that after Christ was crucified and before He was resurrected, He went in spirit to Tartarus to proclaim God&#8217;s victory (1 Pet. 3:18-19). Before He was resurrected and while His body was still in the tomb, Christ&#8217;s spirit went to Tartarus to make such a declaration. In 1 Corinthians 15:45b Paul says that Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit. The Spirit here is the Spirit who gives life. The spirit of Christ, which after His death and before His resurrection went to Tartarus, could not give life. But the Spirit who Christ became is the life-giving Spirit, identical to the Holy Spirit who gives life (2 Cor. 3:6).<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_050.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_052.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John &nbsp; pg 51</div><br></body></html>
