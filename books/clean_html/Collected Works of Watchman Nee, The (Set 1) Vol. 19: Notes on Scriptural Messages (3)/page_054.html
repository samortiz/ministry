<P>We all know that death is a great limitation. All living creatures come to their end at death. The greatest limitation to all living things, whether blades of grass or large trees, is death. A cat or a dog may follow us for three or five years; they may be very clever and useful. But they cannot live forever; their lives are limited. Once they die, they are through. The same is true with man. The foolish rich man might be very good at planning, but "God said to him, Foolish one, this night they are requiring your soul from you; and the things which you have prepared, whose will they be?" (Luke 12:20). Once death comes, everything is over. As long as a man is in his body, he can do many things and be very useful. But his usefulness stops at death. However, with our Lord, death no longer exists. Death has been shattered by our Lord. Death cannot hold Him. Holding is to limit, and resurrection has broken through the greatest limitation. No gate, city, or mountain can stop resurrection. No problem of yesterday, today, or tomorrow can stop Him. He is not only living, but He will not die. He not only will not die, but He has no possibility of death. He is the living one. He became dead, but He is alive, and He will live forever and ever (Rev. 1:18). In Him, all barriers have been broken.</P><P>Resurrection is the power of God. Ephesians 1:20-21 says, "Which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all...not only in this age but also in that which is to come." After the Lord resurrected, He sat on the right hand of God and was far above all things. Everything that can be named is under Him, not only in this age, but in that which is to come. In creation God did not gain the man He was after, but after the Lord's resurrection God gained such a man. God wanted to gain a created man who is the same as He is. If He cannot gain a created man who is the same as He is, He has not gained what He is after. Only the self-existing and ever-existing God is above all things. However, God wants man, who is neither self-existing nor ever-existing, to also transcend over all things. There must be one created man who is transcendent over all things before God's goal can be attained. When the Lord resurrected from the dead and was received to the right hand of the Father, He annulled all the limitations of death, as well as all other restrictions, and God gained the man that He was after.</P><P>We must see that the Lord was incarnated to be a representative man. He lived thirty three and a half years on earth as a representative, and after His resurrection He was still a representative. During His thirty or more years on earth, He was a representative of what man should be in his moral standard. In other words, He spoke forth God's demand on man's morality. After His resurrection when He appeared to the disciples for forty days, He was a representative of what God would give to man as far as power is concerned. On the one hand, the Lord Jesus was a representative of the standard man that God desires. In Him we see God's requirement on man's morality, conduct, and spiritual condition. Therefore, if the Lord Jesus had not died for us and redeemed us from sin, His living on earth would have only been a condemnation of our sins, because we have all come short of the glory of God, and He, as a man, received God's glory and fulfilled God's glory. He was a standard man. When we compare ourselves with Him, we all become sinners and have come short. When the Lord Jesus was manifested in the flesh on earth, the moral standard which He maintained became the standard for every man. When God declared, "You are My Son; today I have begotten You," it did not refer to Bethlehem, but to resurrection. It was on the day of resurrection that the Lord said to Mary Magdalene, "Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God" (John 20:17). This shows us that as sons of God, we begin from resurrection. God wants not only a moral man, but a man of power. Man cannot satisfy God by having a proper moral standard alone; there must also be great power. Since Bethlehem, the Lord Jesus never once came short of God's glory. He was the man with the highest standard of morality. But after the Lord's resurrection, when God declared, "You are My Son; today I have begotten You," He manifested another aspect of manâ€”the man of power. At that time, there was no further problem with time and space. There was no problem with anything. The only remaining question is whether or not man sees it.</P><P>Resurrection is too deep a subject. Strictly speaking, we can only touch a little of this subject. We have to sing a song to praise our Lord's resurrection:</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Thousands of years went by, and we see only men leaving;<br>The number who left were in tens of thousands.<br>It had become a law to leave and not to return;<br>We see no one returning.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Death has its locks, and Hades its gates;<br>But they are only for shutting up,<br>For keeping men in, and not for letting men out;<br>This traffic is one way only!</P><P CLASS=HBODY>God's Son once passed through these gates,<br>Which were doubly bolted.<br>Though death tried its best,<br>He rested as ordinary men.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Since He is life, He can resurrect;<br>Yet He waited for three days.<br>He was restricted only by the Spirit,<br>But was not limited in power.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Hallelujah, He has resurrected!<br>Of all the thousands who have gone,<br>Only this One returned;<br>Only His tomb is empty.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>He has once for all destroyed<br>The once victorious ground of death.<br>The sting of death has stung Him once,<br>And can no more attack.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Since one has returned, all will return;<br>He is the Firstfruit.<br>We who have wilted through Adam,<br>Are resurrected through Christ.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Hallelujah, Christ is Victor!<br>Never to be imprisoned again.<br>Hallelujah, the power of death<br>Is now shattered forever.</P>
