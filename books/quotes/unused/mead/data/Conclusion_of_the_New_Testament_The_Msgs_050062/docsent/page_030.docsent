   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>51.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Master Sovereign Lord</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To the believers Christ is also the Master as their Sovereign Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second Peter 2:1 speaks of Christ as the Master who bought us, referring both to Christ's person and His redemption, by which He purchased the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jude 4 speaks of "our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word translated "Master" in this verse is despotes, which denotes one who is the absolute owner and who has unlimited power over another.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>52.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Friend</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord's word in John 15:15 indicates that He is a Friend to the believers: "No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his lord is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things which I have heard from My Father, I have made known to you."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John 15:13-15 indicates that as branches we have an intimate relationship with the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The branches are not the Lord's slaves; they are His friends, and He is a Friend to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because the branches are the Lord's friends, they can know the Father's desire to be expressed, glorified, in a corporate Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What the Lord has heard directly from the Father He has made known to His friends.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>53.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brother</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As believers in Christ, we have Christ as our Brother.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Romans 8:29 says that those whom God foreknew "He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's purpose is to produce many brothers of His firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, we have been predestinated by God to be conformed to the image of the Son so that He may be the Firstborn among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ, the believers' Brother, is the model and pattern for all His brothers, who will be conformed to His image.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He, the Firstborn, is the prototype, and we, the believers as His many brothers, are the mass production.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's purpose is to have many brothers of His firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Christ was the only begotten Son, He was unique.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But God desires to have many sons who will be the many brothers of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this way the only begotten Son of God becomes the Firstborn among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is the firstborn Son, and we are the many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's purpose in having many sons is that we express Him in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's kingdom is built up with His many sons, and the Body of Christ is built up with His many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without the many sons God cannot have a kingdom, and without the many brothers Christ cannot have a Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, the many sons of God are for the kingdom of God, and the many brothers of Christ are for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The kingdom of God is the Body life, and the Body life in the church is God's kingdom where He is expressed and where His dominion is exercised on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is God's purpose in producing us as the brothers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through the process of conformation, the firstborn Son will have many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the Son of God in eternity, Christ was the unique, only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now through His incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, Christ has become the Firstborn, and the believers have become His many brothers who are being conformed to His image for God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the day of His resurrection the Lord Jesus said to Mary, "Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God" John 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before His resurrection, the Lord never called His disciples brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But now, after His resurrection, they have become His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through His resurrection the disciples have been regenerated 1 Pet 1:3 with the divine life released by His life-imparting death, as indicated in John 12:24.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First Peter 1:3 says that we were regenerated through Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was through His resurrection that Christ imparted Himself as the Spirit into His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By receiving His life, they were reborn and became His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now the believers are brothers of Christ because they have the same life as He.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In His resurrection Christ, the only begotten Son, became the Firstborn among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These many brothers are those who have been regenerated through the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This was the reason the Lord said to Mary, "Go to My brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These many brothers are the propagation of the Father's life and the multiplication of the Son in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, in Christ's resurrection God's purpose is fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hebrews 2:11 says, "Both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He who sanctifies is Christ as the firstborn Son of God, and those who are being sanctified are the believers of Christ as the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The "one" here refers to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Son, who is the Sanctifier, and we, who are being sanctified, are all of one Father.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Both the firstborn Son of God and the many sons of God were born of the same Father God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Both the firstborn Son and the many sons are the same in the divine life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, Christ is not ashamed to call them brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because Christ and the believers are of the same source and have the same life with the same nature, He is not ashamed to call us brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Through His life-imparting death and resurrection, Christ has made the believers one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now His Father is also the believers' Father, and His God is their God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Through Christ's resurrection we have received the Father's life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>By making us His brothers, Christ has imparted the Father's life and nature into us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>By making His Father and God ours, He has brought us into His position the Son's position before the Father so that we may partake of the Father in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, in life and nature inwardly and in position outwardly, Christ and His many brothers are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Father is not only the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ; He is also the Father of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We, the many brothers, are the same as the Firstborn, and He is the same as we are.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Christ, the firstborn Son of God, is our elder Brother.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As such, He is our model and example.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Because He is our elder Brother, He takes the lead in everything, and we follow in His footsteps.</S>
