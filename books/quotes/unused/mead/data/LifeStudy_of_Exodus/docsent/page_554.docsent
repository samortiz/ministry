   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SATAN S USURPING OF GOD S GIFTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another principle related to idolatry is that idolatry is Satan s usurping of what God has given us in order to make it a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Exodus 32 the children of Israel wasted much of the gold that had been given to them by God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before the children of Israel left Egypt, God caused the Egyptians to give the children of Israel gold and other precious things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This gold was to be used for building up the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The tabernacle required a large quantity of gold to overlay the standing boards.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God defeated the Egyptians, and they gave gold to the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But before this gold was used for the building up of God s dwelling place, Satan came in to usurp the gold and use it to make an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, before the calf was made, Satan had already usurped the gold so that it might be used to make earrings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If the children of Israel had loved the Lord to the uttermost, they would never have wasted the gold by using it for earrings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead, they would have kept it for the Lord s use.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In chapter thirty-five the people were commanded to offer gold and other materials for the building up of God s tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first item of the offering for God s dwelling place was gold.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But in chapter thirty-two a large quantity of gold was used to make a calf.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No doubt the golden calf was not something small.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It may have been quite large.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A lot of gold was wasted in making that golden calf.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God has given us many things not for self-beautification, but for us to worship God and glorify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But before we use these things to worship and glorify God, the enemy tries to come in to usurp what God has given us and to waste it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the second principle of idolatry, and it is an offense to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE WORSHIP OF ENJOYMENT</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Another principle is implied by the fact that the people did not make an image of Moses, or one of a horse or other work animal.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, they made a golden calf.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A calf is not for labor but for enjoyment, in particular, for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Both in the Old Testament and in the New, a calf was used to feed guests.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Genesis 18 Abraham had a fatted calf prepared for his guests, and in the parable in Luke 15 the father had the fatted calf killed when the prodigal son came home.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A calf, therefore, signifies enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The ones who beautified themselves in Exodus 32 liked enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Enjoyment was their idol.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Likewise, many people today worship a calf; that is, they worship their enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This interpretation of the significance of the calf is confirmed by 32:6: And they rose up early the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and they rose up to play.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After the golden calf was made, the people ate, drank, and played.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>C. A. Coates says that they sported.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the weekends many people in this country care only for eating, drinking, and sporting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to verse 18, Moses heard the sound of singing, and according to verse 19, he saw the calf and the dancing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Along with the eating, drinking, and sporting, the people were singing and dancing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All this took place in front of the golden calf.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The picture here indicates that the calf signifies enjoyment and that the children of Israel were worshipping what they enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>PRETENDING TO WORSHIP THE TRUE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet another principle is that idolatry is pretension.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every idolater pretends to be worshipping the true God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 4 says, And they said, This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 5 says that when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation and said, A feast to Jehovah tomorrow!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The next morning they rose up early and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings v. 6 . The offerings and the way of worship were proper, but the object of worship was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The children of Israel had changed the object of their worship from the true God Himself to an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus they changed their glory to the likeness of an ox that eateth grass Psa 106:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Jehovah God was their glory, but they changed their glory to an ox that eats grass.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is very similar to what is described in Romans 1:23: And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Nevertheless, every idol worshipper claims that the idol he worships is the true God.</S>
