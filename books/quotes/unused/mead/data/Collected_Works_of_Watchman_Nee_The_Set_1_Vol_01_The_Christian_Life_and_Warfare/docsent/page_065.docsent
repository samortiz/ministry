   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Shrinking from doing God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When you find yourself defeated, you may ask what is the meaning of the interference of the enemy?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why cannot the stream of the power of God go on?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You think it is this and that, and deal with it, but there is no change.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then, after asking God for light, you discover that you were shrinking from what you know you ought to do.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How can the Holy Spirit work when you thus cease from co-operation?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A little hesitation will push you below the point.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then you say, "Lord, I am going to do what Thou dost desire!"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then the power of God comes in, and all goes well.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The enemy will endeavour to hide from you the fact that you are in a lower plane, by dulling the conscience and giving all sorts of excuses to account for what is going on, until you are in such a state as to be almost powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then he inflicts his suffering, and you have the greatest difficulty in getting on your feet again.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Live up to the hilt of the spirit life to which God has brought you, then you will have the power of God to do the will of God at the highest point God seeks from you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>See a few more examples of how Christ walked in the will of God:</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John iv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>34 shows the Spirit of God guiding the Lord at the well, when, in answer to the disciples who were anxiously inquiring about His food, He said, "My meat is to do the will of Him that sent me..."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In John vii.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>3, 6, His brethren said to Him, "Depart from hence...Jesus saith to them, My time is not yet come, but your time is alway ready."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here is the restraining power of the Spirit, so that He is not moved by His brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Again in John xi.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>5, 6, we read, "Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When He had heard therefore that he was sick He abode two days still in the same place where he was."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His were spiritual bonds.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was God's will first.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Though misjudged by those He loved, He did not move.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How did He know God's will?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was never moved from outside; never moved by a family taunt, by sarcasm and unbelief; never moved even by the calls of love.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was in spiritual bonds to do God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The consent of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is important to remember that both GOD AND SATAN REQUIRE THE CONSENT OF THE WILL.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The will of the unsaved, even though it be enslaved by Satan is capable of choice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"Whosoever will may come and take of the water of life freely."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>So man must put his will on God's side for Him to work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"If any man will to do..."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's part in giving you power to "will" is referred to in Phil ii.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>13.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"It is God that worketh in you to will..." i.e., He works in you up to the point of your "willing" He does not "will" instead of you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Man's will needs God's power to energize it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Apart from it, it is mere will-worship Col ii.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>23 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul said, "To will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good, I know not."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Man may also set his will against God's will" This they willingly are ignorant of" 2 Peter iii.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>5 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The servant that knew His will and did it not, shall be beaten with many stripes Luke xii.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>47 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now as to the danger of THE WILL OUT OF ACTION.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Passivity of will arises through a wrong conception of surrender.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Romans xii.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>1, gives the true meaning of surrender.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service...that ye may prove what is... the will of God."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To walk after the will of God the spirit requires a voluntary act of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Your will must guide or CONTROL your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets 1 Cor xiv.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>32 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For instance, your spirit may go out into an ecstasy, or a strain, beyond the volitional control of your will.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then it goes too far.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>YOUR SPIRIT MUST ALWAYS BE KEPT WITHIN THE CONTROL OF YOUR VOLITION.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Reference has been made to the spirit being lifted, but when the spirit is liberated and buoyant, then the new plan of the powers of darkness is to drive your spirit, and drive your body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some people are simply being driven on by the enemy they are always in a strain, always on the stretch, running after something.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It means that the spirit is being drawn out by the powers of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord Jesus knew the will of God in His spirit because it was always in perfect poise never strained, never crushed, never elated, never driven, never slow.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When He was going to raise the girl from the dead, He was stopped on the way, and He had time to stay and attend to the needs before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The ideal is a spirit in perfect poise.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is in that condition you learn how to watch and resist the powers of darkness coming against your spirit, and forcing you on, or, more often, forcing you down.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The relationship of the will to the spirit may be illustrated by that of the string to the kite.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The string of a kite, which holds it steady, is its power.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The moment it is let go it is lost, and drops.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord Jesus walked in the will of God, by knowing it in His spirit and in His intelligence.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The reverse to the action of the will is passivity.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When you find your will passive and slow in action you can bring it into action by saying "I have a will."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then having a will of your own, the principle to safeguard its action, is the Lord's own attitude and choice, "I seek not Mine own will."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>May the Spirit of God teach us how to follow the steps of our Pattern, and like the Son of God so walk with God in seeking and doing His will, that we stand perfect and complete in all the will of God Col iv.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>12 .</S>
