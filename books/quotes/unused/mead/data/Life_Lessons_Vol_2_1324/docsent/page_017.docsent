   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LESSON TWENTY BEING FILLED INWARDLY AND OUTWARDLY WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT 2 II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE INWARD FILLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To us the Holy Spirit is of two aspects the inward aspect and the outward; therefore, to us there is also the inward filling and outward filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The New Testament uses two different words in its original language to describe the inward filling and the outward filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Speaking of the inward filling of the Holy Spirit, it uses the word pleroo, and speaking of the outward filling of the Holy Spirit, it uses the word pletho.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, we will look at the inward filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. The Fact of the Inward Filling of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1 "And the disciples were made full of joy and of the Holy Spirit" Acts 13:52 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This verse speaks of the disciples being filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This Spirit who fills us is for life and living, since He is mentioned together with joy in the daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. The Function of the Inward Filling of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1 Being for the spiritual living that the spiritual life may mature The inward filling of the Spirit is for our spiritual living that our spiritual life may mature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may prove this with Acts 13:52, quoted previously, where joy and the Holy Spirit are mentioned together.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>C. The Condition of the Believers after Being Filled Inwardly with the Holy Spirit "Full of" the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After we have been filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit, we are full of the Holy Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the original language, "full of" is pleres, an adjective.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To be filled with the Spirit is a procedure and should take place time after time, whereas to be full of the Spirit is a condition which results from such a procedure and should be constant.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>1 "Select seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom" Acts 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At Pentecost the communal living of the church made it necessary for some to serve tables, and thus seven men full of the Spirit and of wisdom were chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Holy Spirit and wisdom being mentioned here together proves that the Holy Spirit is for life and living.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The service of the tables was cumbersome, which required men with a proper life and a spiritual living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They had to be persons full of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>2 "Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit" Acts 6:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It tells us here that Stephen was a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was not only occasionally filled with the Holy Spirit, but a man always full of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, he had not only an abundant life and wisdom to serve many tables, but also an overcoming life and faith to stand for the Lord unto death Acts 7:59-60 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>3 "But Stephen being full of the Holy Spirit" Acts 7:55 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Stephen maintained his condition of being full of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although his persecutors hated him and gnashed their teeth at him, he was still full of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, he was able to be faithful unto death, suffering martyrdom for the Lord's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>4 "For he Barnabas was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith" Acts 11:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Barnabas was also full of the Holy Spirit, and that was why he could be a good man, full of faith.</S>
