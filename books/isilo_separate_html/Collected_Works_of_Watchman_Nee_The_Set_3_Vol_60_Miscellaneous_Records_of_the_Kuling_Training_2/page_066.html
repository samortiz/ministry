As soon as he asked, the master was moved with compassion. He was merciful to him and forgave his debts. When a master forgives and releases a slave, his intention is not for the slave to earn money to repay him but for him to be free. What God does in man far exceeds man's requests and prayer. The slave only asked for patience, but the Lord was moved with compassion and forgave him all his debts. The Lord acts according to what He has. He answers our prayer according to what He has. The gospel is God granting salvation to man according to His own pleasure; it is God bestowing His abundant mercy and forgiveness upon the sinner. God acts according to His abounding measure, not according to the sinner's need. The robber on the cross prayed to the Lord, "Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom." The Lord immediately replied, "Today you shall be with Me in Paradise" (Luke 23:42-43). Salvation is God saving men according to His own mind and His own riches. As far as propriety was concerned, the prayer of the robber who was crucified with the Lord was inappropriate, but he received God's grace just the same. The Lord does not save sinners according to their thoughts. His measure of forgiveness is according to His own riches, not according to man's need.</p><p>The Bible shows us a tax collector praying to God in the temple. He beat his breast and said, "God, be propitiated to me, the sinner!" (Luke 18:13). The tax collector knew that he was a sinner, and he asked God for mercy. His only plea was for mercy. Mercy, however, is only the starting point of God's work, not its consummation. The Lord likes to be asked to spend Himself. The man only asked for God to be propitiated to him. God heard his prayer, but He did not answer him according to his prayer. Instead, He said, "This man went down to his house justified..." (v. 14). In other words, the man went home justified. God looked at him as if he had not sinned; He considered him righteous. This was far more than what the sinner prayed for.</p><p>There is another example in the Bible&mdash;the story of the prodigal son in Luke 15. When the prodigal son was away in a far country, he prepared to go home and say to his father, "I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants" (vv. 18-19). He merely thought of convincing his father to grant him the grace to return home. He would have been satisfied to be treated as a hired servant. He dared not hope for his father to spend anything on him again. When he reached home, he only was able to say half of what he had prepared. His father fell on his neck, kissed him affectionately, and would not allow him to go on with his speech. He ordered the slaves to bring out the best things for his son (vv. 20-24). We often pray in a poor way, but God's answer is beyond what we ask or think. The gospel is God working to His own satisfaction. Whether or not man prays enough, God sheds His rich grace and mercy, not to the sinner's satisfaction, but to His own satisfaction.</p><p>The fourth example is found in Mark 2. Here we are told that four men carried a paralytic to the Lord Jesus, hoping to find healing. Being unable to bring him to the Lord because of the crowd, they removed the roof where the Lord was and lowered the mat on which the paralytic was lying. The Lord told the man, "Child, your sins are forgiven" (vv. 1-5). The man was seeking for healing, but the Lord did more than heal him. He forgave his sins. The paralytic was healed, and the sin which brought about his sickness was forgiven. God grants us much grace according to His own knowledge. The paralytic did not have enough knowledge of grace, but his very thought of securing some gain from God earned him God's favor. Nothing glorifies God more and nothing pleases Him more than giving Him the opportunity to dispense His grace. Ten thousand talents may be a debt which cannot be repaid in ten generations. God's forgiveness, however, is far greater than this debt.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_065.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_067.html">Next</a> </body></html>
