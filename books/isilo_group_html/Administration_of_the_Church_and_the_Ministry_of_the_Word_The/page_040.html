<h1 class="title">THE MEANING OF BUILDING<br />
BEING IN THE BUILDING<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S AUTHORITY OVER MAN</h1>
<p>Most people think that building enables us to coordinate together so that we are no longer separate individuals but a corporate Body. The real meaning of building, however, is to build Christ into the believers. When Christ has been built into the believers, they become His Body. In Ephesians 4:11-12 Paul says that God gave various gifts to the church for the building up of the Body of Christ, the building up of the church. In 1 Corinthians 3 he refers to the building up of the Body as the building of God&rsquo;s habitation. The Body and the habitation are the same thing. Paul tells us to use gold, silver, and precious stones for the building. If we build with wood, grass, and stubble, our work will be consumed (vv. 12-15).</p>
<p>Verse 12 of chapter 3 shows that the building materials are gold, silver, and precious stones. Gold signifies the divine nature of God the Father; silver signifies the redemption of Christ, the Son; and precious stones signify the transforming work of the Spirit. This shows that the material for the building is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In other words, the building is built with the Father&rsquo;s divine nature, the Son&rsquo;s redemption, and the Spirit&rsquo;s transforming work. This verse, however, does not say what we are building. For example, brick, stone, or wood refer to the materials for building, but a home, a classroom, or an auditorium refers to the actual building.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, there are two aspects to God&rsquo;s building in the universe: one is a dwelling place, and the other is a city. Everything concerning the building is related either to the dwelling place or to the city. Whether God or man is building, there are only two aspects to the building&mdash;the dwelling place and the city. <em>Dwelling place, temple,</em> and <em>palace</em> refer to the same thing. A temple is a dwelling place, and a palace is a dwelling place. With the exception of the tower of Babel, every building spoken of in the Bible is either a dwelling place or a city. Today God is building a dwelling place. The church is God&rsquo;s dwelling place, God&rsquo;s house. When this building is accomplished, it will be a city&mdash;the New Jerusalem. According to Ephesians 2:22, God is building a dwelling place; according to Hebrews 11:10, God is building a city with foundations.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING OF GOD&rsquo;S TEMPLE</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament the holy temple typifies God&rsquo;s dwelling place, and the holy city typifies the New Jerusalem. When the children of Israel entered into Canaan, from their point of view they obtained the blessing of a land flowing with milk and honey. From God&rsquo;s point of view, however, they were building a temple and a city for God (1 Kings 8:12-21). The Israelites took the holy temple and the holy city, Jerusalem, as their center. When the children of Israel arrived in Canaan, their work was to build the temple and the city. All of God&rsquo;s dealings with His people in the Old Testament were related to the temple and the city. Hence, the psalmists often spoke of the holy temple and the holy city. This is the central matter between God and His people.</p>
<p>Satan, God&rsquo;s enemy, did everything he could to damage the relationship between God and His people. Satan did this by destroying the holy temple and the holy city. After the destruction of the temple and the holy city, there was a recovery among the people of Israel. The building needed to be recovered. The holy temple and the holy city needed to be built. This shows that the building up of the Body of Christ is the building up of God&rsquo;s temple on the one hand and the building up of God&rsquo;s city on the other. On one hand, the Body of Christ is God&rsquo;s house, God&rsquo;s dwelling place, and God&rsquo;s temple; on the other hand, the Body of Christ is the church and the bride of Christ. In Revelation 21 we see a city&mdash;the New Jerusalem. This holy city is the bride. Therefore, the church is a matter of the temple and the city. To build up the church is to build up God&rsquo;s temple and God&rsquo;s city.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Administration of the Church and the Ministry of the Word &nbsp; pg 40</div><br></body></html>
