   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We need to understand the proper meaning of apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Apostasy means to be distracted from the right track in following God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Apostasy is worshipping God in a devilish way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever someone uses the worship of God as a cloak to take a devilish way, he has fallen into apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Roman Catholic Church is a total apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No wonder it is called the apostate church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Roman Catholic Church worships God, but it worships Him in a devilish way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although those in Catholicism worship God in name, they are actually worshipping idols.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Roman Catholic Church does exactly the same thing Jeroboam did when he set up the idols and said, "Behold thy gods, O Israel."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jeroboam seemed to be saying, "This is the God you must worship."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In reality that was not God; it was a golden calf.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, apostasy is worshipping God in a way that is false and devilish.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today's Christianity is filled with apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Apostasy is universal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many who claim to be worshipping God are in fact worshipping idols.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you visit a Catholic cathedral, you will see people worshipping the idols that are along the walls and burning candles to the so-called saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In name they worship God and Jesus; in actuality, they worship idols.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to G. H. Pember, one of the idols in the Roman Catholic Church is Buddha, who was assimilated into Catholicism under the name of St. Josaphat.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What apostasy!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The words "for themselves" in Judges 18:30 are very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many who claim to be worshipping God are really doing something for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Apostasy is doing something for the self under the cloak of worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Jeroboam had no heart for God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, his heart was for his own little empire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In his heart he feared that the kingdom would return to the house of David 1 Kings 12:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Using the name of God as a cloak, he did everything possible to preserve his empire.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The whole of Christendom today is an apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>So many are doing things for themselves under the name of Jesus Christ and under the cloak of the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the reason the Lord needs a recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord's recovery will always offend others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As long as the recovery is here, the divisive groups will stand condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As long as the temple was in Jerusalem, the golden calf was under condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Was it possible for Dan to love Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No, there could be no reconciliation between Dan and Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Often others have come to me and said, "Brother Lee, please don't be so bold.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why not be a little nice?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I replied, "To whom should I be nice?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To the serpent?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To the horned snake?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To the graven image?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To the golden calf?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I hate the golden calf, and I would like to burn the graven image and crush the head of the horned snake."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How can we be kind to today's apostasy?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There can be no compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not try to compromise with the serpent, the horned snake.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you are kind to the snake, you will be poisoned by it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you try to be nice to today's apostasy, you will be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The testimony is the testimony, and apostasy is apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Jerusalem there was God's temple as His testimony, but in Dan there was apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Both in church history and in our own Christian experience we have seen this very thing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There may have been times when we were distracted from the right way in following God and fell into a type of apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We might have said that we were working for the Lord when we were actually working for something else.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Dan did not care for the other tribes; he cared only for his own tribe.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After he won the victory and gained the expansion, the enlargement, he did something for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This was the source of his apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to the Old Testament, the Lord never forgot Dan's apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the eyes of God it was the worst sin in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Nothing is more damaging than divisiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Nothing is more destructive than division among God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Divisive worship centers are often related to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Because the Devil lurks behind idols, by setting up an idol Dan became a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whenever you become divisive, no matter how good your reason may be, there will be something behind you the serpent, the subtle one.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The whole history of the church testifies of this and our experience confirms it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whenever you do not care for others, but only for your interests, doing something merely for yourself, the serpent is at hand.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The best way to be safeguarded from falling into apostasy is taking care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Suppose Dan had contacted the other tribes and said, "Brothers, do you agree that I set up another worship center in the city of Dan?"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Had he done this, the others would have said, "Brother, don't do this.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Deuteronomy 12, 14, 15, and 16 forbid us to have any other center of worship that we may come to the unique center."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If Dan had consulted the other tribes, he would have been kept from apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But being individualistic, he set up another worship center and fell into apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Dan fell into apostasy because he cared only for his own interests.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In principle, every divisive center of worship is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Those who establish them care only for their interests, their desires, and they neglect all the other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>They are like Dan, who cared only for his tribe, not for the others.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Dan not only set up a divisive center, but also ordained the hired "priests" Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>18:30; 1 Kings 12:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>To hire the common people to be priests was profane because it destroyed God's holy ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the downfall of the church, many unsaved ones have been hired to do the service of God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In God's New Testament economy, all true believers are made priests of God 1 Pet 2:9; Rev 1:6; 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But degraded Christianity has built up a system to ordain some of the believers to do the service of God, making them a clerical hierarchy and leaving the rest of the believers as laymen.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This also is a form of apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>To have the clergy and the laity is an apostate practice which we must abhor and abandon.</S>
