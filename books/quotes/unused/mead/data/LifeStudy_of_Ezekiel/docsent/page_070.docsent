   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Breaking All Their Yokes</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Ezekiel 34:27 the Lord promised to break all the yokes, including the yokes of sin and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>With Him as our Shepherd, we have no yokes and no bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jesus breaks every fetter!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the local churches we have no yokes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead, we have full liberty and full release.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Delivering Them from Slavery</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 27 also indicates that the Lord delivers us from all kinds of slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the church we do not have the sense that we are under slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, we have the sense of liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The more we enjoy the Lord s shepherding, the more we are liberated from every kind of slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Never Being a Prey to the Enemy</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 28a says, They shall no more be a prey to the heathen.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here the Lord promised that those in His recovery would never be a prey to the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that they would never be defeated or captured by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the church life we share the spoil of the Lord s recovery, of the Lord s victory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead of struggling to gain the victory, we are simply enjoying the victory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Dwelling in Peace and Safety</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually the Lord promised that all those in His recovery would dwell in peace and safety.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 25b says, They shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods ; verse 27b says, They shall be safe in their land ; and verse 28b says, They shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that we will dwell safely and restfully in Christ, without any fear.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Christ we have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 15 we have the phrase lie down , and in verse 25, the word sleep .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Under the Lord s shepherding, it is safe to sleep even in the woods.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Lord s recovery, there is no need for us to be afraid of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you go to a local church where you have to be careful because the situation is touchy and you are afraid, that must not be a proper local church in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the proper church life in the Lord s recovery, there is nothing for you to be afraid of.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In such a church we have the sense of safety.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In every aspect of the church life, we should feel safe.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There should never be a situation in the church life that causes you to be fearful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For instance, you should never be afraid to talk to an elder or to an older sister.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some have asked me why I can be so frank in speaking for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I can be frank because in the Lord s recovery we have peace and safety; therefore, I am not afraid of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Making Them a Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ezekiel 34:26 says, I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here the Lord promised not only that His people would receive His blessing but also that He would make them a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If there is the peace which is the peace of the covenant, the Lord s blessing will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First, we ourselves will enjoy the Lord s blessing, and then He will cause us to become a source of blessing to others so that they may be supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to comment briefly on five aspects of this blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Shower Coming in Season</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God will cause the shower of blessing to come down in its season.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that its coming will be timely.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There will be timely rain.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we are abiding in Christ, the rain, the Holy Spirit, will often come upon us.</S>
