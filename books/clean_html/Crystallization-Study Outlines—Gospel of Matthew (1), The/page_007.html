<h1 class="title">The Highest Standard of Morality</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 5:16-48</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The expression of the kingdom is with the human virtues in the highest standard of morality&mdash;the standard of life that God requires&mdash;Matt. 5:16, 48:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In particular, the expression of the kingdom is with the virtues of meekness, righteousness, mercy, purity, and peacefulness&mdash;vv. 5-10, 20.</li>
	<li>The highest standard of morality is the living of One&mdash; the Lord Jesus Christ&mdash;whose life is a composition of the divine essence with all the divine attributes and the human essence with all the human virtues&mdash;1:18, 20; Luke 1:35:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The makeup of Christ&rsquo;s being, His constitution, is a composition of the divine nature with the divine attributes and the human nature with the human virtues.</li>
		<li>In Christ the divine attributes fill, strengthen, and sanctify the human virtues for the purpose of expressing God in the human virtues.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s human living was the living of a man who lived God to express the divine attributes in the human virtues.</li>
		<li>Christ is now seeking to live in us the kind of life He lived on earth&mdash;a life that is a composition of the divine attributes and the human virtues&mdash;John 14:19b; Gal. 2:20; 4:19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s intention in His New Testament economy is that all the believers become a reproduction of Christ, living a life in which the attributes of God are expressed in the virtues of man&mdash;Phil. 1:19-21a.</li>
	<li>Eventually, through our growth in life we will be the same as God is in life and nature and live a life with the highest standard of morality for the expression of the kingdom in the divine attributes and human virtues&mdash;Matt. 5:48.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>If we intend to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, we need to practice the highest standard of morality as revealed by the Lord Jesus in 5:17-48:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The highest standard of morality involves keeping the principles of the law&mdash;vv. 17-20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s fulfilling the requirement of the law through His substitutionary death on the cross brought in the resurrection life to complement the law&mdash;vv. 22, 28, 32, 34, 39, 44.</li>
		<li>As children of the Father, we now need to fulfill the new, higher law by the resurrection life, which is the eternal life of the Father&mdash;vv. 9, 45:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This highest life, the life on the highest plane, within us can fulfill the requirements of the highest law.</li>
			<li>In this way we keep the principles of the law to have the highest standard of morality for the expression of the kingdom&mdash;v. 16; 13:43a.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In order to have the highest standard of morality, we need to overcome our anger and lust&mdash;5:21-32:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The new law of the kingdom deals with anger, the motive of murder&mdash;vv. 21-22:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We all are subject to dispositional anger, the anger hidden in our disposition&mdash;Jonah 4:1, 4, 9.</li>
			<li>The root of anger is the self; in order to deal with anger, we must deal with the self&mdash;Matt. 16:24.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The new law of the kingdom recovers marriage back to what God designed in the beginning&mdash; 5:27-32; 19:4-6.</li>
		<li>Because of the anger and lust within us, we need to remain in constant fellowship with the Lord, receiving the divine dispensing and experiencing and enjoying the divine life&mdash;1 John 1:3; Rom. 8:2, 6, 10-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The requirements of the highest standard of morality can be met only by the Father&rsquo;s life, not by our natural life&mdash;Matt. 5:48:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The kingdom of the heavens is the highest demand, and the life of the Father is the highest supply to meet this demand.</li>
		<li>As children of God, we have a heavenly requirement within us demanding that we live on a high level; this level can be reached only by the supply of the divine life&mdash;vv. 9, 45.</li>
		<li>The requirements of verses 17-48 reveal how much the Father&rsquo;s life can do for us, the Father&rsquo;s children, having the Father&rsquo;s life and nature&mdash;1 John 3:1:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>These requirements are actually an expression of the divine life, which is within the regenerated kingdom people&mdash;John 3:3, 5-6, 15-16.</li>
			<li>These requirements open up the inner being of the regenerated kingdom people, showing them that they are able to attain to such a high level and to have such a high living&mdash;Phil. 2:15-16a.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>For the believers to be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect is to be perfect in His love&mdash;Matt. 5:48; 1 John 4:8, 16; Rom. 13:10; Gal. 5:14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We must become perfect as our Father is perfect by loving the evil ones and the good ones without discrimination, loving our enemies and praying for our persecutors&mdash;Matt. 5:43-47.</li>
	<li>We have been born of God to be God&rsquo;s species, God&rsquo;s kind, and God is love&mdash;John 1:12-13; 1 John 4:8, 16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As children of God, we should be the same as God in our love for others&mdash;1 John 3:1; Matt. 5:44-45.</li>
		<li>As God&rsquo;s species, we should not only love others; we should <em>be</em> love because God is love&mdash;1 John 4:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Only one kind of love is genuine, and that is the love which comes out of God&rsquo;s dispensing&mdash;Rom. 8:39, 35; 15:30; 5:5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When love as the nature of God&rsquo;s essence is dispensed into us, we become love in the sense of being constituted with God, who is love&mdash;1 John 4:16.</li>
		<li>The more we receive the divine dispensing, the more we react to others in genuine love, which is God Himself&mdash;Luke 6:27-35.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Love is the most excellent way for us to be anything and to do anything for the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 12:31b&mdash;13:13; 8:1b; Eph. 4:16.</li>
	</ol></li>
