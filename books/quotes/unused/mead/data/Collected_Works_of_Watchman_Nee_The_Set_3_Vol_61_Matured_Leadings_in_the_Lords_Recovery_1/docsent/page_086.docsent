   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WELSH REVIVAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Welsh revival was brought in through Evan Roberts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was not educated at all; in fact, he was only a coal miner.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Yet he brought in the greatest revival in the world the Welsh revival.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Wales was a big place, but Roberts worked mainly in one small chapel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He did not have complete sermons ready for delivery.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His speaking was only a few sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sometimes he would pray a little, but the congregation would always leave weeping or leave dancing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Their meetings did not have a set time for opening and closing and were not held in fixed places.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They met at any place and at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>People could come in the middle of the night or in the early morning.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Almost every family was revived, and prayer meetings were conducted in every household.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No one knew who the preachers were.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometimes one person would stand up and call a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At other times someone would stand up and read a verse.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Mrs. Penn-Lewis came from a Quaker background.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She was a very strict person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Out of curiosity she joined these meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The scene she saw was a mess: Some mothers were nursing their babies; others were taking their meals.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some were praying, while others were singing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Outwardly, there was mayhem; the whole place looked like a market.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, she testified that there was something inexplicable and mysterious in the atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was very unusual.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Outwardly the scene was very noisy, but inwardly these people were all one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This happened in 1903 and 1904.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By 1909 some brothers visited them from England and were told by one of the local pastors, "We have fewer and fewer converts every year.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>During the last one or two years we have hardly converted anyone."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The visitors asked if this meant that the revival had taken a step back.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The pastor answered, "No, all the people here are converted already."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Roberts was able to bring in such a great revival because he was a fully consecrated person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was willing to give up everything and spare nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today while we were singing this hymn, we touched the spirit of the author.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is a spirit unmatched in power in all the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word presence is parousia in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It refers to the Lord's descending, His manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although the Lord has not physically come again, we can bring His presence to our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This presence will bind us and restrict us; we will not dare be slothful.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>May all our walk and work be constrained and bound by His presence, and may we not deviate from this pathway in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE APPOINTMENT OF DEACONS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>AND RESPONSIBLE ONES</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Presently, we have appointed eleven deacons and twenty-two responsible ones.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We hope that these brothers and sisters will take up more responsibility in the five districts.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>From now on, our work has to pay special attention to the care and perfecting of the young brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In addition to these five districts, we have asked a few saints to open up their homes and make them a kind of fellowship station.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have also asked a few sisters to care for these homes like governesses or nursing mothers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They should spend time to talk to the young brothers and sisters, read the Bible together with them, or cook for them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE NEED FOR TRAINING</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Presently, there is an immediate need for saints to migrate to all parts of China, but the condition of the saints here is far from ready.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If they move now, they will just create problems for the churches in other localities.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, we need to actively conduct more trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not underestimate the matter of migration.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is more serious than fighting a war, and the training that is required for such a move is more severe.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The first crucial thing to learn in this training is coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The next most important thing to learn is to be bold.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The trainees have to learn to preach in the open air.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They also have to learn to speak to unbelievers, to care for new believers, and to study the Bible.</S>
