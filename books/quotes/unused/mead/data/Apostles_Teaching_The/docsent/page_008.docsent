   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>To Be the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Having Christ as the Head</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All the believers were baptized into one Body in order that they might be the Body of Christ having Christ as the Head Eph 1:23; 5:23b .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Body is the fullness of Christ, the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we care only for the Head and not for the Body, there will be no fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The phrase the fullness of the One who fills all in all indicates that Christ is universally great.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His greatness has no limit, because He fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Body of Christ is also the full growth, the rich surplus, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A person may have a normal-sized head and a small body, like that of a dwarf.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such a body does not have the full growth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If there is the full growth of the body, there is also a surplus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, the church as the Body of Christ is Christ s full growth and Christ s rich surplus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Body of Christ is also the extension, the spread, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On one hand, Christ is like a pine tree, shooting toward the sky.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is also the vine John 15: 1a, 5a , spreading to cover the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A number of years ago some brothers in England took me to see a large vine of their queen, and one of them asked me if I was impressed at its size.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My reply to him was that that vine was not nearly the size of the true vine that is spreading all around the globe.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today Christ is extending Himself as the vine, the Body of Christ, the church, all over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Body is also the continuation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ has not been terminated; rather, He is continuing today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Body of Christ is the reproduction, duplication, and multiplication of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every reproduction is a duplication.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As in xeroxing, every duplication becomes the reproduction or multiplication of the original, or master, copy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a picture of the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Body of Christ is also the expression of Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The body of a person is the expression of that person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because of this, it is sometimes possible to recognize a person even though he is turned away so that his face is not visible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Body of Christ expresses the One who is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To Be the Bride of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church is also the bride of Christ Rev 19:7, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The bride is the increase, the enlargement, of Christ John 3:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A man who is single is not complete, because he is only half of a couple.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Marriage makes a man and a woman a couple.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the eyes of God, it is not good for man to live alone Gen 2:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, God built a wife for man so that the couple could be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first part, the man, is the source, and the second part, the woman, is the enlargement of the first part.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The bride of Christ is the counterpart of Christ, typified by Eve as the counterpart of Adam Gen 2:20b-23; Eph 5:31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eve was not created; she was a rib that was taken out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God built the rib into a woman to match the man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The man is the husband, and the woman is the counterpart of that husband.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After Eve was built, she and Adam became one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The same is true of the church in relation to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The bride is the wife of Christ, and this wife will be consummated in the New Jerusalem Eph 5:24-25; Rev 21:2, 9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This wife has not yet been consummated, because today the church does not include Abraham, David, or any of the other Old Testament saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the New Jerusalem, all the saints, including the Old Testament and the New Testament saints, become the consummated wife of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To Be the Universal New Man</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church is also the universal new man Col 3:10; Eph 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Head of this new man is Christ, and the Body of this new man is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The new man is created of the Jews and the Gentiles as one Body through Christ s death Eph 2:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Before Christ s death, there was a definite partition between the Jews and the Gentiles; but Christ died on the cross to take away the partition and put the two together as one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In His death and resurrection, He terminated these two parties in the old creation and germinated them in the new creation, making them not just a body but a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These matters are all quite meaningful, and these matters are the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Colossians 3:11 says, Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All...in all in this verse signifies something different from all in all in Ephesians 1:23.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Ephesians all in all refers to the universe, whereas in Colossians it refers to Christ s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Christ s Body there are many members, and Christ is all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christ is you, and Christ is me.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ is every member in His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christ is also in us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is in you, He is in me, and He is in every member of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The entire new man is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Paul said that for him to live was Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The universal new man is being consummated by being renewed through the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man Eph 4:22-24; Col 3:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The new man has not yet been consummated because something of the old creation still remains in us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, we must be renewed day by day 2 Cor 4:16 by putting off the old man and by putting on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Day by day something of our old man should be put off and something of the new man should be put on.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The new man has not yet been completed; it is still under the process of being renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>One of the most difficult things for us to put off is our racial character.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whether we are Japanese, Korean, Chinese, English, Dutch, or American, we all have our particular racial character.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For example, the Americans are very frank.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We may say that it is possible to see through to the very marrow of their bones.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>On the other hand, it seems as if the Chinese wear many layers of clothing so that nothing shows through.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If day by day we put off the old man and put on the new man, the only character we will possess will be the character of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As we are being renewed day by day, the new man is being consummated.</S>
