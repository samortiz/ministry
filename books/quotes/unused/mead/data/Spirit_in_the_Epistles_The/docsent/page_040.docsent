   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Spirit of Glory</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>4:14</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This verse tells us that the Spirit is of glory, that He is full of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, the phrase the Spirit of glory and of God means that the Spirit of glory is the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When you are persecuted for the Lord, the Spirit of God, who is the Spirit of glory, rests upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is glory?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Glory is God manifested, God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Stephen was martyred, his face was transfigured to resemble the face of an angel; that was the glory of God being manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With the martyrs, usually at the moment they suffered martyrdom, there was a condition showing that God was expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That was the Spirit of glory and of God resting upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I can never forget the time more than thirty years ago when I met a fifty-year old brother who was zealously preaching the gospel for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I asked him how he had been saved, he said that he was from the Shantung Peninsula.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When he was young, he had gone to Talien and stayed in a hotel there.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The owner of the hotel was a zealous Christian who preached the gospel to him and brought him to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The owner himself had a special story about his own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He had owned this hotel for sixteen or seventeen years, and prior to that time he had been in Peking learning the business in a certain shop during the year of the Boxer Rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One day there was rioting in the streets, so all the shops were tightly closed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He watched through a crack in the shutters and saw the Boxers carrying swords and marching by.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In their midst was a donkey pulling a cart in which a young girl was sitting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It turned out that she was a Christian who had been captured by the Boxers, and they were taking her off to execute her.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This girl was singing hymns in the cart.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She was not only joyful but also shining.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This incident gave the man a deep impression.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He said, "I must find out about this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is the religion of Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What kind of medicine did she take to give her such strength?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, he later went to find a believer in Jesus, heard the gospel, and was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>My intention in telling this story is to show you that when a person is martyred, persecuted, or reproached for the Lord, the Spirit of glory rests upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we put together the verses above, we see that the Epistles of 1 and 2 Peter emphasize the Spirit of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These Epistles speak about how, when Christians suffer for the Lord, the Spirit of Christ rests upon them to express and release God from within them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When people suffer for a worldly matter, they are troubled so much that they always have a sad or distressed expression and are unable to get through.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, Christians are not like this because the indwelling Spirit, who is also the Spirit of glory, rests upon them to manifest the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>FIRST JOHN THE ANOINTING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now let us come to 1 John.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Holy Spirit mentioned in 1 John has a special place in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The most important verse is the following:</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>2:27</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The anointing mentioned here refers to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This anointing is constantly moving and working within us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The purpose of this moving is to add the element of God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The element of God is like paint, and the moving of the Holy Spirit within us is like someone painting a piece of furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We understand God's will and God's leading not by an explicit word in letters but through the inward anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, I may be a painter painting a room, and you may ask me what color I am painting it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I do not answer you with words; instead, I simply apply some paint on the walls and you know as soon as you see it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today the inward moving and anointing of the Holy Spirit causes us to have more of the element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When God's element increases, we understand more of what God wants, and we are clearer about God's leading.</S>
