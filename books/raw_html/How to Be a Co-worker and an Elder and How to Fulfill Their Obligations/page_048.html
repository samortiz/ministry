<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Adorning and Consummating the New Jerusalem</H2><P>The New Jerusalem is the third aspect of the divine building. We need to adorn and consummate the New Jerusalem with God the Father as its golden base, God the Son as its pearl gates, and God the Spirit for its wall of precious stones, by drinking the Spirit, the flowing Triune God, as the river of water of life and eating Christ, the overcoming Lion-Lamb, as the tree of life with His rich and fresh supply. We have already covered the building and adornment of the New Jerusalem in many previous messages. Revelation 21:2 says that the New Jerusalem was "prepared as a bride adorned for her husband." To "adorn" oneself is to make oneself pretty. This term cannot be used for males; it can be applied only to females. Only females need adornment.</P><P>The expressions used in the holy Scriptures are very precious. You have read Revelation a number of times, but have you ever noticed the word adorned? I have read the Bible for many years, but it was not until this time when I was writing the message outlines that I found out that the New Jerusalem needs to be not only consummated but also adorned (Rev. 21:19). It is adorned with pure gold, pearls, and precious stones, that is, with the Triune God as the elements.</P><P>In 1 Corinthians 3:9 Paul said, "You are God's cultivated land, God's building." Then in verse 10 he went on to say, "According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon it. But let each man take heed how he builds upon it." What Paul meant was: "I have already laid a foundation; no one else needs to lay another foundation. All you have to do is to build upon that which has been laid. But you have to be careful. If you build upon the foundation with wood, grass, and stubble, you are marring God's building. You need to build with gold, silver, and precious stones." For example, here is a building that is to be built with gold, silver, and precious stones. Yet you hang a few pieces of wood on it and put a pile of grass and some stubble on top. This is not to adorn the building but to mar it. First Corinthians 3:17 warns us not to destroy the temple of God. Destroy in Greek means "ruin, corrupt, defile, mar." To build with the worthless materials of wood, grass, and stubble is to destroy the temple of God. If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him. I have not seen anyone who damaged the Body of Christ have a good result. In these seventy years I have seen clearly that those who have damaged the Body of Christ have all suffered serious consequences and were destroyed by God. This is a serious matter.</P><P>Today we are here not to destroy the Body of Christ; rather, we are adorning it. I dare not bring my flesh with me to build the New Jerusalem; that is to destroy the New Jerusalem. I dare not bring my opinions, my old "I," my preferences, and my views to build the New Jerusalem. I simply want to be in fear and trembling to adorn the divine building with God the Father as the pure gold, God the Son as the pearl, and God the Spirit for the wall of precious stones. All of us must have this kind of attitude in our living.</P>
