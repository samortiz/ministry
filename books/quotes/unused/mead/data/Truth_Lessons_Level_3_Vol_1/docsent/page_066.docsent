   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Amalek was a descendant of Esau Gen 36:12 , Jacob s twin brother.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Esau and Jacob were very close Gen 25:24-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, Amalek signifies that the believers flesh, their old man, is very close to the believers regenerated and spiritual new man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the way of following God, that which most frequently causes disturbance to the believers is their flesh Gal 5:17 .</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The name Amalek means warlike.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The flesh enjoys fighting and never wants to keep the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, the flesh is very destructive.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Romans 7 shows us that Paul was so disturbed that he even cried out, Wretched man that I am!</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It takes the lead over sin, the world, and Satan to fight against us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The flesh, sin, the world, and Satan are all related to one another and are interwoven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the most prominent among them in fighting against us is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When in our Christian experience the flesh is put to death, the world cannot hold us, sin cannot operate in us, and Satan is powerless to work upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The reason the world is prevailing, sin is strong, and Satan is active is that we are still in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, the flesh is the leading enemy in frustrating us from entering into and possessing the all-inclusive Christ as the good land.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nevertheless, God has decided that the flesh must be blotted out.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, today is still the time for us to fight against the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God is so strongly against Amalek because Amalek was against the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Exodus 17:16 says, For there is a hand against the throne of Jah!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since the flesh is a hand against the administration of God, it is in rebellion against the economy of God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whatever God does governmentally, the flesh opposes it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, God will fight against this opposer, this rebel, and blot out its remembrance.</S>
