Thank the Lord that many have awakened to the work of this Society. All the works of this Society are for the improvement of society. They do not preach the redemptive gospel of the Lord Jesus. Many officers among them are famous modernists in this country. I do not understand why Bible-believing orthodox churches would support such works that oppose God and would yield to their soft-spoken control. Sometimes they conduct retreats also. But every time I read the report of their retreats, I could not help but sigh. Why did they have to call it a retreat? Why did they not call it a discussion meeting? They use this term with only one intention: to entice average spiritual Christians and to turn them to become their co-workers. What Christianity lacks today is not organizations that are greater and expanded, or discussions that are more refined and more detailed. We have too many of these things already! May the ever-blessed God lead His children to work in a solid way and let the others organize and discuss as much as they please. Before February the editor of the Morning Light Paper wrote me a letter and told me that the church in Chefoo has never joined the Society. When I heard this, on the one hand, I thanked the Lord, and on the other hand, I congratulated the church in Chefoo. Recently I received a letter from a friend in Nanking saying that the China Inland Missions throughout China are also withdrawing from the Society. I also heard that a certain co-worker said that the China Inland Mission is now withdrawing from the Society. Thank the Lord that He has opened the eyes of His children to see that the believing ones and the unbelieving ones have nothing to do with one another. May the Lord lead His faithful servants to leave this Babylonian organization and to serve Him without the camp.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHINESE CHRISTIAN LITERARY SOCIETY</H2><P>The chief figures of this Society are ______ and ______ plus other famous modernists in China. Strictly speaking, the aim of this Society is to overthrow our faith. The fundamental doctrines that we hold as Christians are completely denied by these people. They really belong to another religion; they do not belong to Christianity. We cannot recognize those who do not believe in the inspiration of the Bible or other fundamental doctrines as Christians. This group is now translating the book The Bible for Today by Dr. ______, a noted modernist. I have read this book, and I know that this translation, like all the other books by the same author and published by the Youth Association, will cause untold damage to the faith of many young people. I exhort God's children not to buy books by this publisher nor any magazine by the modernists in the Youth Association. I would further advise others to beware of publications by these organizations. Apostasy is growing day by day, and we should do our best to fight for God's truth. The Lord Jesus is coming soon!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PROGRESS IN PALESTINE</H2><P>The population in Palestine, according to a recent survey, has reached one hundred fifty thousand. This is the highest number since the Jews were chastised by God. This proves that the return of the unbelieving Jews to their homeland has become a reality. Their return is a preparation for the end of this age.</P><P>Within the national library of the Jewish state, in the newly built Hebrew University in Jerusalem, there is a gradual increase of valuable books. In Cincinnati a Mr. ______ has donated six thousand volumes of his books. Mr. ______ has also donated five hundred volumes. There are also many valuable ancient manuscripts.</P><P>Jewish women occupy an important place in Palestine, in contrast to the ancient Jewish custom. The recent issue of the women's journal in Jerusalem was printed in Hebrew. This paper is called Ha-Isha, which means The Woman. It is a kind of paper to promote women's suffrage.</P><P>There will be great developments in Jewish industries, commerce, and farming. The Jews have gathered large sums of money for the promotion of these projects.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IRON AND CLAY</H2><P>General Pangalos has taken hold of the reins of government in Greece, while Romania and Bulgaria are fast following...France and Germany are rumored to be turning toward nominated government. Even England is inclining toward this age of iron mixed with clay, a difficult match. It is hard to predict the outcome of the present world situation. But when the time comes, He who will come will surely come and will not delay.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 07: The Christian (5) &nbsp; pg 14</div><br></body></html>
