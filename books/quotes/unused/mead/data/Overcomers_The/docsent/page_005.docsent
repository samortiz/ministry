   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The great God, who is very active and living, has an intention to be one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This may seem very simple, but this most simple thing is the most mysterious thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Medical doctors have been studying the human body for many years, but they still cannot fully comprehend all of its mysteries.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible says that God indwells us and we indwell Him 1 John 3:24; 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That means God is in us and we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We and God indwell each other.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Theologians came up with the word coinherence to describe this mutual indwelling.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the other living things are after their kind, but man is after God's kind.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Man bears God's image so that he can be a container to contain God, that is, a vessel to be filled with God.</S>

   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We Christians do not live according to our wisdom or our cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We live God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The unbelievers may think that we are foolish, but actually we are the wisest people.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the other hand, the apostle Paul said that "we are fools because of Christ" 1 Cor 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are foolish in others' eyes because we forsake our human wisdom for the sake of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We are human yet we live God.</S>
