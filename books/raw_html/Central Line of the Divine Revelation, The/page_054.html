<P>The first man, Adam, was not a God-man. But the last Adam was a God-man, a man wrapped up with the element of God. As the last Adam, Christ died and resurrected, and through death and resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). It is significant that Paul inserted the adjective life-giving before the word Spirit. We might also render the adjective life-giving as life-imparting. Christ has become the life-imparting Spirit. Since life is God Himself embodied in Christ, this life-imparting Spirit is also the God-giving, or God-imparting, Spirit, the Spirit who imparts God into us. This is implied not in the seed of the woman but in the seed of Abraham (Gal. 3:14, 16). Jesus Christ, our Redeemer and Savior, has become a Spirit who gives life, a Spirit who imparts God.</P><P>Christ as the life-giving Spirit is also the Spirit of Christ. He is not just the Spirit of God, but the Spirit of Christ. This is the consummated and indwelling Spirit. The word consummated implies a process. Thus, the consummated and indwelling Spirit is the Spirit who has gone through a process to become qualified and able to indwell us. The Spirit of God could not indwell us without being processed. In order to indwell us, the Spirit of God has passed through incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection as the steps of a long process. Now, because of this process, He is qualified and able to dwell within us. This indwelling is a great thing.</P><P>The steps of incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection are a real process. In the process of incarnation God Himself was confined within the womb of Mary for nine months. Then after His birth, He continued the process by passing through human living for thirty-three and a half years. Thus, human living was included in the long process of His incarnation. He then went through death and traveled through death, staying in the realm of death for three days. Then He entered into the process of resurrection. After His glorification in resurrection (Luke 24:26), the process of the Triune God was complete, and on the day of resurrection He came back to His disciples and breathed the Spirit into them (John 20:22). Before Jesus was glorified in resurrection, the Spirit who is the Spirit of Christ and the life-giving Spirit was not yet (John 7:39). After Christ's resurrection, the Spirit, the divine Spirit, was processed and compounded with Christ's humanity, His death, the effectiveness of His death, His resurrection, and the power of His resurrection. The compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25 is a clear type of the unique and all-inclusive Spirit, who is the Spirit. This Spirit is the aggregate of the blessing of the full gospel of God in Christ.</P><P>The eight items of blessing, including the last Adam, the God-man, the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of Christ, the consummated and indwelling Spirit, the divine Spirit, the unique and all-inclusive Spirit, and the Spirit, are all wrapped up with Christ as the seed of Abraham. If you have Christ as the seed of Abraham, you are qualified to be blessed with these eight items. Although Confucius was a great teacher of morality, he was not qualified to receive this eightfold blessing. Only genuine, regenerated, and transformed Christians are qualified to enjoy these blessings. We are qualified with, by, in, and through the life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is the aggregate of the blessing of the full gospel of God in Christ. Christ became the life-giving Spirit so that He could impart Himself as God's embodiment and life into us that we may be regenerated, transformed, and conformed to the glorious image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God.</P>
