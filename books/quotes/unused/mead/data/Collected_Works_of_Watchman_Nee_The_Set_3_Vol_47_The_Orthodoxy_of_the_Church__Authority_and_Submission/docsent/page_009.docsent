   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the New Testament there is a fundamental principle: All of the children of God are priests of God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Exodus 19:5-6 God called unto the people of Israel, saying, "Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.''</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God ordained in the beginning that the whole nation be priests, but the incident of worshipping the golden calf occurred not long after.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Moses broke the tables of law and said, "Who is on the Lord's side? let him come unto me....And slay every man his brother'' 32:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At that time the Levites came to stand on the Lord's side, and as a result, three thousand Israelites were slain on that day v. 28 . Henceforth, only the Levites could be priests; the kingdom of priests became a tribe of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The rest of the people of Israel could not be priests, and they had to depend on the Levites to be the priests on their behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The priestly class in the Old Testament was a mediatorial class.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, in the New Testament, Peter said, "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired for a possession'' 1 Pet 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We, the whole church, are priests; this goes back to the condition in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Revelation 1:5-6 says that as many as are washed in the blood are priests.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The priests are in charge of God's business; every believer is in charge of God's business.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There should not be a mediatorial class in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church has only one High Priest, the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before a change took place in the church, all the believers took care of the Lord's business.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But after the apostles, this condition began to change; men began to lose interest in the matter of serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Roman Catholic Church began in the time of Pergamos , there were few who were saved but many who were baptized; thus, unbelievers filled the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then there appeared a group of "clergy.''</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since there were members who were not spiritual, what could they do?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Asking them to put down the account books and pick up the Bible to preach would not be fitting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>So a group of people was sought out to take special care of spiritual affairs while the rest did secular work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, the "clergy'' was produced contrary to God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God desires that all who do secular work should also take care of spiritual affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Roman Catholic Church, the dispensing of the bread, the laying on of hands, baptizing, etc., are all performed by the Catholic priests; even weddings and funerals must be undertaken by the "clergy.''</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Protestant church there are pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For illness, call the doctor; for lawsuits, call the lawyer; for spiritual affairs, call the pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What about us?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can devote ourselves to secular work without distraction.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But please remember, in Taoism the Taoist priests chant the liturgy for people; in Judaism the priests manage the things of God for men.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, in the church, there should not be any mediatorial class, because we ourselves are all priests.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is for this reason that we have been crying out concerning the "universal priesthood'' for twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Abel could offer a sacrifice; so could Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the beginning the people of Israel could all offer sacrifices; but later, because of the incident of the golden calf, they could not offer sacrifices themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God says that every believer can come directly to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But now there are the mediatorial people in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today there are Nicolaitans in the church; therefore, Christianity has become Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord is pleased with those who reject the mediatorial class.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you have been washed by the blood, you have a direct share in spiritual affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church can only be founded on this ground; otherwise, it is Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, we are not just fighting the matter of sects, but we are fighting for the privilege of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today there are three main categories of churches in the world: one is the world church, that is, the Roman Catholic Church; one is the state church, such as the Anglican Church and the Lutheran Church; and one is the independent church, such as the Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church, etc. In the Roman Catholic Church there is the Catholic priestly system, in the Anglican Church there is the clerical system, and in the independent churches there is the pastoral system.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All we see is a mediatorial class which undertakes spiritual affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the church God wants to establish is one in which He can place the whole gospel without the mediatorial class.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If there is anything present that does not conform to the whole gospel, then that is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches'' Rev 2:7a .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord speaks in this same way to all the seven churches, showing that not only the church at Ephesus should hear, but all the churches must hear.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God'' v. 7b . God's original intention for man was that he eat of the fruit of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now God says that we can come directly to Him and do according to His original intention.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The question is not what the tree of life is; rather, the question is whether we are willing to follow God's initial intention to eat of the fruit of the tree of life in the garden of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only the overcomers can eat.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whoever returns to the original intention and demand of God is an overcomer.</S>
