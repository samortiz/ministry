   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"JESUS CHRIST, AND THIS ONE CRUCIFIED"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1 Corinthians 2:2 Paul said, "For I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What Paul knew was of two aspects: one was Jesus Christ, and the other was Jesus Christ crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To Paul, if there had been only Christ and no cross, he would have had nothing to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The degree to which the cross breaks us determines the extent to which Christ is released through us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The degree to which the cross works in us determines the extent to which Christ is expressed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our very being is an enemy of Christ and a hindrance to God, and it needs to be dealt with by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have truly been saved, but Christ has no way to come out from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ cannot be released from within us because we have become a hindrance to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The problem today is not with others but with you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>May God have mercy on us to show us this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This vision has two aspects, two emphases: one is Christ's being in us, and the other is the breaking of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We often think that sins and the world are the most difficult things for Christians to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, we assume that as long as we have thoroughly dealt with sins and are absolutely delivered from the world, then we are good Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must see, however, that although some people have already dealt with sins thoroughly and have been delivered from the world absolutely, there is still a problem in them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This problem is that they have not yet been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, a bottle may contain some water, yet the water cannot flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may say that the water is stopped because the bottle is too dirty, but after you wash the bottle, the water still cannot flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Or you may say that it is because of the decorative patterns on the bottle, but even after you remove the patterns, the water still cannot flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, if you break the bottle, the water will flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same way, even though you may have gotten rid of the filthiness and the worldly flavor in you, life still cannot flow out through you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The problem lies in the fact that you have not been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, we need to ask God to have mercy on us to show us that the cross must do a breaking work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we were first saved, we thought that if we could deal with our sins and the world and do good deeds, we would be good Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, this is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's goal is that we would be broken in order that Christ may come out through us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why Paul said that he did not determine to know anything except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The cross is seeking an outlet in us for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many Christians have truly been saved and are zealous for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They have been delivered not only from sins but also from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yet they do not make any progress in their spiritual condition, and the Lord still does not have a way out through them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, it is not our zeal, our dealing with sins, or our getting rid of the world that gives the Lord a way out.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, the greatest frustration that Christ encounters in us is our self.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even though we may preach the gospel successfully and bring thousands upon thousands of people to be saved, Christ still may not have a way out through us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ will have a way out only when our being, our self, has passed through the breaking and the dealing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only through this kind of breaking will Christ have a way out of us.</S>
