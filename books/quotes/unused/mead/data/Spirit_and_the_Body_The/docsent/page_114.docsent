   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BEAUTY OF THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This does not mean, however, that any should be dissenting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although you may fight with someone, you should still love him because you are both in the same church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We love one another because we are in the same recovery, in the same testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Quite often I have surprised the elders in certain churches by telling them that there is no need for them to condemn certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do not try to unify the church and make everyone the same.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The old people are the old people, the young people are the young people, and the naughty ones are the naughty ones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No matter how hard you try, you can never make the girls into boys or the boys, girls.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All boys will be naughty and all girls under the age of ten will be nice.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The nicest children are girls under ten, and the naughtiest are boys under ten.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But both the nice girls and the naughty boys are lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the beauty of a family.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the church life we must recognize the fact that we have the nice sisters and the naughty brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the beauty of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As long as we maintain our oneness, we shall be harmonious and see the beauty, even when we are fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although we are fighting, we are still harmonious.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This may sound like a strange word, but it nonetheless is true.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is fighting, but no dissenting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are for the one recovery, for the one testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No matter how much we fight, our fighting is for the good of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>DEALING WITH OPPOSERS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I would also like to say a word regarding dealing with those who oppose us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not consider any opposer a hopeless case.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, we should treat opposition as a golden opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every opposer is a good "fish."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because of this, we need to change our concept concerning the opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Dealing with the opposers will expose our motive.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If our intention is simply to convince people and to gain them for our work, our motive is not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our motive must be solely for the living testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whether or not a particular opposer will take this way does not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our responsibility is to seize the opportunity to make the Lord's testimony clear to him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we contact an opposer, we may have deep within us the intention to capture him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to forget about such an intention.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should be motivated, not by the desire for the increase of the local churches, but by the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are not here for the increase of the local churches; we are for the bright, shining, strong, and aggressive testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not care whether or not people come this way, agree with us, or follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We care only for the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We would never hide or conceal this testimony, but we would take every opportunity to manifest it to others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Often I hear the saints saying that certain ones are good material and that we should seek to gain them for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This exposes our motive.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are not here for this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To repeat, we are here to be a bright and shining testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must be able to shine and to present what we are enjoying to others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whether or not they accept it is up to the Lord.</S>
