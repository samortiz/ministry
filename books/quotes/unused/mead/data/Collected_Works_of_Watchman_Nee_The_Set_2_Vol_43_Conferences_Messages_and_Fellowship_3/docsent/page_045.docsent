   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BLOOD DEALING WITH SINS BEFORE GOD,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE FLESH DISPENSING LIFE INTO US</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that there are four aspects to the death and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, there is the blood; second, there is the crucifixion; third, there is the flesh; and fourth, there is the bearing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Two days ago we saw the difference between crucifixion and the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today we will consider the difference between the flesh and the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You may recall that in Exodus 12, God ordered the Israelites to kill the lamb and to put the blood on the doorpost and the side posts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When He came to the house and saw the blood, He passed over that house, and those in the house were spared.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, the blood is absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Immediately after the Passover, the Israelites went into the wilderness with their staff in their hand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once the blood of redemption is applied, one should begin his journey onward.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once a person is saved, he should leave the world behind and run the race of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As soon as the blood is applied, he should set out on his journey.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But how can we have the strength for our journey?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How can we escape Egypt?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here we see God's second provision.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The blood removes man's sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God demands the blood because He condemns sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The blood is absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After the lamb is slain, however, there is not only blood but also flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God said that the flesh had to be cooked and eaten before the Israelites would have the strength to go into Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The blood is for God, while the flesh is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The blood is presented to God, while the flesh is cooked for us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The blood satisfies God's righteous requirement, while the flesh becomes our strength for our walk and inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Suppose you took some meat last night.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today the meat has become your life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The meat of yesterday has become you today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The flesh becomes our strength, our energy, and our life; we live by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The blood is objective, while the flesh is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The blood is for God objectively.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through the blood God has forgiven our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The flesh is for us to take subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through the flesh we have the strength for our journey onward.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The problem in the church today is that believers have only received forgiveness through the blood; they have not received the strength of the flesh to take them on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God has given us not only a redeeming Christ, but also an indwelling Christ to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is signified by the flesh in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The blood is on the doorpost and the side posts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eating the flesh is receiving Christ into us and having Him live for us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many people have already experienced the forgiveness of their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But they continue to be weak and defeated; they are not yet on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The blood has been applied, but the flesh has not been eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why there is weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, a man must not only receive forgiveness through trusting in the blood of Christ, but he must also eat His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the eyes of God, those who do not eat His flesh cannot satisfy God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God's life is not a weak life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Two years ago I asked a group of Christians in Kaifeng what kind of life is described in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One sister argued that no one could be free from the love of money, anxiety, temper, or criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She said that no one in the world could do this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That is right.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No one in this world can do this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But God has not asked us to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God's intention is not for us to live a man's life; He wants us to live God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God has no intention to ask us to do what we cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A man can only live a man's life and can only do what a man can do.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, God has given us His own life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have God's life within, and this life can perform what we otherwise cannot perform.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We can only ask whether or not we are allowing this life to live within us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many people have great assurance about their salvation, but in their experience they are very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They have trusted in the blood of Christ, but they have not eaten His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They are as weak in this world as any worldly one.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is not God's purpose; He intends for man to have His holy, victorious, and sanctified life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God does not want us merely to be humans; He wants to put His life within us and accomplish everything that we cannot accomplish by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In other words, He wants us to accomplish God's work and live God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The whole matter rests in whether or not we have eaten the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>AT THE TABLE, FIRST THE BREAD, THEN THE WINE</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Why does the Bible call the Lord's supper the breaking of the bread and not the drinking of the cup?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In calling it the breaking of the bread, the act of drinking is included.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The bread symbolizes the life of Christ, while the cup symbolizes the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The cup removes our sin before God; it takes care of Adam's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The bread signifies the Lord's life, that is, the life of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The fruit of the tree of life in Genesis 2 is God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The bread is God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God intends for the bread to become man's life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>His goal is the bread, not the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Although God needs the cup, the goal is not the cup; it is merely a remedial step.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The bread brings us God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is why the supper is called the breaking of the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The cup signifies redemption, while the bread signifies the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The cup signifies the first aspect of Christ's death, while the flesh signifies the second aspect of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We covered the second aspect of Christ's death yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This death releases God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Bible calls this release the breaking of the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We are sinners, and the blood of the Lord washes us of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Why do we not drink the cup first at the Lord's supper?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When we were saved, the first thing we did was drink the blood, but the Bible tells us that we should first eat the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This shows us that God's goal is for man to take in the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The blood is secondary and remedial.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is why the breaking of the bread comes first.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It represents an aspect of Christ's death which is much higher than that represented by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I hope that we can see God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I feel that the greatest problem among God's children is that they pay too much attention to redemption and not enough attention to God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Redemption merely deals with the sin problem; it is not God's original goal.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Before God created man, He already had a plan and purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>God did not create man and then leave him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>After He created man, He wanted him to receive His life.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This is why God puts the bread before the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is the teaching of the Bible, and we should obey it.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Today many church leaders do not understand redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>But taking care of redemption alone is not sufficient, because redemption is not God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>As important as it is, the forgiveness of sins can never match the experience of receiving Christ's life into us as our life.</S>
