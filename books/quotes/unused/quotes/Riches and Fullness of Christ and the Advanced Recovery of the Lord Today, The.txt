For this reason, when we love the Lord and pursue after Him, we have to remember to drop our self and give up our self
No matter how peculiar, quick-tempered, or proud we are, we have to forget about these things to touch the Lord
When we contact the Lord with our spirit, we should not ask the Lord to do so many things for us; rather, we should touch the Lord Himself
Electricity will then be transmitted to us, and every electric appliance will be able to operate and to function
As long as we are willing to drop our self and to admit our uselessness, the riches of Christ will become our experience

Whenever we exercise our spirit and use our spirit, we can contact the Spirit, and we can experience the God of grace

The American food in the supermarket becomes the constitution of the Americans within a week after they eat it

If here is a big American who measures seven feet, one inch, and who weighs three hundred fifty pounds, his body will express his fullness

Proverbs says, 'But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day''
In addition, we should have spiritual discernment; we should not live in darkness and should not be blind or follow others indiscriminately
