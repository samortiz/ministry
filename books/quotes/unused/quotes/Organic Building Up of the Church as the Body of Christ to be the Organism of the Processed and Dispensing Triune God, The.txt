How much we need Your blood and Your anointing, the rich anointing with all the unsearchable riches of the Triune God
The intrinsic essence, the intrinsic growth, the intrinsic building up, and the intrinsic fellowship are all very positive
Of being one with one another to fight against God's enemy, many Christians are divided and even fighting one another
The essence of the church is the divine life, and the divine life is Christ as the very embodiment of the processed Triune God
God was just God in eternity past but one day the entire God the complete God in the second person of His divine Trinity became incarnated
That man, by the name of Jesus of Nazareth, was a real, perfect, and genuine man, yet His very intrinsic essence was God
He bore the cross, and He went to the cross to die an all-inclusive death to solve all of our problems and all of God's problems
It does not matter whether we are American, European, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, white, black, yellow, brown, or red
The intrinsic essence of the church is the divine life that the processed Triune God has dispensed and is now dispensing into us
Later in the same chapter, John the Baptist referred to the regenerated ones in totality as the one bride of Christ
Eventually, John the Baptist was reduced to nothing, even to the point of his physical death by being beheaded
The church is the bride of Christ, and according to typology, this bride is typified by Eve, who was Adam's counterpart
If the divine life had only remained in His divine being, concealed in His human body, it could have never been our life
The divine life was released by Christ as the one grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying there for His multiplication
The divine life imparted into us in Christ's resurrection is the intrinsic essence of the church, the organic Body of Christ
If we have any problems with one another, it is because we have departed from the intrinsic essence, the processed and dispensing Triune God
The church exists in the universe as the one universal church of God for His universal expression, the fullness of God
Where the Triune God is, this living, organic church is, because this church is now one with the processed and dispensing Triune God
Does the church in Anaheim have a particular, intrinsic essence different from the church in another locality?
All the local churches on the earth today also have only one intrinsic essence, so the church cannot be divided, or split
He placed the prophets, who are not just universal in function because prophets were a part of the church in Antioch
The intrinsic growth of the church is through the feeding on the guileless milk and the solid food of the word by the members of Christ
When we come to the Bible, we must have the full faith that God exists and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him out
The Bible also prophesied in Luke 21:24 that the city of Jerusalem would eventually be returned to the people of Israel
Jerusalem was taken over by the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, about twenty-six centuries ago, in approximately 600 B
The Lord Jesus prophesied in Luke 21:24 that 'Jerusalem will be trampled by the nations until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled'
From the time of Nebuchadnezzar, Jerusalem was trodden under the feet of the Gentiles throughout the centuries
Nineteen years after the nation of Israel had been restored, in 1967, the city of Jerusalem was reclaimed by the Jews
The two legs signify that the Roman Empire was divided into two parts, the eastern Roman Empire and the western Roman Empire
In these days the people of eastern Europe, who are the clay, the dust, are rising up to deal with and weaken the iron of communism
An unbelieving American citizen was visiting a country in Latin America and observed a native of that country sitting and reading a Bible
He was changed to such an extent that he decided to drop his political associations and become a follower of Christ
When we touch this book with a seeking heart for Christ we touch the Spirit we receive the very lifegiving Christ and we grow organically
Southern California began to receive water from the state of Nevada, and the result is that it has become very green and beautiful
For our spiritual growth, we need the food that the Word provides, and we also need the watering that the gifted ones provide
Regardless of how much time you spend reading the Bible in your home, it cannot replace the meetings of the church
You may say that you do not like the meeting, but whether you like the meeting or not, the 'sprinklers' are there 'sprinkling'
Regardless of how much you endeavor to get something in your home away from the meeting, there is no 'sprinkler' watering you in your home
When we go to the meetings of the church, we are always touching His Word, so we are always receiving something of God
When we are in the meetings of the church, we get thoroughly watered because we are under the 'sprinkling,' the watering
We need to come to the meetings of the church and of the ministry to take a 'shower' or a 'bath' in the water of the word
As we are feeding on the Word, and as we are being watered by the gifted ones, God Himself is moving and growing within us
His growing is within us, and how much He grows within us depends upon how much room we will give to Him to grow
The church grows until it reaches maturity, which is the measure of the stature of the Body of Christ for His expression
God brought all the living creatures to Adam and Adam gave names to all of them, but among these Adam did not find his counterpart
When Christ was sleeping on the cross, however, there was the problem of sin, so His death had to deal first with this sin problem
The rib taken out of Adam's side and the water that flowed out of the side of Christ at the cross both signify the divine life
Christ is increasing, and God is increasing in the growth of life within the members of the organic Body of Christ
As the Body of Christ, the church should not be deprived of Christ, who is the embodiment of God as the source of life
The increase of the vine tree is the increase of Christ, and the increase of Christ is the increase of the church
If a local church has only two or three joints of supply, and these joints are only the elders, that is a poor local church
The use of the definite article 'the' indicates that there is a particular supply of Christ that each joint has for the benefit of the Body
The joints do not constitute the whole body, so there is the need for all the parts to match and complement the joints
When the Body of Christ is functioning properly through the active participation of the joints and each one part, 'all the Body
Ephesians 4:8 says, 'Wherefore He says, Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men'
We may appreciate the Lord's coming down from the heavens, but we also need an uplifted appreciation of His ascension
He became a gift who could expound the Old Testament, who could preach the gospel, teach the saints, and prophesy
He wrote this portion in describing Christ's death and resurrection to accomplish His full redemption and impart life to us
His descension was the means to accomplish His allinclusive full redemption which has saved us from sin death Satan and the lake of fire
The Amplified New Testament renders 'He led a train of vanquished foes' for 'He led captive those taken captive'
Through His descension and ascension, Christ rescued us, enlivened us, and made us gifts with His resurrection life
That means he became a big gift to the church in the category of the gifted persons mentioned in Ephesians 4:11
We may speak in this way to our unbelieving contacts: 'I would like to tell you that our Savior descended in two steps
In the second step of His descension, He entered into death and even went into Hades, dying for us to save us from sin, death, and Satan
As sinners, we were captives of Satan, but through the death of Christ we were forgiven and even rescued from Satan
In the second step of His ascension, He led us as a train of vanquished foes to the third heaven to give us as a present to His Father'
During the time of the Roman Empire, when a general gained a victory, all his captives became a procession in the celebration of his victory
The practice of Christianity with one man speaking and the others listening spoils the gifts and kills the functions of the saints
Some Christians in the denominations do not even know how to pray because their function has been annulled by the clergy-laity system
According to the biblical revelation, however, all the believers should be living, functioning members of the Body of Christ
We were captives, sinners, and enemies of God, but through Christ's descension, we were redeemed and rescued from Satan out of sin and death
When we go out as New Testament priests of the gospel to visit people, we should have the assurance that we are going to gain more gifts
The perfecting of the saints by the gifts is unto the work of the ministry-the building up of the organic Body of Christ
The entire teaching of the New Testament is what we believe, so this New Testament teaching is our Christian faith, our Christian belief
If we are still babyish, we may be holding on to different opinions from our background which cause us to lose the oneness of the faith
Some have taken the Lord's promise in Matthew 16-'I will build My church'-to say that it is not we who build the church, but Christ
The babes are carried about by every wind of teaching 'in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error'
Rather than being babes, we must be those holding to truth in love to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things
According to the entire book of Ephesians, the real things in the universe are Christ as the Head and the church as His Body
In order to become a joint, we need to pray more, seek the Lord more, read the Bible more, feed on Christ more, etc
Through these two categories of members, the Body grows, and this growth is unto the building up of itself in love
Through your contact with the Lord, you have become a joint, so you have the riches of Christ with which you can supply the Body
When the entire Body is operating, the Body causes the growth of itself, resulting in it being built up in love
While we are functioning either as supplying joints or as operating parts, the Triune God, who is within us, moves together with us
The Spirit exercises His gifts, the Lord carries out His ministries, and God operates while we are functioning
The intrinsic fellowship of the churches is the flow of the divine life among and through all the members of the organic Body of Christ
John goes on to say that he reported what he had seen and heard, not that we might have 'life' but that we might have 'fellowship'
There are three major points we need to see when we study the significance of fellowship in the first four verses of 1 John 1
Out of this throne proceeds a current, a flow, which is the flow of the water of life, and this flow is a river
Surely, He is on the throne in the heavens, but if the throne were just in the heavens, it would be too far for us to reach
It may help us to understand this fellowship, this flow of the divine life, if we consider the circulation of blood in our human body
All the members have only one head, and according to the blood circulation with the nerves, every member is connected to the head directly
When we called on the name of the Lord, we may say that the Spirit came into us, that God came into us, or that the divine life came into us
The One who is now in us is the divine life, which is the Triune God, who is the Spirit and who is Jesus Christ
The consummation of the Triune God is within us as the divine life, and this divine life is flowing within us all the time
In those early days, all the believers continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles
The apostles did a wonderful work to impart the divine life into people and bring them into the flow of this divine life
Their fellowship was the fellowship of the apostles, and the fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship of the Triune God
When we preach the gospel and the ones to whom we preach receive the Lord Jesus, we are giving them an 'injection' of the water of life
Whenever we meet a genuine believer, no matter what nationality or race he may be, something 'jumps' within us
In some places in the United States, the white people and the black people would not meet together to worship the Lord
Problems among the saints are also due to focusing on something outward rather than on the intrinsic fellowship of life
Christians love one another until they focus on outward things such as what group they meet with or what doctrines they agree on
If we only care for the intrinsic fellowship, the flow of the divine life, which is like the blood circulation in our body, we will be fine
We should live in and care for this intrinsic fellowship, which is of the Triune God, of the apostles, and of all the believers
Corinthians 1314 refers to the fellowship of the Holy Spirit and Philippians 21 mentions fellowship of spirit indicating the human spirit
All the members of the organic Body of Christ have a fellowship which is based on the faith, the unique belief
The elders of each of the local churches should consider what kind of relationship they have with the other churches
Is their relationship limited to the brothers in their locality, or are they in fellowship with all the churches in the Lord's recovery?
If this church does not have the liberty to ask concerning another church's needs, how will it be able to help?
Some brothers overseeing a needy church in a certain locality may be too proud to tell the other churches that they are in need
There is absolutely nothing wrong with this needy church taking the opportunity to fellowship with another local church who has more money
Galatians 6:1 says that if one among us is overtaken by some sin, we should exercise a spirit of meekness to recover him
We cannot tolerate the sin, but we must take care of the sinful matter privately with a view to rescuing the sinning one
The relationship of the churches must be organic according to the divine life and based upon the organic fellowship of the divine life
From this erroneous teaching came the hierarchy of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope in the Catholic Church
The church in one locality should not have the attitude that they have nothing to do with the church in another locality
The organic relationship of the churches is based on the unique and universal fellowship among all the members of the organic Body of Christ
The four previous chapters on the positive intrinsic matters of the church may be considered as fellowship related to the 'day'
Christ shines in the day, but He is reflected in the night by the moon, the church, and He shines in the night through the stars, the saints
To see this intrinsic factor, we need a proper and sharp understanding that can penetrate into the whole situation
The history of Christianity shows us that there can be cheating and deception in a so-called Christian teaching
Paul had done so much for the church in Ephesus, but years later he was still greatly concerned about the church there
God has a great, universal house, and God has His law, His regulation, His administration concerning His house
God in His divine Trinity-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-is for the dispensing of Himself into His believers
In resurrection He also became a life-giving Spirit , imparting Himself into us, His believers, to be our life, making us the sons of God
As we have seen in chapter three, these sons were brought by the Son to the Father, and offered to the Father as a corporate present
It is wonderful that all of us believers are gifts to function in the Body of Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ
When we arrive at this state, the bride will be prepared, and the Bridegroom, Christ, will come to have His wedding
As the gifts who were given by the Son from the Father to the churches, we are working and preparing for this coming wedding
To teach anything other than God's economy is to teach something different from what the New Testament teaches
The teaching of these Judaizers was a wind that would 'blow away' some of the saints from the central lane of Christ and the church
We have pointed out that the teaching concerning the absolute autonomy of a local church has been creeping into the Lord's recovery
The New Testament shows us clearly that in the local church there must be a government with elders appointed by apostles
Not only do the apostles have the duty and authority to appoint elders, they also have the duty and authority to remove them
Paul said to Timothy, 'Against an elder do not receive an accusation, except on the word of two or three witnesses
To indicate this way that Paul should not have said that he was the Corinthians spiritual father is to overthrow the authority of the Bible
With the winds of teaching there is talk about the Bible and about spiritual things, but what is the intrinsic factor of such teaching?
In 1933 a brother among us received a note from Brother Watchman Nee that said, 'Do the right thing in the right way with the right spirit'
The purpose of the winds of teaching is the evil purpose of the enemy Satan, which is versus the eternal economy of God
They do not come to the meetings regularly, and they are not so concerned about the Lord's interest as they once were
