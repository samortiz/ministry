   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BLOOD, THE COVENANT, AND THE CUP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord s blood redeemed us from our fallen condition back to God, back to the inheritance we lost through the fall of Adam, and back to God s full blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning the Lord s table 1 Cor 10:21 , the bread signifies our participation in life, and the cup, our enjoyment of God s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, it is called the cup of blessing 1 Cor 10:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this cup are all the blessings of God and even God Himself as our portion Psa 16:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Adam our portion was the cup of God s wrath Rev 14:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ has drunk that cup for us John 18:11 , and His blood has constituted the cup of salvation for us Psa 116:13 , the cup that runs over Psa 23:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By partaking of this cup we also have the fellowship of the blood of Christ 1 Cor 10:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Mark 14:25 speaks of the fruit of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fruit of the vine within the cup of the Lord s table is also a symbol.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It signifies the Lord s blood shed on the cross for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His blood was required by God s righteousness for the forgiveness of our sins Heb 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Mark 14:24 says that the Lord s blood is the blood of the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord s blood, having satisfied God s righteousness, enacted the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this new covenant, God gives us forgiveness, life, salvation, and all spiritual, heavenly, and divine blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When this new covenant is given to us, it is a cup Luke 22:20 , a portion for us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord shed the blood, God established the covenant, and we enjoy the cup, in which God and all that is of Him are our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The blood is the price Christ paid for us, the covenant is the title deed God made to us, and the cup is the portion we receive from God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Concerning the Lord s table, we have the blood, the covenant, and the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we come to the Lord s supper, we see a cup on the table.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That cup is a covenant and is also related to the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the blood, the covenant, and the cup are one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The blood is the price paid by Christ, the covenant is the title deed of our inheritance, and the cup is the portion we receive and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ paid the price.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God made the covenant, and we enjoy the portion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE DISCIPLES ENJOYING</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE LORD S DEATH AND RESURRECTION,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE LORD HIMSELF, AND HIS MYSTICAL BODY</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By instituting His table the Lord Jesus was indicating to His followers that they would enter into His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord served them not only with His body and blood, but also with His death, resurrection, Himself, and His enlargement, His mystical Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At His table He served His disciples with Himself, with His death and resurrection, and with His mystical Body as His enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that the disciples should enjoy His death, His resurrection, the Lord Himself, and His enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I doubt that the disciples were clear concerning the significance of the Lord s supper when the Lord Jesus instituted it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They heard the words spoken by the Lord, but they probably did not understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to what the Lord Jesus prophesied in the Gospel of John, when the Spirit of reality came, He led them into all reality John 16:13 , including the reality of the supper instituted by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then the disciples certainly recalled the Lord s words.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They may have said, On the night the Lord was arrested, He instituted a table with the bread and the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We did not understand the significance of this at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now we know that the Lord s intention was to bring us into a full realization of His all-inclusive death, His wonderful resurrection, Himself, and His mystical Body as His enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE PRODUCING OF THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord s death, resurrection, the Lord Himself, and His enlargement are for the producing of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This new man is the development of the seed of the kingdom in chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The full development of the new man will be the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Instead of reading the Bible in a superficial way, we need to be enlightened to see this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today the Lord Jesus is still bringing us into the reality of His table.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before He entered into death, He instituted the table with His death, resurrection, Himself, and His enlargement, which are signified by the broken bread and the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The bread signifies His mystical Body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord s blood has become a cup as the portion for us covenanted by God and paid for by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Week after week we review this story at the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we come to the Lord s table, we are not celebrating a religious communion or performing a so-called mass.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the contrary, at His table we have a revelation of the Lord s death, resurrection, the Lord Himself, and His mystical Body as His enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As we participate in His death and resurrection, as we take Him as our all-inclusive replacement, He becomes everything to us for the producing of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Eventually, this new man will become the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When this process has been fulfilled, the Lord Jesus will come back to receive this new man and to have the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>May we all see such a marvelous vision!</S>
