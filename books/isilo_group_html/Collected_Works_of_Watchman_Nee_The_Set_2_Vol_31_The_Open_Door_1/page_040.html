My sister Jing-hsia and I experienced the Lord's grace and leading and arrived safely in K'un-ming on January 12 at six o'clock in the evening. We took hospitality with Brother Huang Tsung and are temporarily staying in his home. The next day we met with Brother K. H. Weigh and Brother Chou Kang-yao and his younger brother. We asked Brother Chou to ask his wife to find my sister a position as a nurse. We heard that X Hospital likes to use Cantonese, so there may not be much hope. Sister Wang Ju-ching was delayed because her train broke down, arriving only one day ahead of us in Yunnan. In addition to waiting for the train in Huang County for five days, my sister and I rested for one day in Kuei-yang. Therefore, it took us fifteen days to travel from Hunan to Yunnan. I arrived in Kuei-yang on the evening of January 7. I joined the prayer the next evening at the China Inland Mission on Chi-Shan Lane in Kuei-yang. There I met a Western missionary, Mr. Chi, and the elder, Mr. Yeh Ts'ai. I also met Ms. Chen, who is a native of Kuei-yang. She attended our meetings in Shanghai in 1931. She hopes that some of the sisters in the Lord could go to work in Kuei-yang. If Sister Lee and the others go to Kuei-yang and want to stay in a hotel, they could stay in the Paris Hotel on Chung-Shan Road. This hotel is one of the cleaner ones in Kweichow. All the prices for the rooms are discounted. I read Sister Lee's letters in Brother Weigh's house and Brother Huang's house today and learned that she wanted to work in Kuei-yang and K'un-ming and that she was asking about the land and sea routes. Brother Weigh and I are answering her questions in separate letters. I am not clear about the condition of the Szechuan-Kweichow Railway, but I heard from fellow travelers that it is peaceful the whole way. The only trouble is that the mountains are steep and the way is winding. It is similar to the road from Kweichow to Yunnan. The cars shake and sway, and travelers often feel sick. I have heard that the southwest highway is more dangerous around Hunan and Kweichow. Bandits have appeared in the Ch'ang-Teh, Yuan Ling, and Huang County regions of western Hunan. The towns of Chen-Yuen and O-Chih-Bang in Kweichow are very dangerous places. I have also heard of buses and cars being held up. According to Mrs. Huang, Sister Wang Ju-ching heard that the bus before hers was held up twice. My sister and I enjoyed the Lord's presence on this trip and were escorted by angels, so we passed through the dangers as if journeying on smooth highways and did not encounter any mishaps. Thank the Lord for His grace, and thank the brothers and sisters for their prayers. I traveled for four days after leaving Kuei-yang. I first went to Yung-Ning and stayed in the Hsinsheng Hostel. It cost fifty cents per person for two meals and one night. The owner is Catholic, and the food was quite good. Next we went to Pan County and stayed in the T'ung-Hsin-Twei Inn on Ta-Fu Street. Although the rooms in this inn were large, the food was coarse. It would be better to stay in the small inn across the street. It costs fifty cents a person for two meals and one night. The third night we were in Chu-Jing. This place was better. It produces leeks and cauliflower and is famous for its noodles. I stayed in the Railroad Inn. It cost sixty cents per person for two meals and one night. I heard that there is much leprosy in Chu-Jing, so it is best not to eat their eggs and chickens. With respect to passport inspections along the way, women are treated better than men. At Ping-Yi they ask very detailed questions, such as one's full name, home, age, occupation, trip origin, trip destination, where one will live in K'un-ming, what one intends to do, etc. When we arrived in Chu-Jing near K'un-ming, we were interrogated again. When we arrived in K'un-ming, we were questioned four or five times. They did not open the large pieces of luggage, but they did look into the small bags. I prayed to the Lord and was exempted from examination. The only time I was questioned was in the city of K'un-ming at the gate of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. When they found out that I was a Christian going to 119 Peng-Shih Street, the officer said that was Hu Yi-min's place. I asked him whether he knew Hu Yi-min, and he said yes. Later, Brother Huang told me that when Brother Hu came, his face and appearance were so different that the people of Yunnan thought he was an X native, and they questioned him many times. After the brothers proved that he was Tibetan, the news was published in the Yunnan newspaper. In this way the whole city of K'un-ming knew him.</p><p>If Sister Lee comes to K'un-ming, she should know that paper money is not standardized here. If she can change her money at the Central Bank of Szechuan for ten, twenty, and fifty-cent legal bills, it would be best to do so. If she cannot, she should try to change it all into the new legal one-dollar bills. They are accepted more readily. It is not easy to use five or ten-dollar bills here. The stores do not change money, so you must change it at the Central Bank, but it is not easy to get money changed at the Central Bank. Each customer can only bring twenty catties [a Chinese measure of weight] of luggage on the buses. The rest can be carried as hand luggage if it is packed into small packages or carried in a small basket. The brothers and sisters here hope that Sister Lee can come to K'un-ming to work. We testified to the Lord's grace in the meeting on Thursday. Sister Wang Ju-ching did the same. We received the Lord's peace and grace, so please do not worry about us. Please send me a copy of the third issue of The Open Door. Peace in the Lord. Please greet Brother Chang Yu-zhi, Miss Wang, Miss Chang, and Mrs. Yuan How-tzai.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Jing-yuan<br />January 17<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 31: The Open Door (1) &nbsp; pg 40</div><br></body></html>
