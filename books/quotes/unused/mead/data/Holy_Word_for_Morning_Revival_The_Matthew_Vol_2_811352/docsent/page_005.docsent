   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 6 DAY 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 8:24-26, 28-29, 31-32; 9:2-3, 6</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>8:24 And behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, so that the boat was covered by the waves; but He was sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>25 And they came near and roused Him, saying, Lord, save us; we are perishing!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>26 And He said to them, Why are you cowardly, you of little faith?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>28 And when He came to the other side, two possessed by demons met Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>29 And behold, they cried out, saying, What do we have to do with You, Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Have You come here before the time to torment us?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>31 And the demons entreated Him, saying, If You cast us out, send us into the herd of hogs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>32 And He said to them, Go!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And they came out and went into the hogs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep slope into the sea, and they died in the waters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>9:2 And behold, they brought to Him a paralytic, lying on a bed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Take courage, child; your sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>3 And behold, some of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>6 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins then He said to the paralytic, Rise, take up your bed and go to your house.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 8:23 9:8 we see the authority of the King.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This authority is of three aspects: the authority over the winds and the sea 8:23-27 ; the authority over the demons 8:28-34 ; and the authority to forgive sins 9:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the Lord and the disciples were sailing across the sea something in the air and under the sea began to cause them difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The King rebuked the winds and the sea because in the winds were the fallen angels of Satan Eph 6:12 and in the sea were the demons Matt 8:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The fallen angels in the air and the demons in the water collaborated to frustrate the King from going to the other side of the sea because they knew He would cast out the demons there vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>28-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Lord Jesus had come to the country of the Gadarenes, He was met by two who were possessed by demons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The demons cried out, saying, "What do we have to do with You, Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Have You come here before the time to torment us?" v. 29 . The King called Himself the Son of Man v. 20 , but the demons called Him the Son of God, tempting Him to deviate from His standing as the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word "Go!" in verse 32 was the King's authoritative order, and the demons obeyed it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The King complied with the demons' entreaty to enter into the hogs because hogs are unclean in the eyes of God Lev 11:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Unable to tolerate being possessed by the demons, the hogs rushed into the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The demons consented because the water is their lodging place Matt 12:43-44 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 9:1-8 we see the King's authority to forgive sins.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here a paralytic was brought to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The mention of sins in verse 2 indicates that the paralytic was sick because of his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"Some of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes" v. 3 . The scribes, confident that they knew the Scriptures, thought that only God had authority to forgive sins and that Jesus, who in their eyes was only a man, had blasphemed God when He said, "Your sins are forgiven." This indicates that they did not realize that the Lord was God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By uttering such a word, they rejected the King of the heavenly kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This was the first rejection by the leaders of the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As God, He not only has authority over the natural environment and over demons; He also has the full authority to forgive people of their sins.</S>
