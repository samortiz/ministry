<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XV. ALL THE LOCAL CHURCHES ON THE ENTIRE GLOBE SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY ONE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. By Being in the Oneness of the Spirit and<br>in the One Accord of Our Spirit, Soul, and Mind</H2><P>All the local churches on the entire globe should be absolutely one by being in the oneness of the Spirit and in the one accord of our spirit, soul, and mind.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In the Realm of Five Crucial Things</H2><P>All the local churches should be absolutely one in the realm of five crucial things: (1) the growth of life for the testimony of Jesus Christ; (2) the preaching of the gospel; (3) the spreading of the Lord's recovery; (4) the building up of the Body of Christ; and (5) the accomplishment of God's eternal economy. We should be one in all these things.</P><P>We do not need to be one in certain things concerning the administration of the church. Whether the church in a certain locality should buy a piece of land in order to build a hall or not is a local affair. But in the growth of life for the testimony of the Lord, in the preaching of the gospel, in the spreading of the Lord's recovery, in the building up of the Body of Christ, and in the accomplishment of God's eternal economy, we have to be one universally.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XVI. THE NEED TO BE BODY-CONSCIOUS IN ONE ACCORD<br>AND BODY-CENTERED IN ONENESS</H2><P>For the Lord's move in His recovery both locally and universally, we all need to be Body-conscious in one accord and Body-centered in oneness. In one accord we should be Body-conscious. In oneness we should be Body-centered. In our consideration the Body should be first and the local churches should be second. The United States becomes the top country on this earth, not because of the autonomy of its states, but because of the unity of all the states. What a shame it is for any local church to declare its autonomy! To teach that the local churches are absolutely autonomous is to divide the Body of Christ. All the local churches are and should be one Body universally, doctrinally, and practically. Otherwise, where is the unique church of God and the unique one new man for the fulfilling of God's economy?!</P>
