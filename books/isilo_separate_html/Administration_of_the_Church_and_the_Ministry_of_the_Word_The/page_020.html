<p>Protestantism has adopted the thought of Catholicism and frequently speaks about going to heaven. Actually, we are in heaven; we have been seated with Christ in the heavenlies since the day we were saved because the day we believed into Christ, we entered into God. There is no scriptural basis for the teachings of Catholicism and Protestantism concerning going to heaven. Even Paul is not in heaven; he is in Paradise. We must understand that it is a matter of person&mdash;God and man. It is not a matter of place&mdash;heaven. God&rsquo;s entering into man is His coming to the earth; man&rsquo;s entering into God is man&rsquo;s going to heaven. For this reason the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Where I am going you know the way&rdquo; (John 14:4). He was actually saying, &ldquo;I am now going to the Father. Just as I entered into man through My incarnation, I am now going to the Father to enter into Him through My death and resurrection.&rdquo; The disciples thought the Lord was referring to a place and replied, &ldquo;We do not know where You are going; how can we know the way?&rdquo; (v. 5). Then the Lord Jesus said to them, &ldquo;I am the way...; no one comes to the Father except through Me&rdquo; (v. 6). The way is the Lord Himself, and the destination is the Father. Hence, it is not a matter of place but of believing into the Lord, believing into God.</p>
<p>Through His death and resurrection the Lord Jesus brought man into God to enter into a union with God. When man enters into God, he enters into the realm of heaven, that is, the realm where God is. From this perspective, it is a matter of place. The beginning of chapter 14 speaks of God and God&rsquo;s house; God can never be separated from His house. One must enter into God in order to enter into God&rsquo;s house. Whoever enters into God has entered into God&rsquo;s house. Therefore, no one can enter into God&rsquo;s house apart from being in God. One must be in God in order to enter into God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>In His incarnation the Lord Jesus came from the Father and entered into man. However, for Him to go back to the Father, He needed to pass through death and resurrection. Through His death and resurrection, the Lord went back to the Father from man. Therefore, the Lord was going to be in the Father. This is where He was going. The Lord&rsquo;s coming was a matter of entering into man, not of coming to earth. His going was a matter of going to the Father, not of going to heaven (v. 28). The Lord entered into man through His incarnation, and He entered into the Father through His death and resurrection. The Gospel of John does say that the Lord Jesus ascended into heaven; it says, &ldquo;No one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven&rdquo; (3:13). However, we should not say that the Lord&rsquo;s going to the Father refers to His going to heaven. The Lord Jesus did not go back to heaven. He was with the disciples, and He dwells in us all the time. Since He wants to dwell with us, how can He leave us? Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s going in chapter 14 does not refer to His going to heaven; it refers to His going to the Father from man. &ldquo;Believe into God, believe also into Me&rdquo; is the subject of this chapter. The Lord Himself is the way for us to believe into God. The Lord entered into the Father through death and resurrection, and we entered into the Father through the Lord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him&rdquo; (v. 7). The Lord wanted the disciples to know that it is not a matter of position or place but of a person, that is, the Father. Philip said, &ldquo;Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us&rdquo; (v. 8). Jesus answered, &ldquo;Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father?&rdquo; (v. 9). These words are very meaningful. These verses do not speak of a place; they speak of a person. They speak of God, not of heaven. It is a matter of entering into God, not of going to heaven. This chapter is not on the rapture or ascension. It is on the Lord Jesus bringing man into God through His death and resurrection. &ldquo;Believe into God, believe also into Me&rdquo; is the subject of this chapter. This matter is altogether concerning a person.</p>
<p>In verse 10 the Lord said, &ldquo;Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works.&rdquo; Whereas verse 2 says, &ldquo;In My Father&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; verse 10 says, &ldquo;The Father who abides in Me.&rdquo; Where does the Father dwell? Where is the Father&rsquo;s house? Logically speaking, the place where we dwell is our house; our house is the place where we dwell. Many Christians think that the Father&rsquo;s house is heaven, but verse 10 says, &ldquo;The Father who abides in Me.&rdquo; This shows that when the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was the Father&rsquo;s house. We cannot say that a person lives in Taipei but that his house is in Taichung. A person lives in his house.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
