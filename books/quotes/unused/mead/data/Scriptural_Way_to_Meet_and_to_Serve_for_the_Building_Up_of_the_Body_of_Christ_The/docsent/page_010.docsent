   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE CHARACTERISTICS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE BELIEVERS MEETINGS Scripture Reading: Matt 18:20; Heb 10:24-25; Eph 5:19; Col 3:16 TO BE GATHERED INTO THE NAME OF THE LORD Gathered by the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will consider the characteristics of the believers meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first characteristic of a Christian meeting is that the believers are gathered into the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Matthew 18:20 says, For where two or three are gathered together into My name, there I am in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word gathered is passive; when we meet, we actually are gathered.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not gather ourselves together; we are gathered by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, the Lord initiates our gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Day by day, the Lord gathers us into His name which denotes His Person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever we come together, we have to be gathered by the Lord into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we come to the meeting outside of Him, we come dead, empty, and without anything to minister to others as a praise to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Gathered out of All Kinds of</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Occupations and Frustrations</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>into the Living Person of the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Signified by His Name</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever we come together, we come into a Person; therefore, we must be gathered out of our occupations and frustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Day after day we have a lot of things that occupy us and often frustrate us from going to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we keep ourselves in fellowship with the Lord, He will surely rescue us from these occupations and frustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord will save us from many things other than Himself, and He will save us into His Person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This aspect of the believers meeting is very critical, yet it has been lost through the years.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Matthew 18:20 the word into is used, not in. These are two different prepositions in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are gathered into the name, not in the name.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are gathered into the name, into the Person of the Lord, rather than meeting in the name.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord gathers us out of so many other things into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we meet in such a way, we not only have the Lord, but also are in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord as a Person, the all-inclusive and extensive Person, is our meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our meeting is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, whatever we do must be with the Lord and in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We do everything as one person with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the eyes of God, the entire congregation of those who are meeting is one enlarged person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whether there are fifty or fifty thousand, there is still just one person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The meeting should be in a person, and all things other than the Lord Himself should be kept away, left behind, or dropped.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are meeting in the Lord alone; therefore, our meeting becomes one enlarged person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are gathered out of all the occupations and frustrations into the living Person of the Lord, signified by His name.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our coming to the meeting should not be initiated by us, but by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is the gathering One.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because we are all busy, it would be difficult to attend the meetings without the Lord s gathering; His gathering rescues us from so many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Often the night of the meeting seems to have the most frustrations and obstacles.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Suppose the meeting is on a Tuesday night.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It seems that every other night of the week is free from problems or frustrations except Tuesday night.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On this evening, your wife may suddenly have a cold and not be able to cook dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You may also have two young children who need care due to your wife being sick.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It seems that you have a legal excuse and can escape the gathering of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Other times because a particular night does not seem to be so good for meeting, a decision is made to shift the meeting to another night of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When this happens, Satan seems to shift all the troubles to that night.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Frequently, this trouble may be in the form of phone calls which come right before we are leaving to go to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For this reason, we often need to determine not to answer any phone calls close to the time of the meeting in order to cooperate with the Lord who gathers us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord is our Rescuer and He can rescue us from every kind of frustration and occupation, but He needs our cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As the meeting people of God, we are accustomed to having as many as four meetings a week twice on the Lord s Day and two other times during the week.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The worldly people may not have the capability to come to meetings as often as we do.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, regardless of how good the meetings might be, we occasionally lose our taste, and become tired or disinterested.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the time of meeting comes, we may have the excuse that we are tired.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is something of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must realize that the proper Christian meeting is always a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is because the subtle one, God s enemy, Satan, knows that every proper Christian meeting defeats him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Satan is always defeated, not by our individual spirituality but by our meeting in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, every meeting is a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whenever we feel tired, disinterested, or reluctant to go to the meetings, this indicates that we have been defeated by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to pray, Lord, rescue me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Gather me out of this weary condition.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we would pray in this way, the Lord would immediately strengthen us, stir us up, and give us an appetite to go to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Actually, it is not that we go to the meeting; rather, it is that the Lord rescues us from being absent from the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even when you go to the meeting, the meeting itself is still a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you do not sense that there is a battle while you are in any meeting, you are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When I come to the meeting to give a message, I often pray, Lord, You know that there is a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I am going, not merely to speak, but to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In every meeting, there is a battle; therefore, a certain amount of fighting is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord is ready to rescue you from defeat, but you have to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You have to be watchful and on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Because there is a constant battle, the Lord Jesus told us to watch and pray Matt 26:41; Mark 13:33; Luke 21:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we are at home away from the meetings, we may not feel that we need to watch or pray.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We need to realize that day by day, the Christian life and the meeting life are a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Particularly, the prayer meeting is a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Nearly everywhere among the churches today, the prayer meeting is the meeting with the smallest number in attendance.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is a bad sign indicating defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We all must endeavor to defeat the enemy by being gathered into the Lord out of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we go to the meetings in this way, we will certainly function.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we come to the meeting in an indifferent manner, however, it will be hard for us to function.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The old way keeps us in a dormant situation, and the Lord s new way is always to stir us up, making us alive.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If you come to the meetings in a living way, I assure you that you will function, that you will not be lazy, that you will have an interest and a taste for every kind of meeting, and that you will always be watchful and on the alert, knowing that all the meetings are battles.</S>
