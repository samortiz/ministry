   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FORMATION OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's word was a person when it was in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today God's word must also be a person when it comes to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the Lord was on the earth, He was the Word becoming flesh; God was speaking through the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today God is again manifesting His word in the flesh; He is still embodying His word in a person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is still speaking through flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is why God has to deal with our flesh today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He has to deal with our flesh to such an extent that the release of a word from our flesh is the release of the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to reach this point, we must have the constitution of the Holy Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God constitutes something into us through His indwelling Spirit, and as we ponder over such things and enunciate them, God's word is released.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The inward constitution of the Holy Spirit makes God's word our own subjective word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A minister of God's word must allow the Spirit to constitute him to such an extent that the word is no longer objective, but subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's constitution in us through His Spirit has to be so apparent that our mind and God's mind become not only compatible but one and the same mind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's constitution should be so strong that our word becomes not only similar to God's word but God's very own word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the result of the constitution of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When our word becomes God's word, we have the ministry of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we find man in this ministry, we find God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When man speaks, God speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since God's word is released through man, what manner of man must a person be, and what dealings must he go through!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Let us consider how God carries out this constituting work within us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The words within us are formed by God Himself; they are created by God through the daily trials and dealings that He arranges for us in our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may be under some kind of dealing for many days or months.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They may be days of victory, or they may be days of defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may find them bearable or unbearable, but the Lord's sovereign hand is behind all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Day after day, incident after incident, we are disciplined a little at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Gradually a word or two becomes clear within us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we become clearer, we can begin to speak, and this speaking is of our own words.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has created a word or two in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the way words are formed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These words are our words, and they are also God's words.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is where we pick up our training.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Suppose we experience some dealing by God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the beginning we may wonder what is happening to us, and we may not have any word at all to describe it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As we pass through the dealing, we do not seem to be clear about anything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But after a while, we begin to feel a little clearer and exclaim, "Ah, this is what the Lord wants.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is dealing with me for the purpose of getting this one thing."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But it is not this simple.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not become clear all at once.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may be somewhat clear and yet not altogether clear.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While tarrying around this hazy zone, there is a gradual clearing away.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As things become clearer, we begin to have a word or two.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This clearing away becomes the very word we possess.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sometimes the Lord gives us a trial, a very severe trial, and we find ourselves too weak to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may even say to ourselves that there is no way to get through.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But gradually we may feel that there is somehow a way to get through, perhaps even to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We often hobble between a sense of victory and a sense of defeat, and after some days we find that we indeed have overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>During this time we may feel that we cannot get through, but daily we overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we add up all the times that we are able to get through, we find that in the end we are able to overcome without our knowing it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Throughout this process, the word takes form.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This word is our own word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to realize that this movement between light and darkness is a process through which God forms His word in us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>While we are under trials and while our senses move back and forth between confusion and clarity, God is forming His word in us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We may feel that we cannot overcome, and yet we find ourselves overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We may feel that we are about to fall, and yet we find ourselves still standing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Day by day we find the Lord delivering us out of different situations.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This deliverance becomes the word which we have within us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The more we go on, the more we become clear, and the more word we have.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the process by which words are formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The ministry of the word is not something that can be conjured up; it is something formed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The formed word is different from the conjured-up word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>While we are groping in darkness, something seems to be clear to us, and yet it goes away in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>During those moments of clarity we see a little, and the sum total of all these clear moments gives us a clear registration, resulting in our words.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our words, therefore, are what we have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To be a minister of the word, we need not only light, thoughts, the inner words, the outer words, and the memory; we also need to pay attention to how we deliver this word on the platform, that is, the word formed out of the discipline we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God creates words in us through discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The measure of our speaking is determined by the amount of dealings that we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We can only speak to the extent that we have been dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The amount of experience we have before the Lord is the amount of words that we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This makes things quite clear: The Lord is molding us, the person, with the view that eventually we will handle God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord is doing a carving work on our person today with the view that our person will eventually become an oracle for God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The extent of the release of such a word is strictly determined by the amount of training we receive.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Our words are based on the amount of experience we have before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God's intention is to make us and His word one.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is not a matter of us passing on God's word in an objective way but a matter of God's carving and molding, with the result that our words become God's words.</S>
