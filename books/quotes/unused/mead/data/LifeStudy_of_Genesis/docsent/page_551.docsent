   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE NINETY-EIGHT BEING MATURED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE MANIFESTATION OF MATURITY 3</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall continue with the subject of Jacob's prophesying with blessing 49:1-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous message we pointed out that although this word of prophecy was spoken by a man, it was nonetheless the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because, in his maturity, Jacob was one with God, whatever he said was God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Most Christians have a difficult time understanding Genesis 49.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I first began to study this chapter about fifty years ago, I found that it was not easy to learn the meaning of the prophecies recorded here.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a very significant chapter, for it is virtually the conclusion of the book of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the record of Genesis, the human race began with Adam and continued with Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, Jacob was no longer an individual, because he became the father of a house that was chosen by God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This house, the house of Jacob 46:27 , was composed mainly of Jacob's twelve sons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later, these twelve sons became the twelve tribes of the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that God's intention is to have a house, not individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The house of Israel was a type of the church, which is God's house today.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Old Testament we have a house, the house of Israel, and in the New Testament we also have a house, the church of the living God 1 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whatever is spoken regarding the house of Israel is a type, a picture, and a shadow of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I was with the Brethren teachers, they told us to differentiate those parts of the Bible that were for the children of Israel from those that were for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In a sense, this is correct, for we should not mix God's word concerning the house of Israel with His word concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, because the church is a spiritual entity, it is difficult for us to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, we need the picture of the house of Israel in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The principle is that the Bible uses types and figures to portray spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Anything that is spiritual is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, because New Jerusalem is spiritual and mysterious, the Bible uses a city to illustrate it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Likewise, without the picture of the house of Israel, we would find it difficult to adequately comprehend the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, when we examine the picture in the Old Testament, we are able to understand many aspects of the church revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, what is spoken concerning the children of Israel is not only for them; it is also for us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Based upon the principle of using types and pictures to portray spiritual realities, we must apply to ourselves all that is said about the twelve tribes of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Physically speaking, of course, we are not the twelve tribes of Israel; however, spiritually speaking, we are the twelve tribes because they are pictures of us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we want to know ourselves, we should look at the photograph of ourselves in these twelve tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not think that the prophecies in Genesis 49 are only concerned with the sons of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These prophecies probably concern us more than they do Jacob's twelve sons.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The number twelve is composed of three times four.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Firstly, Jacob prophesied concerning his first three sons, Reuben, Simeon, and Levi vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>3-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These three brothers are subdivided.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Reuben stands alone, and Simeon and Levi are grouped together.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to their activities, Simeon and Levi were one.</S>
