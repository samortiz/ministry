   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOVERNMENTAL FORGIVENESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is another kind of forgiveness in the Bible which we call governmental forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can understand this kind of forgiveness from the following verses: Matthew 6:14-15; 9:2, 5-6; 18:21-35; James 5:15.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We call the forgiveness that is spoken of in all these verses governmental forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. What God's Governmental Forgiveness Is</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some may ask, "What is God's governmental forgiveness?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I have often thought that if a person were made aware of God's government immediately upon becoming a Christian, he would spare himself many troubles and problems.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let me once again use the illustration of the little girl.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before such an incident as described above occurred, her mother would have left the doors of the rooms in the house open whenever she left the house.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>She would have left the door to the kitchen open and the kitchen cabinet doors unlocked.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even though there may have been considerable food in the cabinets, she would have left the door open.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On that particular day, when she comes back to the house, she may discover that her daughter has stolen food from the cabinets.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since the mother has found out, the daughter has no choice but to confess her sins and ask for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The mother forgives her and kisses her.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>She says, "I forgive you," and the matter is over with and the fellowship restored.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But from that time on, she begins to lock the doors whenever she leaves the house.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She has changed her way!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Fellowship is one thing, while government is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is government?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Government is the way of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In our words, God's government is His way of doing things; it is His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The mother forgives her child's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She says, "Since you have eaten the food already, I will not pursue the matter any further."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>She forgives her daughter, and the fellowship is restored.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the daughter sees her mother, she can be as happy and intimate as before.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the next time the mother leaves the house, the cabinets and the door to the kitchen will be locked.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In other words, the way of handling things will be different.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Fellowship can be restored, but the way of doing things cannot be easily restored.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The mother is afraid that her child will do the same thing again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>She will no longer grant her daughter the kind of freedom she had before.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She will put on some kind of restrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The way is changed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Please bear in mind that God treats us according to the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Forgiveness in fellowship is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Fellowship is easily restored for those who confess with a true heart.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once they confess that they have sinned against God, God will recover the fellowship between Him and them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But God's way of dealing with these ones may immediately become different.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God's discipline may be exercised upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He may no longer allow them to be as free or loose.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One day the disciplining hand of God may be lifted.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At that time we will have governmental forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After a period of time, the mother may feel that her child can once again be trusted.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>She then leaves the kitchen door open once more.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is called governmental forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Forgiveness of fellowship is one thing, while governmental forgiveness is another.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A father may tell his sons to go outside to play at four o'clock and to come back for dinner at six o'clock.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Suppose one day the children go out and fight with other children.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When they come home, they confess their sin to their father.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The father forgives them and lets them out again the next day, but they get into a fight with other children again.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What should the father do?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They may confess their sins day after day and the father may forgive them day after day, but the father will wonder whether his way of government is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He may wonder if it is wrong to let them out every day.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He may say, "Starting from tomorrow, you will stay at home and not go out because you have been fighting outside."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The father's hand has come in. When we sin against God, God will forgive us when we confess our sins to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, we cannot stop Him from using other methods to discipline us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God will forgive us, and our fellowship with Him can be restored, but He may change His way with us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A man must realize that God's governmental hand is not easily removed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is not easy for God to take away His governmental hand.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God will remove His governmental hand only when He has full assurance that His children are doing the right things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When the father sees his children continuing to make trouble, he will tell them to stay at home and withhold their freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He will shut them up for days, weeks, or even months, until he is satisfied that they will no longer cause trouble, quarreling or fighting with people.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At that time the father may say to his children, "You have behaved well during the past two months.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You may go out for ten minutes tomorrow."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The governmental hand is lifted.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We call these ten minutes a governmental forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The governmental way has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The father still has to observe how the children behave among others during those ten minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If the children do not engage in a fight, the father may allow them to go out again for half an hour the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After some time, he may extend the time to an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Perhaps after one or two months, they may play from four o'clock to six o'clock again.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When that day comes, we can say that governmental forgiveness has been fully exercised in the children!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Brothers, what does governmental forgiveness mean?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Governmental forgiveness is absolutely different from eternal forgiveness, instrumental forgiveness, and forgiveness in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Governmental forgiveness is related to the way God manages, rules over, and deals with us.</S>
