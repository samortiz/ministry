   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT TRUSTING IN OURSELVES, BUT IN GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2 Corinthians 1, Paul told us that he and his co-workers were "excessively burdened, beyond our power, so that we despaired even of living" v. 8 . They had the sentence of death in themselves that they should not trust in themselves but in the very God who raises the dead v. 9 . We need to be impressed with these words in 1:9 "we should not have confidence in ourselves, but in God." Through the redemption of Christ, the very God, who is in the heavens, has come into us, into our spirit Col 1:27; 2 Tim 4:22 . Thank the Lord that He is now in our spirit, calling us to forget about the soulish things and turn to our spirit to meet Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should no longer trust in our self, in our soul, but in God who is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may know the doctrine concerning no longer trusting in ourselves but in God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To say that we trust in God is easy, but in our experience it may be different.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a husband's wife is not so nice to him, the first thing he usually does is to exercise his mind to consider his wife's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is what it means to trust in yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we have really learned the lesson to trust no more in ourselves, we would not exercise our mind first but our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Immediately, we should turn to our spirit and exercise our spirit to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This practically means that we do not trust in ourselves but in God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We all need this kind of experience today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>NOT IN FLESHLY WISDOM, BUT IN THE GRACE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1:12 Paul said that he conducted himself "not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To trust in the self is bad, but to have fleshly wisdom is worse.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul did not say human wisdom but fleshly wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We generally understand that wisdom has something to do with the mind, but Paul speaks of a kind of wisdom related to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Fleshly wisdom is versus the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Fleshly wisdom is something connecting the soul and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The grace of God is in the spirit, working through the soul and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We trust in God, and this God is working within us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Grace is the very God who is working within us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is working from within our spirit through our soul and body in order that our whole being will be under His working.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should have no trust in ourselves but in God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our conversation, our walk, our living in this world should not be something in our fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that we have stopped all our doings and that it is now God who is working within us from our spirit through our soul and body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our whole being is under the working of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This kind of person is living and walking in the Holy of Holies all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>IN MY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because Paul was such a person living in the Holy of Holies, he could say, "I had no relief in my spirit" 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul did not say that he had no relief in his mind or in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you are going to understand 2 Corinthians you have to pick up the key phrases such as "not have confidence in ourselves, but in God"; "not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God"; and "no relief in my spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul did not even say that he had no relief in the Spirit but "in my spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul was a person living, walking, working, and even having his being in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was not a man living in the soul or the flesh but a person living in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, he could say that he had no relief in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This shows us that Paul did not care for the circumstances or for what he thought or could see.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He only cared for his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His brother Titus had not come, so he did not have the relief in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I like this term "in my spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to be brought into the realization of our spirit, and we have to learn how to do everything in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are going to be happy, we have to be happy in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are going to be sorrowful, we have to be sorrowful in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many times we are happy merely in our emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may not know how to be happy in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But we have to learn how to be happy in the spirit, how to have the relief in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all need to learn to take care of the relief in our spirit, and be persons living in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then in 4:13 Paul tells us that he and the brothers with him had "the same spirit of faith."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all have to learn to exercise the spirit to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whatever we do, whatever we say, we have to be sure that we have the same spirit, that we are in the same spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not something in the soul or in the flesh but in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we go to see a brother, we have to go in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we have fellowship, we must have it in the spirit.</S>
