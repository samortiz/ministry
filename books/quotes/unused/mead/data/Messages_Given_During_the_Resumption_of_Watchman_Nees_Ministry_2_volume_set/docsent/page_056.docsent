   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S PRESENT NEED A BODY TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today's need can no longer be met by revivals.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Man's need today speaks of God's need.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If all I have been speaking during the past seven nights were but revival messages, I believe the speaking would not satisfy men.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is needed today is the work of a university.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of course, the elementary school and the high school are preparatory institutions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These preparatory institutions are there to prepare a person for the university.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The so-called seminaries and revival conferences are but "crash courses"; it is difficult for those who graduate from "crash courses" to get into the universities.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A high school is there only to meet the need of society; it is not the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today, we do not preach the gospel to bring people to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The gospel preaching is for a higher goal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As long as a man can breathe, he has to be a proper person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As long as he is a proper person, he has to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But if a person only loves the Lord without living in life, this will not meet God's need.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today, God wants us to go into the university.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The standard of this university is quite high.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although it is not the graduate school, its standard is still very high.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must never despise God's spiritual blessings to China.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Other than China and England, I am afraid there is no other country which has experienced so much of God's blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even places like America and Denmark have to admit that God is blessing these two countries.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>May the Lord be merciful to us, that our work will match God's need in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I feel that the most shameful thing is to send a group of people to America to study in the seminaries and then through them to raise some funds for China.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What China needs is not the U. S. dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What China needs is every drop of our spiritual blood.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today, we will never barter men's souls for U. S. dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During 1926 and 1927, there was a strong anti-Christian and anti-foreigner movement.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since that time, Chinese indigenous churches began to appear in China.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They did a better work than the Western missionaries did.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am afraid that the influence of the U. S. dollars is a frustration to the work in China.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today, in the third period, God does not need spiritual giants any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What He needs is the Body testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today, we only need to be the members.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A small member is a member, and a big member is also a member.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No member can be the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the whole church rises up to preach the gospel, others will only say it is the church that has saved them; they will not say that it is Dr. So-and-so who has saved them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today, whether it is the gospel, the revival, or life, everything is for this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today is not the time for the co-workers to serve the Lord by themselves, but the time for the whole church to rise up to serve Him together.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>FREE FELLOWSHIP ON THE AFTERNOON</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>OF JANUARY 15</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>FOUR KINDS OF WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today there are four kinds of workers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first are the co-workers who match the need of the ministry of God in the present age.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a small group of people who have been dealt with by the Lord and who are in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The second kind are the younger co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They are willing to receive the direction and to come under the coordination of the older co-workers, and they are willing to follow and to learn in humility.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The third kind are those who are unwilling to submit to the senior co-workers, who do not belong to the denominations, yet who are happy to remain in fellowship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The fourth kind are the preachers and free evangelists among the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What we need today are the first and the second kind of co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When a co-worker is in a certain place, he has to cooperate with the local church in that place.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The work and the church cannot be separated one from the other.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When a co-worker is working in a certain place, he is at the same time one of the local brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the church assigns work to the saints, the co-workers should stand on the same ground as the local brothers and should accept assignments in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Concerning the third and the fourth kind of co-workers, we can only let them choose their own pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>With some people, God has not assigned them to take the same way as we do, and we dare not say anything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whatever the situation may be, we are here to do the work that God has committed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We cannot interfere with others' work, and we are not here tearing down others' work.</S>
