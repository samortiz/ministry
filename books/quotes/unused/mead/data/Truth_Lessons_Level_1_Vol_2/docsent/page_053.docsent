   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is a man, the Son of Man, who was born of a virgin, possessing the human nature, a human body, and the human form, and who lived a human life on earth; after His resurrection He is still a man, and in eternity He will still be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is the Redeemer who died and shed His blood to redeem us outwardly, objectively, once for all by His precious blood.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After He died and was resurrected, men called Him Lord; hence, He is the resurrected Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When He ascended to the height of the heavens, as a man He was made Lord by God, that is, the Lord of all things, to whom are all things, and the Lord of all men, unto whom are all men.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In ascension He attained to the height of the universe, far above all; He also attained to the peak of the divine attributes with the human virtues, expressing what God is in His humanity in the universe through all eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, in His ascension He has obtained the throne, glory, honor, the name which is above every name, the lordship, and the rulership.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today in the heavens He gives repentance and forgiveness of sins to save sinners for the building of the church and the establishment of God s kingdom.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At His coming back He will redeem the believers body, conforming it to the body of His glory, and He will also restore all things and bring in God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In eternity He will be the Lamb who is one with God, the Husband of the redeemed, and the temple in which they serve God; He will also be the lamp shining in the holy city, the supply nourishing the holy city, and the healing of the nations on the new earth for eternity.</S>
