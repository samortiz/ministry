<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Elohim (God), Implying the Faithful Strong One</H2><P>Another name for God is the Hebrew title Elohim, implying the faithful strong One (Gen. 1:1; 2:4). The word Elohim is plural in number. This indicates that God is triune. Genesis 1:1 says that in the beginning God (Elohim) created the heaven and the earth.</P><P>After God's creation and restoration of the universe, He came to the creation of man. In Genesis 1:26 God said, "Let Us make man in Our image." There is one God but the pronouns here are "Us" and "Our," indicating that there is a plurality with God. The words "let Us" imply that God is triune and that the three of the Godhead had a conference among Themselves. Thus, the Divine Trinity is fully implied at the beginning of the Bible in Genesis 1. Scofield pointed out that the word Elohim is composed of two Hebrew words, implying strength and faithfulness. Thus, God, Elohim, is the faithful strong One. He is strong and He is faithful, so He can do everything to keep His word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. GOD BEING ETERNAL</H2><P>The Triune God is eternal. No one can adequately explain what eternal means. The word eternal first implies the element of time. According to time God is forever and ever, eternal. God's being eternal also implies quality. His being eternal means that He is altogether complete and perfect, without defect. Concerning time He is eternal. He has no ending and no beginning. Concerning His quality He is complete and perfect. When the Bible says that God is life, this means that this life is without beginning and without ending. It also means that this life is complete and perfect. Our human life is not eternal but temporary. Also, our human life is not perfect or complete. God, however, is eternal both in time and in quality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. From Eternity to Eternity</H2><P>Psalm 90:2b says that from eternity to eternity He is God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Uncreated (as the Creating One)</H2><P>God, as the creating One, is uncreated (Gen. 1:1). The first sentence in the Bible says, "In the beginning God created..." This means that God Himself is the beginning. With Him there is the beginning because He is the beginning.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Without Beginning and without Ending&#151;<br>Self-existing and Ever-existing</H2><P>Hebrews 7:3 reveals that Christ as the Son of God is without beginning and without ending&#151;self-existing and ever-existing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Eternal in His Trinity</H2><P>God is eternal in His Trinity. Isaiah 9:6 speaks of the eternal Father. Hebrews 1:12 and 7:3 indicate clearly that the Son is eternal, self-existing, and ever-existing. Hebrews 9:14 refers to the eternal Spirit. This shows us that in totality the Triune God is eternal.</P>
