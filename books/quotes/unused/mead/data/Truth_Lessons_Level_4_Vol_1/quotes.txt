[1]  Lesson 2: Prophecies concerning Christ His Divinity and Humanity
[2]  LESSON ONE THE PROPHECIES IN THE BIBLE OUTLINE The importance of the prophecies in the Bible: The believers needing to give heed to prophecies: As to a lamp shining in a dark place.
[3]  Second Peter 1:20-21 says, Knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of one s own interpretation; for no prophecy was ever borne by the will of man, but men spoke from God while being borne by the Holy Spirit.
[4]  Revelation 22:6-7 says, These words are faithful and true; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His angel to show to His slaves the things which must quickly take place.
[5]  Some examples of people in the Bible who had an intimate relationship with God are Enoch, who walked with God and received the prophecy regarding the coming judgment by the flood; Abraham, who foreknew God s move, because he was the friend of God; Daniel, who saw visions and recorded prophecies, because he was a man of preciousness to God; and the apostle John, who received the visions in the book of Revelation, because he was the disciple whom the Lord loved.
[6]  HIS DIVINITY AND HUMANITY OUTLINE The Old Testament prophecies concerning the divinity of Christ: Being the eternally unchanging Creator whose years are without end. Going forth from ancient times, from the days of eternity.
[7]  D. Being the Mighty God and the Eternal Father
[8]  Isaiah was written about seven hundred years before Christ s incarnation, but it clearly prophesied that a child would be born to us and a Son would be given to us and that His name would be called Mighty God and Eternal Father.
[9]  As the seed of the woman, Christ in His humanity partook of blood and flesh, having the likeness of the flesh of sin and being involved with fallen man s flesh indwelt by Satan v. 14; John 1:14; Rom 8:3 . Thus, through the death on the cross, Christ judged Satan, the enemy of God John 12:31; 16:11 , destroyed the works of the devil 1 John 3:8b , and destroyed the devil, who dwells in fallen man Heb 2:14 , so as to free man.
[10]  The New Testament reveals that Christ in His humanity is the seed of Abraham Matt 1:1 .
[11]  Here Paul indicates that in God s eyes Abraham has only one seed, that is, Christ.
[12]  Furthermore, Christ in His humanity blesses the nations so that the nations may receive the gospel of Christ, which is to receive the Spirit promised by God v. 14 .
[13]  This indicates that Christ in His humanity is the seed of Abraham so that the nations can receive the gospel of Christ, which is the blessing God gave to Abraham Gen 22:18; Gal 3:8-12 .
[14]  Just as Solomon built and completed the temple of God, Christ in resurrection also builds His church to be the dwelling place of God on earth 2 Sam 7:13a; Matt 16:18; Eph 2:21-22 .
[15]  In 2 Samuel 7 Nathan not only prophesied that the resurrected Christ will build the church, God s temple, but he also prophesied that Christ in His humanity as the seed of David will be the Son of God, and God will be His Father.
[16]  Thus, this Christ who is the seed of David in His humanity became the Son of God, even in His humanity, through resurrection, to be the firstborn Son of God, possessing both divinity and humanity v. 29 .
[17]  Isaiah prophesied that the Spirit of Jehovah the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of Jehovah would rest upon Christ 11:2 .
[18]  Christ in His human living, as the branch of Jesse in His humanity, had all these attributes.
[19]  Based on this redemption, we can receive God s forgiveness; God makes Christ our righteousness and clothes us with the robe of righteousness 61:10 so that we may be justified before God.
[20]  We have seen that before Christ was incarnated, the Old Testament prophets prophesied that the incarnated Christ is God and also man.
[21]  This shows that the Old Testament clearly prophesied the first coming of Christ and that the incarnation of Christ was His coming to do the will of God.
[22]  These aspects include Christ as Shiloh; a Star; a Prophet; the One who does God s will; a great light and a light of the nations; a child, a Son Emmanuel ; the King; the One coming forth from Bethlehem; the Desire of the nations; a Messenger of God and the Angel of the covenant; and the glory and consolation of Israel.
[23]  The Old Testament prophet Moses prophesied that Christ would come as a Prophet raised up by God Deut 18:15-19 .
[24]  In Acts 3:22-23 Peter quotes Moses words to indicate that Christ is the Prophet promised by God through Moses to His people.
[25]  HIS FIRST COMING 2 OUTLINE The child born of a virgin, the Son Emmanuel given by the Eternal Father: A child born of a human virgin.
[26]  Concerning Christ s first coming, the prophet Micah prophesied, You, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, / So little to be among the thousands of Judah, / From you there will come forth to Me / He who is to be Ruler in Israel; / And His goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity 5:2 .
[27]  Micah s prophecy concerning the goings forth of Christ is a great matter in God s economy.
[28]  This prophecy reveals to us that on the one hand, Christ as a man came out of Bethlehem, David s city Luke 2:4 , but on the other hand, Christ as God came forth from the days of eternity.
[29]  Through Christ s coming forth, God s choosing and predestinating were manifested in the believers.
[30]  Not long after the birth of Jesus, when He was presented to God in the temple at Jerusalem, Simeon, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, extolled Him, not only as the light of the Gentiles but also as the glory of God s people, Israel v. 32 . In the Old Testament Jehovah is the glory of Israel Jer 2:11 . In Christ s incarnation, He was extolled by a Spirit-inspired man as the prophesied One.
[31]  In the arrangement of God s economy, the incarnated Christ in His first coming is the glory of Israel to uplift them, and He is their consolation that comforts them.
[32]  AND THE RECOMMENDER OF HIS MINISTRY OUTLINE Christ s birth and youth: Being born in Bethlehem to be a Ruler: Being born as the seed of David, qualified to reign as King.
[33]  In His first coming, Christ was God becoming man to enter into mankind with all His riches and to bring God into man in His ministry.
[34]  Soon after Jesus was born, magi from the east went to Jerusalem, seeking to worship Him.
[35]  Before Christ began His earthly ministry, the Scriptures prophesied of a recommender who would be a forerunner of His ministry.
[36]  He said, Elijah indeed is coming and will restore all things v. 11 . This refers to the time of the great tribulation when Elijah will be one of the two witnesses who strengthen the people of God Rev 11:3-12 . But the Lord Jesus also said, I say to you that Elijah has already come; and they did not recognize him, but did with him the things they wished Matt 17:12 . This shows that the recommender of Christ Elijah had already come; he was John the Baptist.
[37]  HIS LIVING AND MINISTRY ON EARTH OUTLINE His anointing: The Spirit of Jehovah descending upon Him at His baptism.
[38]  The Spirit of God being upon Him continually throughout His living and work.
[39]  Psalm 69 prophesied that Christ would be devoured by the zeal for God s house v. 9a . This prophecy was fulfilled at the time Christ cleansed the temple, the house of God John 2:12-17 . When the Lord saw the corrupted situation of the temple, He could not tolerate it.
[40]  HIS MINISTRY A. Being the Servant of Jehovah to Serve God
[41]  Isaiah 42:1-4 says, Here is My Servant, whom I uphold, / My chosen One in whom My soul delights; / I have put My Spirit upon Him, / And He will bring forth justice to the nations.
[42]  HIS DEATH AND BURIAL 1 OUTLINE His status at His death: The Messiah cut off after the sixty-ninth week.
[43]  This prophecy promised that the anointed Christ would terminate the old creation by His crucifixion so that Christ in His resurrection might become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b to germinate those whom God has chosen, His new creation.
[44]  After the Lord Jesus indicated in Matthew 21:42 that He was the stone rejected by the Jewish builders, He said, He who falls on this stone shall be broken to pieces v. 44 . This word is the fulfillment of the prophecy of the prophet Isaiah: Then He will become...a stone to strike against / And a rock of stumbling / To both houses of Israel... / And many will stumble at these, / And will fall and be broken to pieces Isa 8:14-15 . Furthermore, Romans 9:32-33a, Luke 2:34, and 1 Peter 2:8 refer to the fulfillment of Isaiah 8:14-15.
[45]  According to the record in the Gospel of Luke, Simeon prophesied that Christ would be appointed by God to be a test to the children of Israel for the falling and the rising up of many 2:34 .
[46]  The angel prophesied to Zechariah that Jehovah would engrave the stone, indicating that God would work on Christ as the stone for the accomplishing of God s redemption, salvation, and building.
[47]  HIS DEATH AND BURIAL 2 OUTLINE Prophecies in the Psalms concerning Christ s death: Trusting in God for deliverance.
[48]  Enduring great pain and agony being poured out like water, His bones being out of joint, His heart melting like wax, His strength being dried up, and His tongue being stuck to His jaws.
[49]  While Christ was being crucified on the cross, many fierce men, like the mighty bulls of Bashan, encompassed Him v. 12 . They opened their mouth at Him like a ravening and roaring lion v. 13 . Evil men, a congregation of evildoers signified by dogs, surrounded and enclosed Him v. 16 .
[50]  The fulfillment of these prophecies is found in the New Testament in John 19:34 cf. v. 37 . Christ s two hands and two feet were nailed to the cross, and His side was pierced with a spear by one of the Roman soldiers who executed Him and immediately there came out blood and water v. 34 . John indicates in verse 37 that this fulfilled Zechariah s prophecy: They will look upon Me, whom they have pierced Zech 12:10 . Two substances came out of the Lord s pierced side: blood and water.
[51]  His heart was like wax melted within Him v. 14c-d , His strength was dried up like a shard, and His tongue was stuck to His jaws 22:15a-b; John 19:28 . Finally, God put Him into death, that is, put Him in the dust of death Psa 22:15c . Jesus dying was God s putting Him into death.
[52]  In Psalm 34:20 David says, He keeps all his bones; / Not one of them is broken.
[53]  This prophesied that when Christ was crucified, His legs would not be broken John 19:33, 36 .
[54]  The day Christ was crucified was the day of preparation for the Passover, and the next day beginning at six o clock in the evening was the Sabbath v. 14; Luke 23:54 . The Jews, not wanting the bodies to remain on the cross on the Sabbath, asked Pilate that the legs of Jesus and the other two crucified with Him be broken to hasten their death John 19:31 . But when the soldiers came to Jesus, they saw that He had already died, so they did not break His legs v. 33 . Under God s sovereignty not one of the Lord s bones was broken.
[55]  B. Like a Lamb Being Led to the Slaughter and
[56]  Isaiah 53:7 prophesied, He was oppressed, and it was He who was afflicted, / Yet He did not open His mouth; / Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter / And like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers, / So He did not open His mouth.
[57]  According to Matthew, on the night in which Christ was betrayed, some from the chief priests and elders of the people came to seize Him and bind Him so as to deliver Him to Pilate.
[58]  Although Christ had done no violence, nor was there any deceit in His mouth, He was crucified and was assigned by man a grave with the wicked, but in God s sovereignty, He was with a rich man in His death Isa 53:9; Matt 27:57-60 .
[59]  By being the sacrifice that satisfies God and man, Christ in His flesh offered Himself to God once for all and put away sin, thereby doing the will of God.
[60]  HIS RESURRECTION OUTLINE Being raised from the dead on the third day.
[61]  God raised Christ up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Christ to be held by death v. 24 . Christ is both God and resurrection John 1:1; 11:25 , possessing the indestructible life Heb 7:16 ; hence, death is not able to hold Him.
[62]  In resurrection the only begotten Son of God was made the firstborn Son, possessing both divinity and an uplifted humanity, and His believers were also born with Him on the day of His resurrection to be His many brothers and the many sons of God.
[63]  God promised to give the resurrected Christ to His people as a gift; this One is the holy and faithful things of David.
[64]  The phrase the holy things of David, the faithful things indicates that Christ was of David, for it was out of David s seed that God raised up such a One.
[65]  The New Testament also reveals that Christ s resurrection is a proof of our justification by God.
[66]  This is because in resurrection Christ, the only begotten Son of God, was born to be the firstborn Son of God; moreover, God s chosen people were born with Christ to be the many sons of God, the many brothers of Christ, as the components of the church to be the corporate expression of the Father Heb 2:10-12 .
[67]  He who sanctifies is Christ as the firstborn Son of God, and those who are being sanctified are the believers of Christ as the many sons of God.
[68]  After His ascension Christ sat down at the right hand of God, the Majesty, on the throne of the authority of God to exercise dominion over the universe for God.
[69]  His sitting at the right hand of God signifies that His work has been accomplished and that He is resting there, waiting for only one thing for God to set His enemies as His footstool so that He may have complete rest.
[70]  After Christ was crowned with glory and honor in His ascension, God gave Him the dominion over all things in His exaltation: You have made Him a little inferior to the angels; You have crowned Him with glory and honor and have set Him over the works of Your hands v. 7 . This is similar to what God did with Adam.
[71]  Isaiah 52:13 prophesied concerning Christ being exalted, lifted up, and made very high: My Servant will act wisely and will prosper; / He will be exalted and lifted up and very high.
[72]  Ephesians 1:20-21 refers to the fulfillment of this prophecy: Which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come.
[73]  The power that God caused to operate in Christ has put all things under the feet of the ascended Christ and has given the ascended Christ to be Head over all things to the church v. 22b . Whatever Christ the Head has attained and obtained has now been transmitted to His Body, the church v. 23a .
[74]  This means that in Christ s ascension, there was a demonstration of Christ s victory by the sharing of the captives, the spoil, taken in Christ s victory with God the Father, who is the Great and the Strong.
[75]  Joel 2:28-29 prophesied concerning Jehovah pouring out His Spirit upon all His sons and daughters.
[76]  The Spirit poured out on the day of Pentecost is the Spirit of God compounded with Christ s humanity, death, resurrection, and ascension as the realization of Christ and the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.
[77]  By such an outpouring the individual Christ has become the corporate Christ, the enlarged, increased Christ, which is the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh 1 Tim 3:15-16 .
[78]  Christ holds the key of David; He has authority to open and shut in order to establish God s kingdom, God s dominion, and to build up God s dwelling, God s temple.
[79]  According to Revelation 3 the ascended Christ has the key of David in order to give the church in Philadelphia, a type of the recovered church, an opened door so that people can enter the recovered church to be transformed into pillars in the temple of God and to be built up as God s city, the New Jerusalem vv.
[80]  HIS COMING BACK OUTLINE Christ s coming back His parousia: The beginning of Christ s coming back His coming from the third heaven, God s throne: Being in secret.
[81]  In relation to time, Christ s coming will begin from His throne in the heavens before the great tribulation, the last three and a half years of this age Matt 24:37-42; Rev 12:5; 14:1-5; Luke 21:36 , it will continue with His remaining in the air during the great tribulation 1 Thes 4:15-17; 1 Cor 15:23; Rev 10:1 , and it will end with His coming from the air to the earth at the end of the great tribulation 2 Thes 2:8 .
[82]  These overcomers will be caught up to God and to His throne v. 5 . This is a prophecy that before the great tribulation of three and a half years, Christ will cause the overcoming saints who were martyred throughout the generations to be resurrected from the dead and caught up to God and to His throne.
[83]  Just as the firstfruits of the good land were reaped and brought into the temple of God before the harvest Lev 23:10-11; Exo 23:19 , so the first-ripe believers in God s crop, those who mature earliest, will be reaped first for God s satisfaction.
[84]  In 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 Paul prophesied, The Lord Himself...will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
[85]  Christ s parousia will be completed in His being manifested in public, that is, His coming to the earth openly.
[86]  Christ was taken away by a cloud in the presence of the Jews in a visible way v. 9 . Hence, He will also return openly on the clouds Matt 26:64 , just as Revelation 1:7 says, Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the land will mourn over Him.
[87]  Finally, at His coming back Christ will judge the living peoples.
[88]  This is the day when Christ will judge the living the peoples living on the earth at His coming back on the throne of His glory Matt 25:31-46 .
[89]  IN THE MILLENNIUM AND IN ETERNITY OUTLINE In the millennium: Ruling over the nations as the King.
[90]  These nations will be the last stage of human nations on the old earth, and they all will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ 11:15 , being ruled by Christ and His overcomers.
[91]  After Christ has redeemed the created and lost earth and all people into the realm of His kingdom so that they become constituents of His kingdom Col 1:20 , after He has sold all that He has and bought the kingdom Matt 13:44 , and after He has saved the earth and all people from Satan s usurpation Rev 20:2-3 , He will have the full right to be the King of the restored earth and the restored nations.
[92]  After the millennium Christ will judge all the dead at the great white throne, for He is the Judge of both the living and the dead Acts 10:42; 2 Tim 4:1 .
[93]  In the New Jerusalem in eternity, Christ with God is the temple for us to dwell in and also for God to dwell among His redeemed so that God in Christ can continually dispense Himself into all His redeemed and enable them to enjoy the all-inclusive Triune God forever.
[94]  Apart from Christ God s shining would be a killing, but in Christ God s shining is an illumining.
[95]  God and the Lamb being on one throne proves that God and the Lamb are not separated; God in the Lamb is sitting on the throne.
[96]  This is what is indicated in Revelation 21:23, which reveals that God as the light is in Christ as the lamp and is one with Christ.
[97]  LESSON THIRTEEN PROPHECIES CONCERNING THE CHURCH THE CHURCH BEING
[98]  The church as a mystery being hidden, not made known to God s people before the New Testament age: Being hidden throughout the ages in God, who created all things.
[99]  In Ephesians 3:4 Paul used the expression the mystery of Christ to explain the church as the Body of Christ in God s eternal economy, indicating that the church is the mystery of Christ.
[100]  B. Not Being Made Known to the Sons of Men
[101]  The mystery of Christ the church in other generations was not made known to the sons of men v. 5 . The church, the Body of Christ, was hidden in the Old Testament age.
[102]  One aspect is the mystery of God, which is Christ as life and everything to the believers that they may become the members of His Body Col 2:2 ; the other is the mystery of Christ, which is the church as His Body to express His fullness Eph 1:22b-23 .
[103]  The book of Romans first says that the believers have been baptized into Christ 6:3 , that Christ has been wrought into the believers 8:10 , and that the believers have put on Christ 13:14 .
[104]  Then it reveals that the believers are built together in one Body to express Christ in the local churches 12:4-5 , with all the saints in all the churches loving one another and fellowshipping with one another to express the Body of Christ for the fulfillment of God s mystery 16:1-16 .
[105]  However, when Paul speaks in Ephesians 3 concerning the church as a mystery, he points out that in Christ Jesus the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the Body and fellow partakers of the promise through the gospel v. 6 . Fellow heirs indicates that in God s New Testament economy the chosen, redeemed, and regenerated Gentiles and the believing Jews are fellow heirs of God, inheriting God.
[106]  According to typology, Abraham has only one seed, Christ v. 16 . Since the New Testament believers are one with Christ, they become Abraham s seed out of faith, heirs according to the promise that they may inherit God s promised blessing.
[107]  Faith in Christ, who is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, enables God s chosen people, according to His promise, to become Abraham s heavenly seed as the stars of the heavens Gen 22:17 .
[108]  God in Christ enlivened the church from the position of death, raised her up together with Christ and seated her together with Him in the heavenlies, the highest place in the universe Eph 2:5-6 .
[109]  Christ as the life of the believers has saved them into a position that is far above all God s enemies, to become God s heavenly people.
[110]  In Romans 9:23-24 when Paul speaks concerning God s selection in His sovereignty and says that God might make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory, even us, whom He has also called, not only from among the Jews but also from among the Gentiles.
[111]  In Romans 15:8-11 Paul quotes 2 Samuel 22:50, Psalm 18:49, Deuteronomy 32:43, and Psalm 117:1 and says, I say that Christ has become a servant of the circumcision for the sake of God s truthfulness, to confirm the promises given to the fathers, and that the Gentiles should glorify God for His mercy, as it is written, Therefore I will extol You among the Gentiles, and I will sing praise to Your name.
[112]  Although the church as a mystery was not made known to the sons of men in the Old Testament age, God prophesied through the Old Testament prophets that He would gain the New Testament believers as Abraham s spiritual descendants like the stars in the heavens, that the Gentiles would become God s people the beloved sons of the living God, that the Gentiles would rejoice with the Jews, and that the Gentiles would be gathered together to serve God.
[113]  Being a specific section within the kingdom of God.
[114]  In Matthew 13:33 the Lord used the parable of leaven to prophesy concerning the corruption of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens: The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.
[115]  Paul says, The Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will save me into His heavenly kingdom 2 Tim 4:18 .
[116]  The heavenly kingdom is the kingdom of their Father Matt 13:43 , the kingdom of My Father 26:29 , the kingdom of Christ and of God Eph 5:5 , and the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ 2 Pet 1:11 , and it will be a reward to the overcoming saints.
[117]  The persecuted church suffered in the sweetness and fragrance of Christ, that is, in the tribulation of Jesus and in the fellowship of His sufferings, and thereby became the continuation of His suffering Col 1:24 .
[118]  The church in Pergamos still held fast the Lord s name, the reality of the person of Christ.
[119]  The church still adhered to the faith of the Triune God, believing in the Lord s divinity and humanity and opposing the heresy of Arianism, which denied the divinity of Christ.
[120]  The Lord rebuked the church in Thyatira for tolerating Jezebel, the woman who called herself a prophetess and taught the Lord s slaves to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices v. 20 . The prophetess Jezebel referred to in this prophecy was the pagan wife of Ahab, the king of Israel 1 Kings 16:31 . She urged Ahab to worship and to serve Baal, promoted idolatry among the children of Israel, and sought to kill the prophets of the children of Israel 21:25-26; 18:19; 19:2 . Jezebel is also the woman prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 13:33, the woman who added leaven signifying evil, heretical, and pagan things into the fine flour signifying Christ as the meal offering for the satisfaction of God and man.
[121]  Not Willing to Repent and Being Sick in Bed
[122]  One outstanding feature of the church in Philadelphia is that she has a little power and has kept the Lord s word v. 8 . According to church history the brothers raised up in the early part of the nineteenth century did not care for tradition; they strictly kept the Lord s word.
[123]  She is naked, mainly due to the lack of the subjective experience of Christ, that is, the lack of living by Christ and living out Christ to be her subjective righteousness as another splendid robe.
[124]  THE CONSUMMATION OF THE CHURCH OUTLINE God s eternal plan being to obtain a counterpart for Christ: Being for Christ s satisfaction and rest in love.
[125]  This is a wonderful picture depicting Christ and the church, signifying that only the church, which has the same life and nature of Christ, can become Christ s counterpart for His satisfaction and rest in love.
[126]  It surely is a great mystery that the church as Christ s counterpart comes out of Christ, has the same life and nature of Christ, and is one with Christ.
[127]  THE CHURCH BEING THE BRIDE OF CHRIST A. The Preparation of the Bride
[128]  Ephesians 5:26-27 reveals that today Christ is sanctifying the church, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish.
[129]  Today Christ as the life-giving Spirit is sanctifying the church through separation, saturation, transformation, growth, and building up; in the future Christ as the Bridegroom will present the church to Himself as His counterpart for His satisfaction.
[130]  The New Jerusalem will be the bride in the millennium for one thousand years, which is like one day 2 Pet 3:8 , and will be the wife in the new heaven and new earth for eternity, to the ages of the ages without end. The bride in the millennium consists of the overcoming saints, whereas the bride in the new heaven and new earth is composed of all God s redeemed and regenerated sons Rev 21:7 .
[131]  Resurrection is mainly for the dead those who are sleeping, John 11:11-14; 1 Thes 4:13; 1 Cor 11:30 in the Lord before His coming.
[132]  At that time God will transfigure the believer s body of humiliation to be conformed to the body of Christ s glory Phil 3:20-21 .
[133]  They will be raptured to God and to His throne Rev 12:5 before the three and a half years, that is, before the twelve hundred sixty days, of the great tribulation v. 6 . Then they will execute the Lord s judgment on the devil, God s enemy, casting him out of heaven vv.
[134]  B. Being at the End of the Great Tribulation 1.
[135]  The harvest of the earth is God s people on earth, the believers in Christ cf.
[136]  That the Praise May Be to Each One from God
[137]  The believers will be examined by the Lord at the judgment seat of Christ.
[138]  If the believers heart is right, good, pure, and for God, then at the judgment seat of Christ they will be rewarded with praise from God.
[139]  However, since the believers are selected, called, redeemed, and regenerated by God, He will not let them go.
[140]  If they do not have the real experience and enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ and His unsearchable riches in the church age, they will not be transformed and perfected.
[141]  To be cut asunder refers to being cut off from the glorious Christ, from the glory of His kingdom, and from His glorious presence in His kingdom, unable to participate in Christ and the glory of His kingdom in the manifestation of the kingdom.
[142]  After the immature believers are cut asunder, cut off from their organic union with the Lord, they will be cast out into the outer darkness, which is the darkness outside the bright glory in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, where they will weep and gnash their teeth.
[143]  In the coming kingdom age the overcoming believers will be with Christ in the bright glory of the kingdom Col 3:4 , whereas the defeated believers will suffer discipline in outer darkness Matt 8:12 .
[144]  THEIR DEFEAT AND OVERCOMING 2 OUTLINE The reward received by the overcoming believers: Reigning with Christ in the millennium: Receiving a crown: The crown of righteousness.
[145]  These verses indicate that in the coming age the overcoming believers, who are living in the reality of the kingdom today, will reign with Christ as co-kings and be priests of God and of Christ.
[146]  In Revelation 2:10 the Lord Jesus said to the church in Smyrna, Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.
[147]  In the manifestation of the kingdom the overcoming believers in Christ will participate in the kingdom feast with the overcoming saints in the Old Testament, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[148]  The overcomers will drink the cup of the new covenant anew with the Lord when they participate in the feast of the kingdom of the heavens, just as the Lord said when He established the table on the earth, I shall by no means drink of this product of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of My Father 26:29 .
[149]  This word indicates that from the time the Lord established His table, He would be physically away from the believers and not drink the fruit of the vine with them until He drinks anew the cup of the new covenant with the overcoming believers in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, that is, the kingdom of the Father.
[150]  It will be a reward to His faithful believers, who pursue the growth in His life unto maturity and the development of the virtues of His nature that in the millennium they may participate in His kingship in God s glory 2 Tim 2:12; Rev 20:4, 6 .
[151]  The overcomers will inherit eternal life in the millennium Matt 19:29 .
[152]  To inherit eternal life is to be rewarded in the coming age with a fuller enjoyment of the divine life in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens Luke 18:29-30 .
[153]  The enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth will be the common portion of all God s redeemed people, whereas the particular enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom is a dispensational reward given only to the overcoming believers.
[154]  That the name of God God Himself , the name of the New Jerusalem the city itself , and the Lord s new name the Lord Himself are written upon the overcomers indicates that the overcomers are possessed by God, by the New Jerusalem, and by the Lord.
