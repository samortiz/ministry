[1]  LESSON THIRTY-SEVEN REDEMPTION 2 WASHING OUTLINE The need for washing.
[2]  When we believe and receive Christ, His blood also purifies our conscience Heb 9:14 .
[3]  According to the revelation of the Bible, the blood of Christ does not cleanse our heart; rather, it purifies our conscience.
[4]  Our conscience is the most important part of our spirit, and our spirit is the organ by which we contact God.
[5]  At the time we believe, God washes our sin-contaminated conscience with the Lord s redeeming blood, not only making it clean and transparent but also restoring its original function that through it we may serve God.
[6]  The way to be sanctified: By faith in Christ.
[7]  THE WAY TO BE SANCTIFIED A. By Faith in Christ
[8]  To be holy, to be separated unto God, we must first believe into Christ Acts 26:18 .
[9]  Christ offered Himself as the sacrifice to redeem us from our sins, shedding His blood to repurchase us 1 Cor 6:20; Acts 20:28 , that we may be sanctified Heb 13:12 .
[10]  B. In the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[11]  First Corinthians 6:11 says, But you were sanctified...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[12]  LESSON THIRTY-NINE REDEMPTION 4 JUSTIFICATION OUTLINE Man not justified by works.
[13]  Galatians 2:16b says, We also have believed in Christ Jesus that we might be justified by the faith of Christ.
[14]  We have been justified objectively, positionally, by God s grace, through the redemption of Christ Jesus, and by our faith.
[15]  LESSON FORTY REDEMPTION 5 RECONCILIATION OUTLINE The need for reconciliation: Man being an enemy of God.
[16]  Man needs to be reconciled to God because he is a son of disobedience and a child of wrath.
[17]  Ephesians 2:2-3 shows us that before God fallen men are sons of disobedience and children of wrath.
[18]  Since man s relationship with God has fallen to such a state, he truly needs to be redeemed and reconciled to God that he may have a thorough change toward God.
[19]  As a result of our reconciliation to God, we are being saved in life Rom 5:10 .
[20]  When we are reconciled to God, have peace toward Him, enjoy Him, and boast in Him, we are being saved in His life.
[21]  LESSON FORTY-ONE MADE A NEW CREATION 1 BEING REGENERATED OUTLINE The need for regeneration: Man being of the flesh.
[22]  The meaning of regeneration: To be born of God.
[23]  B. For the Entrance into the Kingdom of God
[24]  Man needs to be regenerated that he may enter into the kingdom of God.
[25]  The Lord Jesus said that man must be born anew John 3:7 , for unless a man is born anew, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God John 3:3, 5 .
[26]  Through baptism in water and in the Spirit, the believers in Christ have been regenerated, leaving all the old things of man and entering into the kingdom of God, into the realm of the divine life and the divine ruling John 3:3 , that they may live by God s eternal life in God s eternal kingdom.
[27]  THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF REGENERATION A. According to the Purpose and Mercy
[28]  The Epistle of James tells us that God brought us forth according to His purpose, that we should be a certain firstfruit of His creatures.
[29]  Through this seed of life, God s word of life, God imparts the divine life into us, regenerating us to be the firstfruit of the new creation to participate in His new creation 2 Cor 5:17 , that we may be filled with the vigorous life that matures first for the realization of His eternal purpose.
[30]  LESSON FORTY-TWO MADE A NEW CREATION 2 RECEIVING THE HOLY SPIRIT
[31]  AND HAVING THE ETERNAL LIFE OUTLINE Receiving the Holy Spirit: As the essential Spirit.
[32]  First, the Spirit of life comes into our spirit to make our spirit life v. 10 . Then He spreads from our spirit into our mind to make our mind a mind of life v. 6 . Finally, He imparts this life even into our mortal bodies to make the body of death a body of life v. 11 . Thus the Spirit of life fills our entire being, including our spirit, soul, and body, sanctifying us and conforming us to the image of the firstborn Son of God v. 29 that we may become the many sons of God to be His corporate expression.
[33]  The Holy Spirit is not only the seal within us but also the pledge of the divine inheritance Eph 1:14; 2 Cor 1:22b; 5:5b .
[34]  For us to be God s inheritance, the sealing of the Holy Spirit is needed; for God to be our inheritance, the pledging of the Holy Spirit is required.
[35]  As the pledge of our inheritance, the Spirit is not only a guarantee, assuring us that all that God is and all that God has shall be our inheritance, but He is also a foretaste of what we shall inherit of all that God is to us.
[36]  Therefore, as the seal, the Holy Spirit forms the divine elements into an impression in us for God s expression; as the pledge, He gives us a foretaste as a sample and guarantee of the full taste of God.
[37]  The Bible shows us that the matter of having the eternal life and enjoying the blessing of the eternal life is divided into three different periods having eternal life in the present age, having eternal life in the coming age, and enjoying eternal life in the eternal age.
[38]  That we have eternal life is assured by the Word of God.
[39]  First John 5:13 says, I write these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe in the name of the Son of God.
[40]  This verse indicates that the written words of the Scriptures are the assurance to the believers, who believe into the name of the Son of God, that they have eternal life.
[41]  We are assured and have the pledge by these words that because we believe into the name of the Son of God we have eternal life, and we know that we have it now.
[42]  THE RESULTS OF BEING RENEWED A. Becoming a New Creation
[43]  Since by being renewed we have received the divine essence of the new creation, we are made a new creation.
[44]  The old creation is our old man in Adam Eph 4:22 , our natural being by birth, without the divine life and nature; the new creation is the new man in Christ Eph 4:24 , our being which is regenerated by the Spirit John 3:6 , having God s life and the divine nature John 3:16; 2 Pet 1:4 , with Christ as its constituents Col 3:10-11 .
[45]  When a believer is regenerated, receives the Holy Spirit, obtains God s eternal life, and is renewed by the Holy Spirit, he is transferred out of the authority of the darkness of Satan into the kingdom of the Son of God s love, out of Adam into Christ, from law to grace, and out of the evil and crooked age into Christ and the church.
[46]  THE RESULTS OF BEING TRANSFERRED A. Out of Darkness into Light
[47]  Both Acts 26:18 and 1 Peter 2:9 point out that God has transferred His believers out of darkness into light.
[48]  F. Out of the Evil Age into Christ and the Church
[49]  Through such a transfer the believers have been transferred out of the evil and crooked age, that is, the religious age, into Christ and the church.
[50]  Galatians 1:4 says, Who Christ gave Himself for our sins, that He might rescue us out of the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father.
[51]  LESSON FORTY-FIVE MADE A NEW CREATION 5 BEING FREED OUTLINE Concerning sin: Freed from sins.
[52]  Freed from the power of sin: Having the real freedom.
[53]  When we are delivered from the power of sin, we no longer serve sin as slaves.
[54]  When God created man, man had only the physical body, not the flesh.
[55]  LESSON FORTY-SIX SALVATION OUTLINE The source of salvation: God s love.
[56]  The work of salvation which God accomplished in His divine Trinity is firstly of God the Father 2 Thes 2:13 .
[57]  God the Father chose us from the beginning; that is, before the foundation of the world and in His sovereign ordination, He foreknew, chose, and predestinated us to receive His salvation.
[58]  Since He is the origin and source of salvation, it is of God the Father that we are saved.
[59]  Furthermore, the Spirit washes and renews us in the divine element to make us a new creation with the divine nature that, having been justified by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we may become heirs of God in His eternal life Titus 3:7 , inheriting all that the Triune God is to us.
[60]  This is God s new beginning, in which He calls men out of the created Adamic race and transfers them into the called Abrahamic race, and out of the life of the old creation into the life of the new creation, that the believers may come out of darkness and enter into the marvelous light of God, out of the death-realm of Satan s darkness into the life-realm of God s marvelous light, and become a people made holy unto God.
[61]  We are saved also through our union with the Triune God.
[62]  After we repent, believe, and are baptized, we are joined to the processed Triune God.
[63]  Through our union with God the Father we have His divine life and nature, being related to Him in life and joined to Him in nature, thus producing an organic union.
[64]  Through our union with God the Son we have been put in Him and He in us; thus we have become one with Him, sharing with Him the same life, nature, living, and activities.
[65]  And through our union with God the Spirit we have received Him into us essentially for our existence, being, life, and living; we also have received Him as the Spirit of power upon us economically for our spiritual work and function.
[66]  OF SALVATION OUTLINE Receiving salvation at the moment of believing: Being redeemed.
[67]  B. By the Spirit s Witnessing with Our Spirit
[68]  The assurance of our salvation is based on the Spirit s witnessing with our spirit Rom 8:16 .
[69]  We not only have the Word of God outside of us confirming the fact that we have been saved, but we also have the Spirit within us witnessing with our spirit that we are the children of God and that God is our Father.
[70]  Therefore, since we enjoy calling God Abba, Father, and do it spontaneously, even with a sweet and comfortable sensation, this proves that we have God s life and are children begotten of God.
[71]  Romans 11:29 says that the calling of God is irrevocable.
[72]  Since God s calling comes out of His invariable being and is according to His unchanging will, it is irrevocable and unalterable.
[73]  It is because of His love that God gave His only begotten Son, the Lord Jesus, to us to be our Savior John 3:16 , and it is by the grace of God that the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption for us Heb 2:9 .
[74]  If the Lord Jesus had not satisfied God s righteous requirement on our behalf, even though, because of His love, God desires to grant us the grace of forgiveness, He could not forgive us or justify us, because that would make Him unrighteous.
[75]  Moreover, our salvation is secured by the invariable God, by God s unchanging will, by God s inseparable love, by God s irrevocable calling, by God s unchallengeable justification, by God s almighty hand, by God s eternal life, by God s new covenant, by Christ s perfect, complete, and eternal redemption, by Christ s eternal salvation, by Christ s almighty hand, and by Christ s unfailing promise.
[76]  LESSON FORTY-EIGHT THE CLEARANCE OF THE PAST OUTLINE The relationship between the clearance of the past and salvation: Clearance of the past not being a requirement for salvation.
[77]  Clearance of the past being an issue of the enjoyment of salvation.
[78]  Clearance of the past being needed for a better Christian life.
[79]  The clearance of the past is not according to the demand of outward regulations but according to the moving of the Spirit within.
[80]  A third example of the clearance of the past is seen in the case of Zaccheus, in his restoring of what he owed others.
[81]  As soon as he was saved, Zaccheus said to the Lord that if he had taken anything from anyone by false accusations, he would restore four times as much Luke 19:8 .
[82]  The extent of clearance of the past is the life and peace spoken of in Romans 8:6.
