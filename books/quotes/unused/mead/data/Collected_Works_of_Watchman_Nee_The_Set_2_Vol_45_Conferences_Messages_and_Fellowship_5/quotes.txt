[2]  Volume 45 of The Collected Works contains the last half of Section Fourteen and Section Fifteen, which include various messages given by Watchman Nee in 1940 and 1941.
[3]  Section Fourteen, including chapters one hundred fourteen through one hundred fifty-three, contains the record of mid-week meetings, Lord's Day morning meetings, fellowship with new believers, and other fellowship given by Watchman Nee mostly in Shanghai in 1940.
[4]  Chapters one hundred fourteen through one hundred twenty-three are included in Volume 44.
[5]  Editor's Note: The following seven messages on the subject of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob appear to be notes taken from conference meetings and resemble the messages in Volume 35, The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[6]  IN HIS OFFERING UP ISAAC Date: February 4, 1940
[7]  If Isaac had been put on the altar and burned, would not God's promise have been burned as well?
[8]  Scripture Reading: Gal 4:29; 5:1; James 2:20-24; Gen 21:8-10; 22:1-2, 5, 16-18
[9]  "The God of Abraham" shows that God is the Father and that man's natural constitution and the flesh need to be dealt with.
[10]  The victory of Christ is unlimited, but man-made victory is artificial and limited.
[11]  Many people can overcome to a certain extent by their own power, but beyond that point they can no longer overcome.
[12]  The first section was the time of God's disciplining, and the second section was the time of God's constitution.
[13]  Seventh, from his encounter with God in his dream during his escape to his uncle, Laban, we see that he feared God, but he did not remember God's promise.
[14]  Scripture Reading: Gen 15:1-4; 16:1, 15; 1 Cor 2:14; 3:11-12; Gal 4:23, 29; Heb 4:12
[15]  A man must have God's light before he can see his true condition.
[16]  Discernment is not an exercise of our outward mentality; it comes through the enlightening of God within.
[17]  First Corinthians 2:14 says, "But a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him and he is not able to know them because they are discerned spiritually."
[18]  THE NATURAL LIFE, THE OLD MAN, AND THE FRUIT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT Date: 1940
[19]  The natural life is the life that is created by God, while the old man is man's life after the fall.
[20]  God appointed two ministries in the Old Testament the priesthood and the prophethood.
[21]  God's children are those who are joined to Christ.
[22]  If a man is not joined to Christ, salvation counts for nothing, and the Christian life means nothing.
[23]  Before you became a Christian, you felt unhappy and angry when others criticized you.
[24]  But after you become a Christian, you begin to realize that you are not really that good.
[25]  Many people try as hard as they can to escape from a sinful living, yet they discover that sin tenaciously holds on to them.
[26]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-FOUR TALKS 1 Date: October 29, 1940
[27]  Sister Ruth Lee asked: What is the difference between buffeting our bodies and asceticism?
[28]  Paul said that he had learned to be content in whatever circumstances he was in. How did he deal with his body?
[29]  Faith should be a very spontaneous thing in a believer.
[30]  One should not need to exercise any effort to believe.
[31]  If a man has to strive and struggle to believe, his faith is not genuine.
[32]  One brother testified that when he was a young believer, he had to exert considerable effort to believe.
[33]  Today believers should pray to God in a very ordinary way, and God answers their prayers in a very ordinary way.
[34]  OF THE SONS OF GOD The Record of a Talk with Newly Baptized Believers Date: November 1, 1940
[35]  When a person is born or even after he is one or two years old, he does not know who he is and what his name is.
[36]  But the amazing thing is that when he grows up, he spontaneously knows his name, who his parents are, and where he lives.
[37]  It will be a big problem if he does not know who he is or if he becomes lost in the streets and cannot tell others who his father is, where he lives, and what his name is.
[38]  When we dwell in the light, we have no problem with God whatsoever.
[39]  But 1 John 3:14 says that we know we have passed from death to life because we love the brothers.
[40]  But Christians can do this, because we are not only "comrades" with common interests or men given to a common cause; we are those who love the brothers and sisters and who can love one another from our heart.
[41]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX THE LAW OF LIFE Date: November 2, 1940
[42]  Scripture Reading: Rom 7:18 8:2 THE POWER OF LIFE OR THE LAW OF LIFE
[43]  After a person is saved, he can have two different kinds of realizations about the new life he has received.
[44]  If we can sin effortlessly through the law of sin, we can surely live righteously through the law of life.
[45]  Yet in actual experience, many Christians do not believe that God is in us as a law.
[46]  If I let go of my keys and at the same time try my best to push them downward, this means that I do not believe in the force of gravity.
[47]  Once the man-child is raptured to His throne, there will be war in heaven, and Satan will be cast onto the earth Rev 12:5-9 .
[48]  If any Christian today wants to participate in this rapture, he has to be watchful and ready for the rapture by the Lord.
[49]  If he does, he will have a share in this greatest work of God.
[50]  God created man from the dust of the earth as a vessel to contain Him.
[51]  This means that His life must shine out of man like a light.
[52]  The appearance of a lamp is not crucial, but it is crucial for light to shine out from it.
[53]  Once Brother Luan was working in a certain place in Southeast Asia.
[54]  He felt within that he should leave, and he even had a dream that he should leave.
[55]  He had planned to leave at 6:00 p.m., but he eventually changed his mind and agreed to leave at 9:00 p.m. But when he was about to leave, the government sent men to him and he could no longer leave.
[56]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-NINE WORLD WARS AND THE CHURCH Date: November 9, 1940
[57]  Scripture Reading: Matt 24:4-14; Acts 4:25; Heb 11:5-6
[58]  Many people pay attention to the signs of the end times.
[59]  Answer: Man can know God's will in three ways.
[60]  Third, God may have a will, yet He may not reveal it directly at all, instead relying fully on others to make it known.
[61]  THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD OF GOD
[62]  Only that which issues from the depth will touch others' depth.
[63]  Only the outflow of the indwelling Spirit will touch others.
[64]  The Holy Spirit must operate not only in the speaker, but also in the listener.
[65]  If a church is not living in the Spirit, it is not qualified to receive any deep messages, because it cannot tell the difference.
[66]  The only thing that will give light and life to men is revelation from God.
[67]  BEING SPIRIT AND LIFE Date: November 13, 1940, midweek
[68]  I know that some of you who are sitting here tonight do not need my word, but I hope that I am not mistaken in my leading.
[69]  When a brother stands up to speak, others can tell whether he knows doctrines or life.
[70]  If he speaks doctrines, he has to be cautious about what he speaks.
[71]  Many people carefully word their speaking; there is no danger of making any errors.
[72]  God's Word is merely theological knowledge to many people; it is not life to them.
[73]  But the Lord says that His word is spirit and life.
[74]  In reading a book or listening to a sermon, we can tell immediately whether we have touched spirit and life within or whether we have touched the mind.
[75]  In Romans 7:21 Paul said, "I find then the law with me."
[76]  The statistics of sin are the cumulative experiences of all our sins.
[77]  When they are exhibited before our eyes, we can do nothing but bow down and confess our failure.
[78]  Scripture Reading: 2 Pet 1:1; 1 Cor 1:30; Phil 3:9 INTRODUCTION
[79]  We have already seen that a saved person should know a few things.
[80]  First, he should know that he is a son of God.
[81]  Now we want to consider the difference between the righteousness of Christ and Christ as our righteousness.
[82]  But the Bible does not say that we are saved by the righteousness of Christ or that the righteousness of Christ has become our righteousness.
[83]  Only when we come to Romans 6 do we see that we are joined to Him in the likeness of His death and resurrection v. 5 . Therefore, a Christian does not become righteous in the eyes of God through the righteousness of Christ, but through Christ Himself.
[84]  The robe of righteousness is a good illustration, yet it is not a perfect illustration.
[85]  In the Old Testament, Jacob cheated his father in order to receive his blessing.
[86]  Jacob's brother was a hairy man, but he was a smooth man.
[87]  This is not the way Christians come before God.
[88]  Brother Yu Cheng-hwa asked: How can we practice the teachings of Matthew 5?
[89]  In our daily life we still live very much by the natural life and the flesh.
[90]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE CHRIST OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS, SANCTIFICATION, AND REDEMPTION Date: December 1, 1940, mid-week meeting
[91]  Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:30; Col 3:4; John 8:24, 28
[92]  Spiritual deliverance is the result of seeing; it is not the result of hearing.
[93]  Other than Christ, God has not given anything to man.
[94]  But it is strange that even though man claims that he knows this fact and has heard it already, he may still hold on to many things apart from Christ.
[95]  As far as we know, all the teachings on sanctification take sanctification as a moral virtue, an act, or an inward condition.
[96]  They all consider sanctification to be a thing, an object.
[97]  If a person has this kind of concept, it means that he does not know what it means for Christ to be our sanctification.
[98]  Christ is not only our Redeemer; He has become our redemption.
[99]  Not only has He become our sanctification in our inward constitution, He has become our redemption in our outward body.
[100]  Thank the Lord that He is not only our Redeemer; He has become our redemption.
[101]  Hence, our redemption is not just a thing, but a person who is joined to us.
[102]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-SIX POVERTY AND RICHES Date: December 4, 1940
[103]  Many of God's children do not know that they are poor.
[104]  In spiritual matters it is easy to deal with those who are empty, but it is very difficult to deal with the poverty that comes from self-proclaimed riches.
[105]  If all that a Christian knows is that he has embraced the Christian faith and that this is a noble thing to do, I do not believe that such a person can go on in a good way.
[106]  A Christian who does not know that Christ is his life does not know what reality is.
[107]  Many Christians feel ashamed of themselves because they do not have many gifts.
[108]  It is true that some have profound wisdom, quick mentality, power, eloquence, or great faith.
[109]  There is a big difference between gifts and Christ.
[110]  Every Christian, whether or not he is a worker, should have his own work in the church.
[111]  Brother Austin-Sparks used to say, "We can never say if our work is of the Lord, nor can we say how much of our work is of the Lord and how much of it is of ourselves.
[112]  We know only after the work has left our hand."
[113]  I heard this remark from him seven or eight times during the year I stayed in London.
[114]  When a work is no longer in our hand and others criticize it as being not of the Lord, we will feel unhappy, discontented, or uncomfortable.
[115]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-EIGHT SERVING GOD IN HOLINESS
[116]  Scripture Reading: Luke 1:75 THE STARTING POINT OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE
[117]  The first unrighteous thing we have to deal with is money.
[118]  We cannot take someone else's money as our own.
[119]  Not a cent of others' money can be ours, and we cannot borrow that is, personal borrowing, not borrowing in business .
[120]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-NINE A TALK WITH NEW BELIEVERS
[121]  Redemption speaks of the great controversy between God and Satan.
[122]  God used all the firstborn as a type of the whole family, because the firstborn is born at the height of a man's strength.
[123]  For God to kill the firstborn means that everyone is to be killed.
[124]  All those who are lost to God have only one end death.
[125]  Redemption is for God to gain something, whereas salvation is for us to gain something.
[126]  It is coming out of your own house and your own tribe to stand on Moses' side and declare, "I am on the Lord's side."
[127]  There is a definite date when we are saved.
[128]  Just as salvation should not be delayed, our consecration should not be delayed.
[129]  Scripture Reading: Rom 12:1-2; John 15:7; 1 Cor 10:27; Acts 16:3, 6-7, 18; 17:16-17; 20:16 GOD'S WILL BEING DIFFERENT
[130]  If a Christian does not know His will, he is still in darkness.
[131]  When a person is one with the Lord, his will becomes the Lord's will.
[132]  If something is not according to God's will, the Holy Spirit will intervene and give him a feeling of unrest.
[133]  If he does not stop, but insists on doing what he wants to do, he will feel ill at ease and not have any peace.
[134]  God often guides a Christian by his own deliberations and will.
[135]  THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD'S WILL Date: Lord's Day morning, December 15, 1940
[136]  Prayer: Lord, in the past You have not been able to gain much in us.
[137]  Now let us consider our positive union with the Lord.
[138]  In verse 2 the word "mind" in Greek is nous.
[139]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-TWO A TALK WITH THE CO-WORKERS
[140]  The Bible is made up of words, but it is not man's word.
[141]  The Bible records the speaking of Daniel, Isaiah, Paul, etc. These men spoke on behalf of God, but this does not merely mean that God was speaking through Daniel, Isaiah, and Paul.
[142]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-THREE GOD'S SPEAKING FROM THE BUSH Date: December 1940
[143]  When Moses was in Egypt, he was involved in two cases of quarreling Exo 2:11-14 .
[144]  Through these two incidents, God showed him that trusting in the flesh, in carnality, or in man's power was useless.
[145]  I believe that Moses never dreamed that God would call him; he never dreamed that God would grant a revelation to him.
[146]  What Christians need today is a revelation from God.
[147]  They need to see God's accomplished work rather than asking Him to do some new work.
[148]  For Paul the battle was in the proclamation of God's eternal plan.
[149]  Paul prayed for this; He asked the Father to give to the saints in Ephesus a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that they would see that God has accomplished everything.
[150]  In 1925 I was in the midst of publishing the second issue of The Christian, covering Daniel, 2 Thessalonians, and Revelation.
[151]  At that time I was not very knowledgeable concerning the prophecies, and I wrote about them in a very brief way.
[152]  I attached to it a preface and sent it to the printer.
[153]  I felt very good about it and did not have much regret about printing it.
[154]  The greatest temptation they face in trying to know God's will is their constant introspection, self-analysis, and attempt to find what is of God and what is of themselves.
[155]  They want to know what is of the spirit and what is of the soul, what is spiritual and what is carnal.
[156]  In John 13 15 Philip, Peter, Thomas, and Judas asked many questions, but in chapter fourteen the Lord told them that a day would come when they would no longer need to ask anything, because the Holy Spirit would teach them of all things when He came v. 26 . When a person asks questions, this proves that he does not have the presence of the Holy Spirit.
[157]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-SEVEN A TALK Date: February 25, 1941
[158]  Brother Chang asked: First Timothy 6:13 speaks of Christ's testimony before Pilate.
[159]  First, it testified that He was the Son of God.
[160]  Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:8-10 DEALING WITH THE NATURAL LIFE
[161]  We must realize that a Christian possesses everything that he should receive at the time of his regeneration.
[162]  God does not mend the natural life; He does not repair the old life.
[163]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-NINE THE VERDICT OF DEATH 2 Date: November 20, 1941
[164]  Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:8-10 DOCTRINE VERSUS LIGHT
[165]  The verdict of death that we are speaking of here does not refer to death itself; rather, it refers to the reality, inevitability, and unavoidability of the work of death in man.
[166]  This verdict removes man's trust in himself and turns him to God alone.
[167]  But we have two questions: How do we know whether we have received this light, and how do we know whether God has done this work in us?
[168]  We do not have to worry about how God does a work; we only need to worry whether God has spoken.
