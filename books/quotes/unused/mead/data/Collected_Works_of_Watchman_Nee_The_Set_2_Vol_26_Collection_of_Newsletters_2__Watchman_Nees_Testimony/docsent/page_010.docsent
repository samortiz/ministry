   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LETTER OF IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Greetings to my dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In April I sent a letter to Collection of Newsletters with news of the co-working brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today I suddenly saw that it had been published in the Newsletter Paper.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Facts had been deleted and topics had been added.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I was very surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There was no impropriety in the letter I wrote.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But I have not read the Newsletter Paper very carefully this past year.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In fact, I have forgotten the address of the Newsletter Paper.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, I never wrote to it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother Chen Ch'in Fa and I saw this paper at the same time and think that the postman must have given the letter meant for Collection of Newsletters to the Newsletter Paper.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This shows how the enemy will stop at nothing to attack us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I am making this announcement to dispel the doubts of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>May the Lord bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Wang Yu T'ing</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>August 22</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>P.S. There will be a five-day conference in Nan Kang Fan Shan, P'ing Yang from August 29 to September 2.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother Chen Ch'in Fa and I will be responsible for the messages.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We hope that the hungry and thirsty brothers and sisters will be edified.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We hope that the brothers and sisters who are in one accord with us in Shanghai will pray for us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Wang Yu T'ing</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A LETTER FROM SHIH YU FANG TO JAN CH'I YU</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brother Ch'i Yu:</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After you separated from Sze Cheng Chapel, I was not peaceful in my heart day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Pastor Chen Ts'ung Kuei led the meetings in Bethany, I suggested that he go to your place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I was willing to pay his round-trip ticket.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Unfortunately, he did not have the time to go to Hangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He stayed in my home for one night in Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I spoke with him about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He said that you left the denomination too quickly and that it was a pity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before he came, I also wrote a letter to Pastor Cheng Chi Kuei asking his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to what Pastor Chen Ts'ung Kuei says, Pastor Cheng is most opposed to the Little Flock.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He speaks from the Bible and is able to turn you back to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I hope Pastor Cheng can write a letter to you and that he can perhaps come to see you and explain everything in person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am very willing to pay the round-trip travel expenses.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do not know much about the Little Flock, but I feel that you are taking the easy way and are not willing to bear the cross in the church to help the weak brothers more with the strength God has given you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is difficult to make the weak brothers into good ones, but this is your work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The group you have now entered must be very holy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They are all of similar wills.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But who will go to exhort and care for the weaker brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Little Flock only wants better people Christians or more zealous people Christians .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although the organization of the church has many problems and perhaps some errors, it needs some spiritual people like Wesley and Martin Luther to change things through the strength of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Don't you agree?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church has a long history already.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God has already done miracles in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I hope you have a peaceful attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If Pastor Cheng can speak correctly according to the Bible, I hope you can come back to help the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I was planning to come to Hangchow today, but my house is being repaired, so I will go to Hangchow next Friday August 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When I come, I will write again.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Please do not come to the station to meet me; I will go to your house myself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yu Fang</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>July 28 at sundown</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>P.S. Pastor Cheng is in the area of Honan leading some meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He will write an article against the Little Flock which will be published in a gospel magazine.</S>
