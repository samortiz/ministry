   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Man's Body Being Transmuted into Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God created man with a pure body, but something of Satan was received into man's body and man's body changed in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It was transmuted into the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In other words, it was corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man's body, by being corrupted in man's fall, became flesh, full of lust.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Romans 7:18a Paul said, "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The flesh is the corrupted body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Satan Becoming Sin within Man</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through man's eating the tree of knowledge, Satan entered into man and became the very sin within man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To see this point we need to read Romans 7:14b, 17, and 20.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 20 Paul said, "But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that work it out but sin that dwells in me."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans 7, especially in verses 8, 11, 17, and 20, indicates that sin is a person, the embodiment of Satan, and is living and acting within us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sin is a personification of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Actually speaking, the sin within us is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At least we can say that the sinful nature within man is the nature of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The sin within man refers to his inward sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This inward sin is just Satan himself indwelling our corrupted body, that is, our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sin Acting as Evil in Man</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Romans 7:21 Paul says, "I find then the law with me who wills to do the good, that is, the evil is present with me."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Satan entered into man, Satan became sin within man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When this sin acts in man, this sin becomes "the evil."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The evil is the action of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When sin acts in us, it becomes the evil.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The real significance of man's fall is that man received Satan's thought, feeling, and will, Satan's being, Satan's personality, into the inward parts of his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, man's soul became one with Satan's person through man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Also, Satan as sin got into man's body, making man's body the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Satan indwells this flesh as sin, as fallen man's sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When this sin acts, it is the very evil that moves and acts within man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through the fall, man's being, man's personality, man's soul, has been filled with Satan's being, with Satan's personality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Satan dwells in man's body as sin, which acts as the evil.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, through man's fall, man became one with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the reason that the children of men eventually are called in the Bible the children of the devil 1 John 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Fallen man became one with Satan in his personality and in his nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Man and Satan are one, so the children of men actually are the children of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the focus and the real significance of man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to point out that man's fall was a receiving of Satan's being into man's being and a taking of Satan himself into man's body, corrupting man's body and transmuting it into the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>C. Deadening Man's Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Man's fall also resulted in the deadening of his spirit Eph 2:1, 5a .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Ephesians 2:1 says that in our fallen state we were dead in our offenses and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that our spirit was deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be deadened is to have the functions damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The deadness of our spirit pervaded our entire being and caused us to lose the function that enabled us to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, through the fall, man's soul became one with Satan's person, man's body became Satan's dwelling place, and man's spirit was deadened.</S>
