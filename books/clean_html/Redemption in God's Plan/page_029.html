<h2 class="head1">COMING AS THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>On the morning of the day of resurrection the Lord Jesus ascended to heaven. In the evening on that same day He came back as the Spirit and breathed into the disciples, telling them to receive the Holy Spirit (20:17-22). From that time onward, the Lord led the disciples to know Him as the Spirit. As the Spirit, He was no longer limited by time and space like He was when He was with them in the flesh. Then on the day of Pentecost He poured out the Holy Spirit from heaven upon the disciples. The disciples were now filled inwardly and outwardly with the Holy Spirit. They were mingled with the Holy Spirit and could enjoy all that the Lord had accomplished (Acts 2:1-4).</p>
<p>The Lord went into death as a man on the cross in order to accomplish redemption, and He came as the Spirit in order to apply His accomplished redemption. Everything that He accomplished in the flesh is in the Spirit to be applied to us. He went as a man, and He came again as the Spirit so that all His accomplishments in the flesh could be applied to us. In the Spirit we can contact and receive all that the Lord accomplished.</p>
<p>We receive the Lord in the Spirit. When He was in the flesh, He could be contacted, but He could not be received by man. Even though He was among man, He could not enter into man. He could render help to man, but He could not enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life and everything. God was incarnated to be the man Jesus Christ, and now the Lord is the Spirit, who is God (John 4:24; 2 Cor. 3:17). Just as everything of God is in Christ, everything of Christ is in the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING<br />
THE TRANSFIGURATION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Christ is the embodiment of God, and the Spirit is the transfiguration of Christ. Christ is the image of God, and the Spirit is Christ in another form. Christ is the impress of God&rsquo;s substance (Heb. 1:3), and the Spirit is the reality of Christ (John 14:17-20). The fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily (Col. 2:9), and all that Christ is and has is in the Spirit (John 16:13-15). God is manifested in Christ (1:18), and Christ is revealed in the Spirit (15:26). God was embodied in Christ in order to be among man, to be seen by man, and to be contacted by man. Christ was transfigured in His resurrection as the Spirit in order to enter into man and to be received by man. God was embodied in Christ in order to be man&rsquo;s Savior, and Christ was transfigured as the Spirit in order to become man&rsquo;s salvation. Just as man needs to know Christ in order to know God, man needs to know the Spirit in order to know Christ. Just as man cannot find God outside of Christ, man cannot touch Christ apart from the Spirit. Just as man must be in Christ in order to contact God (14:6), man must be in the Spirit in order to experience Christ. A person must receive Christ in order to receive God, and a person must receive the Spirit in order to receive Christ. A person who does not believe in Christ does not believe in God, and a person who does not have the Spirit does not have Christ. He who is unto Christ is unto God, and he who belongs to the Spirit belongs to Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING GOD&rsquo;S CONSUMMATE FORM</h2>
<p>As the eternal Father who dwells in unapproachable light (Isa. 9:6; 1 Tim. 6:16), God cannot be contacted. However, He desires to have a relationship with man. Therefore, He came out of unapproachable light in incarnation: He became flesh, revealing Himself in humanity. He had the form of man in order to be near men and to be contacted by men. God was manifested in the Son (John 1:18), Jesus Christ, in order to be among men and to contact men. He put on a body of blood and flesh; He possessed the human life, nature, and image; and He was exactly the same as man yet without sin (Heb. 4:15). In the form of a man He tasted everything of human life, and on behalf of man He accomplished everything needed for man to have a relationship with Him. However, as a man in the flesh, He could not enter into man, be received by man, or become man&rsquo;s everything in order for man to be joined with Him. Therefore, through death and resurrection He became the Spirit&mdash;He changed His form&mdash;so that He might contact man. The Spirit is God&rsquo;s consummate form in His relationship with man. As the Spirit, He can be contacted, and He can also enter into man and be gained by man. Hence, man may have His life, nature, and image and thus be joined with Him as one, just as He put on humanity and was joined with man, having the human life, nature, and image.</p>
<p>Just as the God who dwells in unapproachable light cannot be contacted by man, the God who was incarnated as a man in the flesh could not be received by man. Light is a limiting factor in eternity, and the flesh was a limiting factor in time and space. The light limits His contact with man because of His glory, and the flesh limited His contact with man because of His physical body. In order to be among men, He had to break through the limiting factor of His dwelling in unapproachable light in glory. Likewise, in order to enter into man, He had to break through the limiting factor of the flesh.</p>
<p>Although God came out from unapproachable light in order to be in the midst of man and to be contacted by man, He was limited in the flesh and not able to enter into man to be received by man. When He was incarnated, He broke through the limiting factor of His glory, but He entered into the limiting factor of the flesh. Hence, He had to go through death and resurrection in order to break through the physical limitation of the flesh and enter into spiritual freedom (2 Cor. 3:17). In order to be received by man, He had to come to man in another form. In His first coming He was incarnated as the man Jesus Christ. In His second coming to man on the day of His resurrection, He was the omnipresent Spirit. This is His second form. The Spirit is the consummate form of God in His appearing to man. As the Spirit, God has attained His purpose in man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING ALL SPIRITUAL REALITY</h2>
<p>As the transfiguration of Christ and God&rsquo;s consummate form, every spiritual reality is in the Spirit. The Lord Jesus referred to the Spirit as &ldquo;the Spirit of reality&rdquo; (John 14:17). God is in Christ, and Christ has been transfigured as the Spirit. Hence, the Spirit is every spiritual reality. All that God is and has is in Christ, and Christ is the Spirit. Hence, the Spirit is the reality of all that God is in Christ. Because God is in Christ and Christ is the Spirit, the Spirit is all spiritual reality.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the reality of God and the reality of Christ. Hence, the Lord referred to the Spirit as the Spirit of reality and also said that this Spirit would guide us into all the reality (16:13). <em>All the reality</em> refers to everything that God is in Christ, that is, everything that God desires to impart into us and for us to gain in Christ. The Lord Jesus is the reality (14:6), and reality came through Him (1:17). He became a man for the purpose of bringing reality to man. In order for man to receive this reality, it must be applied through the Spirit; that is, the Lord had to become the Spirit. Hence, the Lord brought reality with Him, and when He was transfigured into the Spirit, He became the Spirit of reality to guide us into all the reality.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the reality of all spiritual matters. Every spiritual matter is in the Spirit. If we have the Spirit, we have every spiritual matter, but without the Spirit, we do not have spiritual reality. When the Spirit is present, reality is present, and when the Spirit is absent, reality is absent. With the Spirit everything is real, but without the Spirit everything is merely doctrine.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THAT GOD IS AND HAS BEING IN THE SPIRIT<br />
FOR MAN TO RECEIVE</h2>
<p>All that God is and all that He has are given to man in Christ and received by man in the Spirit. Everything that God is and has can be given to man only in Christ. However, in order for man to receive God, Christ had to become the Spirit. God has sent the Spirit into the world to reach all those who would believe in the Lord so that the Spirit can enter into man and be received by man.</p>
<p>The Spirit is like radio waves in the air. When we tune a radio to a specific frequency, we can receive the sound being emitted through the radio waves. In the Spirit we can contact, receive, and experience all that God is and has and all that Christ is and has accomplished. We can contact God only in the Spirit, and we can believe in, receive, and experience Christ only in the Spirit. Every spiritual experience can be received in the Spirit because God and all that He is and has are in the Spirit.</p>
<p>God was incarnated as a man, Jesus Christ, in order to be manifested in the flesh to accomplish redemption for us. In resurrection Jesus Christ, the incarnated God, was transfigured as the Spirit in order to come into us. Hence, at any time and in any place God is able to work Himself and all His accomplishments into us so that we can receive Him, be joined to Him, and become one with Him. The manifestation of God in the flesh is precious, but Christ&rsquo;s coming as the Spirit is more real to us. The early disciples knew the preciousness of God&rsquo;s presence in the flesh, but only later did they recognize the value of His presence as the Spirit of reality (Acts 1:3-4, 8). May we not only value the manifestation of God in the flesh but also appreciate His coming as the Spirit of reality. God is waiting for us to receive and enjoy everything that He is and has for us in the Spirit of reality.</p>
