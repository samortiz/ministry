   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hospitable</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Another qualification of an overseer is that he must be hospitable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hospitality requires love, care for people, and endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All these virtues are required if one is to qualify to be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nothing is more bothersome than giving hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hospitality tests the qualifications of elders.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The principle of hospitality is giving without receiving; it is suffering without requiring anything in return.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hospitality means sacrifice with joy, but without recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>An elder must have a heart and a spirit for such hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Apt to Teach</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 2 Paul says that an elder should be apt to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To teach here is similar to parents teaching their children.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>An elder must be apt to render this kind of home teaching to the members of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a parent has not received a proper education, it will be difficult for him to teach his children.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Likewise, if the elders would be apt to teach, they need to be knowledgeable.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, an elder should be able to explain what the mystery of Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a brother is not knowledgeable concerning the truth, he is disqualified from the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>An elder should be able to teach the saints like a parent helps a child with his homework.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, this does not mean that every elder should be a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not necessary for parents to be teachers in order to help their children with homework.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Similarly, not all elders are teachers, but they all should be apt to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not an Excessive Drinker</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verse 3 Paul lists other qualifications: "Not an excessive drinker, not a striker, but forbearing, not contentious, not fond of money."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When Paul says that an elder should not be an excessive drinker, he, of course, has in mind not an excessive drinker of wine.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, the principle here is that an elder should not be excessive in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This requires strong self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the matters of food and clothing, for example, an elder should not be excessive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This tests his ability to exercise self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>9.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not a Striker</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The next requirement, "not a striker," is related to the control of one's temper.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This implies a strong restraint of the temper.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>An elder should be one who does not lose his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>10.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Forbearing</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be forbearing is to be yielding, gentle, mild, reasonable, and considerate in dealing with others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is to deal with people without strictness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>11.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not Contentious</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>An elder should not be contentious.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He should not be quarrelsome; rather, he should be peaceable and not debate with others or contend with them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even if someone comes to fight with him, he should not fight back, but should learn not to be contentious.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>12.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not Fond of Money</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>An elder should not be fond of money.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Money is a test to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>An elder must be pure in money matters, especially since the church fund is under the elders' management Acts 11:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>An elder must realize that the money which passes through his hands is not for his personal gain.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He should not have even the thought of monetary gain.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>13.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Managing Well His Own Household</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In verses 4 and 5 Paul goes on to say, "One who manages well his own household, having his children in subjection with all gravity; but if anyone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>" Managing well his own household is a proof that one is qualified to take the oversight of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>An elder should exercise to manage his household well and maintain it in good order.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is clear that anyone who does not know how to manage his own household cannot take care of the church of God.</S>
