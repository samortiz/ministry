        <h2 class="head1">GENUINE FRUIT BEING WITH GENUINE BLENDING</h2>
<p>The extent of the blending among the brothers in each locality will determine the extent of the work in that locality. If there is no blending, the work will be on the same level of the work in a denomination. The depth of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s work in a locality depends on how much the brothers are blended in one spirit. Merely learning skillful cultivation and tolerance is useless; we must be blendable in spirit. It is certainly not good to quarrel, but if we cannot be blended in spirit, tolerating one another will still not yield any fruit. At the best there will only be some superficial damage. Genuine fruit depends on genuine blending.</p>
<p>Today the Lord&rsquo;s way is not with spiritual giants but with every brother and every sister, because each one is a member in the Lord&rsquo;s Body. It is a fact that some members have more function in the Body, but there are no giants in the Body. In the Body everyone is a member, and every member must be blended. Whether or not a church manifests a condition of being built up and coordinated together depends entirely upon whether the brothers can be blended in spirit. Without being blended in spirit, our messages and fellowship are completely useless. Having fellowship in spirit, being blended in spirit, entering into the feeling of the Body, and spreading the work according to the feeling in the Body are the most important matters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BLENDING BEING THE LIFE PULSE<br />
FOR THE CHURCH TO GO FORWARD</h2>
<p>Blending is the life pulse of the church in its going forward. If the brothers in every locality cannot be blended, it will be very difficult to advance to have a deeper work. Being blended is not a matter of giving people doctrines. If the brothers can only present doctrines when they meet in a locality, they will only promote doctrines. Rather than presenting doctrines, we should have fellowship and contact with others in spirit, supplying life to them in the spirit so that they may see something.</p>
<p>We must first be blended with one another in spirit. Then we should have much fellowship to bring everyone into the spirit for a deeper seeing. The brothers and sisters will slowly see the same vision and enter into the feeling of the Body. If we only talk about new methods or new doctrines, we will incite opinions, which some will approve of and others will oppose. We must avoid causing this problem. The brothers should not go to various localities to promote doctrines but to look to the Lord to supply the saints with life and to help them see what the Lord wants today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING FACTIOUS OR INSISTENT</h2>
<p>Moreover, we should never boast in anything. Even if we truly see something and are blended in one spirit, we should not form a faction, saying, &ldquo;We are those who have seen something.&rdquo; Instead of doing this, we should have fellowship in one spirit with the brothers and sisters. We should not promote new doctrines but help people to be supplied in life and to know the Lord&rsquo;s way. We can have fellowship in the prayer meetings or the bread-breaking meetings, sharing little by little, wholly according to life, which will not be a movement but a mutual flow of life.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s work and in leading the church, anyone who insists on an opinion is not in the spirit. Even if a person has a right opinion, he is not in the spirit if he insists upon it. In the work and in leading the church, there can only be the fellowship of the Body, not the insistence on personal opinions. I fully believe that even the apostle Paul was not insistent on his opinions. I hope that we will all pay attention to this matter and be in the fellowship rather than being insistent.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING SEPARATE LANGUAGE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Some have asked if the church in a certain locality should separate into Mandarin-speaking and Taiwanese-speaking meetings. All the serving ones in that locality must seek the feeling of the Body in a spirit of fellowship. Any insistence is wrong. Those who are serving together must seek the feeling of the Body, the feeling in spirit.</p>
<p>Given that human societies have different languages, we need to try our best to thoroughly understand different languages in order to remove the language barrier. Concerning separating meetings into Taiwanese-speaking and Mandarin-speaking, we have had problems before and have learned some lessons. Over twenty years ago in Taipei, the majority of the people were Taiwanese, and many did not understand Mandarin. So we established a Taiwanese-speaking meeting. At the same time we were trying our best to help localities buy land for the construction of meeting halls. We bought a piece of land in Taipei and built a meeting hall for Taiwanese-speaking meetings. I truly regretted doing that then, because it was wholly according to man&rsquo;s weakness. As a result, it did not bring in any blessing; instead, it became a source of corruption and death.</p>
<p>After we established a meeting hall for Taiwanese-speaking meetings, two brothers were tempted by the devil and greatly contended with each other to be first. They even came to me to accuse each other on separate occasions. Thus, the meeting hall for Taiwanese-speaking meetings soon came to an end. It has been nearly three decades since we came to Taiwan. Today everyone who is thirty years old has an education based on the Mandarin language, and almost everyone who is forty understands Mandarin. With the exception of very rural areas, the number of people in their forties or fifties who do not understand Mandarin is very small. Hence, there is no need to establish a Taiwanese-speaking meeting hall. Having separate meeting halls according to geographic areas is according to the truth, but establishing separate meeting halls according to language is unfitting.</p>
<p>I have spoken to the Chinese brothers and sisters in America very seriously, saying, &ldquo;If you have never learned English and do not understand English, then it is understandable for you to speak Chinese. However, if you have graduated from college and even received a doctorate degree in America, you should speak English. Furthermore, if you want to invite people to eat in Chinatown, you should not just invite Chinese brothers and sisters but all the brothers and sisters in the church. Although it is not easy, you should speak English and blend with the English-speaking saints, because you have come to live in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most important matter among us is oneness. When I started working in the United States, my work was not with the Chinese. However, because some brothers and sisters did not understand English, the church in Los Angeles provided radios and earphones for the saints to listen to translation in the meetings. I cannot forget the lessons that we learned in Taipei twenty years ago; establishing a meeting place for another language opens a back door for Satan.</p>
<p>If no one understands Mandarin and all the saints speak Taiwanese, then meetings in Taiwanese are perfectly justified. When we preach the gospel in the mountainous areas, we should certainly speak the languages of the indigenous peoples, especially if no one understands Mandarin. But in the big cities, everyone has a Mandarin education; consequently, there is no need to establish a Taiwanese-speaking meeting. After the church was formed on the day of Pentecost, the first contention occurred between the Hellenists and the Hebrews (Acts 6:1). Language problems can cause trouble, so we must be careful. The important thing is to maintain the oneness of the church and to cautiously guard against any Satan-initiated contentions related to language. We are one in Christ today. All the brothers should turn to the spirit and have fellowship and prayer together to be led together for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony in the church.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
