   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD CASTING FIRE ON THE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verses 49 and 50 of Luke 12 are two of the most precious verses in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They are also among the hardest verses to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we were to nominate four or five of the most puzzling passages in the New Testament, these two verses would be among them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 49 the Lord said, "I have come to cast fire on the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord told His listeners that He came to the earth with a specific purpose to cast fire on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is this fire?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is not a fire that is produced by ordinary matches, but a fire that is apart from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, I may throw my hymnbook on the chair.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that the hymnbook was not on the chair but was thrown onto it from elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord said that He came to cast fire on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Where did this fire come from?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It came from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is this fire?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The book of Hebrews tells us that our God is a consuming fire 12:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In many instances in the Bible, fire signifies God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His life is righteous and holy, and it is like a fire.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jesus said that His purpose for coming to the earth was to cast God's life on it and to give God's life to man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the time He spoke such a word, man did not have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is why He said, "How I wish that it were already kindled!"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Luke 12:49 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that He wished that man would receive His life that very day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yet man did not receive it, because "I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!" v. 50 . The Lord told us that the fire was not kindled because He still had a baptism to be baptized with.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is puzzling.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Was not Christ already baptized?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Luke 3 clearly records that He was baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What does baptism in this verse mean?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In reading Romans 6 and Colossians 2, we see that this baptism signifies death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For Christ to say that a baptism was still waiting to be accomplished meant that He had not yet died.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Luke 12:50 does not say that He had not been baptized; rather, it says that there was a baptism which still needed to be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why did such a baptism need to be accomplished?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To accomplish something means that there is a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Suppose you want to do a certain work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After you have done the work, you have accomplished it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ's death was for the purpose of accomplishing one thing God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since He had not yet died, the fire was not yet kindled.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These two verses tell us that Christ came to cast God's life to the earth and to give man His life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before Christ died, man had not received that life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After He died, man received this life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Without His death, this life could not have been released, and man could not have received it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why did Christ have to die before man could have His life?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The reason is provided in the following words: "How I am pressed."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The word pressed in the original language means "squeezed, constrained."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ said that He had a baptism to be baptized with, and He was pressed, or constrained, until it was accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Why was He constrained?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was the divine life itself, and He was like the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This life filled the universe and was not bound or restricted by time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His life was omnipresent and omnipotent.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It was everywhere and existed at all times.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This life was like a fire.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It kept on spreading; no one could lock it up, and no place was big enough to contain it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although Christ was equal with God, He became a man and confined this great life to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Such a tremendous life was contained in the flesh, which was limited by time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When He was in Caesarea Philippi, He could not be in Capernaum; He could not be everywhere at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This flesh might have appeared in Galilee one day and in Judea the next, but it could not be in both places at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God's life was restricted by time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is why He felt pressed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>His outward flesh had locked up His omnipresent and omnipotent life like a prisoner; it was no longer free.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>How pressed the omnipresent life was!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What could the Lord do but be pressed?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He was pressed because He had not died.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After He died and resurrected, He was no longer pressed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, there is a different aspect to the death of Christ, one in which He shed His body and released God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the baptism He was about to go through.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This aspect of the Lord's death freed Him from the outward prison and released the fire, through which man received His life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the non-redemptive aspect of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is different from the blood and the crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the Bible this aspect of His death is signified by His flesh John 6:54 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Because of the limitation of time, I can only give a brief foundational word to show you the aspect of Christ's death which involves the release of His life.</S>
