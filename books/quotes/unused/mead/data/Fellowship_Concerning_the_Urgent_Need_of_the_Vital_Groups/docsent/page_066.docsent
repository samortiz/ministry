   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PAYING THE PRICE TO BE VITAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In light of the present situation we are in, what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have studied our situation thoroughly and I feel that nothing can attract and move the present middle-aged American Caucasians unless they see the vitality among us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To be vital means to be living and active.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a group of people are meeting together and are a real vital group living and active whoever comes in and sees this will be convinced.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we are so vital and some seeking ones come in among us, they will be caught by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Vitality is the most convincing factor.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we do not have vital groups, we will have no prevailing way to gain the middle-class Caucasians.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we are vital, sooner or later, in our neighborhood and among our relatives, colleagues, classmates, and friends, we will meet some seeking ones.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The seeking ones care for our vitality, for our being living and active.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The truth has an amount of influence with people, but it depends upon who passes on the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you are a vital person, the truth will be effective.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you are not a vital person, others will not be convinced.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They will think that you just have some good talk but are really no different than they are.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we bring some new ones to our meeting, and our meeting is dormant, we will not convince them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the reason that we are stressing the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not have the vital groups, we will still survive as the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We will still exist, but there will not be much hope of getting the typical American increase.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The only convincing factor we could have is the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are not vital, we are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since we love the Lord and we are for the Lord s recovery, what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to be vital at any cost.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must learn diligently and practice absolutely to be vital; then there is much possibility for us to gain a good number of the seeking ones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These seeking ones caught by us will spread the news.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They will say, I am now meeting in a group full of vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Come and see.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This kind of news will not be appreciated by the general Christians, but some real seeking ones will be attracted.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through this fellowship, I hope we realize where we are and what we need to be.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>CONCERNING CONTACTING THOSE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>WHO HAVE BACKSLIDDEN</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now that we have begun to get into the field of contacting others, there are many lessons for us to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can spend only a certain amount of time to recover the backsliding ones, because we have the sinners and the new ones waiting for our help.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we contact a backsliding one, the first thing we have to learn is how to say something definite and to the point.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a certain brother is backslidden and has been distracted for years, we need to have a thorough fellowship with him to find out where he stands.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then we can give him the appropriate antidote.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To give people the proper antidote, we need to learn much.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we talk too much, that would not work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we talk too little, that is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may spend the next two or three months to contact the other saints among us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we need to contact the unbelieving sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we can get a backsliding one recovered, that is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we cannot get him recovered, we still should not be disappointed, because we have sown something into him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I want to encourage us to learn something as we endeavor to contact others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE NEED TO EXERCISE OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As we contact others, we need to exercise our spirit so that the Spirit may have a way to move on.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Quite often, what we speak would not work, but what we express, what we impress people with, is what works.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Maybe our words will not influence someone but what we are will.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we have something real and living of the Lord, this will impress people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Quite often, this impression will not work out something right away.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Maybe after six months, someone would be brought back to the Lord through the impression which he received of you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is no need for us to be disappointed, because we are sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>With any kind of sowing, there is a reaping.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I advise you all to learn to exercise your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even when some of us share in the meeting, we do not have an impressing spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whenever you speak something in the meetings, you should exercise your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In order to say something concerning the Lord to help people, you need to exercise your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then the Holy Spirit will move on.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If someone is down or discouraged and listens to the speaking of some who are so vital, he will become vitalized.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is so easy for us to remain in our oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What we speak may be good, but it will not be effectual if we do not have our spirit exercised with the Holy Spirit expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we do not exercise our spirit, our sharing cannot be a real spiritual help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must learn to exercise our spirit in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We need to make everything we do definite through our prayer and with our experience of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then we have to match the Spirit with our exercise of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need these two things: to experience the Spirit and to match it with the exercise of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are all short of this.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we come together in our group meetings, we must exercise our spirit and speak with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When you exercise your spirit, you give the Spirit who is indwelling you the way to take action.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then some riches of Christ will come out of you.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If you ask certain ones who have a quiet disposition to speak loudly, this will put them on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But if these ones are filled inwardly with the Spirit and experience the outpouring of the Spirit, they will change and become different persons.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should not remain in our oldness and in our old habit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whenever we function we must exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Spirit goes along with our voice.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If our voice is not released, the Spirit will not be released.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Certain quiet and shy ones need to learn to exercise their spirit and their voice so that the Holy Spirit can be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I want to see your improvement in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I have been improving for over sixty years, and I am still endeavoring to improve.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I am not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I am not content with what I am.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I hope that we will all learn to exercise our spirit to make some real progress in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Christian life actually is just the life of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We need the Holy Spirit, and the only way to get into this Holy Spirit is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Only prayer can usher you into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When you pray adequately, spontaneously you will have the infilling of the Spirit and the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I encourage you all to pray, not lightly but thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>HAVING THE GROUP MEETINGS AND</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>PRAYING FOR OUR WORK OF CONTACTING PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Each week you need to have a group meeting, and you also need to set aside a day or an evening for the purpose of contacting people.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>You need these two times weekly.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>These are additional to the prayer meeting of the church and the Lord s table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In our group meeting in these days, we have to pray for our work of contacting people.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Then we should fellowship about the situation with our contacts, so that we can study their cases, fellowship about them, and receive the mutual help.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>After your study, we should pray again.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This kind of practice will be very practical, useful, and vital.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Then you can decide whom you should contact and by what way.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We have to believe that what we are doing by the vital groups will not be in vain, because this is a very practical sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Surely there will be the real reaping.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>HOW TO CLASSIFY PEOPLE FOR GOSPEL PREACHING</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Accompanying this message, on page 247, is an outline entitled How to Classify People for Gospel Preaching .</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This publication gives a list of twenty different kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This was done in 1954 in Taipei when we had a training course for service.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In the past I also put out a list of prevailing verses to match the different categories of people.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We need to consider the appropriate verses to use when we contact certain people.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The twenty categories of people we have classified for gospel preaching are as follows:</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Those who live in sins.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Those who are empty.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Those who are knowledgeable and rational.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The moral ones.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The self-righteous ones.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The atheists.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The polytheists.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Those who are disgusted with the world.</S>

   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The realists.</S>

   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>I would encourage you to read this, study it, and fellowship with others about it, but do not apply the things in it in a legal way.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>You have to build up yourself with this kind of practical knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Then when you talk to people, spontaneously you will know how to handle them according to what kind of persons they are.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>HOW TO PRODUCE AND ESTABLISH</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>A VITAL GROUP IN THE CHURCH LIFE</S>

   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>I hope that we will read and study this outline prayerfully so that we can be made vital and go to vitalize others.</S>
