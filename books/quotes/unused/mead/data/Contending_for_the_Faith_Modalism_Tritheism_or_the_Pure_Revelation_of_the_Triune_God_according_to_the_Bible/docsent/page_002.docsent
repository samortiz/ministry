   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Modalistic Concept of the Trinity</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to the modalistic concept of the Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not equally and eternally co-existent, but are merely three successive manifestations of God, or three temporary modes of His activity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Modalism, which is actually a form of unitarianism, denies that God in His own inner being is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, it claims that the Father, Son, and Spirit are either temporary or successive roles adopted by God in carrying out the divine plan of redemption and that they in no way correspond to anything in the ultimate nature of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1 Modalism does not recognize the independent personality of Christ, but regards the incarnation as a mode of the existence or manifestation of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2 For the modalists, the Father, Son, and Spirit only refer to the way in which God reveals Himself, but bear no relation to His inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>3 A Brief History of Modalism</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us now briefly consider the history of modalism and the thought of some of its leading exponents.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Toward the end of the second century, there emerged a form of teaching called Monarchianism.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Modalism, otherwise known as modalistic Monarchianism, is a form of Monarchianism.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word Monarchianism derives from the Greek word monarchia which means the rule of one man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Monarchians were concerned about the divine unity or "Monarchy."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For them, the dominant principle was that God is one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As an explanation of the threefold revelation of God, Monarchianism was aimed at excluding the idea that Christians worshipped three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>4 Along with maintaining this principle, the modalistic Monarchians also wanted to assert the full divinity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, as we shall see, the modalists actually sacrificed Christ's independent personality, merging it into the essence of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>5 Modalism was popular among the simple believers, for it seemed to them the best way of protecting their belief in one God against ditheistic or tritheistic belief in two or three Gods corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>6</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Two of the earliest representatives of the modalistic school of thought were Praxeas and Noetus, both of whom came from Asia Minor to Rome toward the end of the second century.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>7 Praxeas taught that the Father and the Son were one identical Person and that the Father Himself became man, hungered, thirsted, suffered, and died in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>8 This view is also known as Patripassianism, from the Latin words pater "father" and passio "suffering" , because its practical identification of the Father and the Son lead to the conclusion that the Father suffered on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>9 In the words of the church historian, Philip Schaff, Praxeas "conceived the relation of the Father to the Son as like that of the spirit to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The same object, as spirit, is the Father; as flesh, the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He thought the Catholic doctrine tritheistic."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>10 The modalism advocated by Praxeas was for a time prevalent and popular at Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Early in the third century, Tertullian, to whom we owe the definition of the Godhead as being "one substance in three persons," wrote against him in a document entitled, Against Praxeas, accusing him of driving out the Holy Spirit and of crucifying the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Noetus published the same views as Praxeas approximately A.D. 200, 11 teaching that "Christ was the Father Himself, and that the Father Himself was born and suffered and died." 12 Noetus taught that in order for Christ to be God, He had to be identical with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since, for Noetus, there could be no division in the Godhead, if Christ suffered, then the Father suffered also.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>13 According to Noetus, there was only one God, the Father, who manifested Himself as He pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Son is merely a designation of God when He reveals Himself to the world and to men.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Father is called the Son for a certain time in reference to His experiences on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To Noetus, the Son is the Father veiled in flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>14 Two of Noetus's disciples, Epigonus and Cleomenes, propagated his doctrine in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>15</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Callistus, who later became Pope Callixtus I, adopted and advocated the doctrine of Noetus, declaring the Son to be merely the manifestation of the Father in human form.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Callistus taught that the Father animated the Son in the same way as the spirit animates the body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>16 Considering his opponents to be ditheists those who believe in two Gods , Callistus taught that God in the flesh is called the Son, while apart from the flesh He is called the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>17</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the early decades of the third century, Beryllus denied the personal existence of the Son, teaching that He had no individual existence of His own before coming to reside among men.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Beryllus also denied the independent divinity of Christ, claiming that He had no divinity of His own but only the divinity of the Father that indwelt Him during His earthly life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In a sense, Beryllus was a stepping stone between the early schools of modalism and Sabellianism.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>18</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sabellius was, by far, the most original, profound, and ingenious of the modalists.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>19 His theology was essentially that of Noetus, but, being more carefully worked out, gave a definite place to the Holy Spirit as well as to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>20 Sabellius seems to have been even more concerned than his predecessors in preserving the unity of God, and he insisted in the strongest possible way that God is one Person as well as one substance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>21 According to Sabellius, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all one and the same, being the three names of the one God who manifests Himself in different ways according to circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As the Father, He is Creator, Governor, and Lawgiver; as the Son, He is incarnate as the Redeemer; and as the Spirit, He is the Inspirer of the Apostles, the Regenerator, and the Sanctifier.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>22 But, to Sabellius, He is the one and the same God, the one and the same divine Person, who acts in all these ways, appearing in successive and temporary manifestations, just as a human individual may be called by different titles to denote his various roles.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>23 God does not act as Father, Son, and Spirit at the same time, but successively, turning from one activity to another as the need requires, with the one and the same God appearing now as the Father, now as the Son, and now as the Holy Spirit, but never all at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>24</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sabellius's fundamental thought is that the unity of God unfolds itself in the course of the world's development in three forms or periods of revelation, and after the completion of redemption returns again into unity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>25 Sabellius taught that the revelation of the Son ends with the ascension and that the revelation of the Spirit goes on in regeneration and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>26 Therefore, the trinity of Sabellius is not a trinity of essence, that is, of the inner being of God, but of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are simply designations of three different phases under which the one divine essence reveals itself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>27 Sabellius differs from orthodox doctrine mainly in making the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit only temporary phenomena which fulfilled their mission and returned into an abstract entity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>28 Sabellius denied that the Father, Son, and Spirit eternally co-exist in the inner being of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rather, he insisted that the Father, Son, and Spirit are merely temporary and successive manifestations of the one Person of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the words of J. F. Bethune-Baker, a renowned scholar in the history of doctrine, for Sabellius, "There is no real incarnation; no personal indissoluble union of the Godhead with the Manhood took place in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God only manifested Himself in Christ and when the part was played and the curtain fell upon that act in the great drama there ceased to be a Christ or a Son of God."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>29</S>
