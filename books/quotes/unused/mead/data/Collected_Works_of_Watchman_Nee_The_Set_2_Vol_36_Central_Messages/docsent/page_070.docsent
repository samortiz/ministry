   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Confessing Our Wrongs</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are many other things of a similar nature, and we cannot enumerate them all.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we are willing to be enlightened by the Lord, He will show us many unrighteous things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once we see that we are wrong, we should not be afraid of confessing our wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we first become a Christian, it is inevitable that we will make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The worst thing is being ignorant of our mistakes or refusing to admit our mistakes once we know them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Being ignorant of our mistakes is being in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sins can be forgiven, but darkness cannot be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we confess our sins, the Lord will forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But darkness makes us ignorant of our sins; therefore, we cannot enjoy forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord said, "I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness" John 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do not have the light, we will not be able to tell the difference between black and white.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we are in the light, we will see what unrighteousness is and what sin is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For a new believer, nothing is more important than knowing what unrighteousness is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For a Christian, as he grows, the most important thing is becoming more and more sensitive to unrighteousness and dealing with all unrighteousness more and more seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A brother once said, "When I was first saved, I wrote a hundred letters of apology and confession the first year and another hundred the second year.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In spite of that, I only knew sin but did not know unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I knew that I had cheated, slandered, and supplanted others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These were sins, and I dealt with them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But I did not see what unrighteousness is; I did not know what it means to infringe upon the rights of others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I did not realize that I should give others what is rightfully theirs and that I should not give others what they do not deserve.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Three years after I was saved, I read a story from a magazine which was about a conference that was held in a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the day of the conference, it was raining.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Someone was sitting on the first row, and he put his raincoat on the back of the chair beside him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Another man was walking up to the platform to deliver his message, and he inadvertently displaced the raincoat on the front row.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One sleeve of the raincoat fell to the floor, and he accidentally stepped on it with his muddy shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He knew what he had done, but he just kicked the sleeve aside.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He delivered a very good message and others could see that he was very familiar with the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the writer of the story remarked, I do not care how good his message is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I just want to see what he will do to the sleeve when he comes down from the platform.'</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After the speaker finished his message, he kicked the sleeve aside just as he had done before and sat down.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The writer of the story concluded with the words, This is unrighteousness.'</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I never knew what unrighteousness was until the day I read this story.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word unrighteousness suddenly became very big to me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What is unrighteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Unrighteousness is trespassing on others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The man should not have stepped on the sleeve and then sat down.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even if he did not clean the sleeve, at least he should have apologized to the owner of the raincoat.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For him to do such a thing was unrighteous."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Brothers and sisters, we have to learn to know what unrighteousness is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Being unrighteous is crossing the boundary, trespassing against others, and causing others to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God has made us His righteousness, and He has made us an expression of His righteousness to the extent that when others see us they see God's righteousness; therefore, we cannot be unrighteous in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>PETITION AND EXHORTATION</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Finally, I should add a few words.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In regard to ourselves, we have to be righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But when we see others being unrighteous, we have to pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The hardest thing for us to take is seeing others practicing unrighteousness while we are practicing righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may feel indignant and angry.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may want to cut them off and ignore them, but this is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to realize that they need light just as we do.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Before we see the light, we also will not realize our mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If our brother or sister is unrighteous, we cannot brush them aside, ignore them, reject them, or cut them off.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to pray for them and ask God to give them the light to see.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is useless for us to see the light alone; they have to see the light also.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have to learn to petition on behalf of others and learn to speak the truth in love.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At the same time, we have to deal with ourselves in a strict way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to remember that we are God's righteousness on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In our daily living, we have to express God as the righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Only then will others give praise and glory to our God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>May God make every one of us a righteous person.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God's salvation is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>May we express God's righteousness on earth by realizing His righteousness, and may we express this righteousness in everything.</S>
