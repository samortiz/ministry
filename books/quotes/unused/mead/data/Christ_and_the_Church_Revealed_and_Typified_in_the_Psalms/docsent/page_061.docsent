   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PLACE OF FULLEST BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The more you go on in the local church, the more strength you will gain.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God" v. 7 . It is not your own strength, but the strength of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Just go on.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no need for you to consider, to hesitate, to turn away.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even if it is the Red Sea, go through it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even if it is the Jordan, go through it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is absolutely a matter of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do not look at the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you do, you will be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You may see the sea ahead of you, or the river in either case it is deep water.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But go on.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Praise the Lord, when you go on, you have the strength.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord is ahead of you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you continue in the church way, you will go from strength to strength, and you will appear before God in Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand" v. 10 . In the Bible, one thousand signifies the fullest measure of a complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Ezekiel 47 speaks of the measurement of a thousand cubits, and the millennium covers a period of a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the blessing we receive by being in the dwelling place of the Lord is the fullest, the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nowhere else can we receive a blessing as full as that which we obtain in the courts of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you go to a meeting which you consider poor and feel that you haven't gained anything from it, you may think it is better to stay home.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All right, stay home.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It may be good for a little while, possibly for a few weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But I can assure you that after three months of staying home and not attending the meetings, you will be back in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I do not care how much you obtain at home; it can never compare with the blessings you receive in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even if the local church is poor, you just come to it; you will get the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may in fact get some blessing elsewhere, but not a thousandfold.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you want the fullest blessing, if you would turn one good day into a thousand, you must come to the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here in the house of God we enjoy God as a sun and a shield.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The sun is for supply, and the shield is for protection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here in the church life God is our supply, and God is our safeguard.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here we enjoy His grace and His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Grace is the inner enjoyment, and glory is the outward expression.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the church life we have the inner enjoyment of grace and the outward expression of glory; we have a supply as the sun, and God Himself as our shield.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Oh, how blessed is the church life!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee" v. 12 . Where? In the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Three times in this Psalm it says, "Blessed is the man": "Blessed are they that dwell in thy house" v. 4 ; "Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee" v. 5 ; "Blessed is the man that trusteth in thee" v. 12 . How absolutely different this is from Psalm 1, which says that the man is blessed who keeps the law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"Blessed are they that dwell in thy house."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are the ones who go from strength to strength.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are the ones who trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These are the blessings of the church life!</S>
