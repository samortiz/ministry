   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Moneylender and Two Debtors</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verses 41 and 42 the Man-Savior said to the Pharisee, A certain moneylender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But having nothing to repay, he graciously forgave them both.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Which of them therefore will love him more?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord s word here indicates that both Simon and the woman were sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Simon considered the woman a sinner, but did not consider himself a sinner, and he doubted that the Savior knew that she was a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the Savior s parable indicated that both Simon and the woman were sinners, debtors to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to verse 42, when the two debtors had nothing to repay the moneylender, he graciously forgave them both.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that all sinners have nothing to repay their debt to God their Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord s word here also indicates that the Savior had already forgiven them both.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 42 the Lord Jesus asked Simon which of the debtors would love the moneylender more as a result of having been forgiven by him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that love to the Savior is the issue, not the cause, of His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verses 44 through 46 the Lord went on to say to Simon, Do you see this woman?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I entered into your house; you did not give Me water for My feet, but this woman has wet My feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You did not give Me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing My feet affectionately.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Savior s word in these verses indicates that Simon should take the woman as an example and learn of her.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 47 the Lord said, For this reason I say to you, her sins which are many have been forgiven, because she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, he loves little.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The great love of the woman was a proof that her many sins had been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Simon s little love testified that he had experienced forgiveness only a little.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Incarnation of the Forgiving God</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 48 the Man-Savior said to the woman, Your sins have been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Both this case and the case of the widow s son in Nain 7:11-17 are found only in this Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This shows the Savior s tender care for the dead and sinful, and it conveys the principle of morality as the unique characteristic of this Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 49 says, And those who were reclining at the table with Him began to say among themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Simon did not realize that this Man-Savior was the very God, the One who has authority to forgive man s sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Man-Savior was the incarnation of the forgiving God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 50 we have the conclusion of this incident: But He said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The forgiven woman had not only love toward the Lord but faith in Him, a faith that operated through love Gal 5:6 and issued in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The faith which saved her brought her to the Savior in love and resulted in her going forward in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>FAITH, LOVE, AND PEACE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Faith, love, and peace are three crucial virtues in experiencing and enjoying the Savior s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Faith is brought forth by knowing the Savior in His saving power and virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Love comes out of this faith and issues in peace to follow the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do you know Luke s purpose in presenting such a picture of the forgiveness of sins?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His purpose was to portray the Man-Savior with His highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we have pointed out, this should be regarded as the underlying principle in the writing of the Gospel of Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Especially in this case we can see this governing principle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here we have a portrait of the Savior s highest standard of morality.</S>
