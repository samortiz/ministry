   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ENOCH WALKING WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The characteristic of Enoch's life was that he walked with God Gen 5:22, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are not told that he worked for God or that he did great things for God, but that he walked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to walk with a person, you must like him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If I do not like you, I will never walk with you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Firstly, I like you, then I love you, and then I will walk with you continually.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The fact that Enoch walked with God proves that he loved God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He simply loved to be in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus rebuked the church at Ephesus because they did many works for God but had lost their first love Rev 2:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord does not want to see so many good works; He wants to see our love toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Suppose a wife performs many good works for her husband, yet would never be in his presence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Surely the husband will say, "I don't want you to be busy and yet be away from me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I want a wife who is with me all the time."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Enoch walked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we read Genesis 5:21-24 carefully, we will see that Enoch began his walk with God at the age of sixty-five and continued walking with Him for three hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He walked with God day after day for a period of three hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Finally, God seemed to say, "Enoch, you have walked with Me long enough.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Let Me take you to Myself."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many Christians are fond of talking about the rapture and the coming of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do you realize that rapture requires that you love the Lord and live in His presence?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"Lord Jesus, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I want to live in Your presence.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I want to walk with You because I love You."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This loving attitude is the preparation, condition, and basis of being raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On what ground was Enoch raptured?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was raptured on the basis of his walk with God for a period of three hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Enoch offered us an excellent example.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>NOAH WALKING WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Noah followed Enoch's footsteps and also walked with God Gen 6:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Actually, he walked with God for a period even longer than three hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As Noah walked with God, God showed him a vision of what He wanted to do in that age.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Noah received the vision of the ark used to save eight members of the fallen race.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Like Noah, we should not act according to our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whatever we do and work should be according to the vision we received in walking with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In our daily walk with the Lord we will come to see His desire, His mind, and His will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we will work and serve according to God's desire, not according to our own thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Noah enjoyed God by walking with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>V. ABRAHAM LIVING IN THE APPEARING OF GOD AND</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>CALLING UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Abraham was more outstanding than Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As we pointed out in the Life-study of Romans, Abraham was transfused with the appearing of the God of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>While Abraham was in Ur of the Chaldees, the God of glory appeared to him and attracted him Acts 7:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to the record in Genesis, God appeared to Abraham several other times as well Gen 12:7; 17:1; 18:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Abraham was not a giant of faith by himself; he was as weak as we are.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The God of glory appeared to Abraham again and again, each time transfusing and infusing His divine elements into him, enabling him to live by the faith of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Abraham's experience reminds us of a battery which operates well after it is charged, but which needs recharging after a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is very interesting to study Abraham's history according to God's appearings to him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God called Abraham out of Ur of the Chaldees and led him on by appearing to him again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As I have mentioned previously, when God called Abraham to leave Ur, He did not give him a map or any directions.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Abraham walked according to the appearing of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If God's appearing was in a certain direction, Abraham simply moved in that direction.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this way Abraham enjoyed the riches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In addition to experiencing the appearings of God, Abraham called upon the name of the Lord Gen 12:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Abraham's son, Isaac, and his grandson, Jacob, also called upon the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since these three generations were all the same, God was called the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This means that God is the God of His people who live in His appearing and who call upon His name.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As Abraham lived in the appearing of God and called upon the name of the Lord, he enjoyed Him as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>According to Genesis 18, God appeared to Abraham as he sat at the entrance of his tent, and He stayed with him for about half a day, even enjoying a meal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thus, the Bible even says that Abraham was called the friend of God James 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In Genesis 18 God and Abraham conversed together and ate together as friends.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Certainly we all would like to have such an enjoyment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Nevertheless, our portion today is much better than Abraham's experience in Genesis 18.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>According to Revelation 3:20, the Lord Jesus is knocking at the door.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If anyone will hear His voice and open the door, the Lord will come into him and sup with him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Day by day we may have a feast with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Abraham dined with the Lord for approximately half a day, but we may feast with Him continually.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We may meet with the Lord at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our portion is higher and richer than was Abraham's.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Abraham enjoyed God as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What is the tree of life?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The tree of life is the supply of life that maintains our living in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Abraham enjoyed God in such a way.</S>
