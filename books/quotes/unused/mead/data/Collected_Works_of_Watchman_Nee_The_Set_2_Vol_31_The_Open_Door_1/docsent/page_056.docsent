   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Letter from Brother Hwa Shi-bin</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dear Brother Yueh-chiao in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I was led by the Lord three weeks ago to leave Ning-Hai and work in the region of Huang-Yen and Hai-Men.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have not had any news about the condition of the assembly in Shanghai and the brothers in Kiangsu, Shanghai, and Shao-Shing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I heard that the people in Shanghai were trapped in high inflation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I would imagine that the brothers in Shanghai must be in the same situation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I wonder what the situation really is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Is Brother Chang Kwang-rong still in Shanghai?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Does Brother Chang still want to travel to Ning-Hai?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I think about him often.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Please greet him for me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Praise the Father that He has raised up many young brothers in Huang-Yen who love and pursue the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They sit around me day and night asking how to walk in the Lord's way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Unfortunately, my spiritual life is immature, and my knowledge of the truth is too shallow; therefore, I cannot help them much.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Fortunately, Brother Guan En-chiu is my companion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord willing, I hope to go to Wenchow and the region of Ping-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I look at the world situation, and I know that the day for the Lord to be glorified is near.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, the bride the church has not made herself ready.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many sinners have not been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My spiritual life has not matured.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I really do not know how I can face the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Please pray for me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hwa Shi-bin</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>December 15</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>P.S. Brother Guan sends his greetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This letter was mailed from Huang-Yen, Chekiang to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sheng County and Sin-Chang</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The condition of the church in Sheng County is very desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I visited several meeting places and preached the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A few people were saved, but there were still many who needed God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I met Brother Yu Cheng-hwa, who lives fifteen miles from me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We hope that there will be an assembly in Sin-Chang, Sheng County, but we are waiting for God to start it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Please pray for this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord willing, I hope to go west after I stay in Sheng County for awhile.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Please pray for me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I received a letter from Brother Hwa Shi-bin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The churches in the Ning-Hai area will have a conference beginning the third day of the Chinese New Year.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They have invited me to attend, but I wonder what the political situation will be like.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Lou Chuan-en</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>January 12</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Work in the Region of Ping-Yang</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To my dear brother in the Lord, Mr. Watchman Nee, and to the brothers and sisters who work for the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We received a copy of The Open Door from Da-San-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By reading it we become acquainted with all of your travels, and we thank and praise the Lord for this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May the Lord bless the work you do and the gospel you preach so that we may be able to fulfill the commission He gave when He sent us to the ends of the earth and so that we may hasten His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We really thank the Lord for causing us to live in this poor and remote region of Ping-Yang where we are peacefully going about our business.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Not only so, the Lord has given us grace that we never expected by sending His faithful servant, Brother Hwa Shi-bin, to Ping-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He went to Hu-Shan, Yi-Shan, Wa-Yao-Tou, and Fang-Yen-Hsia strengthening the brothers and sisters in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Wherever he preached the gospel, sinners confessed their sins and believed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the third and fourth day of this month, we pitched a tent in our locality of Chien-Chang, and he preached the gospel for one day and two nights.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The audience poured in, and we had to enlarge the tent.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although the people were very crowded, they kept very quiet throughout the meeting and did not leave until it was all over.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Brother Hwa spoke powerfully about how God loves sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Every day he sounded the call to those who were under the authority of Satan and about to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>People in the audience would raise their hands to show that they believed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thank the Lord, two new people have joined the Lord's Day, Wednesday, and Friday evening meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Their attitude is very serious, and they are sincere in obeying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We still need your earnest prayer before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Pray that God would add saved ones to the church every day, bind Satan, and release the slaves of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Please send four copies of The Open Door so that we may constantly know of your travels and work and have fellowship with you in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In this critical time, the remaining days of grace, the most important thing is to pray for one another and to keep in constant contact.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>May God give peace, and may His Son, Jesus Christ, be with you forever and ever, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Your weak brothers in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Ma Hsian-yi, Su Tze-san, Liu Sing-kwang, Su Sheng-chuan</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>January 19</S>
