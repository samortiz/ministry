   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Tent of Meeting and the Tabernacle</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The term tabernacle in the Bible refers to something deep concerning God and His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The phrase tent of meeting is positive; however, the significance is not as deep as that of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The tabernacle is related to God s testimony, but the tent of meeting is related mainly to God s interest on earth and to His move.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You may wish to keep this distinction in mind as you read through the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Remember that the word tabernacle points to something directly related to God s testimony and that the term tent of meeting points to something that is more outward, external, related to God s interest and move.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As an illustration of this distinction, let us consider chapter one of Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to Leviticus 1:1, the Lord spoke to Moses out of the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this verse we are not told that the Lord spoke to Moses out of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we read this verse, we may think that it is a wonderful matter for God to speak out of the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yes, God s speaking out of the tent of meeting is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, it is not as wonderful as His speaking in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Relationship between the Cloud</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>and the Glory</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is important for us to understand the relationship between the cloud and the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may say that the cloud is the outer part, the shell, of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By shell we mean an outer covering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we understand the word shell in this way, we may say that an orange has a peeling as its shell, and we may say that the human body has the skin as its shell.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The skin covers the body, and the body contains our being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the shell covering the human body is not our actual being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, our being is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who were outside the tabernacle could see the shell.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Anyone who entered into the tabernacle would see not the shell, but would see the inward glory of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The young people may enjoy the church life and testify how wonderful it is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, they may be enjoying only the shell of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But this does not mean that they should give up this enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the contrary, they should go on to enjoy the inward glory of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Young people, do not be disappointed by my word, and do not throw away the shell because you do not yet have much of the inward glory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I believe that many of us can testify that when we were in Elden Hall in Los Angeles, we were on the roof of the church life enjoying the cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Perhaps some would say that the church life in Anaheim is not as exciting as that in Elden.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I agree.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nevertheless, we must admit that what we are enjoying today is something deeper and more inward than what we enjoyed in Elden Hall.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may no longer be on the roof enjoying the cloud, but we are learning to intercede at the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Anyone who intercedes at the incense altar is no longer in the cloud that covers the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, this one is encompassed by the glory that is on the inside of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I hope that more of us will see this and experience it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some of the older saints may feel bothered or frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They may say to themselves, Why are we not as fresh as we used to be?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why is the church life not so exciting?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is good to be excited and it is also good to be able to excite others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, it is mainly the young ones who are excited and exciting, for they are enjoying the cloud outside the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But it is difficult for the older ones who are experiencing the glory within the tabernacle to be excited.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I can testify that as an older one I may not be excited outwardly, but I find it wonderful to intercede at the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How I love to enjoy the bread at the table and to linger at the incense altar!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those in the outer court may gather around the altar of burnt offering and see the cloud covering the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if they want to see the glory, they need to come inside the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The glory is not on the roof; it is within the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we come into the tabernacle, we shall see that the glory is there.</S>
