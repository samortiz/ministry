   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING THE NEW SONG</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us look firstly at a few verses in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the Mount Sion, and with Him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father s name written in their foreheads.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder; and the voice which I heard was as of harpers harping with their harps: and they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty-four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These were purchased from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb Rev 14:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Notice it says that they sang a new song, and no man could learn that song.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Praises have been established by the Lord out of the mouths of babes and sucklings: even the little babes can praise.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why then does it say here that no man could learn that song?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The answer is that no man can learn it without experience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are some praises which require experience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Look at the moon and the stars how majestic and lovely they are!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Look at the trees, the flowers, and the birds how pleasant!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For this kind of praise, we need no experience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But for these one hundred and forty-four thousand to praise Christ in a special way, they must have the proper and particular experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we lack these experiences, we can never praise the Lord to such a degree.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all can praise Him in a general way, in a religious way, in a natural way; but if we would praise Him in a special and deeper way, we need some experience of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our praises are limited by our experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How much, how deeply, or how highly we have experienced Christ will be the measure of our praise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our praises can never exceed our experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If our experiences of Him have not reached a certain stage, when others sing praises so highly and deeply, we cannot follow, we cannot learn.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not until our experiences of Christ have reached that extent can we also sing that new song.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the foundation for the message of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>PSALM 19 COMPARED WITH PSALM 68</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now before we turn to Psalm 68, let us consider briefly another Psalm, Psalm 19.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first part of this Psalm speaks marvelously of creation the heavens and the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The second part, beginning with verse 7, speaks about the law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is really good.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I do not think I need to say anything concerning this Psalm everyone can understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But do you understand Psalm 68?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now compare these two Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do you see the difference?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Psalm 19 is certainly good, but the praises there are just according to nature, according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I would not say it is a natural and religious praise, but it is not so deep and so rich as Psalm 68.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We Christians have always been appreciating Psalm 19 so much.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I have no intention to depreciate it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I only ask you to compare it with Psalm 68.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is a real progress in the praises in the Psalms; we must go on from Psalm 19 with its praises according to nature and the law to Psalm 68 with praises according to the experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>CHRIST S VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let me in a simple way point out the main points in this Psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First of all, we have the victory in the battle over the enemies: Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered v. 1 . This is not just the battle, but the victory in the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The battle is over, and now we have the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a triumphant Psalm, a Psalm with triumph and victory.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>GOD S HABITATION</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The second main point of this Psalm is the dwelling place of God on earth That the Lord God might dwell with them v. 18 . Several times we see the words the dwelling place of God, the habitation of God, the sanctuary, the holy place.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A Father of the fatherless, and a protector of the widows, is God in his holy habitation v. 5 . The victory in the battle, the victory won by Christ, is for the building up of God s habitation even today on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the earth usurped by Satan, among a rebellious people, God could accomplish such a marvelous thing as building up a habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do you think that in a city so sinful as Los Angeles God could have a habitation, a local church?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yet it is here!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In such a pit of corruption there is a holy habitation built up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God could say to Satan, Regardless of how much you have corrupted the people, I can still build My holy habitation, even in Los Angeles, the city of Hollywood!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is glorious!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Los Angeles is famous for new cults: all the strange things, all the far out things, all the evil things of the earth make their nest here.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But in such a place God has built up the local church as His habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Is not this a real victory?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the Lord had never won the victory, how could He accomplish this?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To my realization, the city of Los Angeles, which takes the lead in evil throughout the world, is the best place for a testimony for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the midst of the most corrupt, the most evil, the most sinful place, God could have a holy sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The victory of Christ is for the habitation of God on this earth, in this last age, among a rebellious and corrupted people.</S>
