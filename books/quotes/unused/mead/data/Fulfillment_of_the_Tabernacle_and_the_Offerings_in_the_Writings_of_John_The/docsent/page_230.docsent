   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INWARD AND OUTWARD ASPECTS OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With the truths in the Bible there are two aspects: an outward, visible aspect and an inward, invisible aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have been opposed by those who hold only the outward aspect, the outward view, because we have both the outward and inward aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The outward aspect or view of the truth is mainly a matter of doctrine, but the inward aspect is for experience.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we have only the outward aspect of a particular truth, we shall not have any experience of that truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In particular, if we hold only to the Lord's visible presence, how shall we be able to experience Him?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Physically, He is in the third heaven, and we could not experience Him if that were His only aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The majority of today's Christians have an objective religion of objective doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They have little subjective experience of the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For this reason, we in the Lord's recovery have been emphasizing the inward aspect of the biblical truths.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I can testify that I care very much for the inward aspect, the inward view, of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>ENJOYING THE LORD IN HIS INVISIBLE PRESENCE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Which aspect of the Lord's presence do you treasure more, the aspect of His visible presence or the aspect of His invisible presence?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we answered this question frankly, most of us would have to admit that we treasure His visible presence more than His invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because this is our situation, if the Lord were suddenly to appear in His visible presence, most of the saints would be frightened rather than excited.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The reason for this reaction would be that they have not had sufficient experience of the Lord's invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we experience the Lord's invisible presence adequately, then we shall be excited when we are brought into His visible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The experience of the Lord's invisible presence is a preparation for us to meet Him in His visible presence, which will then become a genuine and practical enjoyment to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Too few of today's Christians pay adequate attention to the Lord's invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because this is the situation, we are burdened concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because the Gospel of John emphasizes the Lord's invisible presence, in this Gospel there is no record of the Lord's public ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What is emphasized in the Gospel of John concerning Christ after His resurrection is His invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After His resurrection He became the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, He is no longer the Christ in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When He was on earth, He was given a wonderful name Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But today He is not Emmanuel in a physical way; instead, He is the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do you prefer the Lord as Emmanuel, as the One with you outwardly, or as the life-giving Spirit, the One dwelling within you?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all need to treasure the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The wonderful indwelling Spirit is actually the Lord Himself in His invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By the Lord's mercy I can testify that day by day I enjoy the Lord in His invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even though I may sometimes be weak, I still treasure His invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Of course, I am waiting to meet the Lord in His visible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But while I am waiting to meet Him in this way, I need more experience and enjoyment of His invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>TWO ASPECTS OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have seen that with the Lord's presence there are two aspects, the visible presence and the invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Gospel of John also reveals two aspects of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>John 14:16-17a says, "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to these verses, the Lord Jesus prayed that the Father would give us another Comforter, and this other Comforter is the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to this chapter, the Spirit, being another Comforter, would seem to be another person, because a comforter is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus was the first Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because He as the first Comforter is a person, then the other Comforter, the Spirit of reality, should also be a person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, in John 14 we have two Comforters, the Lord and the Spirit of reality, and it seems that these two Comforters are two persons.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The other Comforter, the Spirit of reality, is the Spirit spoken of in 7:39.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord's promise concerning the giving of another Comforter was fulfilled on the day of His resurrection, when the Spirit was breathed into the disciples as the holy breath.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to 20:22, the Lord Jesus breathed into the disciples and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here the Spirit is presented not as a person, another Comforter, but as the breath of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, in chapters fourteen and twenty we have two aspects of the Spirit: the Spirit as another Comforter and the Spirit as the breath of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How can a person's breath be regarded as another person?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, whereas the Spirit as another Comforter is a person, the Spirit as the breath of Christ is not a person separate from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Actually, these two aspects of the Spirit denote an outward and inward aspect of the truth concerning the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Spirit as another Comforter is the outward aspect, and the Spirit as Christ's breath is the inward aspect.</S>
