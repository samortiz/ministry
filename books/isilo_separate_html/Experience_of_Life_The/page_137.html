But the Lord has saved us not only to the state of possessing power, but also to the place of having authority. Those in the heavenly realm not only have power, but also authority. Those with power can only cause others to be moved. But those with authority cause others not only to be moved, but also to be reverent and fearful. For example, consider some brothers and sisters who love the world and live according to the flesh. When they see brothers or sisters loving the Lord, seeking Him, and living in the spirit, they admire them very much and are moved. This is a matter of power. But if they meet other brothers or sisters who are living in the realm of ascension, they feel not only a certain power which causes them to be moved, but also a certain phenomenon which causes them to be reverent and fearful. With such brothers or sisters there is the heavenly reality; therefore, they are also full of heavenly authority. Thus, while they are walking among men, they bring with them a certain fearsomeness, which causes others to be reverent.<p>When we read the Song of Songs in the Old Testament, we see that the one who is seeking the Lord grows in life to such an extent that her expression is exceedingly noble and awesome. Song of Songs 6:10 says, &#8220;Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, terrible as an army with banners?&#8221; Here the morning light, the moon, and the sun are all things in the heavens. Therefore, by this time the condition of this one is altogether heavenly. In other words, her experience of life has reached the realm of ascension. Thus, her condition gives others the feeling of fearfulness. This is because she is in the position of ascension and has the heavenly authority. It is this authority which causes others to be fearful and filled with reverence.<p>The authority we obtain in the position of ascension is the basis upon which we deal Satan and overcome him. In Luke 10:19, the Lord says, &#8220;Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall in any wise hurt you.&#8221; The &#8220;serpents&#8221; mentioned by the Lord refer to Satan, and the &#8220;scorpions&#8221; are the evil spirits, the messengers of Satan. These are our enemies. All they have is power, but what the Lord gives us is authority. The Lord gives us authority in order to deal with all the power of the enemy. We may illustrate this by an automobile moving along the road. Although it is full of power, yet a traffic policeman has authority over it. When he blows his whistle, the car must stop. Again, it is like an army. Although it has great power, yet the general has the authority. When he gives an order, the army must obey. This proves that authority is over power and can control power; therefore, authority is greater than power.<p>But authority depends entirely upon position. With the position, there is the authority; without the position, there is no authority. A policeman without his uniform and not standing in the assigned post has no authority to direct the cars. A general taking leave from his duty has no authority to command an army. Likewise, our heavenly authority depends solely on our position of ascension. Whenever we lose the position of ascension, we also lose the spiritual authority. Therefore, in order to engage in spiritual warfare, we must first know the position of ascension, and secondly, keep the position of ascension. Only then can we deal with the enemy.<p>In Paul&#8217;s second journey, when he was preaching in Philippi, a certain maid with a spirit of divination followed, crying out after him. Paul, being greatly troubled, turned and said to the spirit, &#8220;I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.&#8221; And the spirit came out that very hour (Acts 16:16-18). Paul here was standing in the position of ascension and exercising heavenly authority to halt the enemy&#8217;s disturbing power. Likewise, today, if we stand in the position of ascension, we can directly command the environment, rebuke difficulties, and destroy all the works of the enemy.<p>Unfortunately, the prayers of the church today contain all too few authoritative commands. On the contrary, the prayers are mostly tearful pleadings. Therefore, they cannot deal with the enemy; they can only appeal to God&#8217;s mercy. This only proves that our actual position is still on earth and has not yet ascended to the heavenlies. Since we are not in the position of ascension, we do not have the heavenly authority. We cannot pretend in this matter. On the other hand, if any man has the reality of ascension, he has no need to pompously display his power or assume airs; he is naturally clothed with a heavenly appearance; he is full of a heavenly atmosphere and adorned with beauty as the moon and purity as the sun. This causes him to appear awesome. Not only do men fear him, even the evil spirits are afraid of him. Only this kind of man can stand in the heavenly position, exercise heavenly authority, and engage in spiritual warfare. Therefore, in order to know the ascension, we must know also the position of warfare.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_136.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_138.html">Next</a> </body></html>
