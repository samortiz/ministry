   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S HEART BEING DUPLICATED IN SAMUEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When someone attains a high position, there is always a question as to whether he will allow someone else to come in to match him or to be above him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you had been Samuel, would you have given any ground for someone to match you or be above you?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Samuel was pure and single.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was a Nazarite according to his mother's vow and was altogether not self-seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He never sought to gain anything for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He had no heart for anything besides God and God's elect.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God loved Israel, and His heart was duplicated in Samuel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because God's heart was duplicated in Samuel, Samuel did not care for his own interest or gain.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the end, Samuel gained nothing but a tomb to be buried in. Due to the situation at the time, Samuel appointed his sons to be judges, but, contrary to Saul, he had no intention to build up a kingdom for them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His sons did not follow in his ways but went after unjust gain, took bribes, and perverted justice 1 Sam 8:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the people asked Samuel to appoint a king, he was not offended by anything related to his sons; on the contrary, he was offended by their desire to replace God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>4-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because he had no intention to build up a kingdom for his descendants, Samuel's concern was not for his children but for God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In such a situation it was easy for God to bring in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A PERSON WHO CARED ONLY FOR GOD</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>AND FOR GOD'S INTEREST AND PROFIT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Samuel would never have cooperated with God if he had been a self-seeking person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we will see in the next message, the day before Saul came to Samuel, God revealed to Samuel what He wanted him to do.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God said to him, "At about this time tomorrow I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him as the leader over My people Israel" 9:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Saul and his servant came to Samuel, Samuel did exactly as God had instructed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He did not care to gain anything for himself or for his children.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now we can see why Samuel was so useful in the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He had no self-seeking nor any thought of self-gain.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead, as a Nazarite, who allowed no razor to come upon his head and who did not drink any wine, he was absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was happy to go wherever God wanted him to go and to do whatever God wanted him to do.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was a man according to God, a man according to God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, he was a man whom God could use to carry out His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not think that Samuel did not have any kind of human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One day Jehovah said to him, "Fill your horn with oil, and go; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have selected for Myself a king among his sons" 16:1b .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Samuel heard this, he said, "How can I go?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If Saul hears of it, he will kill me" v. 2a . This indicates that Samuel was very human and had human concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nevertheless, he was not a self-seeking person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All of his seeking was for God and for God's elect.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He cared for God and for His interest and profit, and He prayed for God's people.</S>
