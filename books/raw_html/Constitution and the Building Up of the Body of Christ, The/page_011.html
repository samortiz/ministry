<P>Christ came in incarnation, but it took Him a much longer time of passing through the processes of human living, death, and resurrection to come into us. We know that Jesus now lives in us not only because the Bible tells us so (Gal. 2:20a; 2 Cor. 13:5) but also because our experience testifies that it is so. My experience told me that Jesus lived in me. It was the same with all of us who have received Him. His coming to live in us changed us from naughty ones to "Jesus gentlemen" and "Jesus ladies." This extra One has made us different from the people of the world. Today we are the testimony of Jesus (Rev. 1:2, 9). Jesus lives in us. We know this because of what the Bible says and because of our experience.</P><P>The incarnated Jesus came into us by passing through a long process. Following His incarnation Jesus lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years. Then He went to the cross to die. His death was the second major step He took in order to come into us. By being crucified He took care of all the negative things and He solved all the problems. He took away our sin and our sins. His death solved everything and terminated everything of the old creation.</P><P>He died on the cross, was buried, and on the third day He resurrected. His resurrection was the third major step of His coming. First Corinthians 15:45b tells us that in His resurrection He became another person, the life-giving Spirit. In His incarnation He, as God, became a man. In His resurrection He, as the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit. Therefore, Christ is God, Christ is man, and Christ is the life-giving Spirit. Today the very Christ who has come into us and who is still living in us is God, man, and the Spirit.</P><P>The Bible reveals emphatically that Christ the Lord is the Spirit. Today the Lord Jesus is the omnipresent One in resurrection. He is in heaven, He is on earth, He is in you, He is in me, and He is in millions of His believers. From the day that we called on the Lord and received Him, we realized that someone came into us and was even added into us. Jesus can enter into us because He has become the life-giving Spirit. Today He has finished His three major steps of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. He became a man and in man He died, solving all the problems and taking away all the troubles in the universe. Then in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit so that He could enter into us. Today He is in us.</P><P>Christ is still coming today because He is still in the process of entering into millions of people. But even in such a so-called Christian nation as the United States, millions of people have not yet believed in the Lord Jesus. The Lord desires all men to be saved (1 Tim. 2:4). We have to go with the Lord to them to bring the Lord to them. He is still in the process of His coming until He eventually will come from the heavens to the air and from the air to the earth. That will be the ultimate step in the consummation of His coming.</P><P>Today we have such a wonderful Lord Jesus within us. This is all bright, all in the day, and all positive, but with the day there is also the night. We need to see the night, the negative picture, presented to us in Matthew 13. Matthew 13 reveals the constitution of the Body of Christ under the enemy Satan's frustration, damage, and corruption.</P>
