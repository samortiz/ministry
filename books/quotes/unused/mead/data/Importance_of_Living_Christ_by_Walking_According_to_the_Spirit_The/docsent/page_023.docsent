   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NEEDING TO HAVE A PROPER CHARACTER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As leading ones, we also need to consider the matter of our character.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1953 I gave a training on character in Taiwan and shared thirty points of character in ten groups of three.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first group is genuine, exact, and strict.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to be genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A teenager who pretends to be an old man is not genuine, because he is acting like someone he is not.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should be what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be exact is to be accurate and precise.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Most people s character is not accurate or precise.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1947 a serving sister in Shanghai told me, The roof of the meeting hall has a big hole in it and needs to be repaired.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to get an accurate estimation of the size of the hole, I had to ask her several times, How big?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, it became clear that the hole was not very large.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Inaccurate information may cause damage to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>An elder must have a precise character and be accurate when speaking to others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be strict is not to be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The second group of character traits is diligent, broad, and fine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After we decide to read the Bible every day, the time we spend reading the Bible may gradually decrease.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such laziness is versus diligence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In writing the footnotes for the Recovery Version of the New Testament, I scheduled a certain number of chapters per week.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although I often finished my scheduled work before the end of the week, my character caused me to continue working rather than relaxing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before going to bed at night, if we do not put our shoes in the proper place, it indicates that we are lazy and loose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Keeping a clean living place requires a proper character.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who serve the Lord must be diligent in everything, including caring for their appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A brother who does not keep his shoes shined cannot take good care of a church or speak the word of God with impact.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When a person is exact, strict, and diligent, he often becomes narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He does not forgive others or tolerate looseness or laziness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Toward ourselves, we need to be diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Toward others, we need to be broad.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not criticize or condemn others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who are broad are often rough.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be fine is to pay attention to detail.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to have balancing character traits.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to be diligent but not small, broad but not rough.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The third group of character traits is stable, patient, and deep.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The fourth group is pure, just, and calm.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The fifth group is single, corporate, and open.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The sixth group is affectionate, ardent, and accommodating.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The seventh group is strong, pliant, and submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The eighth group is suffering, lowly, and poor.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The ninth group is steadfast, enduring, and bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The tenth group is clear, magnanimous, and grave.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These character traits may serve as a mirror with which we can examine ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may be surprised by the truth about our character.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 1965 I traveled with a group of brothers from the United States to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The brothers in Manila wrote me a letter asking that I send a brother to preach the gospel in English there.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I fellowshipped with one of the brothers who had come with me, and he had the burden to go.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The serving ones in Manila provided him with excellent hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One day when he was out, some sisters went into his room to clean.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They saw many things tossed carelessly about, including a sock that was on a glass on the desk.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This was a great shame.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One with such a character cannot be useful in the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A loose person cannot do a diligent work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A person always works according to his character.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Character is thirty percent nature and seventy percent habit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We receive our nature by birth, but our habit is built by practice.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By birth we may have a quick or slow nature, but our upbringing and culture affect our habits.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As a result, two children with the same disposition, or nature, but raised in different cultures will have different characters.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A slow Chinese person is very different from a slow American.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They may have the same nature by birth but their characters will be different because of their different practices and habits.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our character affects even our walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A diligent person who walks according to the spirit will rise up early to have a time in the Word, but a loose person who walks according to the spirit will rise later and spend a shorter time in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>An elder who talks to another saint may do so according to the spirit but will speak mostly according to the standard of his character.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The same dye applied to different textiles will produce different results.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A green dye applied to silk will produce a shining green color.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, the same dye applied to cotton will produce a dull green color.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The brightness depends not on the dye but upon the quality of the textile.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Similarly, the kind of Christian we are depends not on God s life and nature but on our character.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We all need to walk according to the spirit, but our character will make a great difference in the outcome.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>According to my experience, for the Lord to regenerate a person is easy, but for the Lord to change a person s character is difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We can easily change our mind, but we cannot easily change our character.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Once a habit becomes part of our character, it is difficult to change.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Before the 1953 training on character in Taiwan, I built a co-workers home near the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The first brothers to live in the home attended the 1953 training.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the first year after the training, everything in the home was kept clean, neat, and orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>However, over several years, the home gradually became sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This shows that it is very difficult to change someone s character.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The leading ones in the churches should not assume that because they are elders, their character is up to the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We must be careful not to act, speak, or make decisions loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We need to be genuine, exact, strict, and diligent in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The elders should always arrive at the meetings on time.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the training we require that everyone arrive at the meetings five minutes before the scheduled time.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>However, I have noticed that when the trainees return to their localities, they do not continue to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Character is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Our usefulness to the Lord depends not only on whether we walk according to the spirit but also on our character.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Any regenerated person can walk according to the spirit, but only a person with a proper character can walk according to the spirit well.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The more we walk according to the spirit, the more the resurrected human nature of Christ will saturate our fallen human nature and transform our poor character.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Nevertheless, when we consider the thirty character traits mentioned above, we will see that our character is lacking and may delay our spiritual growth.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This word of inoculation should affect our attitude so that we have no trust in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We all tend to subconsciously appreciate ourselves and not others.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>However, when we consider our character, we will see that there is not much to appreciate.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We may say that we do not lie, steal, or commit gross sins, but we probably cannot say that we have the thirty character traits mentioned above.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We may have a problem with every point.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If we have a proper attitude of humility, the Spirit will have the freedom to saturate us.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>A good gospel message mainly changes the listeners attitude, which enables them to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Formerly, they were self-righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When they are convicted, their attitude changes, and the Spirit has an opportunity to work in them.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The same principle applies throughout our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The earlier we begin to practice to improve our character, the more likely it is that we will receive the mercy and grace to be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We work and take care of the churches mostly unconsciously according to our character.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Two brothers may interpret the Lord s leading in a particular situation differently because their character is different.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Thus, we even understand the Lord s leading mostly according to our character.</S>
