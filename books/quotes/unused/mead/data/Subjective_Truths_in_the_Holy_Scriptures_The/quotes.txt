[2]  This book is a translation of messages given in Chinese by Brother Witness Lee at an international conference held in Taipei, Taiwan in October 1977.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE TRUTHS IN THE HOLY SCRIPTURES Scripture Reading: John 1:12-13; 3:6b; Gal 1:16a; 2:20a; 4:19; Eph 3:16-17a, 19b; 5:30
[4]  Thank the Lord that we can have this conference.
[5]  The first item revealed in the Scriptures is God.
[6]  I want to show you that even though you have been saved, edified, and nurtured in a local church, I know for a fact that even up until tonight in your religious concept, you still consider Jesus Christ as the Lord of all, the great Lord, who is high above.
[7]  In Isaiah 66:1-2 the Lord seemed to say, "Heaven is My throne, and the earth is the footstool for My feet.
[8]  Satan has poisoned you with the poison of religion in that apparently you are worshipping Me, yet in reality you are far away from Me, and you dare not contact Me. I don't want your worship.
[9]  I will now give you another example, and it is concerning both the objective and subjective aspects of the church.
[10]  I think that even today some of you may still have the concept that the meeting hall is the church, and when it is time for the meeting, you say, "Let's go to church."
[11]  If we pay attention only to the objective doctrines and neglect the subjective aspect, we will not be able to fulfill God's eternal purpose, which is the church.
[12]  This is even clearer in chapter fourteen: "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality, He abides with you and shall be in you .In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you" vv.
[13]  It says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
[14]  Therefore, you can see that the beginning is God, the Word is God, God is God, grace is God, and reality is God.
[15]  The True Worship of God Being to Drink of the Spirit
[16]  In chapter four it says, "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness" v. 24 . What is it to worship Him? In this chapter we are told that the real worship of God is not to bow down, to prostrate, before Him but to drink of Him.
[17]  If you really want to render true worship to Him, you need to drink Him.
[18]  The Lord said, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life" v. 63 . The living water is the Spirit, and the bread of life is also the Spirit.
[19]  BEGINNING WITH THE GOD WHO WAS IN THE BEGINNING AND ENDING WITH THE SPIRIT
[20]  Now we understand that the Gospel of John begins with the God who was in the beginning and ends with the Spirit.
[21]  The God who was in the beginning went through incarnation, the death of the Lamb, and resurrection to become the Spirit.
[22]  In this Spirit there is God, there is redemption, there is power, there is resurrection, and there is life.
[23]  We are speaking not of the anointing of oil but the anointing of ointment.
[24]  Today this Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[25]  CHAPTER THREE THE SUBJECTIVE TRUTHS CONCERNING THE CHURCH IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN Scripture Reading: John 12:24; 20:17; 15:5a; 3:28-29; 14:2, 23; 1 Cor 10:17; Heb 2:12; Eph 5:30-32; 1 Tim 3:15a
[26]  The Gospel of John speaks repeatedly about how we should have subjective experiences of the Lord.
[27]  He became the living water that we may drink Him, the bread of life that we may eat Him, and the breath of life that we may breathe Him.
[28]  WE BEING THE MANY BRANCHES OF THE VINE AND THE MANY MEMBERS OF THE BODY
[29]  Third, in John 15 the Lord said, "I am the vine; you are the branches" v. 5a . The branches are not branches if they do not have an absolutely subjective experience of the vine.
[30]  Not only so, if you did not draw near to the Lord, if you did not call on the Lord for a week, and if you did not pray to Him for two weeks, then your love for the church would grow cold.
[31]  THE CHURCH BEING THE FATHER'S HOUSE AND GOD'S DWELLING PLACE
[32]  Chapter fourteen says, "In My Father's house are many abodes" v. 2 . I believe that among you some still hold the old mistaken concept that the Father's house refers to a heavenly mansion.
[33]  As many times as I have read the Scriptures, I have not found any verse that says the Father's house is a heavenly mansion.
[34]  In these twenty-one chapters we are told that one day the God who was in the beginning became flesh to accomplish redemption for our sins as the Lamb of God and that He became the all-inclusive Spirit after His resurrection from the dead.
[35]  CHAPTER FOUR GOD BEING PROCESSED TO BECOME THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Matt 28:19; Acts 19:5; Gal 3:27; Rom 6:3; 1 Cor 12:13, 3; Rom 8:9-10; 9:21, 23; 10:12
[36]  Through the revelation in the New Testament we can clearly see that God's intention is that we experience Him subjectively.
[37]  Since He is the life-giving Spirit, we can receive Him and also enjoy Him, and the result is that the church is produced.
[38]  Therefore, our subjective experience of God is a matter in the Spirit and life, and the issue is the church.
[39]  If you say that He was God, you are absolutely right; if you say that He was man, you are also absolutely right.
[40]  The Lord Jesus said to the twelve disciples, "Do you also want to go away?" v. 67 . Moreover, He said, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing" v. 63 . The Lord was saying, "I can be eaten because I am the Spirit.
[41]  However, my main point is here: Before our Lord Jesus was incarnated, He was the perfect God in eternity.
[42]  This is because the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is too mysterious.
[43]  Your eyes cannot see Him, and your hands cannot touch Him; therefore, if He were not denoted by a name, it would be very difficult to have Him.
[44]  If I say, "I baptize you into the Father, the Son, and the Spirit," you may ask me, "Where is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit?"
[45]  If at this very moment someone is touched and says to me, "I repent and I believe," then I would say to him, "Since you have repented and believed, I will baptize you into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit."
[46]  I truly hope that from now on, whenever there is a baptism in the church, these five items will be pointed out: the name of the Triune God, the name of the Lord Jesus, Christ, His death, and His Body.
[47]  When we immerse people into water, we are baptizing them into the Triune God, into Christ, into the death of Christ, and into the Body of Christ.
[48]  You must have this kind of living authority, living faith, and living assurance: "I am representing the God of all to immerse you, repentant sinners, into Him, into Christ, into His death, and into His glorious Body!"
[49]  First Corinthians 12:13 says, "For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body and were all given to drink one Spirit."
[50]  To be baptized means that you enter into the water, and to drink means that you let the water get into you.
[51]  CHAPTER FIVE LIVING BY CHRIST TO LIVE OUT CHRIST Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 13:5; Col 1:27; Gal 2:20a; 4:19; Eph 3:16-17a, 19b NOT BEING ACCUSTOMED TO LIVE BY CHRIST
[52]  Among us, every one knows this truth: "Christ lives in me."
[53]  This is because to this day we are not accustomed to letting Christ live in us.
[54]  PRACTICING TO GIVE HEED NOT TO PEOPLE, MATTERS, AND THINGS BUT ONLY TO CHRIST
[55]  The measure of the reality, weight, height, and glory of our church life is determined by the extent to which we live by Christ and live out Christ.
[56]  If you have a problem with your husband, forget your husband; if you have a problem with your wife, forget your wife; if you have a problem with your temper, forget your temper; if you have a problem with your circumstance, forget your circumstance.
[57]  THE LORD'S RECOVERY BEING A RECOVERY OF OUR SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF THE LORD
[58]  We all say that we are for the Lord's recovery.
[59]  The Lord's recovery is to recover our subjective experience of the Lord in order that the church can be realized practically.
[60]  With us, how much of the church element there will be, how weighty the church will be, and how high the church life will be all depend on how much Christ is lived out from within us.
[61]  We must be able to say, "It is Christ who lives in me, it is Christ who is being formed in me, and it is Christ who is making home in me.
[62]  CHAPTER SIX SANCTIFICATION, TRANSFORMATION, AND CONFORMATION Scriptures reading: 1 Pet 1:2a; Rom 15:16; 6:19b, 22; 12:2a; 8:29; 2 Cor 3:17-18
[63]  Our knowledge of the Scriptures is often veiled by our natural concepts.
[64]  Based upon the experiences of many years I can say that sanctification is the addition of the divine element into us.
[65]  For example, there are five cups of pure water here, and you can see that they are all the same.
[66]  The subjective experience is that you start by opening yourself to the Lord to let the Lord Spirit enter into you and allow His element to be added into you; thus, you will be separated, distinct, from others, and be no longer common.
[67]  What the Lord wants today is a church like this, where all the members are filled with the Lord Spirit and all their inward parts are also saturated with the Lord Spirit, resulting in every part being conformed to the image of the Lord.
[68]  CHAPTER SEVEN GROWTH AND BUILDING Scripture Reading: Eph 4:15-16, 22-24
[69]  In the past few messages we saw how God was processed to become the life-giving Spirit.
[70]  Regardless of time and place, everyone who has believed in the Lord has been baptized into this Spirit and has been given to drink this Spirit.
[71]  We need to fellowship about them and speak them again and again, so that we may truly understand what it means for us to be baptized into the Triune God, into Christ, into the death of Christ, and into His Body, and to be given to drink one Spirit.
[72]  At this time I want to speak on a few points in Ephesians 4:15-16 and 22-24.
[73]  It is true that we are already in Christ and Christ is already in us, but you must know that in many things you are not in Christ; rather, you are still outside of Him.
[74]  Verse 16 says, "Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together."
[75]  If you have not grown up into Him, how can you be out from Him?
[76]  I would say that if by this time you have grown up into Him, I have grown up into Him, and we all have grown up into the Head, Christ, in all things, then the entire Body now is out from Him, being joined together.
[77]  PUTTING OFF THE OLD MAN AND PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN
[78]  Now we come to see Ephesians 4:22-24, which is connected to 4:15-16.
[79]  Verse 22 says, "That you put off the old man," and verse 23 says, "And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind."
[80]  When you have grown up, it will not matter if the elders make you unhappy or if a certain brother offends you or even if all the angels are rude to you; you will have no way to put off the church life because it will have already grown and become part of you.
[81]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE GREAT MYSTERY OF GODLINESS, GOD MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 3:15-16; Rom 8:30; Col 3:4; 1 Cor 2:7; 1 Pet 5:10a; 2 Thes 1:10
[82]  In these past few days we have seen more and more clearly that the church is the result of our subjective experience of the Lord.
[83]  We have also seen that our subjective experience of the Lord must be entirely in the Spirit and related to life, and it must also be the Lord Himself entering into us not merely as our life but also as the constituent of our spiritual being.
[84]  We can receive Him into us, and He can enter into us as our life and even live in us as our person.
[85]  We are here, not as angels, but as men in the flesh, yet God is manifested in the flesh.
[86]  Some traditional theologians say that God manifested in the flesh refers to the Lord Jesus, who was manifested in the flesh through His incarnation, and that it does not refer to the church.
[87]  When we gave this testimony in America, because we spoke so boldly, some traditional theologians said that we believe in man's evolution into God.
[88]  They say that we who are in the churches believe we all are evolving into God, that our speaking is a high theory of evolution, and that we are making ourselves gods.
[89]  Furthermore, there is still a solid proof which cannot be overturned, and that is the five items which follow "He who was manifested in the flesh": justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory v. 16 . I would ask you, "Was the Lord Jesus taken up in glory before or after He was believed on in the world?" We all know that the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens after His resurrection, so He was taken up in glory before He was preached among the nations and believed on in the world.
[90]  The Lord said, "I am Jesus, whom you persecute" v. 5 . The Lord meant, "When you persecuted Stephen, you were persecuting Me; when you persecute My disciples, you are persecuting Me." Here we clearly see that the Body and the Head are one.
[91]  THE CHURCH BEING THE GREAT MYSTERY OF GODLINESS, GOD MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH
[92]  The church is the reprint of the Holy Spirit with Christ and the place of God's infusion.
[93]  I would ask you, however, "If you are living by your self, and if I am living by my self, and if we all are living by the self, then is the church the manifestation of God in the flesh?"
[94]  Thank the Lord that although I dare not say that every meeting in the local churches is the manifestation of God in the flesh, I do dare to say that many times when the brothers and sisters in the Lord's recovery meet together, even the angels nod their heads and say, "This is God manifested in the flesh."
[95]  The church is the Body, and the Head is Christ, so the manifestation of God in the flesh here is applied to both.
[96]  The Head has already been taken up in glory, but the Body is still on the way of being taken up and has not yet entered into glory.
[97]  You should never think that glory is merely a realm, that today you are a Christian only on earth, but one day the Lord will use His powerful hand to rapture you from the earth to heaven, instantly placing you in glory, at which time you will shine and be glorified.
