<h1 class="title">The Body of Christ&mdash;<br />
the Goal of the Divine Economy</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 1:4; Eph. 1:10, 22-23; 4:4-6</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>God&rsquo;s economy is that God became man so that man may become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead to produce the organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ, which consummates the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rom. 8:3; 1:3-4; 12:4-5; Rev. 21:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The center of God&rsquo;s economy is Christ, and the goal of God&rsquo;s economy is the Body of Christ&mdash;Col. 1:15-19; 2:9, 19.</li>
	<li>The divine economy is God&rsquo;s eternal plan to dispense Christ into His chosen people to produce, constitute, and build up the organic Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 1:10; 3:8-10; 1 Tim. 1:4.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s aim in His economy is to have a group of human beings who have His life and nature inwardly and His image and likeness outwardly; they are a corporate entity, the Body of Christ, to be one with Him and live Him for His corporate expression&mdash;Gen. 1:26; John 3:14; 2 Pet. 1:4; Eph. 4:16.</li>
	<li>The main contents of the New Testament are that the Triune God has an eternal economy according to His good pleasure to dispense Himself into His chosen and redeemed people to make them the same as He is in life and nature and to make them His duplication that they may express Him&mdash;3:9-11, 14-21.</li>
	<li>The divine economy is God and man becoming one entity, one who is God yet man and man yet God&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17; 12:12.</li>
	<li>The issue of God becoming man and man becoming God is an organism; this organism is the mingling of God and man&mdash;the Body of Christ.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The consummation of the believers&rsquo; experience of the grace of God in His economy is the church as the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 1:6-8, 22-23:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Grace is the manifestation of the Triune God in His embodiment in three aspects&mdash;the Father (the source), the Son (the element), and the Spirit (the application)&mdash;1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 8:9; Heb. 10:29.</li>
	<li>Grace denotes the contents of God&rsquo;s eternal economy for the producing of the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem&mdash;2 Cor. 13:14; Eph. 4:4-6; Rev. 21:2.</li>
	<li>What God wants today is that we experience the grace in His economy so that the Divine Trinity may have an organism&mdash;John 1:16; 15:1.</li>
	<li>Every part of the organic Body of Christ is an issue of the grace of God in the economy of God&mdash;Rom. 5:21; 12:3-8.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Body of Christ, the church, is four-in-one: the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and the Body&mdash;Eph. 4:4-6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Ephesians 4:4-6 reveals four persons&mdash;one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father&mdash;mingled together as one entity to be the organic Body of Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>With the Body of Christ, the Father is the origin, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence; these three are mingled with the Body.</li>
		<li>The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is realized as the Spirit, and They are all in us; therefore, we are a divine-human constitution&mdash;3:16-20.</li>
		<li>Because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all one with the Body of Christ, the Triune God and the Body are now four-in-one.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The four-in-one organic entity in Ephesians 4:4-6 corresponds with the golden lampstands in Revelation 1:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In figure, the golden lampstand signifies the church as the embodiment of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The lampstand is of pure gold, signifying the divine, eternal, incorruptible nature of God the Father&mdash;Exo. 25:31; 2 Pet. 1:4.</li>
			<li>The solid form, the shape, of the lampstand signifies God the Son as the embodiment of God the Father&mdash;Exo. 25:31.</li>
			<li>The seven lamps signify God the Spirit being the seven Spirits&mdash;v. 37; Rev. 4:5.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The church is the Triune God completely mingled with His redeemed people to become the lampstands to express God&mdash;1:20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Body of Christ is the fullness of the all-inclusive Christ, the One who fills all in all&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The church is the Body, and the Body is the fullness; these two levels of &ldquo;is&rdquo; are in succession rather than in parallel.</li>
	<li>The Body is the fullness of the Head, and the fullness is the expression of the Head.</li>
	<li>The fullness of Christ issues from the enjoyment of the riches of Christ; the fullness of Christ is Christ experienced by us, assimilated by us, and constituted into our being to become our element&mdash;3:8.</li>
	<li>Christ, as the One who fills all in all, needs the Body to be His fullness; this Body is His church to be His expression&mdash;1:23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ, who is the infinite God without any limitation, is so great that He fills all things in all things.</li>
		<li>Such a great Christ needs the church, His Body, to be His fullness for His complete expression.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to be universal Christians with a universal view of the universal Body of Christ&mdash;vv. 17-23; Acts 10:9-11; Rev. 21:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;What God is doing today is to obtain the Body of Christ, not merely you as an individual, nor merely the church in a locality, nor merely the church in a country. He wants to obtain the church in the entire universe&rdquo; (<em>Words of Training for the New Way,</em> vol. 1, p. 57).</li>
	<li>&ldquo;It is my desire that you see the light, broaden your view, and realize that we are in God&rsquo;s eternal economy, that you would allow God to have the Body of Christ on the earth&rdquo; (p. 58).</li>
	<li>&ldquo;It is not enough for us merely to have a local view, nor is it enough to have an international view. We must have a universal view. We need to see that Christ is after a Body, and God will prepare a Body for Christ&rdquo; (p. 58).</li>

<h1 class="title">The Reality of the Body of Christ</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 26:19; John 16:13; Rom. 8:16;<br />
Phil. 3:10; Eph. 4:15-16, 20-24</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Body of Christ is God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire and His ultimate purpose; only those who have received revelation from God will see and enter into the reality of the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 1:17-18a; 3:9; Acts 26:18-19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The move of God&rsquo;s economy is like the turning of a great wheel, and this turning wheel in God&rsquo;s economy has the Body of Christ as its axis; all of God&rsquo;s move and work today are joined to and for the Body of Christ, the organism of the Triune God&mdash;Ezek. 1:15; Eph. 1:22-23a; Col. 1:17-18; Matt. 16:18.</li>
	<li>The Body of Christ is not a doctrine but a realm; it is not a teaching but a life; only a revelation from God will usher us into the realm of the Body, and only then will the Body of Christ become our experience&mdash;Eph. 1:17-23; 3:14-19.</li>
	<li>The secret of seeing the heavenly vision of God&rsquo;s ultimate purpose is our willingness to pay the price for it&mdash;Matt. 5:3, 8; 6:22; Psa. 25:9, 14; Rev. 3:18.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The heavenly vision that Paul received at the time of his conversion is the vision of God&rsquo;s eternal economy and of the highest peak in God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;the reality of the Body of Christ&mdash;Acts 26:19; 9:1-5, 15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo;&mdash;v. 4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord showed Saul, who became Paul, that he was persecuting the Head when he was persecuting the members of His Body; Paul began to see that the Lord Jesus and His believers are one great person&mdash;the wonderful &ldquo;Me&rdquo;&mdash;vv. 6, 17-18, 24-25; 22:14-16; 1 Cor. 12:12; Col. 3:10-11.</li>
		<li>Paul is the only writer of the New Testament to use the term <em>the Body of Christ,</em> because at the time of his conversion he heard a message concerning the corporate &ldquo;Me,&rdquo; a message concerning the Body of Christ&mdash;Rom. 12:4-5; 1 Cor. 12:12-27; Eph. 1:22-23; 2:16; 4:4, 15-16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;And he said, Who are You, Lord? And He said, I am Jesus, whom you persecute&rdquo;&mdash;Acts 9:5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Paul saw that Jesus is Jehovah the Savior and that as the One who is now in the heavens, He has passed through the process of incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension for the producing and building up of the Body of Christ.</li>
		<li>Paul saw that Jesus is the very God who has been processed and consummated to be the ascended Lord, the Head of the Body, the firstborn Son of God, and the life-giving Spirit to be dispensed into all His members&mdash;Rom. 10:12-13; Col. 1:18a; Rom. 8:29; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;This man is a chosen vessel to Me&rdquo;&mdash;Acts 9:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s intention in saving Saul of Tarsus was to fill him with Himself and thereby make him an outstanding vessel&mdash;Col. 1:25; Eph. 3:8-9.</li>
		<li>Paul saw that man is a vessel to contain and be filled with Christ as life for the building up of the Body of Christ, which is God&rsquo;s great corporate vessel to contain Him and be filled with Him for His expression&mdash;Rom. 9:21, 23; 2 Cor. 4:7; 2 Tim. 2:20-21; Eph. 3:8-11, 16-19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The life of Christ indwelling us is not a &ldquo;member life&rdquo; but a &ldquo;Body life,&rdquo; a corporate life; Christ is <em>our</em> life, the life of the Body, and the mingled spirit is <em>our</em> spirit, the corporate spirit of the Body&mdash;Col. 3:4; Rom. 8:16; 12:4-5; Eph. 4:3-4a, 23; 2:22:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The one who knows the Body merely as a doctrine may seek the counsel and covering of the Body, but he will do it as a matter of policy, not as a matter of life; when he thinks of it, he will do it, but he also can forget about it.</li>
	<li>The one who has seen the Body as a reality and has entered experientially into the realm of the Body has no possibility of forgetting; his acting by the Body principle is something spontaneous because it is his life.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The reality of the Body of Christ is the reality in Jesus, the actual condition of the life of Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels, duplicated in His many members as the corporate living of the perfected God-men&mdash;4:20-21; Gal. 2:20; Phil. 1:19-21a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Jesus lived a life in which He did everything in God, with God, and for God; God was in His living, and He was one with God&mdash;this is the reality in Jesus:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The followers of Christ were discipled through His human living on earth (as the model of a God-man&mdash;living God by denying Himself in humanity&mdash;John 5:19, 30; 6:57a; 14:24), revolutionizing their concept concerning man.</li>
		<li>In the church life we are being discipled by the Lord to be God-men, living the divine life by denying our natural life according to the model of Christ as the first God-man&mdash;Matt. 28:19; 11:29a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The living of the Body of Christ as the new man should be exactly the same as the living of Jesus; the way Jesus lived on earth is the way the Body of Christ as the new man should live today&mdash;Eph. 4:20-24.</li>
	<li>The reality of the Body of Christ is the corporate living of the perfected God-men, a living that is exactly the same as the way Jesus lived on earth; these perfected God-men live a meal-offering church life, a Spirit-filled, resurrection-saturated, cross-purifying human living as a duplication of Christ&rsquo;s human living&mdash;Lev. 2:1-2, 4-5; 1 Cor. 12:12, 24; 10:17.</li>
	<li>These perfected God-men are genuine men, who do not live by their life but by the fully dignified life of the processed God, whose attributes are expressed through their virtues; corporately, they are Jesus living again on the earth in His divinely enriched humanity&mdash;Phil. 1:19-21a; 3:10; 4:5-9, 11-13.</li>
	<li>To be perfected is to be matured by continually exercising to reject the self and live by another life; this is to be conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death by the power of His resurrection&mdash;Matt. 16:24-26; Phil. 3:10; cf. S. S. 2:8-9, 14.</li>
	<li>We need to become a corporate model, the reality of the Body, a people who live the life of a God-man; such a model will be the greatest revival in the history of the church to bring the Lord back&mdash;Matt. 16:18; Rev. 19:7-8.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The reality of the Body of Christ is the Spirit of reality&mdash;Eph. 4:4a; John 14:17; 16:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The reality of all that the Triune God is, has, and can do is this Spirit of reality; the reality of the death and resurrection which the Triune God passed through is also this Spirit of reality&mdash;Phil. 1:19; cf. Exo. 30:22-25.</li>
	<li>This Spirit of reality makes everything of the processed Triune God a reality in the Body of Christ&mdash;John 16:13-15.</li>
	<li>All that the processed Triune God is and has experienced is realized by the Spirit of reality to be the attributes and the experiences of the Body of Christ in reality&mdash;14:17; Eph. 3:16-19.</li>
	<li>The Spirit of reality is the secret to all that the processed Triune God is to the Body of Christ; the Spirit of reality is the totality of all the attributes of the processed Triune God; the Spirit of reality is the effectiveness of all the processes of the processed Triune God&mdash;Phil. 1:19-21a; 4:12; cf. Gen. 17:1.</li>
	<li>The Spirit of reality dwelling in our regenerated spirit is joined as one spirit with our spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:9-11, 16; 1 Cor. 6:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We should have our whole being turned to and set on this joined spirit, living and walking according to this joined spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:4, 6.</li>
		<li>When we thus live in this joined spirit, we live out the reality of the Body of Christ to become the corporate expression of Christ&mdash;Eph. 1:22b-23.</li>
		<li>We must live and speak in the reality of the Body of Christ, that is, in the Spirit; when you are in the Spirit, you are in the oneness, because the oneness is the Spirit&mdash;Gal. 5:25; Rom. 8:4; 2 Cor. 3:6, 8; Eph. 4:3-4.</li>
		<li>To live in the reality of the Body of Christ is to die and be resurrected daily, which is to daily walk in and according to the Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 15:31; 2 Cor. 4:11; 1:8-9; 2:13-14; Rom. 1:9; 8:4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Spirit of reality in us guides us into the reality of the life of the Body of Christ, the reality of living a God-man life by the divine life&mdash;John 16:13.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The reality of the Body of Christ will close this age, the age of the church, and will bring Christ back to take, possess, and rule over this earth with the perfected God-men in the kingdom age&mdash;Matt. 16:18; Rev. 19:7-8.</li>

the Intrinsic Significance of the Church</h1>

1 Cor. 1:2; 12:27</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The economy of God is for the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Tim. 1:4; Eph. 3:9-11; 4:16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The eternal economy of God is to produce an organic Body to be an organism to God for His increase and expression by God becoming man that man might become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead&mdash;Rom. 8:3; 1:3-4; 12:4-5.</li>
	<li>We are here to carry out God&rsquo;s eternal economy with the purpose of gaining the Body for His Son, Christ, and this Body has to be consolidated into the local churches&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; Rom. 12:4-5; 16:1; 1 Cor. 1:2; 12:27.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Body of Christ is the organism of the unseen God; we need to receive a trance and be transferred into another realm to have an intrinsic view of the Body of Christ&mdash;Acts 10:9-10; 22:17; Eph. 1:17-18, 22-23.</li>
<li>All the problems of the church today are due to ignorance concerning the Body of Christ; we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation with the enlightening of the eyes of our heart to see the Body&mdash;Rom. 12:4-5; 1 Cor. 12:24b-27; Eph. 1:17-23.</li>
<li>The church as the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the bride of Christ takes the Body of Christ as its intrinsic factor; the Body is the church, the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the counterpart of Christ&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15; Rom. 14:17; Rev. 19:7.</li>
<li>The Body is the intrinsic significance of the church&mdash;1 Cor. 12:27; 1:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Without the Body of Christ, the church is lifeless and is a mere human organization&mdash;Rom. 12:4-5; 16:1, 16b.</li>
	<li>The church without the Body means nothing; if there were no Body, the church would have no meaning.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The highest peak of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery that can really, practically, and actually carry out God&rsquo;s economy is for God to produce not many local churches in a physical way but an organic Body to be His organism&mdash;Gal. 1:2; Eph. 4:4, 16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The local churches are mainly physical, but they should be for something spiritual, and this spiritual thing is the Body of Christ&mdash;Rom. 16:4, 16; 12:4-5.</li>
	<li>The local churches are not the goal of God&rsquo;s economy but a procedure to reach God&rsquo;s goal&mdash;the universal Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 14:33b; Col. 2:19.</li>
	<li>Eventually, the local churches will be over, and only the Body of Christ will remain forever as the unique tabernacle of God and the unique bride of the Lamb&mdash;Rev. 21:2-3, 9.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>If we see the Body, we will know that there are laws in the Body and that we need to act according to these laws&mdash;1 Cor. 12:14-27; 2 Cor. 10:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God has laws not only on the physical side but also on the spiritual side.</li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s Body is an organic entity, and no part of His Body can be autonomous.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The unique Body of Christ is expressed in many localities as the local churches&mdash;Eph. 4:4; Rev. 1:4, 11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>A local church is an expression of the Body of Christ in a certain locality&mdash;Matt. 16:18; 18:17; 1 Cor. 1:2; 10:32b; 12:12-13, 20, 27.</li>
	<li>The one universal church&mdash;the Body of Christ&mdash;becomes the many local churches&mdash;local expressions of the Body of Christ&mdash;Rom. 12:4-5; 16:16b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Every local church is part of the unique, universal Body of Christ, a local expression of this Body&mdash;1 Cor. 1:2; 12:27.</li>
		<li>Universally, all the local churches are one Body, and locally, every local church is a local expression of the universal Body; therefore, a local church is not the Body but only a part of the Body, an expression of the Body.</li>
		<li>A local church that makes everything local and that expresses only its locality has become a local sect, a local division.</li>
		<li>The local churches are many in existence but are still one Body universally in element&mdash;Gal. 1:2; Eph. 4:4.</li>
		<li>In the eyes of the Lord, all the churches are one, for Christ has only one Body&mdash;Matt. 16:18; Eph. 1:22-23.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The unique Body of Christ is expressed in many local churches (Rev. 1:11-12, 20) in the divine oneness (as it is with the Triune God&mdash;John 17:11, 21, 23) and in the divine nature, element, essence, expression, function, and testimony; there are many churches, but they have one divine nature, one divine element, one divine essence, one divine expression, one divine function, and one divine testimony because they are one Body.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to practice the church life in the consciousness of the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 1:2, 9; 10:16-17; 12:12-27:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In order to have the Body life, we must care for our fellow members and be full of feeling for the Body&mdash;Rom. 12:15; 1 Cor. 12:20-27; Phil. 1:8.</li>
	<li>We should deny ourselves and identify ourselves with the Body&mdash;Matt. 16:24; Rom. 12:4-5, 15; 1 Cor. 1:2; 12:12-27.</li>
	<li>Wherever there is Body revelation, there is Body consciousness, and wherever there is Body consciousness, individual thought and action are ruled out.</li>
	<li>Whatever we do involves the Body; therefore, whenever we do something, we must have a proper consideration of the Body&mdash;2 Cor. 8:21; Eph. 4:16.</li>
	<li>In our consideration the Body should be first and the local churches should be second; we must pay more attention to the Body of Christ than to the local churches&mdash;Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:4, 16; 2:21-22; 1 Cor. 12:12; 1:2.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is based upon the truth that Christ has only one Body&mdash;Eph. 1:23; 4:4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The one Body is the one church, manifested in many localities as many local churches&mdash;1 Cor. 10:32b; Rev. 1:4, 11.</li>
	<li>The Lord desires to recover the Body of Christ and the oneness of the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 4:4.</li>
	<li>The recovery is for the Body; to know the Body is the proper recovery of the Lord&mdash;1:22-23; 4:4, 16.</li>

<li>Romans 4 lays the foundation for Romans 12&mdash;16, where we see the Body life, the kingdom life, and the practical church life; the purpose of God&rsquo;s justification is to have a reproduction of Christ in millions of sons, who become the members of His Body&mdash;4:13; 8:29; 12:4-5.</li>
<li>In His salvation God is making sinners the sons of God to be constituted the Body of Christ for the expression of Christ&mdash;8:14; 12:4-5:

	<li>In order to be the members of the Body of Christ, we need to be conformed to the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God&mdash;8:29; 12:4-5.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The will of God is to obtain a Body for Christ to be His fullness, His expression&mdash;Rev. 4:11; Eph. 1:5, 9; Rom. 12:2, 4-5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In Romans 12 the will of God is that we whom God has chosen, redeemed, justified, sanctified, and conformed unto glorification may be members one of another to have the living of the Body of Christ&mdash;8:29-30.</li>
	<li>To live the Body life is to &ldquo;prove what the will of God is&rdquo;&mdash;12:2, 4-5.</li>

	<li>Romans 12 speaks of the Body from the angle of the organic union, from the uniting life, from the life that unites us together, not only with Christ but with all the other members of Christ&mdash;vv. 4-5.</li>
	<li>We are one Body in Christ, having an organic union with Him; this union makes us one in life with Christ and with all the other members of His Body:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Body is not an organization or a society but is altogether an organism produced by the union in life that we have in Christ&mdash;John 15:1.</li>
		<li>The Body is something that is held together in the organic union with Christ, and the actuality of the Body is the remaining in the organic union with Christ&mdash;vv. 4-5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>If we would live the Body life, a life in the reality of the Body of Christ, we need to live a grafted life&mdash;Rom. 6:5; 11:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God desires that the divine life and the human life be joined together to become one life that has one living; this union in life is a grafted life&mdash;a life in which two parties are joined and grow organically&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
	<li>In the grafted life we no longer live by ourselves but allow the pneumatic Christ to live in us&mdash;Gal. 2:20.</li>
	<li>Through grafting we are united, mingled, and incorporated with Christ to become in Him the organic Body of Christ&mdash;John 15:1, 4-5; Rom. 12:4-5.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order for the Body of Christ to be built up, we need to reign in life, that is, be under the ruling of the divine life&mdash;5:17, 21; 12:1-16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Every aspect of the living of the Body life in Romans 12&mdash;16 requires us to be ruled by the divine life.</li>
	<li>We can live a life of the highest virtues for the Body life only by reigning in life&mdash;12:9-12, 15-16, 18.</li>
	<li>When we are reigning in life, living under the ruling of the divine life, the issue is the real and practical Body life&mdash;5:17, 21; 12:4-5.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Romans begins with the designation of Jesus Christ to be the Son of God for the mass reproduction of the many sons of God as the members of the Body of Christ, and Romans ends with the practice of the local churches as the expression of the Body of Christ&mdash;1:3-4; 8:29; 12:4-5; 16:1, 16b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The local churches are the practical expression of the Body of Christ&mdash;vv. 1-5a, 16b, 23.</li>
	<li>Although the churches appear in different places, they are not separate, and although they are local, they are still part of the unique universal Body of Christ&mdash;12:4-5; 16:16b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>On the one hand, the Body of Christ is expressed in localities city by city as the local churches&mdash;Rev. 1:11.</li>
		<li>On the other hand, because the fellowship of this Body is universal, these local churches are still one&mdash;1 Cor. 10:16; Eph. 4:4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>For the practice of the Body life, all the local churches must receive all genuine believers unconditionally, according to the way God and Christ receive them&mdash;Rom. 14:1-3; 15:5-7.</li>
	<li>Romans 16 displays the real and practical Body life; here we see that all the churches and all the saints live in the universal fellowship of the Body of Christ.</li>
	<li>In his greetings Paul unveiled some crucial indicators of the proper church life both in a particular local church and among the churches: serving the church, risking our lives for the church, having the church in our home, acknowledging that the church is the church of Christ, and extending hospitality to everyone in the church and being a host to all the churches&mdash;vv. 1-5a, 16b, 23.</li>
	<li>We must be governed by the vision of the Body of Christ and follow in the footsteps of Paul (who took the lead in the fellowship of concern among the saints and between the churches), by bringing all the saints in all the churches into the blending life of the entire Body of Christ&mdash;vv. 1-23.</li>
	<li>When we live in the fellowship of the Body of Christ and express this Body in the local churches, the result will be God&rsquo;s crushing Satan under our feet, our enjoying the grace of Christ and the peace of God, and the giving of glory to the only wise God&mdash;vv. 20, 27.</li>

	<li>Without the new covenant ministry, there is no possibility to bring forth the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 4:11-16.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The church of God in Corinth was a local expression of the one unique, universal Body of Christ&mdash;1:22-23; 4:4; 1 Cor. 1:2; 12:27:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The local churches are the many expressions in many localities of the one Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 2:21-22; 4:16; Rev. 1:11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The local churches, being the existence of the Body for its function, are the many expressions of the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 4:4; Rev. 2:1.</li>
		<li>If the Body of Christ is to be expressed, it must become the local churches.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to live a proper church life as a local expression of the Body of Christ to be a local testimony of Christ according to God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;1:11, 20.</li>
	<li>The building up of a local church is not only for its own building up locally but also for the building up of the entire Body universally&mdash;1 Cor. 14:3-4; Eph. 4:12.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>First Corinthians emphasizes the word of the cross, and the cross leads us to the Body&mdash;1:18; 12:12-13, 27:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The cross points us straight to the Body; the knowledge of the cross brings us the knowledge of the Body of Christ&mdash;Rom. 6:6; 8:13; 12:4-5.</li>
	<li>The cross leads to the Body, and the cross operates in the sphere of the Body:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The work of the cross goes as far as the Body of Christ and consummates with the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 1:18, 23; 2:1-2; 12:12-27.</li>
		<li>Not only does the work of the cross bring us into the Body, but also the Body becomes the realm within which the cross works&mdash;Col. 1:20; 3:15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In the Body of Christ we cannot go on without the cross&mdash;Eph. 2:16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The cross will dig away our natural life, our own activities, and any disproportionate growth&mdash;Matt. 16:24-26.</li>
		<li>Life and work in the Body necessitate drastic dealings with the flesh, and such dealings necessitate a deep knowledge of the cross of Christ&mdash;Gal. 5:24.</li>
		<li>The restriction of the Body will take away our freedom and drive us to the cross&mdash;Rom. 12:3; 2 Cor. 10:13-15; Eph. 4:7, 16.</li>
		<li>All of God&rsquo;s dealings with us have been with a view to prepare us for the Body; all of His work in us is a process of elimination so that we can become functioning members of the Body&mdash;Rom. 6:6; 8:13; 12:4-8.</li>
		<li>If our natural life is dealt with by the cross and if we submit to the headship of Christ and live the Body life, we will have the Spirit&rsquo;s anointing and enjoy the fellowship of the Body&mdash;Col. 1:18; 1 Cor. 10:16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The revelation of the Body is very costly, for it touches the spring of our natural life&mdash;Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We will be broken under the vision of the Body, and we will realize that the only way for us to know the Body and to be built up in the Body is to be broken&mdash;Acts 9:3-6.</li>
		<li>The revelation of the Body will mean a revolution in our spiritual life; this revelation will cause us to see that it is only Christ in us, not anything of ourselves, who constitutes us the members of the Body&mdash;Col. 1:27; 3:10-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread&rdquo;&mdash;1 Cor. 10:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The one bread signifies the one Body of Christ; we are all one Body because we all partake of one bread&mdash;5:7-8; 10:3; John 6:35, 51, 56-57; cf. 15:1, 5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The very Christ of whom we all partake constitutes us His one Body.</li>
		<li>When we jointly partake (eat) of the bread, which symbolizes the individual body of Christ, it comes into us to make us one bread, which signifies the corporate Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 12:12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the one grain of wheat, Christ fell into the ground and died and grew up in resurrection to bring forth many believers as the many grains, which are broken, ground, and blended to form one loaf, the Body of Christ&mdash;John 12:24.</li>
	<li>The one bread signifies not only our participation in the life of Christ but also the fellowship of the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 10:16-17.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ&rdquo;&mdash;12:12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This reveals that Christ and the church are the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ.</li>
	<li>Christ in Himself is the Head, and Christ in all of us is the Body&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord Jesus in Himself is the Head, but when He is constituted into us, He is the Body&mdash;Col. 1:18; 2:19; 3:4, 10-11, 15.</li>
		<li>The Head is individual, but the Body is corporate&mdash;1 Cor. 12:12.</li>
		<li>Christ is both the Head and the Body, but we are the Body and cannot be the Head, because the Head is a matter related to the Godhead&mdash;Col. 2:9-10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>All the believers of Christ are organically united with Him and constituted with His life and element and have thus become His Body, an organism to express Him&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17; John 15:1, 4-5; Col. 3:4, 10-11, 15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit&rdquo;&mdash;1 Cor. 12:13:

	<li>Christ is the life and constituent of the Body, and the Spirit is the reality of Christ&mdash;John 14:16-17; 15:26.</li>
	<li>To be baptized in the Spirit is to get into the Spirit and to be lost in Him; to drink the Spirit is to take the Spirit in and to have our being saturated with Him; by these two procedures we are mingled with the Spirit and are thereby constituted into the one Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 12:13, 20, 27.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Each chapter of the book of Ephesians unveils the mystery of the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God from a particular point of view; we must pray for a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that we may see the Body of Christ as the top revelation of the Bible&mdash;1:17-23; 3:3-5, 9-11.</li>
<li>Ephesians 1 reveals that the Body of Christ is the issue of the dispensing of the processed Trinity and the transmitting of the transcending Christ:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Father&rsquo;s dispensing in His choosing and predestinating issues in His many sons as His house in sanctification&mdash;vv. 3-6.</li>
	<li>The Son&rsquo;s dispensing in His redeeming and saving issues in the believers as God&rsquo;s inheritance in transformation&mdash;vv. 7-12.</li>
	<li>The Spirit&rsquo;s dispensing in His sealing and pledging issues in God as the believers&rsquo; inheritance unto their perfection&mdash;vv. 13-14.</li>
	<li>The transcending Christ&rsquo;s transmitting in His rising and ascending issues in His Body as His expression unto the believers&rsquo; consummation&mdash;vv. 19-23.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Ephesians 2 reveals that the Body of Christ is the masterpiece of the Triune God as the one new man&mdash;vv. 10, 15-16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Body of Christ as the one new man is God&rsquo;s masterpiece, His poem, created in Himself through His death and resurrection to express His infinite wisdom and divine design&mdash;vv. 10, 15.</li>
	<li>On the cross Christ created the one new man in Himself by abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, all the forms or ways of living and worship that divide mankind&mdash;vv. 14-16.</li>
	<li>The worldly people regard cultural differences as a source of prestige, but in the Body of Christ as the one new man we have lost this prestige; now our only prestige is Christ and the genuine oneness&mdash;Col. 1:18b; Eph. 4:3-4a.</li>
	<li>In the one new man there is only one person&mdash;the all-inclusive Christ; this one new man has one mouth to speak the same thing in one accord&mdash;2:15; Rom. 15:6; 1 Cor. 1:10.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Ephesians 3 reveals that the Body of Christ becomes the fullness of the Triune God by our being supplied with the riches of Christ and by Christ&rsquo;s making His home in our hearts:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God has an economy to distribute the unsearchable riches of Christ into our being so that we become His fullness, His expression&mdash;vv. 2, 7-9, 19.</li>
	<li>Paul prayed to the Father as the source that He would strengthen us through the Spirit as the means into the inner man that Christ, the Son, would move and work to make His home in our hearts, issuing in our becoming the Body of Christ as the fullness of the Triune God&mdash;vv. 14-19.</li>
	<li>We need to pray daily to be strengthened into our inner man so that the Triune God may carry out His unique work to build Himself in Christ into our hearts for Him to become our intrinsic constitution for the mutual abode of God and man&mdash;vv. 16-17; John 14:23.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Ephesians 4 reveals that the Body of Christ is the mingling of the processed Triune God with the regenerated believers and that this one Body is built up by the one ministry:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father are mingled together with the believers into one entity to be the organic Body of Christ&mdash;vv. 4-6.</li>
	<li>The oneness of the Body of Christ is the oneness of the Spirit, and the oneness of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself, who is in our spirit; in order to keep the oneness, we must stay in our mingled spirit&mdash;vv. 3-4; John 4:24.</li>
	<li>The Body of Christ is built up by the one ministry, which perfects us to grow up into Christ, the Head, in all things and to function out from Him in order to supply the Body for the building up of itself in love&mdash;Eph. 4:11-16.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Ephesians 5 reveals that the Body of Christ is composed of the children of light to be the bride of Christ for the satisfaction of Christ:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We were once not only dark but darkness itself because we were one with Satan; now we are not only the children of light but light itself because we are one with God in the Lord&mdash;v. 8; Matt. 5:14.</li>
	<li>The lampstand signifies that the church as the reproduction of the Triune God is a living, golden tree, blossoming with resurrection life as the shining light, which is the fruit of the light for the full expression of the Triune God&mdash;Exo. 25:31-34; Num. 17:8; Rev. 1:11-12; Eph. 5:9; cf.

<li>Ephesians 6 reveals that the Body of Christ is the corporate warrior of the Triune God for the defeating of God&rsquo;s enemy:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Spiritual warfare is not an individual matter but a matter of the Body; the church as the Body is a corporate warrior, and only the corporate warrior can wear the whole armor of God&mdash;vv. 10-20; cf. Matt. 16:18.</li>
	<li>All warfare has its source in the conflict between Satan&rsquo;s will and God&rsquo;s will; we must have our will subdued and transformed by Christ through sufferings so that it is submitted to the headship of Christ to choose God&rsquo;s will and to be rich in the defending power of Christ in resurrection&mdash;Isa. 14:12-14; Matt. 6:10; 26:42; Phil. 2:13; S. S. 4:1, 4; 7:4a, 5.</li>
	<li>Prayer is the unique, crucial, and vital means by which we apply the whole armor of God, making every item of the armor of God available to us&mdash;Eph. 6:18.</li>
	<li>We fight the spiritual warfare by being empowered in the Lord, God the Son, putting on the whole armor of God, the Father, and wielding the sword of the Spirit; this is our experience and enjoyment of the Triune God even in spiritual warfare&mdash;vv. 10-11, 17-18.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Ephesians reveals that the building up of the Body of Christ is absolutely in our mingled spirit&mdash;the divine Spirit dwelling in our human spirit and mingled together as one spirit&mdash;1:17; 2:22; 3:5, 16; 4:23; 5:18; 6:18.</li>
<li>We need a spirit of revelation, a seeing spirit, to see the Body; whenever we turn to our spirit and exercise our spirit, we touch the Body, because the Body is in our spirit&mdash;1:17; cf. Rev. 1:10, 12; 21:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In order to grow in life, be in the reality of the Body of Christ, and enjoy the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity, we must care for the sanctifying, sealing, and pledging Spirit speaking and working in our spirit&mdash;Eph. 1:3-4, 13-14; 4:30; John 4:24; Rom. 8:4, 6.</li>
	<li>To know God&rsquo;s economy, to receive His dispensing, and to participate in the transmitting of Christ as the resurrecting, ascending, transcending, and heading-up power &ldquo;to&rdquo; the church, we must know, we must use, and we must exercise our spirit&mdash;Eph. 1:19-23; 3:20; Phil. 4:13, 23; cf. Rev. 4:3.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We are &ldquo;being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit&rdquo;&mdash;Eph. 2:22:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Because our spirit is the dwelling place of God, the house of God, it is today&rsquo;s Bethel, the gate of heaven; in our spirit Christ is our indwelling ladder, joining us to heaven and bringing heaven to us, ministering to us the heavenly life, grace, authority, and power to sustain us to live a heavenly life on earth&mdash;Gen. 28:12-17; John 1:51; Col. 3:1-2; Rom. 8:10, 34; Eph. 2:6.</li>
	<li>Our spirit is where the building up of the church takes place; as long as we stay outside of the spirit, we are divided, divisive, and individualistic; if we stay in the life-giving Spirit in our spirit, we keep the oneness of the Spirit for the building up of the one Body&mdash;John 4:24; Eph. 4:3-4a.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We must pray &ldquo;to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man,&rdquo; that Christ may make His home in our hearts; our inner man is our regenerated spirit, which has God&rsquo;s life as its life, and our heart is composed of all the parts of our soul&mdash;the mind, the emotion, and the will&mdash;plus our conscience, the main part of our spirit&mdash;3:16-17a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The book of Ephesians is the heart of the Bible, and the heart and key of this book is 3:16-19; these verses reveal that the key to the building up of the Body of Christ is the inner experience of Christ as our life.</li>
	<li>When we are strengthened into our inner man through our prayer, Christ makes His home in our hearts, controlling our entire inward being and supplying and strengthening every inward part with Himself&mdash;v. 17a.</li>
	<li>Being strengthened with power into the inner man causes us to be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints the unlimited dimensions of Christ as the breadth, length, height, and depth so that we experience Him as the universal &ldquo;cube&rdquo; in a three-dimensional way to be balanced by the Body and kept and solidified in the &ldquo;cube&rdquo; of our spirit, the church, and the New Jerusalem as the reality of the Holy of Holies&mdash;v. 18; Exo. 26:2-8; 1 Kings 6:20; Rev. 21:16.</li>
	<li>This results in our knowing the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God; we are receiving Him as grace upon grace that we may be filled with His riches to become the full expression of God for His glory in the church&mdash;John 1:16; Eph. 3:18-21.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We must be renewed in the spirit of our mind, allowing our mingled spirit to spread into our mind so that our mind is governed, possessed, occupied, taken over, controlled, and subdued by our mingled spirit&mdash;4:23:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To be renewed in the spirit of our mind is to get rid of all the old concepts concerning the things of the human life and be made new again by the teaching of the Holy Scriptures and the enlightening of the Holy Spirit&mdash;Luke 24:45; Eph. 1:18; Psa. 119:18.</li>
	<li>To be renewed in the mind we must set our mind on the spirit, paying attention to our spirit to be dominated, governed, led, controlled, and directed by our mingled spirit to be Christ&rsquo;s captives in His triumphal procession&mdash;Rom. 8:6; 1 Cor. 2:15; 2 Cor. 2:13-14.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We must be filled in our spirit with Christ as the Spirit unto all the fullness of God&mdash;Eph. 5:18; 3:19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To be drunk with wine in the body dissipates us, but to be filled in spirit causes us to overflow with Christ in speaking, singing, psalming, giving thanks to God, and subjecting ourselves to one another&mdash;5:18-21.</li>
	<li>The issue of our being filled in spirit is that we will have spirit-filled ethical relationships for the expression of the Body in the normal church life; the proper daily life and family life is the issue of being filled in spirit&mdash;5:22&mdash;6:9.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We must receive the word of God by means of all prayer, &ldquo;praying at every time in spirit&rdquo;&mdash;vv. 17-18:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When we exercise our spirit to pray over and with God&rsquo;s word, His word as the sanctifying Spirit beautifies us to be His bride, cleansing us by the washing of the water in the word to make us Christ&rsquo;s glorious church&mdash;5:26-27.</li>
	<li>By praying in spirit we apply Christ as the whole armor of God, and our spiritual fighting becomes our enjoyment of Christ as He spreads a table before us in the presence of our adversaries for us to feast on Him with His riches&mdash;6:10-11, 18; Psa. 23:5.</li>
	<li>When we exercise our spirit to pray over and with God&rsquo;s word, His word slays the adversary in us, killing the negative elements within us, such as hatred, jealousy, pride, and doubts; as we pray-read the word, eventually the self, the worst foe of all and the enemy of the Body, will be put to death, and Christ will be victorious in our entire being in His victory in the Body&mdash;Eph. 6:17-18.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We look to the Lord for His mercy that we may always care for our mingled spirit and the Body; to be in our spirit and in the unique oneness of the Body is to be kept in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery&mdash;John 4:24; Eph. 4:3-4a.</li>

	<li>The unique oneness of the Body of Christ is &ldquo;the oneness of the Spirit&rdquo;&mdash;Eph. 4:3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Spirit is the essence of the Body of Christ; hence, the Spirit is the reality of the oneness of the Body of Christ&mdash;1 John 5:6; John 16:13.</li>
		<li>This is a oneness of the mingling of the processed Triune God with all the believers in Christ&mdash;17:6, 11, 14-23.</li>
		<li>This oneness was imparted into the spirit of the believers in Christ, in the regeneration by the Spirit of life with Christ as life&mdash;3:5-6; Rom. 8:2.</li>
		<li>We need to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace with the transformed human virtues&mdash;Eph. 4:1-3.</li>
		<li>The ground of a local church is the unique oneness of the Body of Christ, that is, the oneness of the Spirit&mdash;v. 3.</li>
		<li>All the local churches need to be kept in the unique oneness of the Body of Christ&mdash;Rev. 1:11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The oneness of the Body of Christ is actually the triune, organic, living God Himself&mdash;Eph. 4:4-6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The issue of the one God and Father, the one Lord, and the one Spirit is one organism&mdash;the Body of Christ&mdash;1:3-23.</li>
		<li>The oneness of the Body of Christ is unique because it is a oneness in the uniqueness of the Triune God&mdash;John 17:6, 11, 14-23:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God the Father is the source as our nature and life, God the Son is the element of this nature and life, and God the Spirit is the essence of the element&mdash;Eph. 4:4-6.</li>
			<li>Because we have the Triune God within us as the source, the element, and the essence, we are one.</li>
			<li>In this oneness with the Triune God, we have oneness with one another; this is the oneness of the Body of Christ.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Because the Body of Christ is the mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed and transformed people, the Body itself is the oneness&mdash;vv. 3-6.</li>
	<li>All the believers should be in the divine and mystical realm of the pneumatic Christ and the consummated Spirit to be mingled with the Triune God for the keeping of the oneness&mdash;John 17:21-23; Eph. 4:3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Our oneness must be the same as the oneness among the three of the Triune God; actually, our oneness is the oneness of the Triune God&mdash;John 17:21-23.</li>
		<li>Our oneness should be in the Triune God, with the pneumatic Christ and the consummated Spirit; to have such a oneness we must be in the Triune God as a divine and mystical realm.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Since the Body of Christ is uniquely one universally, the fellowship of the Body of Christ is also uniquely one universally&mdash;Acts 2:42; 1 John 1:3, 7; 1 Cor. 10:16-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Just as there is the circulation of blood in the human body, so there is a circulation in the Body of Christ&mdash;a circulation which the New Testament calls fellowship&mdash;1 John 1:3, 7.</li>
	<li>The fellowship of the Body of Christ is the stream of the divine life; as the stream of the divine life flows within us, there is the fellowship of the Body of Christ&mdash;Acts 2:42; 1 John 1:3, 7.</li>
	<li>The divine fellowship is the reality of living in the Body of Christ; by being restricted in this fellowship, the Body of Christ is kept in oneness&mdash;1 Cor. 1:9; 12:12-13, 27.</li>
	<li>The unique fellowship of the Body of Christ is related to the unique oneness of the Body of Christ&mdash;6:17; 10:16-17; 12:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The fellowship, the circulation, of the divine life in the Body brings all the members of the Body into oneness&mdash;Eph. 4:3-6.</li>
		<li>This oneness is the oneness of the Spirit and also the oneness of the Body of Christ&mdash;vv. 3-4; 1 Cor. 12:12-13.</li>
		<li>The unique fellowship is the genuine oneness of the Body of Christ as the unique ground for the believers to be kept one in Christ&mdash;Eph. 4:3-6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The fellowship among the churches is the fellowship of the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 10:16-17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Because there is one Spirit, there is only one Body, and there is only one circulation of life in the Body; this circulation is the fellowship of the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 4:4; 1 John 1:3, 7.</li>
		<li>A local church is a part of the unique Body of Christ, and the fellowship of the Body is universally one; in fellowship there is no separation&mdash;Rev. 1:11; 2:7a.</li>
		<li>No church or region should isolate itself from the fellowship of the Body.</li>
		<li>The local churches should fellowship with all the genuine local churches on the whole earth to keep the fellowship of the Body of Christ&mdash;Col. 4:16.</li>
		<li>Among all the churches that compose the one universal Body of Christ, there is no organization, but there is the fellowship of the Body of Christ&mdash;Phil. 1:5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Whenever we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table, we come to practice the fellowship of the Body&mdash;1 Cor. 10:16-17; 11:24-26:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s table is a testimony that we who belong to Christ are one.</li>
		<li>If we isolate ourselves from the fellowship of the Body, we are not qualified to partake of the Lord&rsquo;s body, because the loaf on the table in the Lord&rsquo;s supper signifies the entire Body of Christ.</li>
		<li>As we enjoy Christ in partaking of His blood and body at His table, we express and practice the fellowship of the Body of Christ, the unique fellowship among the churches&mdash;Acts 2:42; 1 John 1:3, 7; Phil. 1:5; 2:1.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Organic Building Up of the Body of Christ<br />
through the Practice of the Scriptural Way<br />
to Meet and to Serve</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:9; 4:11-16; 1 Cor. 14:24-26, 31</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>&ldquo;God is doing the work of His recovery, and His recovery is to build up the Body of Christ...He is recovering the organic building up of the Body of Christ by the speaking of His ministry&rdquo; (<em>Elders&rsquo; Training, Book 9, The Eldership and the God-ordained Way (1),</em> p. 84).</li>
<li>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we practice the genuine church life, caring for the all-inclusive Christ, the consummated Spirit, the eternal life, and the divine truths and endeavoring to escape from organization, dogmatic regulations, rituals, the clerical system, and traditions so that there will be the function of all the members of Christ in the church life for the building up of the Body of Christ in God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;Eph. 3:9; 4:16.</li>
<li>In our practice of the scriptural way to meet and to serve, we need to see that the Body is the basic principle of the church, the ministry, and the work&mdash;1:22-23; 4:1, 4, 16; 1 Cor. 12:4-6, 12-13, 27:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The church, the ministry, and the work are all on the ground of the Body and derive their existence from, find their place in, and work for the good of the Body&mdash;Rom. 12:4-5; Col. 2:19; 3:15.</li>
	<li>The churches are the Body expressed locally, the ministry is the Body in function, and the work is the Body seeking increase&mdash;Acts 13:1-2; 21:19.</li>
	<li>The church is the life of the Body in miniature, the ministry is the functioning of the Body in service, and the work is the reaching out of the Body in growth&mdash;1 Cor. 1:2; 12:27; 16:10; 2 Cor. 3:6.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to practice the scriptural way to meet and to serve for the building up of the Body of Christ, we need a clear vision of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;1 Tim. 1:4; Eph. 3:9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to dispense the riches of Christ into God&rsquo;s chosen and redeemed people&mdash;v. 8.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to have a people to be the Body of Christ for a corporate expression of the Triune God&mdash;1:23; 3:19.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is for the heading up of all things in Christ through the church as the Body of Christ&mdash;1:10.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The meetings of the believers should always be linked to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;1 Tim. 1:4; 1 Cor. 14:26:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We should come to the meetings with a vision of the divine economy, and what we speak in the meetings should focus on the economy of God&mdash;Eph. 3:9.</li>
	<li>The Christian meetings are to make God&rsquo;s economy in His fatherhood known to the believers for the praise of the Father; our meeting is for the magnification and glorification of the begetting Father as the source of the Divine Trinity&mdash;Heb. 2:12; Rom. 11:36; 1 Cor. 8:6a; Eph. 4:6.</li>
	<li>Our meeting is a stewardship, a service, to carry out God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;3:2.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The practice of the scriptural way to meet and to serve delivers the believers from hierarchy, the papal system, and the clergy-laity system for the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;Rev. 2:6, 15; Rom. 12:4-6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s intention in His economy is to have an organic Body built up for Christ&mdash;Eph. 3:9; 4:16.</li>
	<li>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is for the annulling of the clergy and laity and the developing of the gifts, functions, and capacity of all the members of the organic Body of Christ&mdash;Rev. 2:6, 15; Eph. 4:11-16.</li>
	<li>The scriptural way to meet and to serve is the proper practice of the church life against the papal and clergy-laity systems&mdash;Matt. 20:25-28:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The goal of the papal and clergy-laity systems is to annul the Body of Christ and to replace it with religion.</li>
		<li>The recovery according to the Lord&rsquo;s mind is to bring His believers out of the papal system and the clergy-laity system and to replace these systems with the scriptural way to meet and to serve for the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 14:26; Eph. 4:16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Through the practice of the scriptural way to meet and to serve, the Lord is recovering four major items:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord desires to recover the priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament&mdash;1 Pet. 2:5, 9.</li>
	<li>The Lord desires to recover the organic building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:12, 16; Col. 2:19.</li>
	<li>The Lord desires to recover the perfecting of the common members of the Body of Christ to make them living, active, functioning members of the Body&mdash;Eph. 4:11-16; Heb. 10:24-25.</li>
	<li>The Lord desires to recover the church meetings in mutuality with all speaking for the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 14:4b, 23a, 26, 31.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the practice of the scriptural way to meet and to serve, we emphasize prophesying&mdash;the excelling gift for the building up of the church&mdash;vv. 1, 4b, 24-25, 31:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The significance of prophesying in 1 Corinthians 14 is to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, and even to speak the Lord, to minister, to dispense, the Lord, into others; in the sense of the divine dispensing, the entire Bible consummates in all prophesying&mdash;vv. 3, 24-25, 31.</li>
	<li>Prophesying, speaking for God and speaking forth God with God as the content, ministers God to the hearers and brings them to God&mdash;v. 25.</li>
	<li>God desires that each of the believers prophesy, that is, speak for Him and speak Him forth&mdash;vv. 1b, 31; cf. Num. 11:29.</li>
	<li>The characteristic of prophesying is to minister Christ for the organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ; prophesying is the particular gift for the building up of the church&mdash;1 Cor. 14:3-5, 12, 24, 26.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to build up Zion; as the highlight and beauty of the holy city, Jerusalem, Zion typifies the overcomers as the reality of the Body of Christ, the high peak, the center, the uplifting, the strengthening, the enriching, the beauty, and the reality of the church&mdash;Psa. 48:2, 11-12; 50:2; 20:2; 53:6a; 87:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The overcomers as Zion consummate the building up of the Body in the local churches to bring in the consummated holy city, New Jerusalem, the Holy of Holies as God&rsquo;s dwelling place in eternity&mdash;Rev. 2:7; 21:1-3, 16, 22.</li>
	<li>The overcomers are Body conscious and Body centered; they are daily saved in Christ&rsquo;s life by the Spirit through the work of the cross from every aspect of the self, the enemy of the Body&mdash;Rom. 5:10; Matt. 16:24; cf. <em>Hymns,</em> #280.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The overcomers see the Body, know the Body, care for the Body, honor the Body, and do the work of the Body; they keep every principle of the Body of Christ, as the continuation and extension of Christ on earth, for the full expression of Christ&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; 3:18-19; 4:1-6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We must see the crystallized significance of the Body of Christ; this crystallized significance is that the Triune God and His chosen and redeemed people are constituted into one entity, which is the Body of Christ&mdash;vv. 4-6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The oneness of the Body is the oneness of the Triune God, and the coordination of the Body is the coordination of the Triune God&mdash;John 17:21; Eph. 4:3-6; Matt. 12:28; Heb. 9:14; Psa. 133.</li>
		<li>This oneness and coordination are in the Spirit, who is the reality of the Triune God and of the Body; since this Spirit is in our spirit, whatever we are, whatever we have, and whatever we do must be by the Spirit in our spirit for the Body&mdash;John 16:13-15; Phil. 3:3; Rom. 1:9; Eph. 4:1-4a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We must receive and enjoy the supply of the Body&mdash;Phil. 1:19; Col. 2:19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Because the Head is Christ, and the Body is also Christ, to refuse the help of our fellow members is to refuse the help of Christ; therefore, we must allow the members of the Body to minister to our needs&mdash;1 Cor. 12:12-22.</li>
		<li>The prayer of the Body renders the life supply, the supply of the Body, to the members in need so that they may live Christ for His magnification&mdash;Phil. 1:19-20; Acts 12:5, 12; Eph. 6:18-20; 1 Thes. 5:25.</li>
		<li>The fellowship of the Body renders the life supply, the supply of the Body, to the members in need so that they may enjoy Christ as the light of life for His glorification&mdash;1 John 1:3-5; John 1:4-5; Phil. 2:15; Isa. 60:1, 3, 5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We must experience the protection, limitation, and ministry of the Body:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Body of Christ puts on the whole armor of God, which is the totality of all the specialties of the members; spiritual warfare is an integrated warfare of all the members, not the isolated warfare of individuals, so we must all hide under the Body&rsquo;s protection and accept its safeguard&mdash;Eph. 6:10-20; Matt. 16:18; Exo. 17:11-13; Acts 9:25; 2 Cor. 11:33; Deut. 32:30a.</li>
		<li>As members of the Body, we must see our position in the Body and allow ourselves to be limited by the other members; we must be delivered from our individualistic life and function in the Body according to God&rsquo;s will and measure&mdash;1 Cor. 12:14-22; Eph. 4:7, 16; 2 Cor. 10:13-15.</li>
		<li>As members of the Body, we should fellowship and function in the Body to be channels of life to supply the other members; this kind of supply is the ministry, the function, of the members so that the life of the Body can flow in an unhindered way&mdash;1 John 1:3; Rom. 12:5; 1 Cor. 14:4b, 31.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We must honor Christ as the Head of the Body, the authority in the Body; the authority of the Head is the oneness of the Body&mdash;Col. 1:18; 2:19; Eph. 4:15-16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord has given us His life of submission to the Father; when we are filled with Christ as the Spirit of life, we are filled with Him as our submission&mdash;John 5:19, 30; 7:18; Phil. 2:5-8; Rom. 8:2; cf. Exo. 21:1-6.</li>
		<li>The Spirit is the &ldquo;nerve fiber&rdquo; of the Body of Christ, carrying the thoughts of the Head to all the members; when we yield to the authority of the Spirit, we are yielding to the Head&mdash;Rom. 8:27, 6; 1 Cor. 2:16; Eph. 4:30.</li>
		<li>Since the Christ we enjoy as our everything is the Head of the Body, the more we enjoy Him, the more we become Body conscious and the more we love the other members of the Body&mdash;Col. 1:4, 8; 2:19.</li>
		<li>Since we are members of the Body of Christ, we should have a feeling for the Body, taking the feeling of the Head as our own feeling&mdash;Phil. 1:8; 1 Cor. 12:25b-26.</li>
		<li>Only the Lord is our Head, and only He has the authority to direct the moves of the members of His Body&mdash;Acts 2:36; 9:5; Col. 1:17-18.</li>
		<li>Because Christ is our Head, we do not exalt ourselves and do not seek to please ourselves or others; we seek to please Him alone&mdash;2 Cor. 4:5; 5:9.</li>
		<li>We hold Christ as our Head by giving Him the preeminence in all things and staying intimately connected to Him by consulting Him in all things, growing up into the Head in all things for the growth of the Body, and functioning out from the Head by all means for the supply of the Body&mdash;Col. 2:19; Eph. 4:15-16.</li>
		<li>When we hold Christ as the Head, we cannot have different interpretations of the Scriptures, because the Body has one mouth to speak the same thing that the Head speaks; the unique teaching of the Head is the teaching of God&rsquo;s economy by the one ministry for the building up of the Body&mdash;Rom. 15:6; 1 Cor. 1:10; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; Eph. 4:12.</li>
		<li>The mutual relationship of the members of the Body passes through the Head first; thus, when we hold the Head, we cannot have a natural relationship or special fellowship with any individual or group; when we hold the Head, we are blended together, and our relationship with the Body is out from the Head in the divine oneness&mdash;1 Cor. 12:24-25; Phil. 2:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Everything we have is in the Body, through the Body, and for the Body; may the Lord have mercy upon us and grace us in making a resolution to be the overcomers who keep every principle of the Body for the building up of the Body to consummate the New Jerusalem&mdash;Judg. 5:15-16; Rev. 21:2.</li>

	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Head of the Body is Christ, and the Body of the Head is Christ, so the Body of Christ with Christ as the Head is &ldquo;the Christ,&rdquo; the corporate Christ&mdash;Col. 1:18; 1 Cor. 12:12; Col. 3:10-11.</li>
	<li>Anything other than Christ is not the Body of Christ, and anything other than Christ is a foreign element in the Body of Christ; thus, we must be desperate as Paul was to live Christ for the building up of the Body&mdash;Phil. 1:19-21a; 3:8-14.</li>
	<li>All things other than the pure element of Christ are ruled out by this vision; this vision &ldquo;paralyzes&rdquo; us from exercising anything of our natural man&mdash;v. 3.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To live Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ is to be imprisoned in our spirit as a &ldquo;prisoner of Christ Jesus,&rdquo; a &ldquo;prisoner in the Lord,&rdquo; and an &ldquo;ambassador in a chain&rdquo;&mdash;Eph. 3:1; 4:1; 6:20; 2 Cor. 5:20; cf. vv. 4, 9, 14, 16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When we are imprisoned in Christ, we receive a revelation of Him to experience Him in His unlimited dimensions as the church-loving Christ, the new-man-creating Christ, the all-things-heading-up Christ, the gift-making and gift-giving Christ, and the home-making Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 3:18; 5:25-27; 2:15-16; 1:20-23; 4:7-8, 11-12; 3:17a.</li>
	<li>A person who lives Christ as an ambassador of Christ no longer has his own freedom and can no longer do things according to his own convenience; where he goes and what he does are not according to his choice but are under and according to the leading and directing hand of God&mdash;Ezek. 1:1-3; John 7:6, 8.</li>
	<li>To live Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ is to be a captive of Christ in His triumphal procession, doing everything in the person of Christ in our spirit for the celebration of His victory in the work of the ministry to speak in Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 2:13-17.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Body of Christ is the issue of the experience of Christ, so we need to pray desperately that we would live Christ for the Body of Christ to be a reality; the secret of how to live Christ for the reality of the Body of Christ is in Romans 8, which is a definition, description, explanation, and presentation of the law of the Spirit of life&mdash;v. 2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Romans 8 uses this term&mdash;<em>the law of the Spirit of life</em>&mdash;to describe how the Triune God, after having been processed and consummated to become the life-giving Spirit, has been installed into our spirit as a law, a spontaneous, automatic principle and power within us; this is one of the biggest discoveries, even recoveries, in God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;vv. 2-3, 11, 16.</li>
	<li>We need to cooperate with the installed and operating law of the Spirit of life by &ldquo;switching on&rdquo; the spontaneous and automatic power of the installed and automatic God, the indwelling Spirit as the &ldquo;current&rdquo; of the Triune God; to &ldquo;switch on&rdquo; this law is to remain in touch with the Lord, to stay in constant contact with Him, to have habitual fellowship with Him, and to be under His constant infusion by walking according to the spirit&mdash;Phil. 2:13; Eph. 6:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To behave, act, move, and live in the mingled spirit, which is the law of the Spirit of life mingled with our spirit, is to behave, act, move, and live in the Body of Christ&mdash;Rom. 8:4.</li>
		<li>In our spirit we have the presence of God, the speaking of God, the meeting with God, and the dispensing of God through His operation as the law of the Spirit of life to impart Himself into all our inward parts&mdash;Heb. 8:10.</li>
		<li>To walk according to the spirit is to pray at every time in spirit&mdash;Eph. 6:18:

			<li>We need to exercise our spirit to rise up over our body and our psychology, taking heed to the Lord&rsquo;s word to watch and pray, praying at every time in spirit and being watchful, on the alert, for the maintaining of our prayer life&mdash;Matt. 26:41; Eph. 6:18.</li>

			<li>Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles may be summarized by two words: <em>open vessel&mdash;</em> Rom. 9:21, 23; 2 Cor. 4:7.</li>
			<li>We need to enjoy and love the Lord to the uttermost, keeping ourselves entirely, thoroughly, and absolutely open to Him, allowing Him to be everything to us and do everything in us, through us, and for us for the sake of His Body&mdash;1 Cor. 1:9; 2:9; cf. 16:22.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The operating of the law of the Spirit of life as the divine capacity within us spontaneously causes us to live God and become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead&mdash;Ezek. 36:27; Rom. 8:2, 29; Eph. 1:22-23; 3:19-21.</li>
	<li>The operating of the law of the Spirit of life as the divine capacity within us spontaneously constitutes us to be the members of the Body of Christ with all kinds of functions, so that all the Body causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love&mdash;4:11-12, 16.</li>

<h1 class="title">Living Out and Working Out the New Jerusalem<br />
by the Mingling of God with Man<br />
for the Oneness of the Body of Christ</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:15-16; Col. 2:19; Psa. 36:8-9;<br />
Rev. 2:7; 21:18-23; 22:1-5</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>To live out the New Jerusalem is to grow up &ldquo;into the Head&rdquo; by the mingling of God with man, and to work out the New Jerusalem is to function &ldquo;out from the Head&rdquo; for the oneness of the Body of Christ&mdash;Lev. 2:4-5; John 6:57; 7:37; 17:21, 23; Eph. 4:3-4a, 11-16; Col. 2:19; 1 Cor. 3:6-12a; 10:3-4, 17; 12:12-13; Rev. 2:7; 21:9-11; 22:14, 17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s desire is to gain the New Jerusalem through the precursor of the organic Body of Christ produced in the local churches&mdash;2:7; 12:5; 14:1-4.</li>
	<li>Eventually, the local churches will be over; only the Body of Christ will remain forever as the unique mutual abode of God and man so that God and man are married together, mingled and incorporated together, to be one entity, a great corporate God-man&mdash;1:11-12; 21:2-3, 22; 22:17a.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Whatever is ascribed to the New Jerusalem should be both our personal and corporate experience for us to become the New Jerusalem and build the New Jerusalem by the mingling of God with man for the oneness of the Body of Christ to fulfill the eternal purpose of God:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The New Jerusalem is the totality of the overcomers; a remnant of the Lord&rsquo;s believers, the earlier overcomers, will be the bride of Christ for one thousand years (19:7-9; 20:4, 6); then they will join the rest of the Lord&rsquo;s believers, the later overcomers, to be the wife of Christ for eternity (21:2-3, 7):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The earlier overcomers, as the reality of Zion within Jerusalem, the reality of the Body of Christ within the church, have highways to Zion in their heart; they take the way of the church internally by being incorporated into God as their dwelling place through the crucified Christ, typified by the bronze altar as their nest for their refuge, and through the resurrected Christ in ascension, typified by the incense altar as their home for their rest&mdash;Psa. 48:2; 84:3-5; cf. Prov. 27:8.</li>
		<li>To overcome means that we love the Lord more than our self, more than our soul-life; an overcomer knows and loves only Christ for the Body of Christ&mdash;Phil. 3:10; 4:12; Rev. 2:4, 7; 12:11.</li>
		<li>The Lord is waiting for a group of overcomers to live out the reality of the Body of Christ in resurrection to become the bride of Christ to bring Him back and to usher in His kingdom age; for this we need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, may I receive Your mercy and grace to be one of Your overcomers.&rdquo;</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To live out and work out the New Jerusalem as the reality of the Body of Christ, we must hold on to this principle: God&rsquo;s presence is the criterion for every matter&mdash;21:22; 22:4; Exo. 25:30; Psa. 27:4-5, 8; 31:20; 91:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The New Testament commences with the individual Christ as the God-man, &ldquo;God with us,&rdquo; and ends with the New Jerusalem as the corporate Christ, as the great God-man, &ldquo;Jehovah Is There&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 1:23; Ezek. 48:35.</li>
		<li>The Spirit is the presence of Christ with our spirit; we must live and act in the person of Christ, in the presence of Christ, according to the index of His whole person, expressed in His eyes&mdash;2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:16; 2 Cor. 3:17-18; 2:10, 13; Exo. 33:11a, 14-17; 1 Cor. 14:24-25; cf. Rev. 5:6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To live out and work out the New Jerusalem as the reality of the Body of Christ, we must be under the throne of God, the ruling of God&mdash;22:1, 3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Sin is lawlessness, a dethronement of God; we need to dethrone ourselves, humble ourselves, to live in our spirit, coordinate with the saints for God&rsquo;s move, and maintain a &ldquo;clear sky&rdquo; in our Christian life and church life in order to be filled with God&rsquo;s ruling presence of reigning grace&mdash;1 John 3:4; Ezek. 1:13-16, 22, 26; Rom. 5:21; Rev. 4:1-3; 22:1; cf. 1 Kings 10:18.</li>
		<li>To reach this point means that in everything we allow God to have the preeminence and are completely submissive to His authority and administration so that He can fulfill His eternal purpose in us, through us, and with us&mdash;Rom. 5:17; Matt. 8:9; Rom. 14:17; cf. Num. 17:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To live out and work out the New Jerusalem as the reality of the Body of Christ, we must have the flow and supply of life&mdash;Rev. 22:1-2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The flowing river of life and the edible tree of life should be the outstanding features of our Christian life and church life for the enjoyment of God as our real Eden, our pleasure, entertainment, and joy&mdash;<em>Hymns,</em> #509; Gen. 2:8-10; Psa. 36:8-9; 43:4a; Neh. 8:10.</li>
		<li>To drink one Spirit is to be mingled with the Spirit as the oneness of the one Body; this requires us to call on the Lord continually and draw water with joy from Him as the fountain of living water&mdash;1 Cor. 12:12-13; Eph. 4:3-4a; Isa. 12:3-4; Jer. 2:13; John 4:10, 14; 7:37-39; Rev. 22:17.</li>
		<li>To eat the tree of life, that is, to enjoy Christ as our life supply, should be the primary matter in the church life; to enjoy Christ requires us to love Him with the first love; loving the Lord, enjoying the Lord, and being the testimony of the Lord go together&mdash;2:4, 7; 22:14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To live out and work out the New Jerusalem as the reality of the Body of Christ, we must be full of the light of life&mdash;21:11, 23; 22:5; Luke 11:33-36:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The light of the New Jerusalem is God as the illuminating glory shining out through Christ the Redeemer as the lamp, and the entire holy city is the diffuser of the divine light; today this diffuser to spread the divine light is the Body of Christ&mdash;Rev. 21:23-24a; 22:1, 5; 21:11; Eph. 5:8-9.</li>
		<li>Light is the presence of God; we enjoy Christ as our God-allotted portion in the light to deliver us from the authority of darkness, the kingdom of Satan, and to transfer us into the kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love&mdash;Col. 1:12-13; Acts 26:18; Rom. 13:11-14; cf. Mark 9:2-8.</li>
		<li>The light of God is in the sanctuary, God&rsquo;s dwelling place, which is our spirit (Eph. 2:22) and the church (1 Tim. 3:15); in our spirit and in the church we receive divine revelation and obtain the explanation to all our problems (Psa. 73:16-17, 22-26).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To live out and work out the New Jerusalem as the reality of the Body of Christ, we must partake of God the Father in His divine nature, typified by the gold as the base of the city&mdash;2 Pet. 1:4; Rev. 21:21b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The one street of pure gold signifies that when we live and work according to the divine life flowing in the divine nature, we never &ldquo;get lost,&rdquo; and we are pure, simple, and uncomplicated&mdash;22:1; 2 Cor. 11:2-3.</li>
		<li>The divine nature is what God is; we must exercise our spirit to enjoy God as Spirit (the nature of God&rsquo;s person), and we must remain in the divine fellowship to enjoy God as love (the nature of God&rsquo;s essence) and as light (the nature of God&rsquo;s expression)&mdash;John 4:24; 1 John 4:8; 1:5, 3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To live out and work out the New Jerusalem as the reality of the Body of Christ, we must experience God the Son in His death and resurrection, typified by the pearl gates&mdash;Rev. 21:21a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Pearls signify the issue of Christ&rsquo;s secretion in two aspects: His redeeming and life-releasing death and His life-dispensing resurrection&mdash;John 12:24; 19:34; cf. Zech. 13:1; Jer. 2:13.</li>
		<li>We must experience the death of Christ by the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection so that we may be conformed to His death and to the image of the firstborn Son of God&mdash;Phil. 3:10; 1:19; Rom. 8:29; 2 Cor. 4:7-13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To live out and work out the New Jerusalem as the reality of the Body of Christ, we must experience God the Spirit in His transforming work, typified by the jasper wall with its foundations of precious stones&mdash;Rev. 21:18-20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>By our growth in the divine life in Christ as the living stone, we are transformed into precious stones to have the same appearance as God&mdash;1 Pet. 2:4; 1 Cor. 3:12a; Rev. 21:10-11; 4:3; 2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2.</li>
		<li>The wall functions to separate, to sanctify, the city unto God from all things other than God, thus making the city the holy city; the wall also functions to protect the interest of the riches of God&rsquo;s divinity on the earth and the attainments of His consummation&mdash;Rev. 21:2a, 10b; cf. John 17:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To live out and work out the New Jerusalem as the reality of the Body of Christ requires spiritual warfare; at the time of Nehemiah, &ldquo;those who built the wall and those who carried burdens took the loads with one hand doing the work and with the other holding a weapon&rdquo;&mdash;Neh. 4:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>There are three aspects of the attack of the enemy: the first aspect is the enemy&rsquo;s mocking (2:10; 4:2-3); the second aspect is for the enemy to set up plots through the destroyers of the divine building asking for meetings and discussions (6:2); the third aspect is to cause us to be discouraged, weakened, spiritually sick, and in discord (4:10-12).</li>
		<li>As a person who loved God, Nehemiah prayed to God to contact Him in fellowship; for the rebuilding of the wall, Nehemiah stood on God&rsquo;s word, prayed according to it, and took action in a properly aggressive way in resurrection&mdash;1:1-11; 2:4; 4:4-9; 13:1-30.</li>
		<li>We need to stand against the stratagems of the devil by fighting the battle in the Body with fighting prayers, praying at every time in spirit to put on the whole armor of God to build up the Body of Christ as the house of God for the glory of God and as the kingdom of God for the dominion of God for the complete fulfillment of the economy of God&mdash;Eph. 6:10-20.</li>
