   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should be happy to be both priests and slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, the Greek word rendered "slaves" in 1 Peter 2:16 means bondslaves.</S>

   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We, His brothers, participate in His divinity, but we can never partake of His deity.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It would be heresy to say that we can partake of Christ's deity.</S>

   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Christ is the Firstborn with divinity and humanity, and we are His many brothers with humanity and divinity.</S>
