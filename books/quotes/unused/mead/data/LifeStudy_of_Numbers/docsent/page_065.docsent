   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE EIGHTEEN JOURNEYING 3 Scripture Reading: Num 11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will begin to consider the failures recorded in chapters eleven through fourteen of Numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FAILURES</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moses' word in 10:35 and 36 implies Christ's incarnation, ascension, and coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But after this marvelous word at the end of chapter ten, from chapter eleven through chapter seventeen there is nearly nothing except failure.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These chapters speak of different kinds of defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The behavior of the people in chapter sixteen was an insult both to Moses and to Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The insult was so severe that Jehovah, who is full of mercy and patience, could not tolerate the situation any longer and became very angry.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is similar to the situation in John 2, in which the Lord Jesus, the incarnated God, became angry.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Numbers 16 God became like this, saying to Moses, "Rise up from the midst of this assembly that I may consume them in a moment" v. 45 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may not care for these chapters that record the failures of God's people, but these chapters are in the Bible, and we need to pay attention to them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A. Murmuring Evil</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Taberah, which means "a burning," the children of Israel were murmuring evil 11:1-3; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Deut 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here evil refers not only to evil words but also to evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The evil words spoken by the people were based on evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These evil words went into the ears of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This murmuring kindled the anger of Jehovah, and He sent fire to consume some at the extremities of the camp.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moses prayed for the people, and the fire abated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"So the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of Jehovah burned among them" Num 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>B. Lusting</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the murmuring, the mixed multitude among the people began to lust vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>4-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The mixed multitude consisted of those without a definite family, those who did not know of whom they were born or to what family they belonged.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In principle, it is possible for there to be such a mixture in the church life today, for certain ones, not knowing how they were saved or through whom they were regenerated, may not have a proper spiritual status.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The name of the place where the mixed multitude lusted was called Kibroth-hattaavah, which means "the graves of lust," because "there they buried the people who lusted" v. 34 .</S>
