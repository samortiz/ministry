<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Tools</H2><P>The six points we have covered are not enough; we also need the tools for the gospel preaching. We have to prepare different types of Bibles&#151;large and small, the whole Bible, the New Testament, the separate books, the expensive ones, and the economical ones. These Bibles must be available before we go out to preach the gospel. In order to preach the gospel, we have to have Bibles. It is sad that, when some come to the church for a Bible, the responsible ones would say: "Go to the Bible Society for your Bible!" This may sound very good, but it proves that this church is sick in the matter of preaching the gospel.</P><P>Other than Bibles, there are other tools, such as tracts, booklets, gospel stories, testimonies, and gospel posters. All these are gospel tools, and they are necessary for the preaching of the gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Purpose</H2><P>Why should we preach the gospel? What is the purpose of the gospel? We must impress this upon every brother and sister. We have to tell the brothers and sisters who are preaching the gospel that the purpose of the gospel is for men to receive the Lord's life, to enliven men's spirit, to regenerate them in the spirit, and to enable men to take the Lord as their life.</P><P>Our gospel should not gain only some who are barely saved but who are not clear about the matter of life. We should not have only those who seem to have believed in Jesus and who have been forgiven of their sins, but who do not seem to have been regenerated. Seemingly, this word is not according to the truth, for no one is saved without being regenerated. But in actual cases, some are indeed like this. Some people believe and confess that the Lord Jesus is the Savior. They have confessed their sins and have prayed. They say that their sins are forgiven and that they are saved. No matter how hard you try, however, you cannot sense that they are living within. The reason for this is that in preaching the gospel we have not paid attention to the purpose of the gospel. The gospel is not merely to bring forgiveness of sins to people, but to bring them the Lord's life and to enliven them within.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. Activity</H2><P>After the elders have trained the brothers and sisters in all the points we have covered, they should begin some gospel activities. They have to conduct gospel meetings in the meeting hall. They have to organize gospel meetings in the homes. They should have some activities in public places. Every day, they should carry gospel tracts with them, and should pass out these tracts in the train stations, the bus stops, and on the bus and the train. These are the gospel activities.</P>
