The Satanic Chaos with the People of Israel</H2><P>With the people of Israel in the wilderness, we see not only the divine economy but also the satanic chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The People of Israel<br>Being Overconfident in Themselves<br>for the Keeping of God's Commandments</H2><P>The people of Israel had become blessed travelers with God, but they were overconfident in themselves for the keeping of God's commandments (Exo. 19:7-8). God brought them to Mount Sinai, where He came in to meet with them and to speak to them. Being overconfident in themselves and not knowing themselves, they said, "All that the Lord hath spoken we will do" (v. 8a). God was offended by this, for it indicated that they did not know themselves. They should have said, "O Lord, You know that we are a fallen people. We cannot keep Your word. We need Your mercy, grace, redemption, and salvation." God is pleased to hear such a word. However, what the people of Israel spoke was entirely different and was offensive to God, who then proceeded to decree the law. The people, who were so confident in themselves, broke the law even before it was given to them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The People of Israel Sidetracking Themselves<br>from the Central Line of the Divine Economy<br>to the Sideline of the Law</H2><P>In the wilderness the people of Israel sidetracked themselves from the central line of the divine economy to the sideline of the law (Exo. 20:1-21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</H2><P>Finally, let us consider the remaining aspects of the divine economy and the satanic chaos in the Old Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Divine Economy<br>concerning the Tabernacle,<br>the Offerings, and the Priests</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God Charging the People of Israel<br>to Build the Tabernacle for His Dwelling and<br>to Serve Him by the Priests through the Offerings</H2><P>In Exodus 25&#151;Leviticus 27 God charged the people of Israel to build the tabernacle for His dwelling and to serve Him by the priests through the offerings. The tabernacle, the priests, and the offerings all typify Christ. Even in the Old Testament, God's people did not live only by the law but also through the tabernacle, the priests, and the offerings. If they had lived only by the law, all of them would have been condemned.</P><P>Consider the example of David. Although David was victorious and was a good king, he was not perfect according to the law. He committed fornication, conspired to kill one of his soldiers, and robbed that soldier of his wife. The genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1 says, "David begot Solomon of her who had been the wife of Uriah" (v. 6). The expression her who had been the wife of Uriah is not pleasant, for it emphasizes David's great sin and shows that there is this black spot in the genealogy of Christ. David surely was not perfect according to the law, but he was perfect according to the tabernacle, the priesthood, and the offerings. After he confessed his sins of murder and fornication, he applied the offering (Psa. 51:19), and through the offering he was forgiven. Actually, David was forgiven through Christ as the tabernacle, the priest, and the offerings.</P><P>The tabernacle signifies Christ as the embodiment of the merciful and gracious God. John 1:14 says, "The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality." This verse does not say that the Word, which is Christ, became flesh, full of righteousness and justice. If Christ had been full only of righteousness and justice, we all would be condemned by God. But Christ as the tabernacle was full of grace, and as such a tabernacle He brought God to us. Then He died for our sins. In His death on the cross, He was the Priest and also the offerings. Therefore, through Christ as the tabernacle, the Priest, and the offerings, we sinners have been redeemed, saved, and regenerated. Furthermore, according to God's economy, we will also be renewed, sanctified, transformed, conformed to Christ's image, and glorified with Him in His glory.</P><P>The genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1 is an extract of the entire Old Testament. This genealogy is an extract of the Old Testament not on the side of the law but on the side of the tabernacle, the priesthood, and the offerings. According to God's economy, it is thus the genealogy of the One who is the threefold seed, the One who is the seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, and the seed of David. Christ was born of Mary, a descendant of David through his son Nathan. Mary's husband Joseph was a descendant of David through his son Solomon. Hence, they were both descendants of David, and through them Christ came.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
