   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>During that ten-day conference, I received much help from his messages.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>They were indeed marvelous, marking a real turn in both my Christian life and in my church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>My eyes were opened to see Christ in His preeminence in all things according to God's eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I took brief notes on all his messages, which he eventually published in the March and April issues of The Present Testimony in 1934.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One day before the conference, we were having fellowship together.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At that time he asked me how I daily studied the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I replied that I was in Acts and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Immediately he said that these two books were a very good match.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At first I did not understand what he meant, but eventually I was helped to see that Acts reveals to us how Christ ascended to the heavens and was made both Lord and Christ 2:36 , whereas Colossians reveals that Christ should have the preeminence in all things and should be all and in all in God's economy 1:18; 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There was never another person in my entire Christian life who helped me know the Scriptures in such a profound and living way, especially regarding the revelation of Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On one occasion the first hall in Shanghai arranged to hold a gospel meeting, but no one knew who the speaker would be.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many thought that Watchman would speak.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I was feeling quite relaxed and prepared to hear a message from him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I hoped also to learn more concerning how to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>About an hour before the meeting, there was a knock at my door, and a note was passed on to me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It said, "Brother Witness, you give the message on the gospel tonight."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It shocked me!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At any rate, I had to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That night I spoke from John 16 concerning the Spirit convicting the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I pressed the people with the matter of sin because we were born of Adam, of righteousness because we can believe in Christ, and of judgment because we follow Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I told the people that here are three persons Adam, Christ, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We were all born sinners in Adam, but now God has offered us the opportunity to get into Christ to be justified by taking Him as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By believing in Christ we are transferred out of Adam into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, if we do not believe in Christ, we will remain sinful in Adam, and one day we will be together with Satan sharing God's judgment upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As I delivered this message, I could not see Watchman in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I did not know where he was, and no one told me where he was.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But after a period of time had elapsed, one day as we were walking down the street, he suddenly turned to me and said, "Brother Witness, not many in this country can give a message from John 16 on the three points of sin, righteousness, and judgment and on Adam, Christ, and Satan as you did.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I encourage you to go on."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I heard this, I said to myself, "How did he know this?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually, I discovered that while I was speaking he was standing behind the door listening to my word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He heard everything.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By that time I was aware that he was continually testing me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 1934, after I had been in Shanghai for about four months, Watchman came to see me one day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He said, "Brother Witness, we the co-workers here all feel that you should move your family to Shanghai and work together with us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Bring this matter to the Lord, and see how He will lead you."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I brought the matter to the Lord, and at this time my eyes were opened to see a very significant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I saw from the book of Acts that there was only one flow, one current on the earth; it began from the throne of grace and came down to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From Jerusalem it took its course through Samaria, traveling to the north to Antioch; then from Antioch it turned westward to Asia Minor and to Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I saw that in the entire book of Acts there was only one current of the Lord's work on this earth and that there was no record of the work of anyone who was not in the current.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Barnabas separated from Paul and began another current, the account of his work in Acts terminated Acts 15:36-41 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The later co-workers, such as Timothy and Apollos, after being raised up by the Lord for His work, all were merged into one flow of the Lord's move, though they did not need to go to Jerusalem for this purpose Acts 16:1-3; 18:24-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord revealed to me that the flow of His work in China must be one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since it had begun from Shanghai, I should not go to the north and keep another flow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the Lord was going to do something in the north, I must first enter into the flow in Shanghai; then eventually the flow in Shanghai would travel to the north.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although a work was already started in the north, I became crystal clear concerning the one flow.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>With this vision in view, I returned to the north following Watchman's conference, stayed for awhile, and then returned to Shanghai to stay and work with him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, there was one flow and one current of the Lord's work in China.</S>
