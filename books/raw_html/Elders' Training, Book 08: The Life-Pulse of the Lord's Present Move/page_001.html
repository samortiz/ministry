<h2 class="head1">FOREWORD</h2>
<p>Approximately four hundred and twenty-five brothers came together in Anaheim, California for an elders&rsquo; training with Brother Witness Lee in February of 1986. Book 7 entitled <em>One Accord for the Lord&rsquo;s Move</em> and Book 8 entitled <em>The Life-pulse of the Lord&rsquo;s Present Move</em> contain Brother Lee&rsquo;s fellowship during those days. As the Lord is bringing all the local churches into His up-to-date move, the fellowship contained in these two books of this set of the elders&rsquo; training series is vital. For the carrying out of the present practice in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, it is crucial that every saint enter into the burden of the word that was spoken in this training.</p>
<p>We trust that the vision of all the points presented in these two volumes would be wrought into us and that we would live according to this revelation. Our prayer is that all the churches with all the saints would be brought into one accord for the Lord&rsquo;s move and that the life-pulse of the Lord&rsquo;s present move, which comprises the home gatherings, the truth lessons, the burden for full-timers, with all being either a job-dropping one or a money-making one, and the spreading of the gospel, would become a living reality in all the churches.</p>
