<h2 class=head1>THE MYSTERY ONCE HIDDEN NOW REVEALED</h2><p>The mystery of the universe, Paul tells us, has been hidden “from the ages” (Eph. 3:9) and was not made known “in other generations” (3:5). This means that it was hidden from eternity (the ages) and from the earlier generations of time. Even the angels did not know. Nor did Adam, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, or even the wise Solomon. Isaiah and the other prophets were in ignorance of this mystery too, as was John the Baptist.<p>This mystery was hidden in God Himself. He alone knew about it.<p>It is not insignificant that today this mystery has been made known. We know about it from the Bible. Yet, sad to say, even many Christian teachers and scholars do not see this mystery, in spite of their having read through the Bible perhaps a good number of times. It is possible to see the black and white letters without seeing the mystery. Paul uses a variety of terms to convey what this mystery, now revealed, is. He refers to it as economy, dispensation, purpose, will, pleasure, desire, and intent.<h2 class=head1>THE EMBODIMENT OF GOD</h2><p>To say that Christ is the mystery of God is to say that He is God’s definition and explanation. God is unknown, but Christ is His expression and embodiment. Yes, Christ is God; He is also God’s description and embodiment. Apart from Him we cannot find God. This is the problem of our Jewish friends. They put Christ aside, yet insist they have God. They do not have God, because He can only be realized in Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE TRINITY A MYSTERY</h2><p>The Trinity has been a puzzle to Christian scholars since the first century. Even in the first chapter of Genesis we find the Trinity hinted at. The word God in Hebrew is in plural number, not singular. Then in verse 26 the three pronouns referring to God are plural: “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.” How could the one God refer to Himself as “us”? Why does He use a plural possessive “our”? This problem has bothered the scholars for centuries.<h2 class=head2>The Threefold Name</h2><p>Let us come to the New Testament. One day after His resurrection, just before He ascended to the heavens, the Lord Jesus met with His disciples on a mountain in Galilee. There He charged them to go and “disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit” (Matt. 28:19). Notice that the Three are here, yet “name” is singular. There is something of a mystery about this name of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
