<h1 class="title">PRINCIPLES CONCERNING<br />
THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>The organization of the church must be according to the life and authority of God. Moreover, the organization of the church must also be according to function and ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING ACCORDING TO FUNCTION</h2>
<p>Although there is such a thing as place or position in the organization of the church, our emphasis should be function, not position. We should not bring the thought of position into the church; rather, we must emphasize the matter of function. The elders in a church do not have a higher position than the other brothers and sisters; rather, the elders carry more weight in regard to function. For example, in a local church it is less serious for the general condition of the brothers and sisters to be poor than for the function of the elders to be poor. If the function of the elders is poor, the church will suffer much loss. We need to respect the elders because their function in the church is of great importance.</p>
<p>When elders, deacons, and responsible ones are appointed and designated for specific services, it must be done according to life, in submission to the authority of the Holy Spirit, and according to function. We need to ask, &ldquo;How much function will this brother have as an elder or a deacon?&rdquo; Some who have been appointed as elders are like the deaf; they cannot hear the voice of the Holy Spirit. Others are like the blind; they cannot see the work of the Holy Spirit. Whereas life has to be recognized through experience, function can be more readily discerned by considering a person&rsquo;s place in the church, the coordination he is involved in, and what his particular portion is. Inwardly, these are matters of life, and outwardly, they are matters of function. Many other things can be hidden from others, but a person&rsquo;s function is not something that can be hidden.</p>
<p>At this point we want to make a distinction between gifts and function. Many people have gifts, but they may not function. It is not easy for a person without a gift to function, but often, gifted people do not have much function in the church. For example, a sister may be able to play the piano well; hence, this is her gift. Nevertheless, she may not function in the church because of a bad temper and poor character. When she is angry, she simply walks out of a meeting. Moreover, she may not pay attention to the time and often arrives late. Although a meeting may start at a certain time in the evening, she may arrive ten minutes late, when the singing has stopped. Although she plays the piano very well, she has no function in the church.</p>
<p>Some people are not without gifts, but their gifts are superficial. For example, the Old Testament gives an account of a donkey that was able to speak human language (Num. 22:21-30). This surely was a gift. The New Testament makes mention of people speaking in tongues and being able to heal the sick, both of which are gifts (1 Cor. 12:9-10). However, having gifts does not necessarily mean that one is able to function. Gifts are superficial and simple, but to function properly is not. If a person wants to be useful, to function, he needs many things in addition to a gift. For example, a certain brother in a local church may truly have the gifts necessary to be an elder, but his function may be spoiled by a bad temper. In other words, although he has the gifts, due to his bad temper, he may not have the function of an elder. Therefore, functions are greater than gifts. To function requires more than possessing a gift.</p>
<p>Some might then ask, &ldquo;Do gifts plus life issue in function?&rdquo; Gifts plus life may not necessarily issue in function. This is because function is very much related to a person&rsquo;s character. Even though a person may have a gift and a certain amount of life, he may not have a function. In order to function, he must have God&rsquo;s life wrought into him to the extent that a proper character is produced within him. For example, a brother may have a gift related to preaching the gospel, but he may lack perseverance. When he preaches the gospel in a certain place, if there are no results after three or five days or no one is saved after a month, he will give up. Likewise, another brother may be satisfied with a small result and quit preaching. Both are short of perseverance. Perseverance is missing in their character.</p>
<p>Perseverance is related to endurance. Some brothers have the gift of teaching and are able to shepherd and teach people, but they lack endurance. They are able to give good messages, but because they lack endurance, they do not function much. Suppose there are two brothers who both have a gift for preaching the gospel, the first one being more gifted than the second one. It may be that the function of the second is greater than that of the first. After the first one lives in a certain place for a year, he may not be able to continue in the work of the gospel. Although he has a greater gift, due to his lack of endurance, he is not able to continue to labor for more than a year. However, the work of the second one, who is not as gifted but has endurance, will begin to flourish once he has been in a certain place for more than a year. Hence, a person with a greater gift may not necessarily have a greater function. His gift must be matched with the proper character in order for him to have a corresponding function.</p>
<p>Character refers to the way we are. We must allow the life of God to change the way we are. Our lazy character and sloppy disposition must be dealt with by God&rsquo;s life. If a person is short of perseverance, always expecting to accomplish a task instantly, his disposition, his way of being, must be transformed by God&rsquo;s life. If a person has no endurance, is not able to accommodate others, and handles matters in a sloppy manner, his temperament must be dealt with by God&rsquo;s life. Although he may be gifted, his laziness, sloppiness, carelessness, and lack of perseverance and endurance will cause him to have no function.</p>
<p>We have seen many gifted brothers and sisters in the church whose functions are not manifested because of their poor character. This is pitiful. Moreover, if elders, deacons, and responsible ones are appointed based merely upon gift and not function, the appointed ones will be a trouble to the church in the future. Those who are gifted but without function are dangerous in the church and will eventually harm the church. I hope that the young brothers and sisters will pay special attention to this matter, that is, that they would not focus merely on gift and neglect function. If they do this, they will be dangerous persons in the church. Having a gift does not require the Lord&rsquo;s dealing, but functioning absolutely requires His dealing. A person whose function is manifested among the saints and in the church must be one who has been dealt with. Such a one may be an elder without much gift, but he definitely has a portion, a function, in the eldership.</p>
<p>Function includes gift, but gift does not include function. Function is gift plus something more. Function is gift matched with character. Some people are gifted, but their person is short. In other words, their character does not match their gift. If they want their character to match their gift, they must pass through the cross and experience the life of Christ. The lessons that the Lord&rsquo;s life leads us to learn are very practical. To speak inaccurately or do things in a sloppy manner proves that one has not learned the lessons taught by the Lord&rsquo;s life. In other words, if a person has learned the lessons related to life and the cross, he will be serious and strict in doing things and will speak accurately.</p>
<p>A person who has passed through the cross and been worked on by Christ&rsquo;s life will not be lazy and sloppy. He will not come to a meeting late. To do otherwise, indicates that one has not learned the lessons taught by the Lord&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Gifts do not have much to do with life, but to function requires that one learn the lessons related to life. The more strongly a person experiences the dealing of the cross and the deeper he experiences the work of Christ&rsquo;s life, the more his function will be manifested. If a co-worker appoints an elder or a deacon according to the brother&rsquo;s function, the result will be very positive; however, if he ignores a person&rsquo;s function and focuses on his gift, the result will be unthinkable.</p>
<p>If a worker of the Lord appoints elders or deacons merely according to their ability to handle matters and deliver spoken messages, stressing gifts more than function, the result will be that the whole church will experience death. Such an appointment is not according to the Holy Spirit or life, and it is not produced organically. Gifts are not sufficient to serve as the basis of one&rsquo;s service. A person&rsquo;s service in the church should be determined not according to his gift but according to his function. The amount of function and the kind of function a brother has determine what portion he should have in the service. Without a certain function, he cannot serve in a certain capacity, nor can he have a corresponding portion in the service. Those who work for the Lord must hold firmly to this principle.</p>
<p>Gifts are not produced by life but are something added outwardly. Functions are produced by the inward growth in life. To function requires that we conduct ourselves properly as befitting men. Our character should be that of behaving in a manner that befits a proper man. This requires that we experience the dealing of the cross and the inward working of Christ&rsquo;s life. Our function in the church is the result of matching our character, which has been dealt with by the cross and worked on by Christ&rsquo;s life, to a gift. Ninety percent of our function in the church depends upon our character, and only ten percent depends upon our gift. However, the character of which I speak is not our natural character. Our natural character is worthless. Our character is valuable only when it has been dealt with by the cross and been worked on by the resurrection life.</p>
<p>Our natural meekness, perseverance, endurance, and reverence are worthless in the church. However, after we have been dealt with by the cross and have experienced the resurrection life, we will have in the Lord the virtues of meekness, perseverance, and endurance. Moreover, we will fear God and be earnest in whatever we do. This kind of character is the main constituent of a proper function. If we are such a person, it does not matter whether our gift is small. As long as we remain in the church year after year, our function will spontaneously be manifested. If a church is committed into our hand, after a period of time it will be built up. Once the Lord has worked on our character, we will have a particular portion and function.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
