<h2 class="head2">D. The Materials of the Divine Building</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The Divine Trinity as the Precious Items</h2><p>First, the materials of the divine building are the Divine Trinity as the transformed precious items&mdash;gold, silver, and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12). Paul warns us to take heed, to be careful about, how we build upon Christ as the foundation. We must use the right materials, which are gold, silver, and precious stones. Gold signifies God the Father as the base of the divine building (Gen. 2:11; Rev. 21:18, 21). Silver or bdellium and pearl signify Christ in His redeeming and life-releasing death and His life-dispensing resurrection (Gen. 2:12; Rev. 21:21). Precious stones signify the Spirit in His transforming and building up work (Gen. 2:12; Rev. 21:19-20).</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Transformed Believers</h2><p>The materials also include the transformed believers who are the divine plants transformed into the divine minerals (1 Cor. 3:6-9).</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Unworthy Materials</h2><p>Wood, in contrast to gold, signifies the nature of the natural man; grass, in contrast to silver, signifies the fallen man, the man of the flesh (1 Pet. 1:24); and stubble, in contrast to precious stones, signifies the work and living that issue from an earthen source. All these are not worthy to be used as materials for the divine building (1 Cor. 3:12).</p><p>The natural man cannot be used for the divine building. The natural man, the man created by God, may be good but is not regenerated and transformed, and thus is not the proper material for the building. The fallen man, the man of the flesh, has no part in the building. Furthermore, the work and living that issue from an earthen source are not worthy of the divine building. These materials should not be used in the divine building. You should build only with the precious materials, that is, with the Triune God and with the transformed believers. If we see this, we will realize that in the building up of the church, we must put ourselves aside, including whatever we are as a naturally good man or as a fallen, fleshly man. Everything that issues from an earthen source must also be put aside. Natural things and worldly things cannot be adopted for the building up of the church, the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">E. The Work of the Divine Building</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Renewing, Transformation, and Building Up</h2><p>The work of the divine building is carried out through renewing and transformation. Renewing issues in transformation, and transformation issues in building up. The building up of the jasper wall of the New Jerusalem goes along with its transformation (Rev. 21:18a). We need to be renewed and transformed, and then we can do the work of building.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Believers&rsquo; Growth in the Divine Life</h2><p>The work of the divine building is the believers&rsquo; growth in the divine life and their being joined together in the divine life (Eph. 4:15-16; 2:21). We need to grow up together and be joined together in the divine life. This growing and joining together is the building. The actual building is our growth and our union in the divine life. When we grow in the divine life and when we are joined together in the divine life, we are in the building.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Believers&rsquo; Being Built Together in Christ</h2><p>The work of the divine building is also the believers&rsquo; being built together in Christ into a dwelling of God by the Spirit in their spirit possessed by Christ, both of which are mingled as one spirit (Eph. 2:22). If we are experiencing this, we are doing the work of building up the Body.</p>
