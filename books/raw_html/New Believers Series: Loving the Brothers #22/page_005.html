<P>Concerning the fornicator in 1 Corinthians 5:13, Paul said, "Remove the evil man from among yourselves." At the beginning Paul delivered such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh in the name of the Lord Jesus and with the power of the Lord Jesus because the Corinthians did not do anything to cast him out. Is this kind of dealing too severe? It was indeed extremely severe. But Paul did this so that the man's spirit would be saved in the day of the Lord (v. 5). The purpose for his flesh being destroyed in the present time was so that he would not suffer eternal loss. The purpose of telling it "to the church" in Matthew 18 is for restoration; the removing in 1 Corinthians 5 is also for restoration.</P><P>When Joshua judged Achan, he said, "My son, give glory to Jehovah" (Josh. 7:19). Though Achan had committed a great sin, he spoke to Achan with such a spirit and such brotherly love.</P><P>David took hold of his clothes and tore them when a young messenger brought the news of Saul's death to him. He mourned, wept, and fasted until the evening (2 Sam. 1:11-12). When someone told David about Absalom's death, David was much moved. He wept, saying, "O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you!" (18:33). Saul was a king who hated David, and Absalom was David's rebellious son. Yet David wept when they died. He had to fight the battles, and he had to judge, but he could not restrain his tears. He had to judge, and he had to condemn, but he could not hold back his tears.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, if a person can only judge and condemn but has no tears or sadness, it proves that he does not know anything about brotherly love. If anyone rebukes a brother only for the purpose of tearing him down, such a one has no love in him, only hatred. To hate the brothers is to murder them! This is a very serious matter!</P><P>A brother once wrote to J. N. Darby about the matter of excommunication. Darby's first words were, "I think it is the most dreadful thing for a sinner whose sins have been forgiven to excommunicate another sinner." There is nothing more dreadful than for a sinner whose sins are forgiven to excommunicate another sinner. Mr. Darby's reaction was something that issued from a life of love. No doubt, there are many things which need to be addressed. We can excommunicate a sinful brother or sister from the church if it becomes necessary to do so. But we must never harbor any hatred in dealing with them.</P><P>First John 4:20-21 says, "If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen. And this commandment we have from Him, that he who loves God love his brother also." Here John shows us that to love one's brothers is equal to loving God. He who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. We should love our brothers if we want to love God. This is the commandment which we have received from God.</P><P>We must be careful not to do anything that will offend love. We should not offend our brothers lightly. We must love one another and must honor the brotherly love that has been placed in our hearts. We should not put aside such a heart. God has placed this heart in us so that we can use it to serve and help the brothers. We should allow this brotherly love to grow, to be strengthened, and to be empowered.</P><P>First John 3:17 says, "But whoever has the livelihood of the world and sees that his brother has need and shuts up his affections from him, how does the love of God abide in him?" John did not say, "How does the love of the brothers abide in him?" He said, "How does the love of God abide in him?" because the love of God is the love of the brothers, and the love of the brothers is the love of God. The love of God does not abide in a person who shuts up his love for his brother. He cannot deceive himself by saying, "Although I do not love my brother, I love God." Our relationship with the brothers comes from our relationship with God. If we are not related to the brothers, it means that we are not related to God. If we reject our brothers, the love of God is not in us.</P>
