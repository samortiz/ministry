<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PROPER PERSON</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SPECIAL FELLOWSHIP MEETING</H1><p>Date:1:30 p.m., December 28, 1947<br>Place:Hong Kong<br>Speaker:Witness Lee<br>Remark:A meeting for those who are burdened for the affairs of God's house, concerning matters related to God's house. Attendance, about forty or more.</p><P>Brother Hsu asked:How should elders serve in the house of God?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PERSON BEING GOD'S METHOD AND WAY</H2><P>Brother Lee answered:The service of the elders has to do with the person of the elder. It does not depend on the method, but on the person. In the New Testament it is very difficult to find out what is the method or way to serve. Some places seem to speak about the method or the way, but actually the emphasis is still the person himself. The person is the way, and the person is the Lord's work. If God does not gain a person, He will have no work, and He will have no way. A way is a course that a person takes. If God does not gain man, He will have no course to take. Man thinks that the most important thing to do is to find a good way. However, God's work does not involve giving us the ways, but is a matter of gaining the persons. If God can gain two or three brothers here, He will have a way. Even if I present to you the best way to be an elder, it will be useless if the person is wrong. We, the person, should be gained by God. We have to learn to be the proper person more than to learn to do the proper things. It is meaningless for things to be done properly without the person being a proper one. What you are is what you do. You cannot serve God beyond what you are as a person. Hudson Taylor said in his book Union and Communion that what we are is more important than what we do. This word left a deep impression on me. We should know how to help the brothers and sisters properly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING DEALT WITH BY GOD TO SERVE HIM</H2><P>What God cares for is whether or not you have been touched by Him. The measure we yield ourselves to the Lord determines the measure we are able to serve Him. If you have been dealt with in your temper, you can help others with their temper. If you have been dealt with in the way you dress, you will be able to help others in the way they dress. The church is not a worldly society. The church is a body (Eph. 1:23). A body is a matter of life. If we can only do the proper things in the church and nothing else, we are failures. It is true that we need to learn the proper lessons with regard to many things, including money and the way we deal with our family. However, in the church, business affairs do not take priority. Rather, life takes priority. Life can meet man's present need. This should cause every servant of God to come before God again. Otherwise, the more right things we do, the more man-made works there are, and the more the church will become a human society or community; it will become something merely human, with nothing other than a common belief and a common philosophy!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING DEALT WITH IN LIFE<br>TO BRING IN THE AUTHORITY</H2><P>In order to have such a proper life, we need to be restricted in everything and to apply ourselves in a practical way to learn the lessons. The main thing we have to learn is the matter of authority. A person who has authority has life; he is like the budding rod of Aaron (Num. 17:1-10). If you submit to him, you will have life. If you do not submit to him, you will touch death. However, such a person does not put on an air. When the apostle spoke about the elders, he spoke very little about what they do. Mainly he spoke about the kind of persons they should be (1 Tim. 3:1-5). In a degraded church, people pay much attention to the office of the elders and the deacons. A person can be very clever and capable, but he may not be dealt with in the matter of life. Whenever someone brings his knowledge and diplomacy into the church, it is like putting a hole into a ship. Soon the whole ship will be filled with sea water; the world will invade and take over the church. Just because a person has the knowledge does not mean that he can therefore interpret the Bible. When a person engages in visitation work or other affairs, what is needed is not merely to have things done properly, nor to gain others' admiration, but to be a proper person. A proper person has the authority with him. Even if he is not a responsible one, the authority is still with him. Wherever there is life, there is authority. Life is authority. If God can gain one brother here in an absolute way, the saints in this place will be able to advance in great strides.</P>
