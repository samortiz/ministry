<h2 class=head2>The Testimony of Jesus</h2><p>We all must see that regardless of how many regions and how many workers there are, the Lord’s testimony must be one because there are not two Lords or three Lords, but only one Lord moving on this earth. Therefore, there is only one move by one ministry to produce one Body to bear the one testimony. We must consider the real situation among us. Regionally, some of the churches bear different flavors. The churches should not bear the flavor of their region and should not give people the impression that these are churches of a certain region. The impression the churches should give people is a genuine, unique testimony of Jesus. There should be no nature, no flavor, no color, and no shape of any region. The churches should only be a testimony of Jesus.<h2 class=head1>BEING TESTED CONCERNING THE PURITY OF OUR HEART</h2><p>We are here for the Lord’s recovery, and we love Him and His recovery. We all have been tested, though, as to how pure our love is for Him and how pure our heart is for His recovery. Standing before the Lord and before all of you brothers, I want to give my testimony that I always check with myself in this way—“how pure is your heart toward His recovery? How pure is your heart toward this ministry? Are you pure in this ministry or are you using this ministry for some subsidiary purpose?”<p>Undoubtedly, we are using this ministry for the Lord’s recovery. Everybody sees this, but could we say that our heart is so pure to such an extent that we do not have any subsidiary purpose? Quite often I check myself until I can say, “Lord, by Your mercy and for Your love I am here. If I am not pure, Lord, purify me. Purify my heart and purify my motives. Lord, I am in fear and trembling of having some subsidiary intention in Your ministry.” We all have to be tested, brothers. I am not here preaching any doctrine, rebuking anyone, or justifying anyone. As an old, yet little brother I am fellowshipping with you in my honesty. I called this urgent training with a strong purpose because I realized that the purity was doubtful and questionable. We all must see that we are here for the Lord’s recovery, and the Lord’s recovery is just of the Lord’s one move by the Lord’s one ministry to produce His unique Body for His unique testimony.<h2 class=head2>The Work of the Lord</h2><p>If we try to justify ourselves by what we do, this means nothing. Are we on this earth doing different works in different regions and bearing different colors with different flavors? If we do this and we say we are for the Lord’s recovery, then what kind of recovery is this? Honestly speaking, I want to tell you that no work is ours. The work in California is not mine, the work in Texas does not belong to the Texan brothers, and the work in the Northwest does not belong to the brothers there. The work is the unique work of the Lord (1 Cor. 15:58; 16:10).
