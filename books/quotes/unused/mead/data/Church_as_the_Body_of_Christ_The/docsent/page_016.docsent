   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this chapter we will consider the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first time the Bible speaks of the church, it also speaks of building.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Matthew 16:18 says, Upon this rock I will build My church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This verse speaks not only of the church but also of building; while it takes the church as the subject, it also takes the building as the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church is a great matter, and building is an even greater matter in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, the church is God s building project in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In English, building can be both a verb and a noun; in Greek, the word building in both its verbal form and noun form have the same root.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In its verbal form, it means God is building ; in its noun form, it refers to the church as the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Timothy 3:15 says that the church is the house of God; house in Greek refers to building as a noun.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every detail of this description shows that the church is God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE APOSTLES BUILDING WORK</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>AND GOD S BUILDING WORK BEING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Epistles, the apostles repeatedly speak concerning building.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1 Corinthians 3:11 Paul speaks of the foundation which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today all the Lord s workers are building upon this foundation; all who serve the churches should do a building work upon this foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the Greek, the references to building in the New Testament are not references to edification as a matter of spiritual improvement but to edification as a matter of building.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>An apostle working for the Lord, a prophet exercising his gift, and a teacher carrying out his ministry are for the building up of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Ephesians 2 clearly shows that in Christ, the believers are being built together with the apostles and prophets vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>20-22 ; this building work is now in progress.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Peter says that as living stones we are coming to the Lord and being built up as a spiritual house 1 Pet 2:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we come to the Lord, we are living stones; the Lord will build these living stones up little by little and piece by piece.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The result of this building is that we become a dwelling place, a spiritual house, for the Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To this day, God is still working on and building this city.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has only one building work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not think that the church, the house, that the apostles were building is not the holy city that God is building.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The city that God is building is the house that the apostles were building.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is a house today, and it will be an enlarged city in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The house is the temple; when the city appears, the temple will no longer be seen.</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>OF MATERIALS FOR HIS BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God has been carrying out this building work since the creation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In eternity past God had the blueprint for His building, and God prepared the materials according to this plan, this blueprint, through creation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should not consider God s creation to be His building work; His creation prepared the materials for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The created man was the material that God prepared for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For example, with a physical city the materials for the building of the city must be prepared before it can be built.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God made man from the dust of the earth in order to prepare the material for His building; the created Adam, the created human race, is the material that God uses for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, creation is a preparation for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God s building follows creation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>While creation was accomplished through God s power, building is accomplished through God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In other words, whereas creation comes out of God s handiwork, building comes out of God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After God s creation was completed in Genesis, God began to enter into His building work, into His building.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the Old Testament, even though God did not begin the building, He used types and figures to describe the building He desired.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For example, the tabernacle, the temple, the coordination and service of the children of Israel, their becoming a kingdom of priests, and the service recorded in Nehemiah and Ezra after their return from captivity are all shadows and figures of God s building.</S>
