   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LETTER FROM CHU CHIA CHENG TZE,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CH'ANG-CH'UN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To my brother in the Lord, Brother Shun T'ien:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am very, very sorry because I received your letter from Shanghai a long time ago.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The attacks we have received in the last six months have been hard to take.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I really know our position now.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord places those who obey Him in the battlefield to manifest the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I received your postcard that was sent before you left, I thought that I could go by any means to Ch'ang-ch'un to see you before you left.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then something came up, and I could not go to Ch'ang-ch'un, nor could I answer your letter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>My heart was very sad until I received your letter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then I was somewhat comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In these six months there have been many difficulties on all sides.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not only have there been problems in my home, but also the assembly has had some.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There were only four brothers to begin with Brothers Hsiao, Kao, Yu, and myself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is another brother, Chin, but he is a worker, so he is very busy and does not come to the meetings often.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the fall Mr. Kung Hsiang from Harbin came to visit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is Brother Yu's brother-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is in the Assembly of God and only speaks about the baptism in the Holy Spirit and the doctrine of speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He came among us and caused much trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ultimately, Brother Yu was drawn off by him to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There was a great problem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He set up another meeting in Brother Yu's house.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It hurt all our members.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I was very sad because of this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I deeply felt that I have offended the Lord much because I did not take care of our brother in love.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Shortly thereafter, the denominations gave us difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They kept distracting Brother Kao so that he suffered much.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We were really in danger for a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Satan used many different ways to divide our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Finally, Brother Hsiao, Sister Hsieh, and myself gave the whole matter to God in prayer and begged God to protect His children.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We deeply believed that God had opened a door that no man could shut and that He would protect us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We asked the Lord to give us strength to overcome this attack.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thank the Lord, we stood firm by His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A few days ago I went to Ch'ang-ch'un to visit old Brother T'ien and Sister Chang.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I learned about the conference in Hangchow from them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I really thank the Lord that He raised up Brothers Lo and Chao to serve the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They are very clear about the truth and bear the responsibility of deacons in the assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Parts omitted.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The assemblies in Manchuria will continue to suffer if gifted workers do not come to lead them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It will not be easy for them to go on either.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We entreat the Lord to send Brother Nee to Manchuria soon.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Parts omitted.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Please greet Brother Ma Mei T'ang.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May you be clearly dealt with by the Lord in this time so that you might have more strength to bear an overcoming testimony for the Lord, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Please read the entire fourth chapter of 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>An Ching T'ien</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>December 4, 1934</S>
