   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE TRIUNE GOD LIVING IN THE BELIEVERS SO THAT THEY MAY LIVE HIM 3 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:5; 8:1-2, 4, 6-7, 9; 1 Cor 15:10; Gal 2:20; Matt 20:26-27; 23:11-12; 1 Tim 1:3 GRACE, WHICH IS THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>LIVING IN THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>SO THAT THEY MAY LIVE HIM,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>BEING VERSUS LEGALISTIC OUTWARD PRACTICES</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The central lane of the divine revelation in the Bible is the Triune God living in the believers so that they may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, in a sense, the Bible has many complications.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For instance, Acts 2:44 records that after the day of Pentecost the first believers had all things common.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This practice was not a legality 5:4 , nor did it continue for the long run 11:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nevertheless, the brief record in Acts of this early practice has become a distraction to some Christians and has been misused as a basis for promoting mandatory communal living among certain groups.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The focus of God s economy is not communal living but the Triune God living in the believers so that they may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moreover, our living of God does not require a legalistic communal living.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The practice of having all things common became a distraction and cause of murmuring among the early Christians 6:1 , and it ended even before the ministry of the apostle Paul began.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul was commissioned to complete the word of God Col 1:25 , and he does not teach or even mention this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, he says, Concerning the collection for the saints...on the first day of the week each one of you should lay aside in store to himself whatever he may have been prospered 1 Cor 16:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 2 Corinthians 8:7 he says, Just as you abound in everything...abound in this grace also.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Grace here refers to the act of love shown in the giving of material things to the needy saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The believers grace was the issue of God s grace, which was motivating them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the fellowship concerning the ministry to the saints, the apostle refers to the grace of four parties: 1 the grace of God, which was given to the Macedonian believers to motivate them and enable them to give with liberality vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1-2 ; 2 the grace of the apostles, which allowed the believers to participate in the ministry to the needy saints v. 4 ; 3 the grace of the believers, which was their ministering of material things to the needy ones vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>6-7 ; and 4 the grace of Christ, that He became poor that we might become rich v. 9 . This indicates that the believers offering of material possessions to the Lord for any purpose should be absolutely a matter of grace, not of human maneuvering.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Grace is powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In a sense, to have a legalistic communal living is easy, although complaints and murmurings will soon arise.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, to faithfully set aside a portion of God s material blessing for His needs requires grace, which is the Triune God enjoyed by us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The focus of God s economy in the Bible is the Triune God living in us so that we may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul says, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me 1 Cor 15:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This verse expresses the same thought as Galatians 2:20, which says, It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not I but the grace of God means I cannot do it; it is not I but the Triune God who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Seeking Christians are easily attracted to communal living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, this practice is not what God desires.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What He desires is to live in the believers so that they may live Him practically to the extent that they desire to give financially to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To faithfully set aside a portion of our income for the Lord requires grace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To make any long-term sacrifice, such as Brother Watchman Nee s twenty years imprisonment, requires the Triune God living in us and our living Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The matters of material giving and communal living show that it is easy for us to be distracted from the central lane of the Bible, even by other things in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to realize that no practice will last long if it is not based on the Triune God living in us and our living Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God s intention is not to have a group of people living together and having all things common.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not be distracted from the central lane of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God s desire is for a people who live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As long as we live God, He will spontaneously lead us to give when it is proper.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our living of God balances us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To impose outward regulations is easy, but to live a balanced life requires the Triune God as grace to us.</S>
