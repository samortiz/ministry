We need to see that in order to carry out these matters, we need God's divine supply, which is given to us through His divine dispensing
Without this dispensing we cannot receive the supply, and without this supply we cannot fulfill the requirements in the New Testament
The meekness required in the New Testament is much higher than that required by human teachings concerning morality ethics and human virtues
It is impossible to meet the requirements of humility, meekness, gentleness, and love as revealed in the New Testament by our natural being
We need another being-the being of the processed Triune God dispensed into our being and even constituted into our being
In certain matters, even in such small things as our thoughts and motives, He will not let us go; rather, He corrects and adjusts us
To worship in dead religion, in our mind, or to serve any dead thing rather than God does not require our conscience to be purified
In the eyes of God we were dead ; thus, whatever we did, bad or good, was dead works in the sight of the living God
Now, in order to touch this living God, we need to exercise our spirit and to have a blood-purified conscience
If we would serve God and worship Him, we must do so in our spirit for the preaching of the gospel of God's Son
God desires to transform sinners in the flesh into sons of God in the spirit by dispensing Himself through Christ into them
The crucial point in serving God in our spirit in the gospel of His Son is that we minister Christ to others in the gospel
The only acceptable service and worship that we can render to God is not by the flesh but by the Spirit of God
According to typology the worship of God should be in the place chosen by God to set His habitation and with the offerings
Christ is the fulfillment and reality of all the offerings with which God's people in the Old Testament worshipped Him
In the Old Testament Mount Zion, the place of God's habitation and the place of His name, is a type of the human spirit
According to the New Testament, God's habitation is not on any mountain nor in the heavens; God's habitation is in our spirit
According to law he was a Pharisee according to zeal he persecuted the church and according to the righteousness in the law he was blameless
Paul says strongly that we who believe in Christ serve by the Spirit of God, boast in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh
We need to be reminded repeatedly that we serve and worship God through the dispensing of the processed Triune God
When we come to serve God or worship God we need to have a pure conscience a conscience purified from dead works or from any kind of offense
The only acceptable service and worship that we can render to God is not by the flesh but by the Spirit of God
We have seen in the previous lesson that the believers can experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in serving and worshipping God
In this lesson we will see that the believers need to experience this dispensing also in working and laboring for the Lord
The believers work and labor for the Lord by the Lord's resurrection life and power, not by our natural life and ability
Based on verses 1 through 57, Paul encourages the believers to be steadfast, immovable, and always abounding in the work of the Lord
Only by the resurrection life in us can we be steadfast, immovable, and always abounding in the work of the Lord
They went throughout the land preaching God's word as the gospel, that is, proclaiming the Lord Himself as the gospel
As the believers work and labor for the Lord, they preach Christ as the gospel to sinners by preaching the word of God
They need to preach in season and out of season, that is, whether or not the situation is convenient and whether or not they are welcome
We should also be charged to be ready to proclaim the word of God's New Testament economy in season and out of season
Those who work and labor for the Lord should cast out demons in the Lord's name and heal the sick by laying hands on them
In 1 Timothy 4:6 Paul does not say 'being taught' but 'being nourished,' indicating that his concept is that of supplying life to others
The words being nourished remind us that the work of a good minister of Christ is indeed a matter of life and is for the growth in life
We will be able to lay before the brothers the words with which we have been nourished by the Lord through the ministry
Many lovers and seekers of the Lord Jesus have lost the enjoyment of Christ because they have been deceived and frustrated
We must find a way to supply them with food and share with them the spiritual riches that the Lord has provided us
The nourishing food that the nursing mother eats and digests becomes the milk with which she nourishes her baby
Peter also said, 'Shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not under compulsion but willingly, according to God'
They should shepherd the saints as the flock of God according to God's choice, desire, intention, and preference
The believers need to build up the church with the experiences of the processed Triune God as gold, silver, and precious stones
In 1 Corinthians 3:12 Paul speaks of building on the foundation with three kinds of precious materials-gold, silver, and precious stones
Precious stones are transformed substances; hence, they refer to the third of the Divine Trinity, the Spirit with His transforming work
In order to deal with the power of darkness, there is the need of the exercise of the authority of the heavenly King
As the heavenly King, the Lord Jesus has such authority, but we need to pray, even with fasting, to execute the Lord's authority
Concerning prayer, Acts 1:14 shows that after the Lord's resurrection, the disciples 'all continued steadfastly with one accord in prayer'
They were not conferring with men, nor were they forming an organization; rather, they were fasting and ministering to the Lord
Spiritually speaking, they were not at the altar in the outer court but were at the incense altar in the Holy Place
When they served the people of God, they ministered at the altar in the outer court, offering sacrifices to God for the people
The believers who work and labor for the Lord will be rewarded by the returning Lord in the day of the resurrection of the righteous
In 1 Corinthians 3:14 Paul says that if anyone's work which he has built upon the foundation remains, he will receive a reward
The work that remains must be of gold, silver, and precious stones, the product of faithful ministers of Christ
To give them food is to minister, at the proper time, the Word of God with Christ as the life supply to the believers in the church life
We will be rewarded with the authority to rule in the manifestation of the kingdom, and we will be set over all the possessions of the Lord
We will also participate in the joy of our Master, that is, the enjoyment of the Lord as our inward satisfaction
We do not merely teach the word of salvation; we speak a completing word regarding God's revelation concerning Christ and the church
We need to proclaim in season and out of season, that is, whether or not the situation is convenient and whether or not we are welcome
While working and laboring for the Lord, we should also cast out demons in the name of the Lord and heal the sick by laying hands on them
Paul reminds us to build up the church with the experiences of the processed Triune God as gold, silver, and precious stones
We need to experience the processed Triune God as these precious materials; then we can build up the church as the Body of Christ
To pray is mainly to cause our spirit to be exercised so that the ministry of the word may be enlivened and strengthened
If we work and labor for the Lord in this way, we will be rewarded by the returning Lord in the day of the resurrection of the righteous
In Matthew 25:34, John 17:15, Acts 17:24, Ephesians 1:4, and Revelation 13:8 it denotes the material universe as a system created by God
In John 1:29; 3:16; and Romans 5:12 it denotes the fallen human race, corrupted and usurped by Satan as components for his evil world system
These 'courses' enslave and possess man, causing him to completely forsake and forget God and to go along with the current of the world
The world denotes the enemys scheme system and organization to usurp the place of God in man and eventually to gain full possession of man
If we do not love the world, we can keep the love of God in us, and we will have the ground to overcome the evil one
If we keep the love of God with which He has loved us, we will not love the world; that is, we will not love anything in place of God
The vainglory of life is the empty pride, boast, confidence, assurance, and display of material things of the present life
The Greek word rendered 'life' in verse 16 is bios, a word that refers to the physical life and also to the present life
Just as the world is against God the Father, so the things in the world, which are its lust, are against the will of God
Since everything everyone and every matter have been systematized by Satan we should not live according to the modern fashions of this age
Satan is not only God's enemy outside of God's kingdom but also the adversary within God's kingdom, rebelling against God
We must declare what the Lord has accomplished, the victory of the cross, the attainment of resurrection, and the position of ascension
Loving ourselves and caring for ourselves cause us to lose the position of warfare and to be unable to fight against the enemy
To be subject to God and to be humble toward God enable the believers to withstand the devil, that is, to stand against the devil
In 1 Peter 5:9 faith refers to the believers' subjective faith, which is their faith in God's protecting power and loving concern
In Ephesians 4:26-27 Paul says, 'Be angry, yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your indignation, neither give place to the devil'
In 2 Corinthians 2:11 Paul reminds us not to 'be taken advantage of by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes'
In 2 Thessalonians 3:3 Paul says, 'The Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one'
The whole world lies in the evil one , but we have a part within us that has been regenerated, born of God, and has the life of God
The world denotes the enemys scheme system and organization to usurp the place of God in man and eventually to gain full possession of man
The vainglory of life is the empty pride, boast, confidence, assurance, and display of material things of the present life
Instead of living according to the modern fashions of this age, we need to flee to the Triune God and His Word
We can overcome Satan because of the word of our testimony, which is our testimony that the devil has already been judged by the Lord
The whole world lies in the evil one, but we have a part within us that has been regenerated, born of God, and has the life of God
For the interest of God's kingdom, the believers have to fight the good fight against Satan and his kingdom of darkness
On the positive side, this charge concerns the economy of God, and on the negative side, it concerns the different teachings
Paul charged Timothy to fight against this deviation from the faith, which is to fight the good fight of the faith
The prophecies may refer to some kind of prophetic intimations made concerning Timothy when he was admitted into the ministry
Since such teachings may be used by the enemy to keep us from enjoying the eternal life, we need to lay hold on the eternal life
The faith denotes the contents of the New Testament as our faith , in which we believe for our common salvation
On the third day He was resurrected from the dead both physically and spiritually to become the life-giving Spirit
Because we believe in Him, our sins have been forgiven, He has come into us as our life, and we have been regenerated
In Jude contending for the faith is to contend for the basic and crucial matters of God's new will, His new testament
Someone may say that Jesus died on the cross not for redemption but because He was a martyr and sacrificed Himself for His teachings
The faith, the common faith, has been delivered to the saints once for all, and what we need to do now is to contend for it
Paul also says in 1 Corinthians 9:24, 'Do you not know that those who run on a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize?
These verses indicate that we must not only run, but run successfully in order to obtain the prize, which is a reward as an incentive to us
Although Christ is our way, we should not take this way simply as a way; rather, we should take the way as a race to run
The prize that the believers win for running the race is an incorruptible crown , which is a reward as an incentive
Eternal salvation is by faith, having nothing to do with our work , whereas the reward is for our work after we are saved
The Greek word translated 'encumbrance' in Hebrews 12:1 may also be rendered 'weight,' 'burden,' or 'impediment'
The Greek word translated as 'looking away unto' means to look with undivided attention by turning away from every other object
The wonderful Jesus, who is enthroned in heaven and crowned with glory and honor , is the greatest attraction in the universe
In Hebrews Paul points us particularly to the Christ who is seated in heaven with so many aspects to care for us in every way
In order to fight the good fight of the faith, we need to lay hold on God's life and not trust in our human life
Now by living this life, enjoying and laying hold on the eternal life, we will be able to fight the good fight of the faith
The believers should experience the dispensing of the processed Triune God also by running the course of the race
We must run, and run successfully, in order to obtain the prize, the incorruptible crown, which is a reward as an incentive
We need to stay in His presence, fellowship with Him, and even pray with fasting in order to receive more dispensing of the divine essence
In this lesson we come to a second category-being profited by all things in our circumstances and environments
According to God's design and arrangement, all these persons, matters, and things are used by Him for our good
Romans 8:28 says, 'We know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose'
Gods purpose is His plan and His plan is that we be conformed to the image of His Son so that He would be the Firstborn among many brothers
No doubt, growth comes from inward nourishment, but this nourishment needs the coordination of the outward environment
There is the need of God's sovereignty to arrange our environment so that all things may work together for our good according to His purpose
Whether or not all persons, matters, and things in our environment work to our good depends on whether or not we love God
Paul wrote in Christ Jesus our Lord because he knew that there would be a problem if the love of God was separated from Christ Jesus
Because the love of God is in Christ Jesus, everything is insured; we are assured that nothing can separate us from the love of God
In Romans, after speaking of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory, Paul brings us into God's heart of love
For Christ to be magnified is for Him to be shown or declared great without limitation, for Him to be exalted, and extolled
To magnify Christ is to express Christ without limitation, to make known to others that the Christ who lives in us is unlimited
Matthew 5:10 says, 'Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens'
If we hunger and thirst after righteousness, we need to pay a price, for the righteousness that we seek is the kingdom of the heavens
We are in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens now, and we will be rewarded with its manifestation in the coming age
In order to be in the kingdom of the heavens, we need surpassing righteousness, the righteousness on the highest plane
Peter 4:14 says, 'If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you'
When we are reproached in His name, we are reproached with Him, sharing His sufferings , in the fellowship of His sufferings
they went from the presence of the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be dishonored on behalf of the Name'
If we realize this and experience the dispensing of the processed Triune God, we will boast in our tribulations
Peter 2:19-21 says, 'This is grace, if anyone, because of a consciousness of God, bears sorrows by suffering unjustly
For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model so that you may follow in His steps'
If we are established in the faith, afflictions will do good for us according to God's purpose in His appointment
By experiencing the dispensing of the processed Triune God, the believers in affliction enjoy the peace of Christ who has overcome the world
He arranges everything sovereignly so that we may suffer in order to be perfected in this age and glorified in the coming age
If we are persecuted, the God of grace will perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us after we suffer a little while
We should not be put to shame in anything; rather, Christ should be magnified in our body, whether through life or through death
The Lord said that those who are being persecuted for the sake of righteousness are blessed, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens
Those who are reproached, persecuted, and evil spoken of are blessed because their reward is great in the heavens
If we are reproached in the name of Christ, we are blessed because the Spirit of glory, that is, the Spirit of God, rests upon us
We were called to suffer because Christ also suffered on our behalf, leaving us a model so that we may follow in His steps
By experiencing the dispensing of the processed Triune God, we can enjoy the peace of Christ in sufferings because He has overcome the world
When James speaks of the practical Christian perfection in his Epistle, there is an aspect concerning the enduring of trials
James speaks of various trials, indicating that we should not count just certain trials a joy but should count all trials a joy
For us to experience the putting to death is to experience the working of the cross, which the Lord Jesus suffered and endured
Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day'
According to the facts of the Lord's life on earth, His name, Jesus, denotes a suffering person, a man of sorrows
The more we are in the kingdom, and the more we are for the kingdom of the heavens, the more we shall suffer and be persecuted
The burning furnace used by God to purify our life is God's way to deal with us in the judgment of His governmental administration
By experiencing such a fiery ordeal, God considers us to be sharing, participating in, the sufferings of Christ
The ending -ianos, denoting an adherent of someone, was applied to slaves belonging to the great families in the Roman Empire
For this reason, Peter says that if a believer suffers 'as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name'
Today the term Christian bears a positive significance, that is, a man of Christ, a person who is one with Christ
We not only belong to Him but also have His life and nature in an organic union with Him and live by Him, even living Him, in our daily life
We should magnify Christ in our confession by our holy and excellent manner of life to glorify, express, God in this name
The reason believers suffer is that God does not want His own children, His own house, His family, to suffer the end of the ungodly
Peter says, 'Let those also who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator'
In suffering His just disciplinary judgment in our body, we should commit our souls to Him and to His faithful care
Romans 8 reveals that suffering with Christ is the condition for being heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ
Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15:41 that 'star differs from star in glory,' indicating that some stars shine more brightly than others
By the experience of the divine dispensing, we will reign in the coming age with Christ through endurance in this age
Under God's sovereign arrangement, many trials, troubles, tribulations, and sufferings have been assigned to the believers
Our fellowship with the Lord should be as continuous as our breathing and as the circulation of blood in our bodies
When we fellowship with Him deep within us, we will receive and absorb the dispensing of the processed Triune God in a fine way
Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tried, and you will have tribulation for ten days
We should count it all joy when we fall into various trials, because God, through the divine dispensing, uses them to perfect us
The momentary lightness of affliction works out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory
We should not regard the fiery ordeals that we experience as strange but rather rejoice in sharing the sufferings of Christ
If we suffer from persecutors who contemptuously call us Christians, we should not feel ashamed but should glorify God in this name
By the experience of the divine dispensing, we will reign in the coming age with Christ through endurance in this age
In this message we will see that the believers experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in having the best attitude toward others
Our being submissive to God's appointed authorities in the government is an indicator that we have a certain amount of transformation
Such transformation is the issue of the growth in life through the experience of the dispensing of the processed Triune God
If you do what is evil fear he does not bear the sword in vain for he is a servant of God an avenger for wrath to him who practices evil
In order to maintain a peaceful situation there is the need of a government with authority to rule over the people
He who resists the authority opposes God's ordination, and those who oppose will receive judgment to themselves
If we resist authority, either judgment will descend upon us from the authority, or it will come to us directly from God
Because of our conscience, we need to learn, by being transformed through the divine dispensing, to be subject to authorities
In being subject to the government, believers should pay taxes and customs to the authorities as God's officers
Paul said to Titus, 'Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work'
Before Paul could teach the saints to respect the government, he had to experience a certain amount of transformation
When he was Saul of Tarsus, he was a patriotic Jew and wanted to be free from the yoke of the Roman imperialists
In Titus 3:1 Paul instructs the saints to subject themselves to rulers and authorities, being ready unto every good work
Paul recognized that even the officials appointed by Caesar were rulers appointed by God; they were His deputy authority
We need to be transformed through the divine dispensing in order to be subject to rulers and to be ready unto every good work
The phrase every human institution includes 'a king as being supreme' and also 'governors as being sent by him'
To be subject to institutions means to be subject to the regulations, ordinances, and laws enacted by the legislature
The Lord Jesus said to His disciples, 'You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy'
We love our good neighbors because they suit our natural choice, and we hate our enemies because they do not match our natural choice
In order to love our enemies, we must be born of God to be a God-man, a person saturated with God and mingled with Him
As Spirit is the nature of God's person, and light is the nature of God's expression, so love is the nature of God's being
When he was being stoned, even unto death, he knelt down and cried with a loud voice, 'Lord, do not hold this sin against them'
We have been called to bless others; hence, as a blessed people, we should always bless others so that we might inherit blessing
In order to bless our persecutors and not curse them, we need to be saturated with the processed Triune God through His dispensing
Sometimes it is not possible to live in peace with all men, because others are not willing to have a life of peace
Authority is from God, and those in authority are appointed by God as servants of God to the believers for their good
We should also learn to subject ourselves to authorities, fear and honor them, and maintain a good relationship with the government
If we would fulfill these requirements, we must be born of God to be a God-man, a person saturated with God and mingled with Him
Since His love has been dispensed into us, the love with which we love our enemies is the love of God our Father
We have been called to bless others, so we, as a blessed people, should always bless others so that we might inherit blessing
We also need to pursue peace with all men, endeavoring to keep a peaceful situation with everyone by living in peace with all men
Sometimes it is not possible for us to live in peace with all men, because others are not willing to have a life of peace
Rather, we are referring to the highest standard of morality and virtues achieved through the dispensing of the processed Triune God
It is the living of the Lord Jesus Christ, whose life was a composition of God with the divine attributes and man with the human virtues
In God's eyes the church, the masterpiece of God's work, is the highest poetry , expressing God's infinite wisdom and divine design
As the believers, we compose God's masterpiece and are absolutely new because we are the mingling of God and man
As God's masterpiece, we have been created 'for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them'
We, the believers in Christ, have been created in Christ for good works and redeemed by Christ to be His people, zealous of good works
In order to have the highest standard of morality and virtues, we need to be regulated by four governing principles
The first governing principle is in 1 Corinthians 6:12: 'All things are lawful to me, but not all things are profitable'
The Greek words rendered 'be brought under the power of' literally mean to 'be brought under the authority of'
Paul's thought is that all things are under our authority, but we must not be brought under the authority of anything
When we consider whether or not to do a certain thing, we should ask ourselves if we are under the power or control of that thing
Corinthians 10:23 speaks of the third governing principle: 'All things are lawful, but not all things build up'
Not being brought under the power of anything concerns ourselves and is personal, subjective; building up concerns others and is corporate
Corinthians 10:31 speaks of the fourth governing principle: 'Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God'
According to the context of 1 Corinthians 6:13 through 11:1, to glorify God means in particular that we need to glorify God in our body
Corinthians 6:12; 10:23; and 10:31 have four basic principles for regulating the conduct of New Testament believers
All things are lawful to the believers, but all things must also be profitable, that is, not causing the suffering of any loss
In order to take this narrow way we need to apply Christ to every situation, because it is difficult for us to be released from our habits
Surpassing righteousness is the condition for entering into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the millennium
The Lord Jesus said You have heard that it was said to the ancients You shall not murder and whoever murders shall be liable to the judgment
The law of the old dispensation deals with the act of murder, but the new law of the kingdom deals with anger, the motive of murder
We should have no confidence in our natural life but enjoy Christ's overcoming life through the divine dispensing
In order to live up to a moral standard that is higher than that of the old law, we must overcome our temper and our lust
What the Lord Jesus proclaimed concerning marriage in the new law of the kingdom changed the way of the old dispensation
The Lord's new decree changed the law concerning divorce and recovered marriage back to God's original intention
Concerning the highest standard of morality in the Christian life not divorcing surpasses divorcing ones wife with a certificate of divorce
We need to see a crucial matter, which is that the evil one seeks an opportunity to express himself through our excessive talking
The Lord Jesus said that if we love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us, we behave as sons of the heavenly Father
The demand of the new law of the kingdom is much higher than the requirement of the law of the old dispensation
The kingdom of the heavens is the highest demand, and the life of the Father is the highest supply to meet that demand
The Father has begotten us, He has imparted His life into us, and He has given us His nature for our enjoyment
The divine life brings us into His fellowship, and in this fellowship we enjoy the Father in His life and nature
Through the experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, the believers can have the highest standard of morality and virtues
Christ gave Himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify to Himself a particular people as His unique possession
In order to live out the highest standard of morality and virtues, we need to be regulated by four governing principles
As sons of the heavenly Father, we love our enemies and pray for our persecutors, which surpasses loving our neighbor and hating our enemy
We have been born of our Father so the divine life brings us into His fellowship and in this fellowship we enjoy the Fathers life and nature
We will also consider the believers' experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the matter of watching and praying
We should have the habit of proving everything that we intend to do, of testing everything, and then of holding fast to what is good
The fact that the believers have the highest standard of morality and virtues is also seen in their enduring suffering for doing good
By such inward empowering, Paul could do all things in Christ; that is, he could express Christ in all these virtues
Toward the end of Philippians 48 Paul changes his expression and says If there is any virtue and if any praise take account of these things
Virtue and praise, categorized as 'if any,' are not two additional items but values of the six items already covered
Paul says that we should 'take account of these things'; that is, we should think on them, ponder them, consider them
In our experience of Christ we must attain to the point that whatever we do is true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of
We should also watch and pray concerning the Lord's interest, His present move, the world situation, and the condition regarding the unsaved
When the Lord comes unexpectedly that day will come upon them as a snare as a net cast over all those dwelling on the face of all the earth
As Christians living on this earth, we should not be caught in the trend of today's world nor be stupefied by enjoyment and anxieties
The believers should watch and pray not only to escape the great tribulation but also to 'stand before the Son of Man'
Whether we will become those who prevail to be raptured before the great tribulation does not depend on the Lord
We need to be watchful and pray at every time so that we can prevail to escape the great tribulation and stand before the Son of Man
The Lord said, 'For this reason you also be ready, because at an hour when you do not expect it, the Son of Man is coming'
It is a serious mistake for any believer to think that he can know the exact day and hour of the Lord's coming
Through experiencing the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, the believers can have the highest standard of morality and virtues
We need to have the habit of proving everything that we intend to do, to test everything, and then to hold fast to what is good
The highest standard of morality and virtues is also seen in our endurance, which is the working of God's grace within us
In our enjoying of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, we must learn to watch and pray so that we may not enter into temptation
The Lord reminds us to watch and pray because it is possible for us to be tempted in anything, at any place, and at any time
We need to allow Him to saturate our entire being, spreading from within our spirit to reach and even to penetrate our soul
Eventually, the Spirit becomes one with the bride, the aggregate of all the regenerated and transformed tripartite believers
The processed tripartite man will match the processed Triune God forever for His full expression and satisfaction
In the Old Testament God told His redeemed people Israel that He was their Husband and that they were His wife
When the Lord Jesus came, John the Baptist told his disciples that Christ was the Bridegroom coming to take the bride, who is the church
Finally, the New Jerusalem will be the consummation of God's counterpart, the aggregate of all His redeemed and perfected people
For eternity this universal couple will be the full manifestation of the Triune God expressed in all His glory
The Spirit and the bride call the thirsty ones to come and drink the water of life-the flow of the processed and dispensing Triune God
When we have a sincere desire for the Lord's desire, we also have an earnest expectation for the sinner's salvation
If we have a desire for the Lord Jesus to come back, this desire will stir up within us a concern for the salvation of others
As we are saying, 'Come, Lord,' a burden will rise up within us for our family, neighbors, friends, and colleagues
Anyone who answers the call to come and drink of the water of life will participate in the central goal of God's economy
These two portions of the Word indicate an important characteristic of our Christian life: awaiting the Lord's coming
Our real citizenship, our true commonwealth or associations of life, is not on this earth; it is in the heavens
