   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>G. Jehovah's Charge to Israel</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Depart from Babylon</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 11 and 12 reveal that these chapters concerning Christ as the Servant of Jehovah are related to Israel's departure from Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 11 says, "Depart!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Depart!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Go out from there Babylon !/Do not touch any unclean thing!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>/ Go out from the midst of her!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Cleanse yourself,/You who bear the vessels of Jehovah!"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This word about the vessels of Jehovah indicates that the vessels of the temple, which had been carried away to Babylon, would be brought back to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 12 continues, "You will not go out in haste, / And you will not go in flight;/For Jehovah will go before you,/And the God of Israel will be your rear guard."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The entire Bible gives us one complete revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This revelation shows us that God has an economy, a plan with many arrangements, to gain a people who are regenerated, sanctified, renewed, transformed, and conformed to His image to be His corporate expression that He may be glorified forever.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This revelation includes the fact that God has an enemy Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As God's adversary, Satan is always rejecting God, opposing God, and doing whatever he can to frustrate God from accomplishing His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This opposition to God's economy indicates that there is a war raging in the universe between God and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Bible, the result of Satan's work is called Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In God's eyes, all the attacks carried out by the nations come from one source Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Babylon signifies division with confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Babylon was first called Babel in Genesis 11, but at the end of the Bible, Babel consummates in Babylon Rev 17 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Babylon is also seen in the image in Daniel 2.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The head of that image is Nebuchadnezzar, indicating that Nebuchadnezzar is the head of Babylon, and the ten toes of that image are Antichrist with the ten kings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, Antichrist also will be a part of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Old Testament, Babylon was mainly political, but this political Babylon also interfered with the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Babylon invaded Jerusalem, it destroyed the temple of God and carried away to Babylon the vessels of the temple Dan 1:1-2 , which typify the ways and means for God's people to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These vessels continued to exist, but they were marred.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, captured the people of high rank in Israel, including the royal family, and forced them to worship his god in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, the worship of God was damaged and marred by Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This shows that Babylonian politics went together with Babylonian religion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the New Testament, Babylon is mentioned in a strong way in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The religious aspect is mentioned first Rev 17 , then the political aspect Rev 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The religious Babylon is revealed as "Mystery, Babylon the Great, The Mother of the Prostitutes and the Abominations of the Earth" 17:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Revelation 2:20 she is signified by Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In contrast to political Babylon, religious Babylon, the apostate Roman Catholic Church, is very mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It has God, Christ, and Satan within it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It has a name that it proclaims God and preaches Christ as the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But when its members believe its preaching, they are brought into the secrets, mysteries, and deep things of Satan v. 24 to worship idols.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The apostate Roman Church preaches God but worships idols.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is hypocrisy.</S>
