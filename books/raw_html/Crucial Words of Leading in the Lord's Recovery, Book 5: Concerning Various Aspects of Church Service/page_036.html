	 <h2 class="head3">Living Christ Every Day</h2>
<p>Some elders and deacons among us are not able to speak about the mystery of the faith. If we do not know the mystery of the faith, how can we hold it? The mystery of the faith refers mainly to Christ as the mystery of God (Col. 2:2) and the church as the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4). Therefore, to hold the mystery of God in a pure conscience is to hold Christ, that is, to live Christ out every day. Before we were saved, we lived and acted recklessly; we lied and cheated. After we were saved, our conscience was enlightened, and we became sensitive toward these things. We could no longer cheat or lie; instead, we conducted ourselves properly.</p>
<p>Gradually, we saw that the mystery of God was Christ, not morality, ethics, honesty, faithfulness, righteousness, or holiness. We did not steal or lie, but neither did we live Christ from morning to evening every day. I am afraid that we only lived the life of a proper, moral, and ethical Chinese person; we did not live Christ. Thus, our conscience still condemned us. We were saved, we loved the Lord, and we stood in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, but our testimony was a testimony of morality instead of a testimony of Christ. Therefore, rather than confessing for losing our temper or lying, we need to say, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me for not living You today. People saw my morality, but they did not see You in me.&rdquo; Such an experience proves that we have seen not only the truth but also the mystery of the faith.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Living in the Body Every Day</h2>
<p>Holding the church as the mystery of Christ in a pure conscience includes not only living Christ every day but also living in the Body every day. We do not live Christ by ourselves; we live Christ in the church. Living Christ and also living in the Body of Christ causes the devil to fear. We are people who live in the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>While instructing the elders and the deacons, Paul tells the deacons to hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience (1 Tim. 3:9). This means that the deacons should live Christ in His Body. If we do not live Christ in His Body, our conscience will be bothered by the shining of the truth. Our conscience will condemn us. Although we might not have any wrongdoings, our life is not a life in the Body of Christ nor a life that lives out Christ. Our conscience, which has been enlightened, must be so pure that it wants nothing other than Christ and the church. Then our conscience will not condemn us, and we will have a pure conscience to hold the mystery of the faith. People in the world may know that we believe in Jesus, but they do not know the mystery of our faith in Jesus. The mystery of our faith in Jesus is to live Christ and to live Christ in the Body of Christ. This is a great matter.</p>
<p>The testimony of the church depends upon whether the serving ones&mdash;the elders and deacons&mdash;know the truth. They not only need to know the truth, but they need to keep the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. If all the elders and deacons do this, the church will be strong and rich, and it will be able to spread.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Life Being to Live the Life of Christ in the Body</h2>
<p>In addition to the truth, there is also life. Truth and life cannot be separated. Life is to live the life of Christ in the Body. If you ask me why I have my hair styled in this way, I would say that it is based on my living of Christ. Because I live Christ, my conscience determines how long or how short my hair should be. Similarly, if the elders and the deacons know the truth and live Christ in the Body, that church will be strong and rich.</p>
<p>The first matter that we need is to hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience, that is, to live Christ in the Body of Christ. This is the highest standard of morality, and it is much higher than the standard of morality in society. If we would be in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must live Christ in the Body. This is more than the four ethical standards in Chinese culture: being faithful, filial, kind, and righteous. It is to live the living Christ in the Body of Christ. Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; Philippians 1:21 says, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ.&rdquo; This is not a matter of being kind or loving. This transcends human kindness and love, because Christ transcends human kindness and love. Christianity has lost this, and the Lord is recovering this today.</p>
<p>The elders, deacons, and co-workers need a clear understanding of this. Many young full-timers grow and make progress because of their growth in the truth and in life. I encourage you to read the Bible diligently so that you can see the truth, be enlightened, and have a living that expresses Christ in the Body of Christ. This is life, and the foundation of life is the truth. Thus, truth and life cannot be separated, and they issue in one testimony&mdash;the church life.</p>
