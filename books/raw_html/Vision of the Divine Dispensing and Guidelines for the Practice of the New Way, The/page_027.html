<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Most Comprehensive Way to Read<br>the Bible Based on the Experience<br>of Believers throughout the Ages</H2><P>Now I would like to show you the most comprehensive way to read the Bible based on the experience of believers throughout the ages. There are three methods to do this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Being Nourished Daily in the Spiritual Life<br>by Pray-reading Two or Three Verses<br>Sequentially through a Book of the Bible<br>Every Morning for Ten to Fifteen Minutes</H2><P>You should spend ten to fifteen minutes early every morning to do nothing else but to sequentially pray-read two or three verses from a designated portion of the Bible. During this time, you should not merely read but pray-read, that is, to speak to the Lord directly with the Lord's word and to pray the Lord's word into you. This is the best way to be nourished in your spiritual life. Although everyone is busy during the day with very little extra time, everyone can get up fifteen minutes earlier. Whoever is willing can do it. This way is suitable for everyone. At the beginning, it may require some effort, but after a while, it will become your habit. Moreover, this way of reading helps you to retain the Lord's word in your heart easily. During the day you can "chew" on these words again and again, digesting and receiving the Lord's supply from them. This is the first method of reading, and it is the most necessary one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Studying a Book of the Bible in Depth<br>for Thirty Minutes Every Day</H2><P>The way of studying the Bible by diving into a particular book should not be overlooked. Although we may pray-read two or three verses of the Bible every morning and obtain spiritual nourishment and light, the degree of help we receive may differ. If your knowledge of the Bible is deep, the nourishment you obtain will be rich. Because their knowledge of the Bible is not so accurate, the supply many obtain is not very proper. Therefore, reading the Bible requires an accurate understanding. Of course, a wrong understanding in reading the Bible is better than not reading at all. But understanding the Bible correctly is certainly better than misunderstanding it. However, an accurate understanding in reading the Bible depends on the reader's degree of knowledge of the Bible. For this reason, we have to receive the teaching, and continuously dig deeper into the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Speed-reading Three Chapters of the Old Testament<br>and One Chapter of the New Testament<br>for Fifteen Minutes Every Day</H2><P>Another way to read the Bible is speed-reading. The best time to do this is after lunch. You should read four chapters each time in a sequential way&#151;three in the Old Testament starting from Genesis and one in the New Testament starting from Matthew. This kind of reading does not require much thinking; you do not need to try to understand. Simply read through the chapters quickly. It does not matter if you understand or remember what you have read. Simply read on step by step every day. In the long run, you will surely get the help. In spiritual things, do not try to be too fast or to do too much. The most valuable way in spiritual matters is to do things a little at a time. This is like little streams that flow for a long time. It would be marvelous if we could read the Bible in this way throughout the entire year.</P><P>I treasure very much the fact that you can devote one or two years of your time to wholeheartedly be trained here while you are young. In the church, many spiritual things are received from and taught by others. You have learned most of your knowledge of the truths from me. There is very little that you have that was not received from others. I myself was the same way. In the first forty years of my Christian life, nearly everything I had was learned through others. Later, the Lord was merciful to me and gave me some light directly. I was able to see the matters of God's economy, God's dispensing, God's mingling with man, and so forth. I had this latent ability to understand these things not only because of the growth in life, but also because of the training in the Bible. This is like a person who wants to advance in education. He must reach a certain level of proficiency first before he can do research and discover new things.</P><P>The Bible is not a common book but a highly specialized book. It is not something that man can understand with his natural mentality. I do not believe that as soon as a person opens up the Bible, he can see the light within it and acquire an accurate understanding. Therefore, studying the Bible requires teaching. The simplest way for us to teach people to read the Bible is to give them a kind of leading, guidance, or adjustment in a spontaneous way. This kind of teaching is best carried out when you are pray-reading with others or when praying in the meeting. Spontaneously, as you are pray-reading or praying with others, some words will come out which contain the enlightening or teaching element. When others receive the supply, they will also receive the leading. In order to have this kind of prayer in the Lord, you have to have a great deal of knowledge of the Bible. According to my experience, a proper prayer is with power, and this real power comes from your accumulated labor on the Word of God through the years. Suppose some of you have not yet graduated from college, and you come here to be trained. You will feel that the training is strenuous because your mental capability has not received enough development. You will also find out that there are things that you cannot understand.</P><P>There is one more thing that I have to make clear to you. The word of the Bible is our food. It is not physical food, but spiritual food. The physical food does not need to pass through our mind. It goes directly into our stomach and is digested. However, since the Bible is spiritual food, it needs to pass through our understanding. Suppose a person does not know English, yet you give him an English Bible to read. He will have no way to comprehend it. Therefore, in order to partake of the Lord's word, we must use our spirit and exercise and train our understanding.</P><P>The Bible is the embodiment of God. Hence, this spiritual food is simply God Himself. When it comes into our being, we will not only be satisfied, but God will be dispensed into us. As a result, we will grow with the growth of God (Col. 2:19). Therefore, after you graduate from college, and before you step into society, you should set aside two years to be trained here. This will cause you not only to be filled in life, but also to be educated in the truths. This will surely be a big profit to your experience of human life in the future. For you to be able to do this is a blessing. Unconsciously, your entire being will be affected; your thought, concept, and knowledge of people and of God will be different. This is not only a blessing to you personally, but also to your family. In the future it will be a blessing to society, and it will also be a big help to the church.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei, Taiwan on October 16, 1990)</P>
