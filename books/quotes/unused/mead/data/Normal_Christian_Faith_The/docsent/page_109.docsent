   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE STORY OF A BRITISH POLITICIAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the last century, there was a British woman politician named Christobel Pankhurst.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She was the leader of the woman's suffrage movement.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before the First World War, she tried everything she could to stop the war.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the craftiness and wickedness of the politicians of the day soon triggered the catastrophe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>She then tried her best to end the war.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But her efforts were in vain; the war came to an end only after four bitter years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She thought that if she could lay her hand on power, she would be able to effect political reforms.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But in the end she was convinced that there was no honesty in politics.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be honest would never make one successful in the political arena.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>She began to lose faith in worldly systems.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One day she was looking for some books in an old bookstore in London.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From a pile she pulled out a small booklet written by a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It said that the world situation was going to worsen, and there was no chance of improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The final solution would come only when Christ comes back again.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>She was fully captured by its message.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She wanted to know the price of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The owner, realizing that she was a famed politician, gave it to her as a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The book was published a few decades before that time, and the author had long deceased.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But she realized that what the book mentioned about the world situation was absolutely correct.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Other books merely discussed the outward appearance; this one exposed the root of the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It said that the Lord Jesus came the first time to save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The second time He comes, He will change the political systems.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The booklet also mentioned some prophecies in the Bible concerning the end of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because of this book, she began to read the Bible and accepted Jesus Christ to be her Savior and King.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Later she resigned her political career and wrote some good books concerning the work of Christ and His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>WAITING FOR THE LORD'S COMING</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What we need today is to be proper Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We do not need to try to change the institutions or reform society.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All of our hope rests in the coming of our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When He comes, all problems will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today, we only seek after God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We wait for the coming of His Son, and we trust that in that day we will reign with Him in His glory.</S>
