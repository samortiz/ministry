   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Similarly, the titles the Spirit of God v. 9a , the Spirit of Christ v. 9b , and the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead v. 11 indicate that the Spirit is God, Christ, and the resurrecting One.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Romans 8:16 says, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are much blessed to have the assurance that we have been born of God, yet this is only the beginning.</S>

   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The resurrecting One within us gives divine life to our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although our spirit is life, and our mind set on the spirit is life, our body is mortal, dying.</S>
