   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Advising and Teaching Others to Fear God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Take Refuge in Him</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 7-22 show us David's advising and teaching others to fear God and take refuge in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 8 David said, "Blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, when David disguised himself in front of that king, he did not take refuge in Jehovah but in his "mask," in his disguising himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 11 David said, "Come, children; hear me./I will teach you the fear of Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do we want David to teach us to disguise ourselves, to put on a mask?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This shows that on the one hand, we may trust in the Lord; on the other hand, we may put on a mask to deliver ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually, who saved us the Lord or our mask?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Goodness of Fearing God</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>and Taking Refuge in Him</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Psalm 34 David spoke of the goodness of fearing God and taking refuge in Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>7-10, 17-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 10 says, "The young lions hunger and starve,/But those who seek Jehovah will not lack any good thing."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>People may quote these verses for their personal benefit but eventually end up lacking the material things they desire.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second Corinthians tells us that Paul passed through much suffering and deprivation, even to the extent that he was lacking food and clothing 11:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Way to Fear God</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Psalm 34 David spoke of the way to fear God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>11-16; 1 Pet 3:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verses 12-16 say, "Who is the man who desires life,/Who loves having days in order to see good?/Guard your tongue from evil,/And your lips from speaking deceit./Turn away from evil and do good;/Seek peace and pursue it./The eyes of Jehovah are set toward the righteous,/And His ears, toward their cry./The face of Jehovah is against those who do evil,/To cut off the memory of them from the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These verses were quoted by Peter in 1 Peter 3:10-12, but Paul did not quote such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul's vision of the New Testament economy was clearer than that of all the other apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When David asked, "Who is the man who desires life,/Who loves having days in order to see good?" he was not talking about the eternal life but about the physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>David was a great saint in the Old Testament, and Peter was one of the great apostles in the New Testament, but I do not believe that what David said here is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even among us, who dares ask the Lord to give him long days that he may enjoy many good things?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>David said that if we love having days in order to see good, we should guard our tongue from evil and our lips from speaking deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But who has ever succeeded in guarding his tongue from evil?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What David spoke here was according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 15 says, "The eyes of Jehovah are set toward the righteous,/And His ears, toward their cry."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But who is righteous on this earth?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul said that not one is righteous Rom 3:10 , and Isaiah said that our righteousnesses are like filthy rags Isa 64:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we depend upon our righteousness to enjoy God's eyes and ears being set toward us, we will enjoy nothing, because we have no righteousness of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Concerning the righteous man, David said, "He keeps all his bones;/Not one of them is broken" v. 20 . This is a verse concerning Christ because David was a type of the suffering Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Christ was on the cross, the soldiers did not break His legs when they saw that He had already died John 19:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>John said, "These things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled: 'No bone of His shall be broken'" v. 36 . There were times in describing his sufferings that David typified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we look at Psalm 34, we can see the mixed expressions of David's sentiment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 20 refers to Christ, but most of this psalm is not according to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our concept needs to be changed to the divine concept according to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As we grow in Christ, our concept will be changed.</S>
