   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND TIMOTHY MESSAGE SEVEN THE INCENTIVE TO THE INOCULATOR Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 4:1-8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider the incentive to the inoculator 4:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we shall see, this incentive is the coming reward.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. THE APOSTLE'S CHARGE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 4:1 Paul says to Timothy, "I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, Who is about to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God has given all judgment to Christ because He is a man John 5:22, 27; Acts 10:42; 17:31; Rom 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As the righteous Judge 2 Tim 4:8 , He will judge the living from His throne of glory at His second appearing Matt 25:31-46 , and He will judge the dead at the great white throne after the millennium Rev 20:11-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 4:1 Paul speaks of Christ's appearing and His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ's appearing will be for judgment, to reward each one of us Matt 16:27; Rev 22:12 , and His kingdom will be for His reigning with His overcomers Rev 20:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By these two events the apostle charges Timothy to fulfill his ministry of the word faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here it seems that Paul is saying, "Timothy, you must realize that your life and work today have much to do with the Lord's appearing and His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At His appearing will you be praised by the Lord, or will you receive a rebuke from Him?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Will you receive a reward or chastisement?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Will you be considered qualified to participate in the divine kingship and reign with Christ for a thousand years, or will you be disqualified from reigning with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Timothy, you need to think seriously about these things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, I charge you by the Lord's appearing and kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is a matter of great significance to be charged by the Lord's appearing and kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As genuine Christians we are saved for eternity, but how are we living our Christian life, and how well are we fulfilling our Christian duty?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Are we taking care of God's New Testament economy?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do we practice the proper church life, the Body life, to express God in Christ through the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These questions deserve our attention, for the way we answer them may determine our future as far as the Lord's appearing and coming kingdom are concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not listen to the superstitious and superficial teachings which tell you that as long as you are saved you cannot have any problems with the Lord at His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may have great problems when you meet Him at the judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every believer in Christ, every genuinely saved person, must stand before the judgment seat of Christ and be judged by Him not concerning salvation or perdition, but concerning reward or punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because this is a solemn matter, Paul charged Timothy before God and Christ Jesus and by the Lord's appearing and kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verse 2 Paul continues his charge: "Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word Timothy was to preach included what he had learned both of Paul and of the Old Testament 3:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This proves that verses 1 and 2 are a continuation of 3:14-17.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In caring for a local church, especially in a time of the church's decline, the preaching of the Word is vital.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Timothy was not merely to preach a word about salvation from hell to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was to speak a completing word regarding God's revelation concerning Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such a healthy word is the truth, the reality of the contents of God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Timothy was charged to be ready to preach this word in season and out of season.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To preach in season and out of season means to preach whether the situation is opportune or inopportune, whether it is convenient or inconvenient, whether you are welcome or unwelcome.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, Timothy was to reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all longsuffering and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Reprove here means to convict.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The adjective all modifies both longsuffering and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It speaks of teaching in many aspects and directions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The carrying out of such teaching requires longsuffering.</S>
