   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BIRTH OF THE MAN-CHILD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 12:2 says, "And she was with child, and she cried out, travailing in birth and being in pain to bring forth."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Being with child is figurative and not real.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What does it mean to be with child?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It means that a child is in the mother's womb, and the child and the mother are united in one body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the mother eats, the child is nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the mother is ill, the child is also affected.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The condition of the mother is the condition of the child.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The mother and the child are one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, this child is also different from the mother; he is another being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you say that they are one, they are really one, for the child receives life from the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, as far as his future is concerned, he is different.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His future is entirely distinct from that of his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Immediately after he is delivered, he is caught up to the throne of God, while his mother flees into the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In addition, while the woman is with child, all that can be seen is the mother; the child is hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Outwardly, it appears as if there is only the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The child assuredly exists, but he is hidden within the mother; he is included in the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 3 says, "And another sign was seen in heaven; and behold, there was a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That serpent after several thousand years is completely different.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Originally it was a serpent, but now it has been enlarged to become a dragon.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is the form of this dragon?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It has seven heads, ten horns, and seven crowns upon its heads.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It has the same appearance as the beast which rises up out of the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Revelation 13:1 says, "And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns ten diadems."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The beast which rises out of the sea also has seven heads and ten horns with crowns.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This reveals Satan's goal he wants to gain the crowns, which signify authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The difference between the dragon and the beast is that the crowns of the dragon are upon its heads, while those of the beast are upon its horns.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The heads signify the authority to decide, and the horns signify the authority to execute.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The heads control and the horns execute.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In other words, the horns are subject to the commands of the heads.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whenever the heads move, the horns follow.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that all the behavior of the beast is under the control of the dragon.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Revelation 12:4 begins, "And his tail drags away the third part of the stars of heaven, and he cast them to the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Isaiah 9:15 shows that the tail denotes lying and deception.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Revelation 2 and 3, stars refer to angels.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since the stars of heaven are mentioned here, they are the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One third of the angels in heaven were deceived by the dragon, and they fell and were cast down with the dragon.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 4 continues, "And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, so that when she brings forth he might devour her child."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here is a woman whom God has purposed in His will and a man-child whom He desires to obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the dragon is hindering what God is after in the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The dragon knows that this woman is about to bear a man-child; therefore, it stands before the woman and waits to devour her child as soon as she delivers.</S>
