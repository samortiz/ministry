   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE CONCERNING THE VISION AND BURDEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One of the feelings I have from my visit abroad is that the Lord has opened a door for us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even if we do not take into account the openness in the West, but only consider the openness in Southeast Asia and Japan, we can see that a door is wide open.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are opportunities for us to go and labor.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Burma, and Thailand there are at least fifty places with meetings, and every place needs saints to go and help them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They are waiting and hoping that saints from Taiwan will go and help them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some of the Lord s workers want a good opportunity and a good location for their work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, they often write letters to advertise their availability.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If they want to labor in a place, they write and ask whether there is an opportunity to labor there.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this way, they seek for an opportunity and a place to work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the Lord has given us a wide-open door.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Believers want us to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In contrast to workers who seek opportunities to work, the Lord does not require us to seek opportunities to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The opportunities are waiting for us and are even looking for us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The brothers and sisters need to understand that the places abroad have a great need and are open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We know our true condition in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even though the saints abroad respect us and regard us highly, we know that we are not that high.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to know our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nevertheless, if we compare our condition with that of other places, we see that we are able to meet the needs in some places.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, there is a brother who was originally from Indonesia.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He lived in Taipei for many years and met in the third district.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, he has returned to Indonesia and is somewhat useful there.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is able to help the local saints, particularly the young people, and his function has become manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Another example is that some meetings overseas depend on the saints from Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In many places brothers from Taiwan are responsible for the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is as if the meetings cannot continue if the saints from Taiwan are not present.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This situation proves that there is a great need in all the places.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>BEING SPIRITUAL AND BECOMING NOTHING</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Question: Can you fellowship more about our work being limited by what we have learned and what we are doing?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Does this mean that our usefulness is not related to our spiritual learning?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Should we pursue spirituality in order to be more useful to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How can we solve the problems in a place if we do not know what their problems are?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Answer: We should not use spirituality as a means to measure the usefulness of a believer in the Lord s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>None of the believers who are confined in their service by their spirituality have a good ending.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, every serving one must learn to live in the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is to pursue being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I do not like to use the word spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Especially after my visit overseas, I am not sure what it means to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do not understand the expression pursue spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What does this refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What does it mean to be spiritual?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I know what it is to be humble and to be proud, and I understand what it is to persevere and to love.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Does spirituality mean that a person can be built with others?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I do not understand what it is to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, a person who constantly seeks spirituality does not become spiritual; instead, he becomes nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This was the failure of the mystics.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order to be spiritual, the mystics maintained a life of privacy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They focused on their relationship with God, on learning to fellowship with God, and on living in God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They considered this to be crucial and maintained a life of privacy in order to learn these lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As a result, they became nothing, because they have no spiritual posterity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>SPIRITUALITY CAUSING A PERSON TO BE LAZY</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many believers who have an understanding of spiritual matters reject things from the mystics.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Brother Yu Cheng-hua translated some of Madame Guyon s books and introduced them to us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These books are still being read among us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The first book that he translated was an abridged version of her autobiography.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Chinese translation, entitled Fragrant Myrrh, was published twenty years ago in 1938.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He also translated A Short and Easy Method of Prayer and a book by Brother Lawrence entitled The Practice of the Presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Have these books rendered us any genuine help in the past twenty years?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we study this matter seriously, we will see that the way of the mystics has no future.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The practices of the mystics can only produce a group of special believers.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Believers who may have been good material before they were helped by the mystics are damaged, and their progress is frustrated after they begin to follow the practices of the mystics.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They turn inward and practice short and easy prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I know these things because I witnessed this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Believers who practice these things become lost in mysticism, and they are hindered and delayed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In order to avoid a conflict among us, we have not rejected the things of the mystics.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I stopped receiving the teaching of Madame Guyon in 1943.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, in order to diffuse a crisis among us, I spoke according to her writings.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I went along with the situation, and by the Lord s mercy, some saints were recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Several of the saints here are from Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If they consider our past, they will understand what I am saying.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I went to Shanghai to diffuse a crisis.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>One aspect of this crisis was related to the teachings of the mystics.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I do not deny the need to turn to our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This teaching of the mystics has its value.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, there is a danger that we will have problems if we are constantly turning inward.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, instead of opposing the practice of touching an inner feeling, I turned the saints to preach the gospel and to start new meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This was a rescue and a release.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>After I was in Shanghai for more than a year, the atmosphere changed.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I encouraged everyone to preach the gospel and to start new meetings instead of continually turning inward.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When Brother Nee resumed his ministry, he said to me that many of the things by Madame Guyon should not have been brought in. To repeat the mistake of the mystics produces a manufactured, or artificial, spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Such spirituality often turns into personal freedom and results in spiritual laziness.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>For example, so-called spiritual believers can say that even if thousands of people go to hell, they must seek the inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They must also seek the inner feeling even if the churches are desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>To turn inward is a euphemism.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is a sign of laziness and indicates that they do not have a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>A person with a burden does not continually declare that he must turn inward to seek the inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Only a mother who does not care about her children would say that she must maintain her cleanliness at the expense of her children.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>A mother who is truly burdened for her children will take care of her children.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Please do not misunderstand me.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is difficult to find a brother among the workers as pure, absolute, and faithful as Brother Yu was.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>However, if we follow the way that he introduced, we would have no future.</S>
