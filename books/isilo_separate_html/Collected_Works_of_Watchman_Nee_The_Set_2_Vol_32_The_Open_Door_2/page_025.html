Please use X dollars for the relief of co-workers or brothers and sisters in difficulty and use the rest for the expense of The Open Door. Starting with Issue No. 9, we will need only three copies of The Open Door because there are very few brothers and sisters here who can read. The meetings have been under the Lord's guidance. Although the number is small, every meeting is filled with mutual, short testimonies. Thank the Lord! The Lord willing, we hope to build a meeting hall this year for the preaching of the gospel.</p><p>Brother Gung En-lung<br />[Address omitted]</p><p> (This letter was received on July 22&mdash;Editor.)</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> </body></html>
