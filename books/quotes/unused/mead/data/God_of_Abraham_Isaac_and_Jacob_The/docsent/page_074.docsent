   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BACK TO CANAAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Esau returned to Seir, and Jacob set off to Succoth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and pitched his tent before the city" v. 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Remaining in Shechem</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God wanted Jacob to go back to his father's land, but he remained in Shechem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Shechem was only the first stop on the way to Canaan, yet Jacob dwelt in Shechem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, he built a house in Succoth v. 17 . Then he bought a parcel of a field, spread his tent, and erected an altar in Shechem, and called it "El-Elohe-Israel," which means "God, the God of Israel" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He had not reached Bethel nor Hebron yet; he was only in Shechem, and he dwelt there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He not only dwelt there, but he bought a piece of land there.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This shows that Jacob was not strong enough and had not learned the lesson properly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He had not reached the state of perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's dealing with Jacob was gradual.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The discipline of God and the constitution of the Holy Spirit were carried out step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although it was a failure for Jacob to remain in Shechem, he nevertheless built an altar there, called on the name of God, and proclaimed God to be the God of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was a progression.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God was now not only the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac, but "El-Elohe-Israel."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"El" is God, and "Elohe" is also God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The meaning of the whole word is "The God of Israel is indeed God," or "God is indeed the God of Israel."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He could now say such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He had indeed made some progress before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In chapter thirty-four, Jacob's daughter was defiled in that land, and two of his sons plotted and killed Shechem and all the males of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This put Jacob in a very difficult situation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was then that God called him to Bethel 35:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God disciplined him and guided him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He wanted to live in Shechem, but God would not let him live there for too long.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have mentioned before that Abraham lived in three places in Canaan: Shechem, Bethel, and Hebron.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He built altars in all three places.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These three places carry the characteristics of Canaan; they are in fact a representation of the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After Peniel, God intended to take Jacob on the path of Abraham, first to Shechem, then to Bethel, and finally to Hebron.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Abraham passed through these three places, and God led Jacob through these three places as well.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After Peniel, God led him on to Shechem and then to Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Peniel and Bethel match one another.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At Peniel God said, "Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel" 32:28 , and at Bethel He also said, "Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob" 35:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In other words, Peniel was the beginning, while Bethel was the completion.</S>
