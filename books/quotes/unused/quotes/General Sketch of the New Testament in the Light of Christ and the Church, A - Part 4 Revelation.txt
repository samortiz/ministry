To know what Mark deals with is a further help to understand Revelation, and so on with Luke and all the following books
Nearly every crucial term, clause, and phrase in Revelation is taken from either the Old Testament or the other New Testament books
We must become familiar with all the terms, the phraseology, the terminology, and the titles in the entire Scriptures
The subject of the entire Scriptures is Christ as our life and the church as His expression or, stated more briefly, Christ and the church
As we have seen, the entire New Testament presents a picture of a universal man, having Christ as the Head and the church as the Body
Since the New Testament is the fulfillment of the Old Testament, the entire Scriptures are also a picture of this universal man
Christ is the very life and content of this universal man, and the church is the very expression and manifestation
At the beginning there are the local churches as the lampstands in each locality to hold Christ as the lamp with God as the light
With every record of a human life there are many things of Satan, sin, death, the world, idols, and the kingdom of darkness
Everyone else's life is a life with Satan, sin, death, the world, idols, and darkness and with almost nothing of God
The third section, Revelation 21 and 22, reveals Christ in eternity as the very center, centrality, and universality of all things
When He looks at people, He burns them in order to purge away everything which does not correspond to the nature of God
Anything which does not match the nature of God is purged away by this burning fire and is cast into the lake of fire
After all of the judgments by burning, everything in the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem is purified
Anything that is of life will pass the test, but anything that is not of life will be judged, rejected, and burned
If we do not, we will have many things which do not correspond to the nature of this life; all these things will be burned
In addition, at the end of Revelation there is a city with a flow of living water, and in Ezekiel there is the same thing
Revelation 2 and 3 contain the seven epistles to the churches, which are the last epistles given by the Lord to His church
These seven epistles were written to seven churches in Asia; however, at that time there were more than seven churches
What is mentioned in chapters two and three must also be in the nature of prophecy, and we must interpret the seven epistles as prophecies
If we realize these two chapters in the way of prophecy, we will obtain their proper meaning, and they will be very meaningful
If we compare the record of these two chapters with the facts of church history, we will realize that they correspond to one another
If we look into these seven epistles from this point of view and under this light, we will realize how meaningful and helpful they are
When we talk about the practice of the church, we all need to know and understand the seven stages of the course of the church on this earth
About forty years ago in China, Brother Watchman Nee published twenty-four issues of a monthly paper entitled The Christian
Following this, during World War II, Brother Nee conducted a study of Revelation 2 and 3 a second time in a wonderful way
History tells us that in all the centuries since the lampstand in Ephesus was taken away, there has never been a genuine church there
The second loss was that the believers would not be rewarded with the enjoyment of the tree of life in the Paradise of God
If we do love the Lord, on the other hand, we will enjoy Him as life, and we will enjoy light as the issue of this life
When Constantine came into Christianity, made it the state religion, and encouraged people to come into it, he made it something great
Balaam was a Gentile prophet who taught Balak the king to cause the people of God to commit fornication and worship idols
The time that Constantine came into Christianity was the start of the teaching of the heathen prophet, the teaching of heathenism
In the initial stage, the church in Ephesus had only the works, the activities, of the Nicolaitans , not yet the teaching
In the ancient time, after the people of Israel were delivered out of Egypt, God declared that they were a kingdom of priests
Due to the failure of the people of Israel in worshipping the golden calf at Sinai, only one tribe out of the twelve tribes became priests
After Constantine made Christianity the state religion, thousands of unregenerate people were baptized into Christianity as members
A small number were trained to be the priests the clergy while the vast majority of the nominal Christians took care of their worldly living
In the church there must be no class, or we may say, there must be only one class-not clergyman or layman but brother
Pergamos was a fortified tower, like the great tree in Matthew 13:31-32, in which everything was exposed for outward show
Revelation is a book of prophecy in symbols, and the seven epistles in chapters two and three contain many symbols
In addition, there was also the teaching of the Nicolaitans , the teaching of the hierarchy, the difference between the clergy and the laity
Nicolaitans is derived from two Greek roots-nikao, meaning 'to subdue' or 'conquer' and laos, meaning 'laity' or 'common people'
The teaching of Balaam brought the church into union with the world, and the teaching of the Nicolaitans mixed the church with Judaism
History tells us that during the fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries, these things happened exactly in this way
When the bishop of Rome began to be considered as the pope, the Roman Catholic Church was officially and formally formed
The Roman Catholic Church was prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 13:33, in which a woman took leaven and added it to fine flour
In the eyes of the Lord, the Roman Catholic Church became the same as this woman, bringing many heathen practices into the church
In the same way, the church itself must not teach, because in the eyes of the Lord the church is in the position of a woman
Only the Lord Himself is the man, the one who has the right to teach, the right to say yes or no, right or wrong
By the teaching of this woman, many pagan and heathen things were brought into the church, causing fornication and idol worship
If we read the history of the church, we will discover the actual fulfillment of the prophecy of the Lord in this epistle to Thyatira
The thousand years from the sixth century to the time of the Reformation in the sixteenth century was a period of darkness
From that time the Vatican became an independent state with its own jurisdiction, conducting diplomatic affairs
The latter stages of the church have more to do with us today than the first ones, so we must be more familiar with them
No doubt, the Reformation which began at the time of Martin Luther was the fulfillment of the prophecy in this epistle
On the one hand, many things were recovered in the Reformation, but on the other hand, many of those things withered away
The Roman Catholic Church became an international church, mixed with all the nations but under one head, the pope
Although during the Reformation the church gave up its international character, it fell to become the national churches
Luther himself admitted that this was wrong, but he could not avoid it because the political influence was too great
Luther was one of the greatest servants of the Lord, and we do not want to criticize him, but we must speak the truth
They became the dissenters and began to form dissenting churches the private churches such as the Presbyterian Church and the Baptist Church
In the eyes of the Lord, both the national churches and the private churches are weak and full of deadness, so the Lord rebuked them
The reformed churches did not satisfy the Lord's heart because they did not fully return to the normal condition of the church
About three hundred years after the Reformation, the sixth stage of the church began, symbolized by the church in Philadelphia
In the epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 there are several meaningful names, such as Balaam, the Nicolaitans, and Jezebel
Panton tell us that the Brethren movement was more powerful than the Reformation, although many people today do not know much about it
The Brethren, on the other hand, did not advertise themselves, and they had nothing to do with worldly affairs
Some of the Brethren were lords and ladies in society, but when they were gained for this testimony, they renounced their titles
In the entire history of the church, there has never been a group of believers as the Brethren who gave up the world in such an absolute way
More than ninety percent of the fundamental teachings in Christianity come from the discoveries made by the Brethren teachers
The Scofield Reference Bible is very popular in the United States today but Scofield was just the salesman not the factory of his teachings
The truths in almost all the notes in his Reference Bible and the teachings in his correspondence course came from Brethren writings
The Brethren were outstanding in three things-in brotherly love, in keeping the Lord's word, and in not denying His name
Brotherly love, keeping the Lord's word, and not denying His name were prominent among them, and they dropped all other things
There is no mention of sinfulness or the teaching of Balaam, the teaching of the Nicolaitans, or the teaching of Jezebel
They claimed to be wealthy and rich and to have need of nothing, but in actuality they were neither cold nor hot, but lukewarm
The Brethren had a very good start over a century ago, but after about twenty-five years, many of them fell into degradation
Laodicea represents not the reformed churches but the degraded Brethren, who are fallen not due to sin but due to pride
As this chart indicates, the stages of the church represented by Ephesus, Smyrna, and Pergamos have all concluded
The church in Thyatira, the fourth stage of the course of the church, exists today and will remain until the end of this age
If we were born five hundred years ago, there would have been no choice before us; there was only one kind of church
Of course, we may all agree that we can have nothing to do with Thyatira, but some people still argue for Sardis
Once we become Philadelphia, we can never again be Sardis, but we must be careful that we do not become Laodicea
Although Ephesus lost its first love, it remained at the level of normality, as indicated by the first part of the systematic chart
Chapters four and five of Revelation show us the scene around the throne in the heavens after Christ's ascension
A jasper stone is dark green and semitransparent, symbolizing that God is the God of life in its transparency, pureness, and brightness
The very God who directs the entire universe is a God of pure and transparent life, and He is also a God of redemption
There are the angelic hosts, the angels, and there is the rest of creation in heaven, on the earth, under the earth, and in the sea
The twenty-four elders as leading ones represent the angels, and the four living creatures represent the rest of creation
That the twenty-four elders have golden crowns upon their heads means that they were given the power to rule as kings
From the beginning of creation, the Lord appointed the angels to have the power and authority to rule the universe
On the one hand, they have the authority to rule the universe, and on the other hand, they are the priests serving in the presence of God
In 5:8 each of the elders has a harp, which is for praising the Lord in His presence, and they have bowls of incense
The angelic elders, as the most ancient of the creatures, praise the Lord, and they bring the saints' prayers to God
In the scene around the throne in the heavens there are also four living creatures having the appearance of a lion a calf a man and an eagle
Colossians 1:20 indicates that in addition to man, all other creatures except the angels need God's redemption
In front of the tabernacle there was the laver for washing , and in front of the temple stood a bronze sea with ten bronze lavers
The people of Israel crossed the Red Sea and the Jordan River, and we Christians are baptized in water to deal with all the negative things
Coming out from the throne are the seven 'torches,' the seven lamps of fire, the sevenfold Spirit in God's operation and judgment
Revelation 5:1 says that on the right hand of the One who sits upon the throne there is a scroll sealed up with seven seals
When the Lord Jesus took the scroll and was about to open its seals, two hosts in the universe worshipped and praised Him
Some expositors say that from chapter four, Revelation begins to speak of things in the future, but this is not accurate
In the book of Revelation there are four big sevens-the seven churches, seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls
At the time that this book was written, the church and in particular John, its writer, were under the persecution of the Roman Empire
Because we have the spiritual wisdom today, we can understand Revelation and put the puzzle together to give us a clear picture
Please refer to 'The Chart of the Seventy Weeks and the Coming of Christ, with the Rapture of the Saints' at the beginning of this book
The seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls in Revelation are composed both of four plus three and six plus one
The number four signifies the creatures, as represented by the four living creatures, while the number three represents the Triune God
Without the Lord's judgment, the things in the hands of man always degrade, but due to God's judgment, there is an improvement
In the age of the church there is seven, signifying God plus man, but in eternity there will be twelve, signifying God mingled with man
As the gospel of peace, the rider carries a bow in his hand with no arrow, for the arrow has been shot on the cross
Darby taught, there would be no prophecy telling us what would transpire from the time of the Lord's ascension until the great tribulation
Rather, the four horses in chapter six give us a picture of what happens from the Lord's ascension to the time of the great tribulation
In principle, they are still saying, 'a choenix of wheat for a denarius and three choenixes of barley for a denarius'
These four things-the preaching of the gospel, war, famine, and death-are four horses running a race, and they are still here with us today
We have to say that we are on the first horse, the preaching of the gospel of peace, which goes forth conquering and to conquer
These martyrs have been very patient, waiting for a long period of time until the four horses will have almost finished their race
They have to wait until the number of their fellow slaves who are about to be killed for the Lord's testimony is completed
The first will occur at the beginning of the great tribulation , and the second will occur after the great tribulation
Revelation 7:1-8 speaks of the one hundred forty-four thousand of the remnant of Israel, who are sealed by God
The believing Jews are reckoned as members of the Body of Christ and are not to be considered among the Jewish people
Even among the Jewish people, however, there will be a certain number who truly will be serving God at the end of this age
In verses 1 to 3, the four angels holding the four winds of the earth are given the order not to harm the earth, the sea, or the trees
The number of those sealed is one hundred forty-four thousand, which is twelve thousand from each of the twelve tribes
The one hundred forty-four thousand does not include the entire nation of Israel, because the tribe of Dan is not represented among them
According to Ezekiel 48:1, however, in the coming millennium Dan will still be counted among the tribes of Israel
The insertion between the sixth and seventh seals shows us how God will be mindful of His people, both of Israel and of the church
Before the damage brought in by the seven trumpets God will take care of His people desiring if possible to save them from these calamities
Through many years of careful study, we have seen that even before the sixth seal some overcomers will be raptured
In order to see these things clearly, please refer to the chart mentioned above and read Revelation again, many times if possible
On the one hand, the casting of fire to the earth is the answer to the saints' prayers, which are made effective by Christ as the incense
When the fourth trumpet sounds, the third part of the sun, the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars are smitten
Today people say that whatever happens to the earth is natural, but at that time they will realize that what is happening is supernatural
That only one-third of everything is damaged will indicate that there must be a sovereign One who is arranging these things
In Luke 10:18 the Lord said that He saw Satan falling like lightning out of heaven; that was the judgment of Satan
The Antichrist, as the king of the demon-possessed locusts, has a name in Hebrew, Abaddon, meaning 'destruction'
The four angels were released, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year that they might kill the third part of men'
The first four trumpets damaged only the earth with the trees, the seas, and the rivers, and the things in the heavens
At the sixth seal, however, there is a sudden supernatural change in the signs in the heavens-the sun, the moon, and the stars-and on earth
He warns them that this earth is not trustworthy, and because the Lord will shake this earth, they should not become settled in it
God intends these four trumpets to be a warning to the people on the earth not to trust it and settle down on it
The sixth trumpet brings even more intensified tribulation-two hundred million horsemen who kill the third part of men
At this point, one third of the earth, one third of the sea, one third of the fresh waters, and one third of the heavens have been damaged
Now because men would not be warned by the first four trumpets but continue to do things against God one third of the population is cut off
The fifth trumpet as the first woe has something of scorpions , whereas the sixth trumpet as the second woe has something of serpents
Revelation 10:1 continues, 'And the rainbow was upon His head, and His face was like the sun, and His feet like pillars of fire'
That the Angel lifted up His right hand to heaven indicates that Christ is ready to judge the earth and possess it through His judgment
That there shall be delay no longer means that there will be no more time of toleration in God's judgment upon the earth
He said to me, Take it and devour it, and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey
Verse 11 continues, 'And they said to me, You must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings'
In chapter twenty-one, however, there is no need of a rod because there is nothing left to judge in the New Jerusalem
The insertions in the book of Revelation speak about matters close in time to the events in the nearby chapters
Three and a half years, that is, forty-two months times thirty, is a thousand two hundred and sixty days, as in verse 3
During the last half of the last week of this age, the two witnesses will come to prophesy, clothed in sackcloth
Revelation 11:4 says, 'These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth'
The first school says that these two witnesses are Enoch and Elijah, whereas the second school says that they are Moses and Elijah
Verses 5 through 7 say, 'And if anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies
Three and a half days is similar to the three days in which the Lord was in the tomb and the four days in which Lazarus was dead
Because the two witnesses are 'troublemakers,' people will celebrate when they are killed and will leave their bodies on the street
Literally, men in verse 13 is 'names of men,' or as Robert Govett says, 'men of names,' implying people of renown
The last half of the last week, that is, the three and a half years, will be the period of the great tribulation
The Lord destroys the religious Babylon, for example, in chapter seventeen and the material Babylon in chapter eighteen
The lightnings, voices, thunders, and earthquake correspond exactly to 16:18, indicating that these two verses refer to the same time
In chapter four there is a throne in heaven with a rainbow; the prophecy in the first section is under the vision of this throne
In chapter eleven, however, there is another vision, not of the throne but of the temple in heaven, and not with a rainbow but with an ark
As we have seen, the throne refers to God's authority, and the rainbow refers to God's covenant concerning the earth
Genesis 1 gives a complete record of God's creation in a general way, but more details are needed in order to show us God's eternal purpose
In the first part of the prophecy of this book, from chapter four to chapter eleven, we cannot realize what God is seeking after
We can only see that God, as the One on the throne with the rainbow, is judging to clear up the situation on the earth
God is not satisfied with the temple in which He dwells, so He is preparing another, bigger habitation, which is the city of New Jerusalem
The city will take the place of the temple in the eternity to come, and Christ will be the very ark of testimony in that city
Today this ark of testimony is in the temple, but God's intention is to work this ark from the temple into the city
The whole story of the Old Testament from Genesis 11 to the end of Malachi is simply a record of these two cities
In principle, therefore, the sun, the moon, and the twelve stars together represent the entire company of God's redeemed people
Because this woman is not earthly but heavenly, we cannot say that this woman is Mary, the mother of Jesus, as some Bible students claim
The twelve stars represent the patriarchs; before the age of the law, the patriarchs were shining and glorious as stars
Just as the moon reflects the glory of the sun, the Old Testament time only reflected the glory of the New Testament
The Old Testament tells us that the redeemed Israel was a woman before God, and the New Testament says the same thing about the church
Verses 2-4 say, 'And she was with child, and she cried out, travailing in birth and being in pain to bring forth
Another sign was seen in heaven; and behold, there was a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems
The dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, so that when she brings forth he might devour her child'
Verse 5a says, 'And she brought forth a son, a man-child, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod'
In this picture, there is a woman, signifying something weak, out of whom comes a man-child, signifying something strong
Within the woman, the weaker part, representing all the redeemed people of God, there is a stronger part, who are the overcomers
The overcomers are a small number who stand up to fulfill God's purpose when the majority of the people of God have failed Him
In the recovery of God's people in the Old Testament time, God's intention was to have all His people come back from Babylon to Jerusalem
Those who came back to Jerusalem became the overcomers standing in the position of God's people to fulfill God's purpose
The times of the raptures in Revelation 12 and 1 Thessalonians 4 are different, and the places to which they are raptured are also different
After the overcomers are raptured and caught up to God's throne, there will be no more place there for the enemy
When the conscience becomes pure, it is easy for it to be weak; many times a keen conscience becomes a weak conscience
On the one hand we do have to deal with our conscience but on the other hand we have to stand against the enemy by the covering of the blood
We will have a pure conscience, a conscience void of offense, and we will have the boldness to give the word of our testimony
In order to overcome the enemy, we need to apply the blood, have a strong word of testimony, and put our life into our testimony
Verses 13 and 14 say, 'And when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the man-child
After God's people fled from Egypt, the Lord told them that He had borne them on eagles' wings and brought them to Himself
During this time, God will nourish the remaining believers just as He nourished His people in the wilderness for forty years
Jeremiah 46:7-9; 47:2-3; and Isaiah 8:7-8; 17:12-13; and 59:19 tell us that the armies of the enemies of God's people come like a flood
During the three and a half years, the devil will send his evil spirits to cause great armies to come to persecute the people of God
The stronger part, the man-child, has been raptured by this time, but these two groups still remain on the earth
Since Antichrist, the beast, is like these three, he will have all their characteristics, as mentioned in Daniel 7:4-7
Verse 6 says, 'And he opened his mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, which tabernacle in heaven'
If anyone is for captivity, into captivity he goes; if anyone kills with the sword, with the sword he is to be killed
Whereas Christ as the Lamb of God with seven horns has the seven Spirits of God , this false lamb with two horns sends out unclean spirits
Verse 13 says, 'And he does great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth before men'
The first beast, Antichrist, comes out of the abyss , and the second beast, the false prophet, comes out of the earth
In Acts 1:20, Peter refers to Judas by quoting Psalm 109:8, which says, 'May his days be few; / May another take his office'
In addition, Acts 1:25 says that after Judas died, he went 'to his own place,' not to his people as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob did
By joining all these points together, we can believe that this false prophet will be Judas, who will come back from the dead
Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred sixty-six'
Because the book of Revelation was written during the time of the Roman Empire, John could not write it in plain words
Six hundred sixty-six is the number of the beast, the number of a man, and the number of the name of that beast
The number represented by the Hebrew letters of the name Nero is 306, and the number represented by Caesar is 360; the total comes to 666
The number six, however, is one short of seven, signifying humanity created on the sixth day but short of God and corrupted by Satan
In contrast the Greek name for Jesus according to the numeric value of the Greek letters adds to 888 eight being the number of resurrection
The Antichrist is nothing but corrupted humanity without God, while Jesus is humanity mingled with God in resurrection
That the hundred and forty-four thousand are purchased from the earth indicates that they are redeemed ones, a part of the church
The firstfruits and the general harvest are mentioned in type in Leviticus 23:10 and 22, Exodus 23:19, and 34:26
The firstfruits are brought from the field not to the barn but into the temple for God's satisfaction and enjoyment
After ripening, it is brought not to the temple but into the barn, the place between the field and the farmhouse
In the same principle, the firstfruits in chapter fourteen do not merely enjoy the rapture, but they satisfy God's need
On the one hand the manchild fulfills Gods purpose by defeating His enemy while on the other hand the firstfruits are for Gods satisfaction
As the firstfruits offered to God in the temple for His satisfaction, they enjoy the rapture in order to take care of God's need
The terms, the items, the contents, of this gospel are one hundred percent different from the gospel of grace preached by believers
Whereas the gospel of grace is one of repentance and faith, the eternal gospel is for people on the earth only to fear God and worship Him
The parable of the ten virgins is related to the Christian life , and the parable of the talents is related to Christian service
The parable of the sheep and the goats in Matthew 25 gives us a picture of how the Lord after His coming back will judge the living Gentiles
The sheep, however, will be reckoned as good ones merely by their works, and the goats will be reckoned as evil ones also by their works
The Lord will judge the nations according to the way they treat the least of His brothers during the tribulation
If those of the nations treat the persecuted brothers of Christ well, the Lord Jesus will reckon them as sheep when He comes back
After this warning Christ will come back to defeat Antichrist and exercise His judgment on those Gentiles who are still living on this earth
That judgment will not be based on the gospel of grace, for the dispensation of the gospel of grace will be over at that time
Those who listen to this gospel and fear God will not dare to persecute the believers or the Jews who are God's people
The Communists persecute the Christians, but some Gentiles fear God and secretly share their food and clothing with them
Some will listen to that gospel, fear God, worship Him, and treat the Lord's brothers, the weaker ones among God's people, well
These include the parables of the sower the wheat and the tares the great tree the leaven the hidden treasure and the pearl of great value
A net is cast into the sea to gather from every living species, which are brought to the shore and divided into the good and the foul
In contrast, the things brought up from the sea by the net refer to the ones who are not regenerated and transformed
All the sheep, the good ones, will be transferred into the millennial kingdom to be the nations, the people, on this earth
The Jews, however, will be the priests in the millennial kingdom helping people to know God , and the overcoming believers will be the kings
At the beginning of the last three and a half years of this age, Antichrist and the ten kings under him will turn against the Roman Church
The cup of His wrath mentioned in verse 10 will be the seven last plagues, the plagues of the seven bowls, spoken of in chapter sixteen
Those who keep the commandments of God are the genuine Jews, and those who keep the faith of Jesus are the New Testament believers
Because the rest of the harvest is green, it is left in the field until the earthly waters, the earthly supply, are dried up
Verses 17 to 20 say, 'And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle
The angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the fury of God
At the end of the great tribulation all the worldly forces who follow Antichrist will be gathered together to fight against Jerusalem
Their blood will be as deep as the bridles of the horses, and it will flow from Bozrah to Armageddon, a distance of 182 miles
According to the order of Revelation 14, the rapture of the firstfruits will take place before the great tribulation
Following this, the eternal gospel will be preached due to the persecution carried out during this period of three and a half years
Antichrist will set up his image for people to worship, and he will persecute the saints who remain on the earth
When grapes are ripe, they become full of water, signifying that the worldly people will be full of sin and sinful things
After chapter fourteen, the record of the Scriptures comes back to give further details of other important things and crucial matters
The glassy sea is only mingled with fire, but when it becomes the lake of fire, its contents are intensified; it is all fire and no glass
That these overcomers are standing indicates that they were martyred and then resurrected and raptured to stand above the glassy sea
For You alone are holy; for all the nations will come and worship before You, for Your righteous judgments have been manifested'
One of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the fury of God, who lives forever and ever
In the second trumpet, one third of the creatures in the sea died, but at this time everything in the sea dies
Verses 8 and 9 are the fourth bowl: 'And the fourth poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given to it to burn men with fire
The fall of religious Babylon is mentioned in 14:8, while the fall of material Babylon is mentioned here in 16:19
The harlot symbolizes religious Rome, the apostate Roman Catholic Church, and the waters symbolize many peoples and nations
In the eyes of the Lord the Roman Catholic Church today is a harlot, an evil woman, who is 'sitting' upon so many people
The ambassadors, ministers, and leaders of many nations are sent to the Vatican; this is to commit fornication with the great harlot
Many people are not clear about the vision of the great harlot because they have not come'outside the camp' , to a place apart
She claims that she preaches the truth of God, but this so-called church is full of idols, full of abominations
The unclean things of her fornication in Revelation 17:4 refers to spiritual things mixed with politics, which is fornication
Also, to be a servant of the Lord is proper, but to have the title of Reverend is an evil transmitted into the church
History tells us that more saints were killed by the Roman Church in this way than by the other persecutions of the Roman Empire
The picture of the harlot riding on a beast depicts the union of the Roman Catholic Church with the Roman Empire
Verse 8 continues, 'The beast that you saw was and is not and is about to come up out of the abyss and go into perdition
History tells us clearly that Rome was built on seven mountains; it is even called 'the city of seven mountains'
At that time the writer of this book, the apostle John, was not free to write about Rome and the Caesars in plain words
The seven heads are the seven mountains, and they are also seven kings, that is, seven Caesars of the Roman Empire
Revelation 17:11 says, 'And the beast who was and is not, he himself is also the eighth and is out of the seven and goes into perdition'
We conclude this from 13:3, which says of the beast, 'One of his heads was as it were slain to death, and his death stroke was healed'
In that resuscitation the spirit of Nero will come out from the abyss and enter into the body of the seventh to make him the eighth
On the one hand, the beast is the eighth, but on the other hand, he is a combination of the body of the seventh and the spirit of the fifth
He even published two photographs together, one of Mussolini and the other of Nero, showing people how much alike they looked
These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them at the battle of Armageddon, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings
These are the followers of Christ, the ones who have been raptured, who fight the battle against the Antichrist and his army at Armageddon
The harlot has been riding on the beast, signifying both the Roman Empire and the Antichrist, to utilize its political power
Revelation 18, however, records the fall of Babylon, the city of Rome, mainly in its political and material aspects
The intention of the Communists is to establish a new kind of human society, regardless of the cost to human life
They would even sacrifice most of the human race as long as they could gain a small number from the young generation
The saints in Denmark and England wondered how I, not being a king, a prime minister, a president, or even a prophet, could predict this
According to the prophecy of the divine Word in Revelation 17, Catholicism will be very prevailing until the end of this age
The righteousness that is Christ Himself is sufficient for us to be justified and saved; this is righteousness in the singular number
Rather, it is righteous deeds, the daily walk, the Christian living, which Christ as our life works out through us
To be invited to attend the wedding feast is to have the privilege of sharing the millennial kingdom as co-kings with Christ
His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems, and He has a name written which no one knows but Himself
His being clothed with a garment dipped in blood is related to His treading of the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God
That His name is called the Word of God means that He is the expression, the testimony, and the speaking of God
Revelation 19:14 says, 'And the armies which are in heaven followed Him on white horses, dressed in fine linen, white and clean'
Revelation 19:20 says that the beast and the false prophet were seized and 'cast alive into the lake of fire, which burns with brimstone'
Paul gave no indication here that he expected to die, yet he still aspired to attain to a certain kind of resurrection
The word for resurrection in 3:11 is not the ordinary word for resurrection; it has something added to it to make it out-resurrection
As we have seen, the first resurrection is not the ordinary resurrection; this is the best resurrection, the resurrection with the kingship
Many believe that no matter what kind of Christians they are after they are saved they will suddenly be kings when the Lord Jesus comes back
If the Lord Jesus came today and put us on thrones as kings, we ourselves might tell Him that we are not qualified
After being saved, they passed through certain kinds of experiences which made them adequate and prepared to be kings
Ezekiel 382 says Son of man set your face toward Gog of the land of Magog the prince of Rosh Meshech and Tubal and prophesy against him
Verse 9a says, 'And they went up upon the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city'
After the war at Armageddon, during the thousand years, the armies of heaven become the camp of the saints who reign as co-kings with Christ
The first scrolls are a record of the works and deeds of the unbelievers, while the second scroll is the book of life
If the dead who are in the sea are the same as the dead who are in Hades, why is there the need to mention the dead in the sea separately?
He said that the dead who are in the sea may not be human beings but the spirits of the living beings of the preadamic age
In the restoration of God's creation, on the second day, God made an expanse to separate the waters below from the waters above
Revelation 11:7 and 17:8 tell us that the beast comes out of the abyss, but 13:1 says that he comes up out of the sea
In the same way, all the dirty and wrong things in the universe will be restricted to a small location, the lake of fire
The first two chapters mention the heavens and the earth , while the last two chapters speak of the new heaven and the new earth
A great part of the construction of the Scriptures, from Genesis 3 through Revelation 20, is for dealing with the serpent
God came in to bring light, an expanse, and the dry land, which emerged from the covering water on the third day as a clear type of Christ
The New Jerusalem and the lake of fire are the two ultimate issues of God's work in creation and in redemption
In Revelation 12 there is a wonderful woman clothed with the sun, with the moon underneath her feet, and a crown of twelve stars on her head
The stars signify the patriarchs the moon signifies Gods people in the age of the law and the sun signifies Gods people in the age of grace
All the redeemed ones within these three dispensations together comprise this wonderful, universal woman, who is the very bride
In the Old Testament times, the people of God were a bride to God on the one hand, and the dwelling place of God on the other
Without the presence of God, they could never be the people of God, and God could never be the very God to them
We cannot say what the eternal presence of God will be like, but to some extent we have the foretaste of the presence of God today
Regardless of whether or not there is a change in our circumstances as long as we have the presence of God within us everything is all right
In the new heaven and new earth there will be full satisfaction and rest; there will be no more cause for tears
To thirst in verse 6 is to thirst not merely after God's redemption or God's work but after God Himself as the living water
Only the overcomers will be the bride in the millennium, but all the redeemed ones eventually will be the wife for eternity
The parables in Matthew 13, however, were spoken on the seashore in a mysterious way; the crowd did not understand them
In the same principle, we must be in spirit and be brought out of the world to the highest level, to the mountain
When the children of Israel were brought out of Egypt, they received a vision from God to build the tabernacle
The tabernacle was full of gold, and the breastplate and shoulder plate of the high priest were full of precious stones
East, north, south, and west is the spiritual order of the directions of the tabernacle, conveying the thought of God's dwelling
For a building to have gates on four sides, each opening onto the lot in balanced proportions, it must be in the center
A few times in recent years some believers who attended our meetings told us that we are like the 'holiness' churches
We must not denominate ourselves, and if we are balanced in every way, it will not be easy for others to denominate us
He measured the city with the reed to a length of twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal'
In both the tabernacle built by Moses and the temple built by Solomon the Holy of Holies was equal in three dimensions
Revelation 21:18 says, 'And the building work of its wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass'
When our self, the flesh, the natural life, and the old man are broken even a little, the light shines out and we are clear
The work of the Holy Spirit after we are saved is the work of building something of Christ in us, signified by the precious stones
Trees, for example, are burned into carbon and then pressed over a long period of time to become precious stones
Sometimes the Lord uses a high temperature, and other times He uses a lower one, just as a sister knows at what heat to bake something
Originally, we are only wood, grass, and stubble , so we need the burning and pressing that we may become precious stones
How many precious experiences of Christ by the working of the Holy Spirit under burning and pressing do we have?
The expression, protection, sanctification, and separation always depend on this kind of precious experiences of Christ
We should not quote verse 28, however, while forgetting about verse 29, which says that we are being conformed to the image of God's Son
Rather, all things work together for good to burn us and press us that we may be conformed to the image of the Son of God
In the city proper there is only one kind of gold, but in the foundations of the wall there are twelve kinds of precious stones
Peter, John, and Paul each had their own spiritual characteristics and were different in color and in brightness
Our physical body, for example, is living and strong when it is vertical, but a horizontal body is dead, or at least sleeping
A sister may desire to bear responsibility like a brother, and a brother may desire to be free from responsibility like a sister
When all the members of the church are fitly framed everyone keeping a right position in order there is real beauty strength and function
Verse 21 says, 'And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was, respectively, of one pearl
Originally, we were only small grains of sand, but now we are regenerated and are being transformed into precious pearls
Pearl signifies God the Son who died and resurrected, by whose death and resurrection we have been regenerated
Precious stones signify the work of the inner life by the Holy Spirit by which we are being transformed into something precious
Through our experience of the death and resurrection of Christ we have an entrance and opening for the increase of the church
The more we experience His death and resurrection, the more we will be broken to produce an opening for the increase
By His death and resurrection, we enter into the spiritual realm, into God Himself, and into His kingdom, the realm and sphere of God
After entering into the spiritual realm, we walk on the way of the divine nature and live, act, and behave according to the divine life
There are three gates on each of the four sides of the wall of the New Jerusalem, and at the center of the city there is the throne
When we were young, we spent much time to study how twelve gates could have only one street which leads to the throne of God
Whether we come from America, Africa, Australia, Europe, Asia, or any other direction, we are all on the same street
At the same time the Holy Spirit is working within us to transform us into precious stones for the building up of the wall
The appearance, likeness, and holiness of God in His glory are the separating wall for our Christian life and for the church
In our Christian life and church life we must have God's appearance, God's likeness, and God's holiness in His glory as our separating wall
In the garden of Eden there was no wall to protect it; Adam himself was the only protection, so the serpent came in
In addition, verse 14 says that the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb
The golden reed, therefore, signifies the divine nature in human form as the standard of the measurement of the city
Since the entire New Jerusalem is the manifestation of the divine nature in humanity, it is in harmony with the measure of the golden reed
A brother may be a typical American with a typical human life, living, and form, but he can still be full of God
The four living creatures in Revelation 4 have only the face of a lion, the face of a calf, the face of a man, and the face of an eagle
If the brothers and sisters among us are peculiar and so 'spiritual' that they are not truly spiritual, the church will be strange
How much is the Lord expressed in a full way among us in our living as wives, husbands, students, teachers, and businessmen?
All the fathers mothers children inlaws brothers sisters students teachers businessmen and laborers must be very human yet full of God
It says, 'And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel'
The meaning for the symbols in verse 17 is given in Luke 20:36, which tells us that in the resurrection man will be equal to the angels
Our natural life, soulish life, self, self-intentions, self-centeredness, and everything of the self must be put on the cross
A hundred and forty-four is twelve times twelve, signifying that the New Jerusalem is full of God's perfection in His eternal administration
On the one hand, we need to build up the wall, but on the other hand, we need breaking to create an entrance into the city
The Spirit as the seeking woman enlightens our heart to cause us to repent, to make a decision to come back to the Father
The three parables in Luke 15 show us the three steps taken by the Triune God to bring fallen man back to Himself
We need the breaking to create openings in the wall, which are the Triune God as the three gates in four directions
If we are this way, then we may want to see people saved, but they will not come; we may distribute tracts, but there will be no response
When our spirituality is broken, there are the gates, the openings and entrances, for the weak and sinful ones to come through
Some Christians need to build the wall higher, but those who have built the wall need breaking to create gates for people to enter through
A building with three gates on four sides, one that is easy for people to come into, must be adequately balanced and properly in the center
The local expression of the church in the city where we live must also be in the center, not geographically but spiritually
It must not be in any extreme but in the very center of God's testimony, having four sides full of gates for people to enter in
In the holy city, however, there is no need to go to a certain place to serve God, for God Himself in Christ will be the temple
In the same way, in the holy city in eternity future there will be no need of the sun or of the moon because God Himself will be the light
As we have seen in a previous message, the measurements of the city in three dimensions also prove that the city is the Holy of Holies
Similarly, in the entire Scriptures the Holy of Holies is the only other place where there is need of no light other than God
At that time we the redeemed ones will have a body in resurrection which will never be tired, so we will not need nighttime for sleeping
For us, there will be no night but only day, because in the holy city God Himself will be the 'sun' which will never go down
Nothing common will have the right to enter into the holy city or to have a share in it, because the city will be holy
In the same principle, anything of the church must be holy and separated; whatever is common or natural has no place in the church
By reading the Old Testament together with the New Testament, we can see that God's building always needs the kingship and the priesthood
The editors of The New English Bible may have wondered how one tree could be on this side and on that side of the river
In order for us to have the flow, God in Christ must be enthroned within us, and we must be under His authority
If we enthrone Christ honor and respect Him on the throne and submit to His authority in everything right away we will have the flow within
If we repent, enthrone Christ, submit to Him, and take His authority and headship, the flow within us will be recovered
We have something to feed on, and we are satisfied, strengthened, liberated, refreshed, and revived day by day
Our experience should not be like the children of Israel who ate the same food, the manna, every day for forty years
That the tree of life grows in the flow of the river signifies that the living Christ is in the flow of the Holy Spirit
The nations on the new earth will be those people who remain after the final judgment on the rebellious mankind at the end of the millennium
The believers are the regenerated ones who are born anew to be kings in God's royal family and components of the New Jerusalem
The restored nations, however, are not regenerated but simply restored according to God's dispensation for them
All creation, including the plants, the sun, and all things, will be restored to their original condition in creation
According to Isaiah 30:26 the light of the sun in the millennium will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days
Due to the fall of man, the entire creation became degraded, but at the time of the millennial kingdom, all things will be restored
Whereas the regenerated believers eat the fruit of the tree of life, the restored nations are healed by the leaves of the tree of life
That those who serve God will see His face indicates that genuine service leads us into fellowship and the presence of the Lord
Whether or not our service is proper can be checked in this way: Does our service lead us into the Lord's presence?
The more some people serve, the more they do not have the fellowship of the Lord and the more they lose His presence
Because His name will be on the foreheads of God's redeemed, people will quickly recognize that these persons belong to Him
The outer court of the tabernacle in the ancient times required the light of the sun, and the Holy Place needed the light from the lampstand
He will mingle Himself with us, dwell among us, and make us one with Him to serve Him as priests and reign with Him as kings
All the natural, sinful, and old things must be filtered out by the cross, by the death of Christ, at the pearl gates
We are under the headship, the kingship, and the authority of God in Christ in the fellowship of the flowing Holy Spirit
In this way the Triune God is mingled with us, and the work of the Holy Spirit produces precious stones that are good for the building
These experiences must be the model, pattern, reality, and goal of every church as a local expression of the Body of Christ
Although the apostle John did not seal the prophecies of this book, God's enemy, Satan, has sealed this book for centuries
If we are unrighteous or filthy and do not deal with this problem, the Lord may allow us to remain in this condition
In His divinity, Christ is the Root, the source, of David, and in His humanity Christ is the Offspring, the issue, of David
On the other hand, the Spirit and the bride yearn that the thirsty sinner also will come to take the water of life for his satisfaction
May we all look to the Lord that He will reveal these things to us in our spirit, that from this day on we will have a heavenly vision
