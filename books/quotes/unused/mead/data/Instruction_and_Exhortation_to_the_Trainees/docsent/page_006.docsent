   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S DESIRE TO TRAIN HIS PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The training that we provide is not at all like that of a seminary.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should not consider the full-time training as a kind of seminary.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the Old Testament, from the very beginning God did have the intention to train and discipline His people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Concerning this matter we cannot see that much before the time of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, in Jacob's case we can realize that he received a great deal of training.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord exercised much discipline over him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In all of the ancient fathers such as Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, and Isaac, we cannot see much of God's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But with His people, God began His discipline with Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jacob was nearly the first among God's people who received so much discipline and training.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This, however, was just the initial stage of God's discipline and training of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually, by that time God had only one person to discipline the naughty Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God eventually trained him and disciplined him to transform him from Jacob into Israel Gen 35:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When did this individual Israel become the corporate Israel?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was an individual Israel in Genesis, but when we come to the book of Exodus, there is no more individual Israel Exo 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now it is a corporate Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The name "Israel" was first used for an individual person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, the same word "Israel" was used to denote an entire nation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They became the children of Israel, the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Immediately after God rescued this corporate Israel, the children of Israel, out of Egypt, the Lord brought them to Mount Horeb Sinai .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Mount Horeb is called the mount of God because it was there that God stayed with His people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God stayed with them for at least one hundred twenty days.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Moses spent the first forty-day period to receive the two tablets of the law Exo 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That law was quickly broken Exo 32 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then he returned to the mount for another forty days Exo 34 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>So there were at least two periods of forty days.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There may also have been a third time of forty days cf.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Exo 34:34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Each term of our training lasts about eighteen weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The current training will last about twenty weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Twenty weeks is equivalent to one hundred forty days which is approximately three periods of forty days.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>So our terms of training are fixed according to the length of time that God stayed with His people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Prior to this, God never stayed with a group of people day and night for one hundred twenty days.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then the children of Israel finally arrived at Sinai Horeb .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is a difference between Sinai and Horeb.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sinai is an entire range of mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Horeb is just one peak of the entire Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So, God came to meet Israel at Sinai and stayed on Horeb.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Horeb is called the mount of God or the mount of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For God to stay there one hundred twenty days was not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For that many days God trained His people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first thing that God did on this earth with His corporate people was to hold a training.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let us consider the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They were wild and Egyptian, that is, worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But they were saved and passed through God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They came out of that tyranny and were brought to the very place which God had prepared so that He could come to stay with His chosen people for a length of time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whether the children of Israel wanted to stay for a longer or shorter time did not depend upon them, but upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He had to finish His plan, His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That was the Old Testament economy of God, which was a type of the new.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They were under God's training.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God was there training His people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God gave them lessons and then a design.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He planned for them to do a work to build up something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At Sinai the children of Israel received the design to build God's dwelling place on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They eventually built a house for God, which became the place for God to meet with His corporate Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This required much training.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In addition to building a habitation for God, there was the need of the service of the priesthood to be set up to serve in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because this priesthood required many things involving the offerings, the instructions found in Leviticus were given at Horeb, the mount of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Exodus 19 records that the corporate Israel arrived at Sinai and stayed there.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They stayed there for over one hundred days.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In Numbers 10, they then left Sinai when they saw the cloud move.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>That cloud was a sign of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Because God has no image, we cannot see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God was in the cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The cloud remained there at Mount Horeb for over one hundred days.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Within that period of time, God trained His people.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The entire book of Exodus, the entire book of Leviticus, and half of Numbers are a record of training.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They were trained how to worship God.</S>
