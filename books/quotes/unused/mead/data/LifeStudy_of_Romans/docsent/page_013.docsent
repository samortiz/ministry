   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE THREE THE SOURCE OF WICKEDNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE WAY OF RESTRICTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we will cover the source of wickedness shown in the condemnation of mankind and the way of restriction shown in the condemnation of the self-righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After the introduction, Paul presents the matter of condemnation in four aspects: on mankind in general 1:18-32 , on the self-righteous in particular 2:1-16 , on the religious specifically 2:17-3:8 , and on all the world totally 3:9-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Firstly, the book of Romans reveals that condemnation has come upon mankind in general.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then attention is given to two special classes of mankind the self-righteous class and the cultured, religious class.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Finally, the whole world is brought under condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether we are good or bad, religious or non-religious, we are under God s condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although we do not want to dwell upon the subject of condemnation, there are two points related to it that are quite important.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First is the source of evil, the source of wickedness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because of this source mankind is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, in this message we will see the source of man s wickedness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Second, we need to see the way of restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is a way to restrict this wickedness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since we have been saved from condemnation, we need not give it much attention.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, we need to return to it long enough to learn the source of evil and the way to restrict evil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I. THE CONDEMNATION ON MANKIND A. The Source of Wickedness</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now we need to consider the source of wickedness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This section of Romans 1:18-32 reveals four elements of the source of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Holding Down the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>in Unrighteousness</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first element in the source of wickedness is holding down the truth in unrighteousness 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is truth?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Truth is not mere doctrine or knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Truth is reality; it is solid and substantial.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is reality in this universe, and the prime reality is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To say that there is no God is to speak vanity; to declare the reality of God is to speak something solid, substantial, genuine, and true.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is real.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No one can deny the reality of God or disclaim the fact that He exists, for the existence of God is a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, from the very beginning, mankind did not respect the reality of God, but suppressed it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They simply did not care for this reality and refused to hold it in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They held down the truth in unrighteousness, suppressing it in an unrighteous manner.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the United States today we behold evil on every side, and the newspapers are filled with wicked and shameful things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why are there so many shameful things in the leading country of the world?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because so many people will not maintain the truth, but instead, wrongfully hold it down.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the most significant aspect of the source of wickedness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Disapproving of Holding God</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>in Full Knowledge</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although mankind knew there was God, they tested and tried Him, eventually deciding not to hold Him in their full knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They disapproved of holding God in their full knowledge 1:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many professors and professional people do not believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you ask them about God, they will say, We know there is a God, but we don t like to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Such people disapprove of holding God in their knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must hold God in our knowledge, for it is dreadful to refuse to do this.</S>
