   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE CRUCIAL ITEMS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I hope that you will not only grow in life and know the truth but also learn to apply the truth and speak it to others.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This requires that we exercise our spirit, our heart, and our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not enough to have a strong spirit or a heart to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must have a sober mind so that we are able to speak clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then we will be able to help others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the purpose of this training.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The goal of this training is for us to be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to be useful persons, we must pay attention to these three items: growing in life, knowing the truth, and speaking the truth to others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must learn how to speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>SCHOOLS BEING FOR THE LORD S USE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The saints who are studying or teaching in schools are in an environment that is useful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No other environment is better.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It does not matter whether you are a teacher, a professor, a teaching assistant, or a student.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The school is the best environment for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From one perspective a school may seem small in scope, but even a small school can have several thousand students.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The oldest students typically are no more than twenty-five or twenty-six years old, and they are not yet set and settled.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They may still be deciding which job to take.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once a person begins to work, he becomes set and settled.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whether he goes into business or another field, he will quickly become set and settled.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At such a time it will be more difficult to speak to him about the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The best time to speak to him concerning the Lord is while he is still a student, because students are not set or settled.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Students who have not chosen a profession are easy to reach with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, if we desire to be used by the Lord, we should grasp the opportunity to preach the gospel in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, the future of the church lies in the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not easy for a couple who are in their sixties and who are set and settled to receive the truth concerning the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even after speaking to them for six months, they still may not be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suppose they are clear and are saved; it will not be easy for them to go out and preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This does not mean that we should not preach the gospel to older people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord is not a respecter of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He will save older people and younger people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nevertheless, our burden should be the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From the testimonies it seems that a good number of Taiwanese young people have been gained by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is very encouraging.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, we should first do a thorough work in the schools to gain the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then our next generation will be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is very easy for young people to receive the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes we need to speak for only half an hour, and a young person will become clear and receive the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once he receives salvation, there will be a desire and an impetus in him to tell his friends or his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The young people should know that their parents listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After they are saved, the young people must tell their families.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Initially, their parents may not be pleased, but if the young people will continue to speak, their parents will believe.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some parents say that the knowledge their children receive in high school or college is of a new era and should be right.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, they will follow their children because they love their children, and they identify with what their children do.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, as soon as the students are saved, their parents can be saved without much effort.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Taiwanese have a very strong practice of idol worship.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we preach the gospel to them without first saving their children, they will most likely chase us away.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Young people today are very clear in their mind, making it easy to preach the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After they believe, they will preach the gospel to their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This will be the easiest route for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A young Taiwanese brother testified that when he first believed in the Lord, he dared not go home during the New Year holidays, because his parents wanted to beat him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead, he went to the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Recently his younger brother was saved, and his parents are ready to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The young people should not only pray for their parents; they should go home to compel their parents, telling them how good it is to believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this new age, parents will follow their children.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As a parent, I know that children are capable of compelling their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The more the children compel, the better they become at it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, it is not so effective for parents to compel their children.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I hope that this word will encourage the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>SPREADING THE GOSPEL THROUGHOUT TAIWAN</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our heart is for the Lord Jesus and His church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, we truly hope that the Taiwanese people will get saved.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The way to reach this goal lies in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The government in Taiwan stresses education.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The basic education has been increased to nine years.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must preach the gospel to the young ones during their nine years of education so that they hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Everyone is required to finish junior high school; therefore, we must aggressively preach the gospel to the students in junior high school.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After their salvation, the junior high school students will become gospel seeds when they enter high school.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They will be gospel seeds in college also.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The co-workers need to open their eyes and see that to labor in the schools will reap double the results with half the effort.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, even if all the co-workers labored in the schools, only a few students would get saved.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But if the saints who are students can preach the gospel in this way, many other students will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The saints in school will be like thousands of foot soldiers.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is our burden.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We have no desire to give many messages.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We want to train and produce useful foot soldiers who will be in every city in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then whenever the gospel is preached, a person will be saved, and afterward, a whole family will be gained.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we gain a classmate, he will preach the gospel to his parents, and in this way family after family will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is our burden.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is the responsibility of the young people to spread the gospel all over Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Many of the young people love the Lord and have consecrated themselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Some of them are willing to serve the Lord full time.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is more glorious than going abroad to study.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The most glorious thing for our young people, especially for the Taiwanese brothers and sisters, is to receive a burden from the Lord to spread the gospel to every corner of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Leading a thousand people to salvation is more glorious than making millions of American dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We need to see the Lord s way and receive a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I do not intend to stir up the young people to be preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>My desire is for them to graduate from college and then give themselves to preach the gospel throughout this island.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>They do not need to give up their jobs in order to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Before I began to serve the Lord full time, I gave messages seven days a week even though I had a job.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I was working and serving the Lord at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Hence, preaching the gospel does not depend on our serving full time.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Preaching the gospel depends on our taking Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If the Lord leads us to serve full time, we should serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If He does not lead us to serve full time, we should not serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Either situation should not be a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We must make a resolution and tell the Lord that we were born in Taiwan, we grew up in Taiwan, and we live for the people of Taiwan; we give ourselves for their souls to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The Taiwanese need us.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Therefore, we should place ourselves in the Lord s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Do not wait until you graduate.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Whether you are in college, high school, or junior high school, you should give yourself to the Lord while you are still a student.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The students around you are your targets; whenever you gain one person, you gain a whole family.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This is the Lord s present desire.</S>
