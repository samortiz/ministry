   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GROUND OF ONENESS UTTERLY LOST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the divisions in Christianity are elevations that involve either lust or ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Division opens the way for every evil thing to come in. Consider the evil Jeroboam did.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He made two calves of gold and set one in Bethel and the other in Dan He also made a house on high places and made priests of the high places from among all sorts of people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He "ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All these points can be applied to today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, only genuine believers who have the life of Christ, who love the Lord, and who know the Word should be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But many of the ministers in Christianity today do not even believe that Christ is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, in Christianity there are many festivals, such as Christmas and Easter, that have been ordained and established by man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, just as the children of Israel were eventually led into captivity and underwent a complete loss of the ground of oneness, so Christians today have been carried off to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The ground of oneness has not only been damaged; it has been utterly lost.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Very few Christians have any idea of what the ground of oneness is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Who cares for the genuine oneness today?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is rare to find Christians who care about it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Generations ago, the genuine oneness of the believers in Christ was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For this reason the situation of today's Christianity is altogether Babylonian.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although some may talk about oneness, this is not the genuine oneness revealed in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we speak of the ground of oneness, hardly anyone can understand our language.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To most Christians, the language of oneness is a foreign tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A RECOVERY OF ALL POSITIVE THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Old Testament reveals not only the damage and loss of the ground of oneness, but also the recovery and testimony of this ground.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jeremiah prophesied that after seventy years of captivity in Babylon, the Lord would bring the people back to the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Jeremiah 29:10 says, "For thus saith the Lord, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ezra 1:1 refers to this prophesy of Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here we are told that in the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus so that he made a proclamation throughout his kingdom regarding the building of the house of God in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This took place "that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates that the return to Jerusalem was not initiated by man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the clear record of the Bible, it was initiated by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When God's people were in Babylon, they did not offer sacrifice to Him there.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nowhere are we told that in Babylon they offered the burnt offering every morning and evening.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No doubt, men like Daniel, Ezra, and Nehemiah prayed, but they did not have the ground to offer sacrifice to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Babylon there was no altar.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without an altar, it was impossible for them to offer anything to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Moreover, in Babylon God's people could not observe the yearly feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What a pitiful situation!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Babylon was a good place for fasting, but not for feasting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was suitable for weeping, but not for rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Psalm 137:1 says, "By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the ground of oneness was lost, nearly everything else was lost also.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God's people lost the riches of the good land, the altar, and the feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only at the chosen place in Mount Zion could they enjoy all these marvelous things.</S>
