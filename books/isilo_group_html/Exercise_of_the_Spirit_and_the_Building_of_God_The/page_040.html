<h1 class="title">THE WORD BECOMING THE SPIRIT</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will cover how to receive the Word as the Spirit. This is a basic lesson for Christians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD NEEDING TO BE ENJOYED BY MAN<br />
BEFORE HE CAN BE MINGLED WITH MAN</h2>
<p>In order to be mingled with man, God must first give Himself, with all His elements, to man, for man to eat, drink, and enjoy. In order for something to be mingled with man, it must be something that man can receive. In order for food or drink to become part of man&rsquo;s constitution, it must first enter into man. Likewise, we must first enjoy God by eating Him before He can be mingled with us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING ENJOYED BY MAN IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>God is enjoyed by man in His Son, Christ. There are many religious people who seek God, but very few have touched God when they worship. There are many people in Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, but few people have touched God when they worship. Actually, the teachings of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism are not about the worship of God. Confucianism is a philosophy of improving human ethics, but it is not related to worshipping God. Buddhism was founded by Siddhartha Gautama. Buddhism teaches a person how to become a buddha. It has nothing to do with the worship of God. Taoism teaches how a person can reach a state of perfect peace and become immortal, but it is not related to worshipping God. Only Christianity, Judaism, and Islam speak about the worship of God. These three religions are monotheistic; that is, they worship one God. Furthermore, they worship the true God. However, there is a great difference between Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. Judaism and Islam do not worship God in Christ: they worship God apart from the Son of God. As a result, those in Judaism and Islam do not touch God when they worship, even though the object of their worship is right. They worship the true God, but they cannot touch Him, because they do not worship Him in Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p>According to 1 John, those who do not receive Christ cannot contact God: &ldquo;Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also&rdquo; (2:23), and &ldquo;he who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life&rdquo; (5:12). This life is the Son of God. These portions of the Word clearly show that apart from Christ, the Son of God, man cannot touch God, because He is embodied in the Son. No one has ever seen God, but the Son of God has declared Him (John 1:18). Hence, those who have seen the Son have seen the Father (14:9), and those who have not seen the Son have not met the Father. This means that those who do not receive Christ cannot contact God. No matter how pious and sincere a person might be, if he is not in Christ and does not have Christ, he cannot contact God. God can be contacted by man only in Christ. Christ is the only means for man to contact God. There is no means through which man can contact God, much less obtain and enjoy God, except through Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING BOTH THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Christ is the means for the believers to contact God because Christ is the Word and the Spirit. In order for God to be mingled with the believers, they must enjoy Him. The believers can enjoy God because He is embodied in Christ, and they can touch Christ in the Word and in the Spirit. If the Word and the Spirit did not exist, no one on earth would be able to touch Christ. In a normal condition the church should have both the Word and the Spirit. When the balance between the Word and the Spirit is lost, the believers cannot touch Christ in a proper and full way. If we want to gain Christ in a proper and full way, we must touch the Word and the Spirit.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.&rdquo; This verse speaks of the word of Christ being within man. Romans 8:9 says, &ldquo;The Spirit of God dwells in you. Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.&rdquo; This verse speaks of the Spirit of Christ being within man. First Peter 1:10-11 says that the Spirit of Christ spoke within the Old Testament prophets.</p>
<p>The Word and the Spirit are for us to realize Christ. Christ is conveyed to us in the Word, and we can experience Him as the Spirit. Without the Word and the Spirit, everything is empty. We would not have a way to know Christ or experience Him without the Word and the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Word is primarily for explaining Christ to us so that we may understand and know Him. The Spirit is primarily for us to realize everything that Christ is, to make Him our reality, so that we may touch Him. For example, it is possible to learn about electricity and understand it. But if a person does not contact electricity, it will not be real to him, because he has not experienced electricity. Christ is the living Word of God, and the Bible is the written Word of God. The written Word of God is for us to know the living Word of God. We can know the living Word of God because the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ. If we want to know, contact, touch, and enjoy Christ, we must contact the Holy Bible and touch the Holy Spirit. In other words, we must read the Bible and pray with our spirit.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Exercise of the Spirit and the Building of God &nbsp; pg 40</div><br></body></html>
