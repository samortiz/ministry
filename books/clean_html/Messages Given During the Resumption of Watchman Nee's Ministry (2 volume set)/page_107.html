<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Kingdom Being the Demand of Life,<br>and Life Being the Supply for the Kingdom</H2><P>If this is the case, who can enter the kingdom? Who can be saved? This question was raised two thousand years ago already. The Lord's disciples asked Him, "Who then can be saved?" The Lord answered, "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible" (Matt. 19:25, 26). Only God Himself can meet the requirement of the kingdom. The kingdom is intimately related to God's life. The kingdom is the demand of life, whereas life is the supply of the kingdom. On the one hand, the life we receive demands that we live out the kingdom. On the other hand, all the requirements of the kingdom are met by the supply of life. Regeneration is for a person to receive and to possess this life, and this life meets all the demands of the kingdom (John 3:3). Man thinks that a person climbs from a low point to a high point, and that improvement is gradual. But God gives to us a high life right from the beginning, so that we can live a high living of entering into the kingdom.</P><P>In the marriage life, you always encounter conflicts and tempers. Suppose a couple have believed in the Lord and are saved. At the beginning, they may still try to hold back their temper and to not give each other an unhappy look. But after a while, they will invariably come into conflicts. Our attitude at home toward our children and our servants often exposes where we are. If we cannot overcome in the small things, we will not be overcomers. In the New Testament, the Lord presented the kingdom right from the beginning. This kingdom requires that we take His life into us and live out a kingdom living. The kingdom life is able to take care of everything both great and small, and it is able to overcome everything.</P><P>Brothers who are engaged in business together may get along with each other well at the beginning. But after a while, they will start to argue with each other. They may argue so much that they have to bring the matter to some elderly brothers for arbitration. After the arbitration, they may be reconciled with each other for a while, and may agree with one another that they will henceforth not exercise their flesh, but will instead pray and confess their sins one to the other, and that by the grace of God they will no longer lose their temper. They may accept the word of exhortation of the elderly brothers. But after half an hour to an hour, while they are still talking, they may be provoked to argue with each other again. This is our real situation.</P><P>If one of these brothers would, on the contrary, answer the demand of the kingdom, not only would he stop arguing; he would even give what he has to the other. If we are only concerned about the conscience, the moral standards, and the public opinions, we are still not qualified to enter the kingdom. The life of Christ helps us not only to meet the standard of the conscience or of morality, but to meet the requirements of the kingdom.</P><P>If a husband loses his temper with his wife all the time, and a person comes along to exhort the wife to be patient and says that unwavering patience is more precious than good treasure, such an exhortation is like the barber's cutting of a person's hair; soon after he cuts the hair, the hair grows back again. If you can help the wife to see the requirement of the kingdom, everything will be fine. When the husband loses his temper, the wife can still smile at him. This shows that she is a person living in the kingdom, and that in everything she has overcome.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Answering the Demands of the Kingdom<br>in a Desperate and Absolute Way</H2><P>Today, God will not do anything to comply with our wish. All He wants is that we single-heartedly seek for the accomplishment of His will. If we seek for the accomplishment of God's will in this way, the kingdom will come. We must answer the demands of the kingdom in a desperate way. We must obey absolutely before we can meet the kingdom requirement. God's salvation does not bring us to the standard of the conscience, morality, or justice only. The requirement of God's kingdom is as "terrible" as an atomic bomb. We find many Christians who conduct themselves well in the first five or six years of their Christian life, but begin to fail by the seventh or eighth year. They begin to lose their patience and may even begin to lose their temper uncontrollably, or backslide or fall suddenly. Only those who answer the demand of the kingdom in an absolute way will overcome. The requirement of the kingdom is as high as heaven itself. The kingdom requires that we give all the reasons to others, and all the blame to ourselves. It requires that we give all the gains to others, and take all the losses to ourselves. If we do this, all the problems will be solved.</P><P>The same principle applies to our material offerings. Man considers it all right if he offers one-tenth of what he has. After he has tithed, he keeps the rest in his own pocket and considers it his. But the requirement of the kingdom is that you be separated from your money. It is not a question of giving up one-tenth, but a question of being delivered from the bondage of money. The way God wants us to take today is the way of answering the demand of the kingdom.</P>
