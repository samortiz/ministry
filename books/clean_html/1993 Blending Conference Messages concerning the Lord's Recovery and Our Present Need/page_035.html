<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Its Building Up Being by the Bountiful<br>Supply out of the Head through Every Joint<br>of the Rich Supply and through the Operation<br>in the Measure of Each One Part</H2><P>We all need to see the operation and functioning of the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God. All of us are part of this organism which needs to be built up. The building up of the Body of Christ is by the bountiful supply out of the Head through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, which causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love (Eph. 4:15-16). The building up of the church is the growth of the Body of Christ. As we grow up into the Head in all things, we have something out from the Head for the building up of the Body.</P><P>Ephesians 4:16 speaks of the joints and the parts of the Body. We are either joints or parts, but we should not be concerned about what we are. We need to grow up into the Head and then we need to function or operate out from the Head so that the Body can be supplied and built up. The Lord will fill us and move within us for us to function according to the measure of our capacity. Our capacity needs to be enlarged so that the Body of Christ can be built up more and more.</P><P>Paul used the human body to show us the reality of the Body of Christ (Rom. 12:4-5). The joints are the articulation of the Body. When a building is being built, the first thing the builders do is to set up the framework. That framing is like the articulation in our physical body. For the joints of the Body of Christ to be joined closely together is for them to be articulated and fitted closely together in harmony.</P><P>In a physical building, the frames of the building need to be joined closely together, whereas the stones of the building need to be put together by being interwoven. This is a picture of the joints and the parts in the Body of Christ. Not only is there the articulation of the joints, but also there is the need for each one part of the Body to be knit together, to be interwoven, to be compacted together solidly, through the growth in life to become one entity.</P><P>The joints dispense the particular, rich supply of Christ, and the knitting and interweaving are through the operation in the measure of each one part. This causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love (Eph. 4:16). This love is the divine love by which we love Christ and the fellow members of His Body.</P>
