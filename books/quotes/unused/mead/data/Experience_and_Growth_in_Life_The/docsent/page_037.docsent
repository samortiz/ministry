   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE FOURTEEN THE GROWTH IN LIFE 7 Scripture Reading: Phil 4:2-8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Philippians 1 speaks of salvation through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ v. 19 , living Christ v. 21 , and magnifying Christ v. 20 . In chapter two salvation is spoken of again.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 12 says, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 15 says that we shine as lights in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are luminaries reflecting Christ as light.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This shining is the holding forth, the applying, presenting, and offering of the word of life v. 16 . Philippians 3 speaks of the righteousness of God based on faith v. 9 . Righteousness in chapter three equals the salvation in chapters one and two.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Chapter three also speaks of our goal v. 14 and our pursuing v. 12 . THINKING THE SAME THING AND REJOICING IN THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first matter spoken of in Philippians 4 is thinking the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 2 says, "I beseech Euodias, and I beseech Syntyche, to think the same thing in the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to our dissenting nature, we often cannot agree with others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If someone suggests that we do one thing, we may propose to do the opposite instead.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before a young child knows many other words, he can already say "No!" to his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From our youth we have learned to say no to everyone else and yes to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is dissenting, and dissenting is rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The desire for prestige and respect is at the root of our dissenting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even if we are wrong about something, we may still try to claim our dignity in that situation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can observe this fallen, human behavior everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many of the arguments between children in a family center around the issue of prestige.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The desire for prestige and the dissenting it produces are of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 4 says, "Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we think the same thing and are not dissenting, we can rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to human experience, a dissenting person is rarely joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, those who are dissenting are full of complaints, murmurings, and reasonings 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Philippians 4:5 says, "Let your forbearance be known to all men."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Forbearance is reasonableness, considerateness, and consideration in dealing with others, without strictness of legal right.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who are forbearing can readily agree with and follow others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, if we are dissenting persons, we will not be able to forbear with others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a result we will have anxiety v. 6 . The way to be at peace and be released from anxiety is to be forbearing with everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>CHRIST AS THE REALITY OF OUR HUMAN VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 8 says, "For the rest, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is righteous, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is well-spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The items listed in this verse are the virtues of a proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we are not dissenting, we can rejoice and have forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As those who forbear with others, we will live a life that is truthful, honorable, venerable, right, pure, and single, with no mixture in our motive.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then our living will be lovely and well-spoken of.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a result, we will have virtues and things worthy of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the proper living of a proper human being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the items spoken of in Philippians 1 through 3 are the elements of the proper human living in chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To live Christ in chapter one is to live a life that is true, honorable, right, pure, lovely, and well-spoken of, full of virtues and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Likewise, as luminaries reflecting Christ in chapter two, our expression is a life that is pure, right, honorable, and true.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The way to live such a life is to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, many unbelievers endeavor in themselves to have these human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They are like a glove without a hand in it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Their virtues are empty and without reality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we live Christ, we have the reality of all the human virtues, including truthfulness, honor, righteousness, and purity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When some new believers begin to seek the Lord, they may desire to be like the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What we need to be, however, are proper human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A proper human being is a person filled with Christ as the reality of his human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ must be our truthfulness, honor, righteousness, purity, and every item of our human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To be a proper human being in this way is to express God through His divine attributes in our human virtues, to have a human life filled with Christ as the reality of the attributes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A proper person is full of virtues, and Christ as the embodiment of God is the content, the reality, of his virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To be a person full of Christ as the proper virtues is to experience God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In Philippians 1 salvation is to live Christ and magnify Christ in any circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Chapter two shows us that this salvation is to reflect Christ by holding forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In chapter three salvation is the righteousness of God, who is God Himself embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then in chapter four, there is the life that is true, honorable, righteous, pure, lovely, well-spoken of, and full of virtue and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The reality of such a life is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, all four chapters of Philippians refer to the all-inclusive, living person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In chapter one Christ is our long-term salvation, in chapter two Christ is our daily salvation, and in chapter three Christ is the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then in chapter four Christ is all the virtues of our humanity.</S>
