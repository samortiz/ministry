<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S CENTRAL WORK</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONFERENCE (6)</H1><p>Date:Evening, January 13, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</p><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:19b, 20</H1><P>Prayer: May the Lord prevent anyone from having a wrong understanding of these messages. If anyone is to understand these messages, may their understanding be correct. For this we need the revelation of the Holy Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S CENTRAL WORK&#151;<br>WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</H2><P>Ephesians 3:19 speaks of the fullness of God. This fullness is the content. God's intention is to fill us with this content. Verse 20 shows us how God accomplishes this, that is, how He fills us with His fullness. The main work of God today is to work Himself into man. Unless our living, our walk, and our work are linked up with God's center, they will all pass away. Even the so-called blessings and peace will pass away. The only thing that will remain is God's work within us. I know that many will think that I am saying the wrong thing, and I know that many will misunderstand my words. But if a man loves the Lord with a pure heart, he will see the revelation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S WORK IN TIME<br>BEING TO WORK HIMSELF INTO MAN</H2><P>Everything that does not belong to God Himself, even if it has been created by Him, will all pass away. The heavens, the earth, and all things, even we ourselves, will all pass away, because the heavens, the earth, and all things, including ourselves, are not God Himself. That is why they will all pass away. No matter how good you are, and how nice and how clean you look, all these things will pass away. Of course, humanly speaking, it is always better to do good than to do evil. But the good and evil that come from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil are the same before God. Everything that is not of God will pass away. The Chinese have a saying, "Humility brings profit, while arrogance brings loss." But both of these things will also pass away. Today, we are not evaluating matters from a temporary point of view. Rather, we are evaluating matters from an eternal point of view. Many things may appear to be good in time, but they cannot endure for eternity. Good is something that exists in time; it cannot be brought into eternity. To do good is the goal of those in the world, but a Christian's goal belongs to eternity. In eternity, there are only things that belong to God. Only God's things are eternal. It is true that God's things pass through time, yet they proceed from eternity and extend through eternity. Everything that God accomplishes in time and in the world is for the accomplishment of His eternal purpose, which is to work Himself into man. Only when God is worked into man can God's eternal purpose be fulfilled. God passes through time in order that He can work Himself into man, that is, in order for Him to mingle Himself into man.</P><P>For a man to do good apart from God is as worthless as it is for him to commit sin apart from God. Of course, within the span of time, all virtues are better than evil. But in eternity, both are worthless. Time is in God's hand, and God puts the man He gained into this "furnace" with the purpose of working Himself into man, so that man can be in God and God can be in man. A glazed vessel must go through the firing in a furnace before the flowers painted on it can become one with the vessel. After the vessel has been fired, the flowers and the vessel can never again be separated. If the vessel breaks, the flowers on it will also break. God's intention today is to fill our inclinations and our character with God's nature and character. In the end, God will become our content, and His fullness will be mingled with us. God's life will have a "chemical reaction" with our life. This is God's work all the way from the beginning to the end. His purpose is for man to be like Him. He has no intention to merely improve us a little. This is man's natural concept. The human ethical mind thinks that all a person needs to do is to change the wrongs and make them right. But God's thought is not concerning good and evil, but concerning His working Himself into us.</P>
