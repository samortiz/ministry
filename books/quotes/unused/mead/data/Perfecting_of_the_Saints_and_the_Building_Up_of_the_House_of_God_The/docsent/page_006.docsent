   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE VISION OF GOD S DESIRE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE MAN S LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous chapter we saw that only when we have a thorough knowledge of life, the church, and the kingdom can our work meet the need of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Both the church and the reality of the kingdom depend on life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The content of the church is life, and the reality of the kingdom is also life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we have the truth concerning the church but do not have life, we cannot have the testimony of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Neither can we have the reality of the kingdom if we have only the truth concerning the kingdom but do not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, we must have life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we will have the content and the testimony of the church, and we will have the reality of the kingdom, which is the authority of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This does not mean that the truth is not important.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The reality of anything related to life must be matched by truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But truth without life is empty, superficial, and outward.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Truth must contain life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The content of reality is life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are concerned, because the believers who serve God do not seem to know God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We often speak about life, and we know that God is life and that life is God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moreover, we frequently speak of God becoming our life and of His being our life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, we are still short of knowing God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE TRUTH OF GOD DESIRING TO BE MAN S LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>NEEDING TO BE REVEALED</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During the past two thousand years of church history, only the apostles clearly saw the truth concerning God as our life and God s desire to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This does not mean that believers did not know that God is their life, nor does it mean that they did not experience and enjoy God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, for the past two thousand years, no one emphasized the truth of God as man s life or of God s desire to be man s life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, the truth concerning justification by faith was seen by the apostles in the early church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, this vision was hidden after the time of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was not until Martin Luther was raised up that the truth of justification by faith was declared.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This does not mean that the believers who lived before Martin Luther did not experience this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We believe that even during the darkest period of Catholicism many believers genuinely experienced being justified by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, it was not until Luther was raised up that the vision and revelation of justification by faith was as clear as a scientific law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>People also know that they need to eat nutritious food, but it was not until a few years ago that the various vitamins found in food were identified.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Similarly, the fact of justification by faith has existed for a long time, but the truth of justification by faith was clearly defined by Martin Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since then this truth has been shining brightly among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Another example is the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just as people know that there are numerous kinds of vitamins, believers can know that they are saved and can be assured of their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before George Cutting wrote the pamphlet Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment, countless believers had the assurance of their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, the truth concerning the assurance of salvation had not been clearly presented.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the believers who lived before George Cutting were asked whether they knew they were saved, they may not have said with assurance that they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They may have had some assurance of their salvation, but this truth was not spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It was not until the 1800s that George Cutting declared the truth concerning the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since then this truth has shined brightly and clearly in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Christianity spread to China, the missionaries took the gospel to China, but they did not take the truth concerning the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thirty years ago the Lord raised us up as a group of young brothers, and He used Watchman Nee to recover the truth of the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This does not mean that before Brother Nee none of the Christians in China had the assurance of their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many Christians truly had the assurance of their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, prior to Brother Nee the believers did not teach this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was not taught among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>SPREADING THE TRUTH CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>GOD S DESIRE TO BE MAN S LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>During the past two thousand years countless believers experienced God as their life, but they did not speak this truth; this truth was not clearly and thoroughly expounded.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Madame Guyon knew God as life, but she spoke only about loving God, desiring God, and being lost in God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We speak of God being mingled with man, but Madame Guyon did not have this utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God used Brother Nee to say that God is constituted into us, but today we say that we should absorb God so that He can become our constituent, and we also say that the divine nature and the human nature are mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are even bold enough to use the expressions eating God and drinking God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Madame Guyon may have had many experiences of this, but she did not use these words.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The truth concerning these matters was not released at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Andrew Murray lived after Madame Guyon, and he enjoyed God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In his book The Spirit of Christ, it seems as if he wanted to use the words eating God and drinking God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We almost expect to read these words when we read his book.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although Andrew Murray saw these truths, he did not have the words to express them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In these last days the recovery has intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This recovery has given us a vision, a revelation, and the utterance to speak clearly concerning God s intention to be man s life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we first heard the expressions eating God and drinking God, they sounded raw and wild.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, I believe that in eight or ten years these will be common words in our daily life and even in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thirty years ago one did not ask a person if he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In those days no one even dared to say that he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A person who said that he was saved seemed proud.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In particular pastors and elders opposed such speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now, however, the truth concerning the assurance of salvation is common among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Christians not only experience this truth, but it is also common knowledge, just as vitamins are common knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today many Christians no longer say that they are going to Sunday service; instead, they say that they are going to a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Furthermore, the schedule posted at the entrance of many church buildings uses the word meetings and not Sunday worship.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In a short time many Christians will say, I rise up early every morning to eat, drink, and enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I absorb God every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>These words will soon be common among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>A message concerning God as our life may initially be criticized, but eventually it will be accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is what happened with the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, the truth concerning the church ground is a different matter, and it has been opposed by many believers.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Christian groups acknowledge the truth concerning the assurance of salvation, because by so doing, they gain more members; they do not suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Similarly, if Christians accepted the truth of God as man s life and man s food, they could have a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>For the past one hundred years the writings of Andrew Murray are the most popular books published among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is because Christians can touch something and can taste God when they read these books.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Therefore, I believe that soon all of God s children, even those who oppose us, will not only receive our messages concerning how to enjoy, eat, drink, and absorb God, but they will also speak these very things.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In less than ten years these messages will spread among Christians in the Far East.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In these last days God will accomplish this.</S>
