[2]  AS THE LIFE ELEMENT Scripture Reading: Matt 13:3, 8, 23, 37-38 OUTLINE Christ, the Triune God embodied in humanity as the source of life, signified by the tree of life Col 2:9; John 1:14; Gen 2:9; Rev 2:7; 22:2.
[3]  The church as the Body of Christ is not a formation or an organization but a constitution that has been constituted with the Christ of life as its very constituent.
[4]  My burden is to help the saints see that the Body of Christ is a constitution, constituted with the Triune God embodied in Christ as the life element.
[5]  We must see that the church as the Body of Christ has been constituted not with a simple Christ but with the all-inclusive Christ as the life element.
[6]  We do have such a Christ who is the embodiment of the Triune God as the source of life signified by the life tree.
[7]  We all know that Jesus Christ loves us and that He came to be our Savior.
[8]  Christ as the divine life seed and the believers as the human growing earth become one to produce the organic element for the constitution of the church Eph 1:22 .
[9]  By sowing Himself into the believers, Christ makes the church the Body of Christ with the Spirit as the essence of the Body, the Lord as the element of the Body, and God the Father as the source of the Body the Triune God as its contents Eph 1:23; 4:4-6 .
[10]  A Christian should be one who mainly lives Christ Phil 1:20-21 for the constitution of the Body of Christ, which is enlarged and constituted with all His real believers, with Christ as their life element Rom 12:5 .
[11]  By all this we can have a clear view to see that God's intention in His eternal economy is to have us grow Christ, live Christ, and magnify Christ, that we may be mature in Christ to have His full stature and to be built up through transformation in the full measure of His fullness Eph 4:11-16 .
[12]  Without Christ as the life element for the constitution of the Body of Christ, and without the Body of Christ as the full expression of the all-inclusive Christ, the recovery today would become zero.
[13]  In the previous chapter, we saw the constitution of the Body of Christ with the all-inclusive Christ as the life-element.
[14]  Matthew 13 shows us how Christ came as the Sower to sow Himself as the life seed of wheat, signifying the word, into the human heart as the growing earth vv.
[15]  The growing of Christ in the good earth of the human heart is for His multiplication to be the constitution of the church to fulfill God's eternal economy Matt 13:8, 23; John 12:24; Eph 3:8-10 .
[16]  Christ came in incarnation, but it took Him a much longer time of passing through the processes of human living, death, and resurrection to come into us.
[17]  We know that Jesus now lives in us not only because the Bible tells us so Gal 2:20a; 2 Cor 13:5 but also because our experience testifies that it is so.
[18]  I. UNDER THE ENEMY SATAN'S FRUSTRATION A. By the Human Heart as the Wayside
[19]  C. By the Anxiety of the Age and the Deceitfulness of Riches as the Thorns Choking the Life Seed
[20]  We have believed in the Lord Jesus, receiving Him as our Savior, but day by day we have to deal with the anxiety of this age and the deceitfulness of riches.
[21]  B. By Changing the Nature of the Small Mustard into the Nature of a Tree
[22]  Satan's damage is also to change the nature of the small mustard, signifying the church in life, which is good for food supply, into the nature of a tree, signifying the big Christendom in confusion, which is good for lodging the evil ones, signified by the "birds" Matt 13:31-32 .
[23]  We need to note that the three items above under Roman numeral I the wayside, the rocks, and the thorns frustrate the growth of the life seed in the believers and restrict the multiplication of Christ through His believers; whereas the two items above under Roman numeral II the tares and the mustard seed becoming a great tree , on the one hand, bring in a mixture among the components of the church, and on the other hand, change the nature of the church and make the appearance of the church abnormal.
[24]  Satan's corruption of the church began with his leavening the initial church, typified by the two wave-loaves offered to God on the day of Pentecost Lev 23:15-17 .
[25]  Satan also leavened the church with Catholicism in the papal system, hierarchy, heresies, idolatry, and pagan practices.
[26]  H. By Leavening the Church with Nationalism, Racialism, Socialism, Liberalism, Politics, Etc.
[27]  The church has also been leavened with nationalism and racialism.
[28]  CHAPTER THREE THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST BY THE GROWTH IN LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: John 1:1-2, 29; 3:14, 5; 1:32, 12-13; 6:57b-58a; 7:37-39; 20:22; Rev 2:7b, 17b; 22:2 OUTLINE The believers' growth in life unveiled in the writings of John: Its source: The eternal Word God in eternity John 1:1-2; 1 John 1:1.
[29]  In whom is life John 1:4a; 1 John 1:2.
[30]  Its base: The redemption of Christ as the Lamb of God John 1:29.
[31]  In the previous chapter, we saw the constitution of the Body of Christ under the enemy Satan's frustration, damage, and corruption as revealed in Matthew 13.
[32]  We need to be impressed with all these negative things.
[33]  In these dark days of degradation, we have to cooperate with the Lord for the carrying out of His recovery.
[34]  This is why we need to see a vision on both the positive and negative sides.
[35]  We need to come out of this negative picture and be in the positive one with Christ as the Triune God embodied in humanity to be the tree of life, the one grain, the many grains, the one bread, the Body of Christ, the new man, the organism of the Triune God, and the New Jerusalem.
[36]  The building up of the Body of Christ altogether depends upon our growth in this wonderful life, a life that is compounded with the divine life as the base, and with Christ's humanity, the effectiveness of the death of Christ, and the power of His resurrection as its ingredients.
[37]  In Matthew 7 the Lord Jesus said that the gate is narrow and the way is constricted which leads to life, and few are those who find it v. 14 . But in John the Lord said that if we come to Him and drink, rivers of living water will flow out of our innermost being 7:37-38 . He also said that if we drink of Him, we will never thirst again 4:14 , and that if we eat of Him, we will never be hungry again 6:35 .
[38]  The third aspect of the base of the believers' growth in life is the regeneration of the Spirit as the dove John 3:5; 1:32 to produce the children of God with the right of the divine life 1:12 , who are born of God, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man v. 13 .
[39]  We have been redeemed by Christ as the Lamb slain for us, we have been delivered from the serpentine poison by Christ being the brass serpent to deliver us, and we have been regenerated by Christ as the dove, the soaring Spirit, to enliven us.
[40]  The Destruction of the Works of the Devil and the Casting Out of Him as the Ruler of the World
[41]  The works of the devil, Satan, all have been destroyed, and he as the ruler of the world has been cast out by Christ through His death in the manifestation in His flesh 1 John 3:8; John 12:31b .
[42]  In the book of Revelation, we are charged to eat Christ as the tree of life 2:7b; 22:2 .
[43]  Now that we have seen the source, the base, and the way of the believers' growth in life in the writings of John, we want to go on to see its progression.
[44]  The believers' growth in life is for their transformation into white stones, justified and approved by the Lord Rev 2:17b for God's building the New Jerusalem 3:12 , firstly in the millennium in the initial stage 2:7; 3:12 and lastly in the new heaven and new earth in its ultimate consummation 21:1-3 .
[45]  For us to be the proper materials for God's unique building, the organic Body of Christ, we still need very much to grow in the divine life that we may be transformed with it into the glorious image of the resurrected Christ as the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29 .
[46]  BY THE GROWTH IN LIFE 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:2b, 2c; 2 Pet 1:1-4; 1 Pet 2:2, 5, 9; 2 Pet 1:5-7; 3:18; 1 Pet 5:10; 1 Cor 12:13b; 3:6-7; Eph 4:12-13, 15-16; Rom 8:23b, 30 OUTLINE The believers' growth in life unveiled in the writings of Peter: Its base: The sanctification of the Spirit 1 Pet 1:2b.
[47]  The redemption of Christ through His vicarious death on the cross 1 Pet 2:24a.
[48]  We worship You that You are the speaking God.
[49]  The Bible tells us that when Christ died, we died with Him and in Him Rom 6:6; 2 Cor 5:14b; Gal 2:20 , and when Christ rose, we were resurrected with Him and in Him Eph 2:5-6 .
[50]  The grace of Christ is just Christ Himself distributed to us through His redemption for our enjoyment, and the all grace of God is simply the processed and consummated Triune God to be our life supply in all aspects.
[51]  These two items should be the fragrant virtues of those who have seen Christ as the centrality and universality of God's eternal economy and who are pursuing Christ, growing Christ, living Christ, and magnifying Christ.
[52]  In Peter's writings, the believers' growth in the divine life also has its issues.
[53]  Peter also tells us that the believers' growth in the divine life also has its consummation.
[54]  Going along with His regeneration God has renewed us by the germination of His Holy Spirit to have a new beginning in His new creation Titus 3:5 .
[55]  The complete and full salvation of God comprises one particular aspect, that is, to save us by the life of Christ Rom 5:10b in all the matters of our daily life in the entire course of our Christian life, especially in regenerating, transforming, conforming, and glorifying us.
[56]  In addition to all the above items, Paul in his writings assures us of the abounding, multiplying grace of God Rom 5:20 , which is the grace of Christ that is sufficient to meet all our needs in our Christian life 2 Cor 12:9 and leads us to reign in life in Christ Rom 5:21 .
[57]  Making Us the Church as the Body of Christ
[58]  The dispensing of the blessing of the Divine Trinity to make us the church as the Body of Christ Eph 1:3-23 is a great base to our growth in the divine life.
[59]  In Paul's writings the way of the believers' growth in life is revealed in much more detail than in Peter's writings.
[60]  According to Paul's writings, the believers grow in life by drinking the spiritual milk 1 Cor 3:2a; Heb 5:12b , by eating the spiritual food Heb 5:14a , by drinking the Spirit 1 Cor 12:13b , by being watered 1 Cor 3:6b, 7b , and by God operating in them Phil 2:13 .
[61]  In Paul's writings we also see the progression of the believers' growth in life.
[62]  Through our growth in life we the believers mature with Christ as the element of the divine life unto full growth.
[63]  The fullness of Christ here denotes the expression of Christ, and the expression of Christ is just the Body of Christ.
[64]  This is not our own love but the love of God in Christ, which becomes the love of Christ in us, by which we love Christ and the fellow members of His Body.
[65]  BY THE TRANSFORMATION IN LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: John 3:5-6; 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 12:2a; 8:30c; Heb 2:10a; Titus 3:5b OUTLINE The complete salvation of God: Sanctification in God's calling 1 Pet 1:2b.
[66]  The first two chapters of this book speak of the constitution of the Body of Christ.
[67]  The Body of Christ has come into existence through the constitution with the all-inclusive Christ as the life element, but God has an enemy who is not happy to see this.
[68]  We saw that the base of our growth in life in Peter's writings is of the following items: the sanctification of the Spirit, the redemption of Christ, the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, the regeneration through His resurrection, the God-allotted faith, the divine power that gives us all things related to life and godliness, the precious and exceedingly great promises, and the divine nature.
[69]  In order to see the revelation of the transformation in life for the building up of the Body of Christ, we need to see the items of the complete salvation of God.
[70]  D. The Positive Organic Reaction of the Divine Life
[71]  CHAPTER SIX THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST
[72]  BY THE TRANSFORMATION IN LIFE 2 Scripture Reading: Matt 13:44-46; 1 Cor 3:12; John 17:26b; Eph 3:9-10; 1:9; Rev 21:1-3, 9-23 OUTLINE The consummation of the transformation in the building up of the Body of Christ: Constituting the believers, who grow and mature in Christ's life, into precious materials for the building of God Matt 13:44-46; 1 Cor 3:12: Supplying the believers with the element of the all-inclusive Christ.
[73]  My burden in these days is with this fellowship concerning the constitution and the building up of the Body of Christ.
[74]  This book is a continuation of the burden in the two books we have published entitled The Satanic Chaos in the Old Creation and the Divine Economy for the New Creation and The Overcomers.
[75]  In the previous chapter, we saw the complete salvation of God, the vital importance of transformation in the complete salvation of God, and the significance of transformation.
[76]  The apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 3 that we are God's farm, God's cultivated land v.
[77]  The first four parables are concerning the plant life.
[78]  We need to eat Christ as the living bread from heaven embodied in His words of eternal life John 6:57b-58a, 51, 68 , as the tree of life Rev 2:7b , and as the hidden manna v. 17b . By eating Christ we can be constituted and supplied with Him as our life element so that we can grow in life and be transformed in life.
[79]  In order to be transformed, we need to apply the cross of Christ to our peculiarity, individuality, independence, seclusion, self-deception, pretension, self-seeking, personal preference and taste, localism in church practice, and all kinds of divisive factors.
[80]  OF THE TRANSFORMATION FOR THE COMPOSITION AND CONSTITUTION OF THE NEW JERUSALEM
[81]  The work of the redeeming Christ in His overcoming death and life-supplying resurrection is signified by the element of the pearls of the gates Rev 21:21a .
[82]  In the New Jerusalem, there will be no dust of humanity.
