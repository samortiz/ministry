Whatever things we can see, especially the things on this earth, would be empty and meaningless if there were no human beings
It seems that the Triune God held a conference, deciding that He should make man in His image and according to His likeness
God made man in this way so that man can be like God and can express God, and so that God's attributes may be expressed in man's virtues
In Genesis 2:7, we are shown that God used the dust of the ground to make man and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life
The word for breath here in Hebrew is the same as the word for spirit in Proverbs 2027 which says The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord
According to essence, that was a breath of life; according to function, this breath of life is the spirit within us
The Old Testament clearly says that there is a spirit within man, and this spirit was created by Jehovah for man
The people in the world talk about the heavens, the earth, and man; but the Bible talks about the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man
Because there are sunlight, rain, and air, the earth can produce different kinds of animals and plants, so that we can live on it
For this reason, God who is Spirit created a spirit for us so that we may use the spirit to worship Him and to gain Him
He created us in this way in order that we can be vessels to contain Him so that one day He can enter into us to be our life and content
Within us believers is God; hence, we should all feel honored and proud, not because of ourselves, but because of the God within us
Because God is within us, we do not do the things we should not do, and we do not go to the places where we should not go
Within such a living, as those who are walking uprightly, being holy and not being earthly, with everything done righteously, we love people
God created man for the purpose that man would receive Him as life and live by Him in order to live out an organic living
Due to this, the image God created for man was damaged; that image of love, light, holiness, and righteousness, was damaged
Everyone would like to be loving toward others, straight- forward, upright, holy, and righteous; yet no one can do it
On the surface the church is a congregation of a group of people meeting together actually there is God as life within this group of people
By this life we preach the gospel, nourish newly saved ones, perfect the saints, and meet to speak the Lord's word
We have lost the position to receive God as life, no longer being able to contact the holy, righteous, and glorious God
His death satisfied the requirements of God's glory, holiness, and righteousness , and opened up for us the way to the tree of life
Now the death of Christ has brought us fallen people back to the position to receive God as life so that we can receive Him as our life
Through the death of Christ, God justified us; through the resurrection of Christ, God entered into us to be life to regenerate us
In other words, the life of God adds into us a new element so that we can have a transformation of life through an organic operation
The Lord Jesus originally was God's only begotten Son; at that time, within Him there was only divinity, with no humanity
There are also some whose will is not that strong, who do things foolishly, who always make mistakes and get upset
As soon as He came in, we who believed in Jesus, regardless of whether we were good or evil, had divinity added into our humanity
If we pray and contact the Lord adequately, the divine nature within will increase, and we will be able to live out a superior living
It is the same with us, with humanity mingled with divinity; it is no longer we who live, but Christ who lives in us
Now through the redemption and salvation of the Triune God, every one of us one day will be conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son
He desires those who are saved by His life to express the glory and beauty of His divine attributes in their human virtues
