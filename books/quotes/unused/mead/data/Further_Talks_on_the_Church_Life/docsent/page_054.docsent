   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Body of Christ is not a doctrine; it is something living.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all must learn this one thing: Only when every member functions is there the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only when every member functions is that the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our problem today is that we have inherited the priestly system of Roman Catholicism and the pastoral system of Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we are careless at the present time, there will also appear a certain kind of mediatorial system among us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We will be the only ones who take care of the matters in God's service.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Merely preaching the Body of Christ is useless; we must let it work and show forth its functions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since it is the Body of Christ, we need not fear that it will lack the functions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since it is the Body of Christ, we can place our faith in it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord wants every member in every locality to rise up and serve.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>GOD HAVING GONE AHEAD OF US</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If I am right, according to my discernment it is possible that the time has come.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The letters I have received from different places and the news I have heard from every place indicate that today in every place all the saints are ready to come forth to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God has gone ahead of us; we must follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not my desire that even one brother from among us would go out and fail to lead the brothers and sisters to serve but would replace them instead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I hope that when you go to a certain place, you will lead eight or ten to serve at the beginning and then after a certain time they will lead sixty, eighty, or a hundred to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then on your next visit you may see one or two thousand people serving.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is proper.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you must use the five-talented ones to suppress the two-talented ones and the two-talented ones to suppress the one-talented ones, you are not the Lord's servant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you must use the five-talented ones to replace the two-talented ones and the two-talented ones to replace the one-talented ones, you are not the Lord's servant.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You must cause all the five-talented ones to rise up and serve and all the two-talented ones to rise up and serve, and you must also cause all the one-talented ones to rise up and serve.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You must also cause those whom you think are not useful to rise up and serve.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, the glorious church will appear.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Foochow I would rather see all the simple villagers serving than three or five outstanding ones preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I do not admire the outstanding ones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I like the one-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In His graciousness the Lord could give us more Pauls and Peters, but He has not done so.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The whole world is full of one-talented brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What shall we do with these people?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Where are we going to put them?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>PHILADELPHIA MUST APPEAR</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this training here on the mountain, if God really deals with our self and with our work to the extent that we go out to provide a way for all the one-talented ones to serve, for the first time the church will begin to see what brotherly love is and Philadelphia will appear.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today the church needs not only oversight but also brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I believe in authority, and I also believe in brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without authority the church cannot go on.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"And have kept My word'' this is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"And have not denied My name'' this is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Philadelphia had these two kinds of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But Philadelphia herself is brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All the brothers come forth and serve in love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When such a day comes, we will begin to know what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Otherwise, if the present condition continues, we will still be hanging on to the tail of Roman Catholicism and Protestantism; we will not know what the brothers of Philadelphia are and what the authority of the church is.</S>
