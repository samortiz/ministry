   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN GALILEE 1 Scripture Reading: Luke 4:14-44</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we shall consider 4:14-44.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These verses begin the third major section of the Gospel of Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first section is the introduction 1:1-4 , and the second concerns the preparation of the Man-Savior in His humanity with His divinity 1:5 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The third section, which is quite lengthy, covers the ministry of the Man-Savior in His human virtues with His divine attributes 4:14 19:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 4:14 9:50 we have the ministry of the Man-Savior in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then from 9:51 19:27 we have a record of His ministry from Galilee to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE MAN-SAVIOR S HUMAN VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>AND DIVINE ATTRIBUTES</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The ministry of the Man-Savior was in His human virtues with His divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have seen that the preparation of the Man-Savior was in His humanity with His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The conception, birth, and growth of the Man-Savior were all in His humanity with His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After undergoing a full preparation, He began to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Like His preparation, His ministry was in His humanity with His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In particular, His ministry was not only in His humanity but in His human virtues, and not only with His divinity but also with His divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Man-Savior ministered in His human virtues with His divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Case of a Sinful Woman</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a help in understanding the expression in His human virtues with His divine attributes, let us use some cases in the Gospel of Luke as illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 7:36-50 a sinful woman came into the home of a Pharisee who had invited the Lord Jesus to eat with him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we read the account of this incident, we see that Jesus, the Man-Savior, conducted Himself in His human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was not at all bothered by that sinful woman, even when she began to wet His feet with her tears, and to wipe them with the hair of her head and when she kissed His feet affectionately and anointed them with the ointment v. 38 . If we had been the Lord Jesus, we probably would have been troubled by the behavior of this woman.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We might have said to her, Don t you know that I am a guest in this house?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Can t you see that I am eating?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, to act in that way would be to fail to act in the proper human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this situation the Man-Savior was very kind and patient, realizing that this woman had been convicted of her sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was also merciful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>People often speak about love, but rarely about mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Mercy, however, is more tender than love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be merciful is to sympathize with others in their poor condition and low estate.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In addition to exercising kindness, patience, and mercy toward the woman, the Lord Jesus also exercised His understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Often we fail to understand others, but the Lord Jesus was very understanding in the case of this woman.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, He was wise and loving.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Perhaps you are wondering what divine attributes are expressed in 7:36-50.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First, here we have the divine forgiveness 7:47-48 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is the only one who can grant forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He alone is qualified to forgive sins.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, forgiveness is one of the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 7:50 the Lord Jesus said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The giving of peace is also a divine attribute.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God is the only one who can give inner peace.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 7:36-50 we see the Man-Savior in the house of a Pharisee acting in His human virtues with His divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He could behave in such a manner because He was the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may say that He was a man equipped by God and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He possessed all the human virtues created by God, and He also had the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, He acted in the highest standard of morality, for His human virtues expressed His divine attributes.</S>
