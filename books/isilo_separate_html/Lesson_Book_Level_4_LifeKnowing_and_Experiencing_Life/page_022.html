The Source of the Sense of Life</h2><p>[Where does the sense of life we are speaking of come from? From what is it produced? It is produced from the things we have gained through regeneration-the life of God, the law of life, the Holy Spirit, Christ, and God. The life of God, the law of life, the Holy Spirit, Christ, and God cause us to have a feeling within, and this feeling is what we call the sense of life.<p>Every life has its feelings. Furthermore, the stronger the life is, the keener its feelings are. The life of God is the strongest life; therefore, when this life is in us it causes us not merely to have feelings, but to have strong feelings.<p>The Holy Spirit as ointment is anointing and moving in us; Christ is living in us with activity; and God is working in us. All three are in us with activity and action. They are not quiet and motionless; therefore, they all cause us to have feelings.]<h2 class=head2>C. The Function of the Sense of Life</h2><p>[What then is the function or use of this sense of life? The function or use of the sense of life is to let us know continuously where we are living. Are we living in the natural life or in the life of the Spirit? Are we living in the flesh or in the spirit? This is what the sense of life makes known to us continuously, and it is for this that we have the sense of life. Therefore the sense of life in us guides and proves us. If we follow the sense of life, we follow the guidance God gives us, and at the same time, we receive a verification of where we are living.<p>The sense of death makes known to us that we are not living in the spirit but in the flesh. The sense of death includes weakness, emptiness, depression, darkness and pain. Once we have such feelings, it means the sense of life in us is making known that we are already not right, that we are already not living in the spirit, but in the flesh.]<p>The sense of life [gives us the feeling of life and peace, or, in other words, it makes us feel strong, satisfied, lively, bright and comfortable. Whenever we feel strong, satisfied, lively, bright and comfortable within, we have inward proof that we are right before God and that we are living in the spirit. Life and peace are the positive feelings which the sense of life gives us within, thus proving that our condition in life is normal.]<p>What do we do when we have the sense of death? All we need to do is to repent (turn back) to the Lord by calling on His name. We also need to confess (agree with) to Him. Then He will forgive us and His blood will cleanse us. The end result will be the sense of life and peace. God provided us the sense of life in order for us to experience life easily. How good and easy it is to experience life according to the sense of life.<h2 class=head1>II. THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</h2><p>[Closely related to the sense of life is the fellowship of life. So let us now see the fellowship of life.]<h2 class=head2>A. The Source of the Fellowship of Life</h2><p>[Where does the fellowship of life come from? First John 1:2-3 says, &#8220;We (the apostles)...report to you (the believers) the eternal life...that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed the fellowship which is ours is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.&#8217;&#8217; These verses show that the apostles preached unto us &#8220;the eternal life&#8217;&#8217; so that we may have &#8220;fellowship.&#8217;&#8217; The eternal life is the life of God, and the life of God entering into us enables us to have fellowship. Since this fellowship comes out of the life of God, it is the fellowship of life. The life of God, therefore, is the source of the fellowship of life.]<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
