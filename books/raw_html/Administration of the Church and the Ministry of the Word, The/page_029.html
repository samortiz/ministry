 <h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO KNOW PEOPLE</h2>
<p>It is also crucial that we learn to know people as we administrate the church and minister the word. We need to know people for the administration of the church, and we also need to know people for the ministry of the word. If we do not know people, we cannot build up the church; rather, the church will be brought into confusion and torn down. A person who wants to build up the church must know people. He must know the condition of the brothers and sisters. This includes their intentions before God, their flesh, and their spirit. Every skilled construction worker must be knowledgeable about stones, tile, and wood. He must be able to discern the nature of wood, knowing whether it is soft wood or hard wood. If he does not know the nature of wood and uses it indiscriminately, the houses he builds will be dangerous to live in.</p>
<p>Much of our knowledge of people is according to the dealings we have received. If the Lord has dealt with us in a certain aspect, it will be easier for us to know people in that aspect. If our motives have never been dealt with by the Lord, it will be difficult for us to see whether others are pure in their motives. If our intentions, motives, and purposes have been thoroughly dealt with by the Lord, when we touch others, we will know their intentions, motives, and thoughts, and we will immediately know the source of their problems. We will know when they are pure. If our flesh has never been dealt with and we have never learned the lesson of being broken, we will not know when others are in their flesh. Therefore, our knowledge of people is based on our knowledge of ourselves. Those who are serious and correct in their dealing with themselves will know people accordingly.</p>
<p>It is very important for the elders who administrate the church to know the intentions, motives, and purposes of the brothers and sisters. The elders need to know the spiritual condition of the brothers and sisters and where they are before God. When the elders do not know the brothers and sisters, they can make many mistakes. When someone who is courteous, eloquent, knowledgeable, zealous, and able to give messages comes to the church, the elders may think that he can serve in coordination. But when he is brought into coordination, an entire service group may collapse.</p>
<p>The elders who administrate the church must avoid fickleness. It is inappropriate for them to constantly change their evaluation of the brothers. They should not say that someone is spiritual and then change their mind two months later. This kind of thing must be avoided in the administration of the church. This can be avoided only by knowing people and continually learning to know people.</p>
<p>The elders who have learned this lesson and who have been dealt with by the Lord will have a clear knowledge of others, knowing where they are and the condition of their spirit no matter how they conduct themselves. You will know whether a person&rsquo;s speaking represents the real condition of his spirit. You will know whether he is filled with the uncleanness of the self and the natural man, because his spirit has never been delivered from the self.</p>
<p>You will know whether he would carry out a work all by himself. A believer may be experienced, knowing how to conduct himself, but not be delivered from the self. If his views and knowledge are worldly, he cannot have a spiritual service. If such a person becomes an elder, he will tear down the church even if he can minister the word. Any responsibility and coordination in service that he bears will be a tearing down work. It will be the same as installing a time bomb in a building; at a certain time the bomb will explode, and the entire building will collapse. Arranging for him to be an elder will result in tearing down, not building up. Instead of being good for the building, he will be like a time bomb. When it is time for him to lose his temper, the whole situation will be out of control. He may be able to gain people and befriend them by his humility, knowledge, eloquence, and persuasive speech, but this is all according to the flesh. The church will be ruined in his hand. This is the real situation in some places. Making a mistake in knowing a person can damage five years of labor. Some damage cannot be recovered in a short time. The Lord may require five years to begin a new work.</p>
<p>Some people pray according to their own leading, not according to the leading of the Spirit. Others speak according to their own leading, not according to the leading of the Spirit. We should not encourage such ones by giving them responsibility or a position in the service. We cannot forbid people from speaking in the church meetings, but we must observe them and see if their ways are proper. If their ways are improper, we should exhort them so that they know that their ways are not encouraged or approved. This will give them some feeling. We should not excommunicate them for speaking something improper, but when they do so a second time, we should tell them that their ways are improper. We need to give them the feeling that their ways are not approved. This will afford them the proper help.</p>
<p>When the elders do not have this kind of awareness, they may assign an older brother who seems humble, knowledgeable, and experienced some responsibility in the service. Afterward, when problems arise and the church is damaged, they will begin to realize that they should not have known people according to the flesh. This has been the situation in many places.</p>
