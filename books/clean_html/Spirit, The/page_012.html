<h2 class="head1">THE ANOINTING OINTMENT&mdash;<br />
THE COMPOUND SPIRIT FOR ANOINTING</h2>
<p>The Spirit is also symbolized by the anointing ointment, which is the compound Spirit for anointing (Exo. 30:25-26; 1 John 2:20, 27; 2 Cor. 1:21). The difference between the oil and the ointment is that the ointment is a compound. In order to make an ointment, something of liquid is needed as a base. Then some elements are added into the liquid and compounded together. The Spirit that is working upon us and within us is not only an oil but also an ointment. The four elements in the compound ointment in Exodus 30 are myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. These four elements are mingled together with olive oil. They are compounded together into one ointment.</p>
<p>Many Christians may know the Holy Spirit, but they do not have the realization of the compound Spirit. Before the incarnation of God, the Spirit of God had not been compounded with the elements of the Triune God&rsquo;s processes. But after God&rsquo;s incarnation and through Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion and resurrection, the Spirit of God became a compound Spirit. The element of the Spirit of God before God&rsquo;s incarnation was divinity, which is God Himself. Through God&rsquo;s incarnation, humanity was added to the Spirit. Through Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion, the all-inclusive death of Christ was added into the Spirit. Through His resurrection, the element of resurrection with its power was added into the Spirit. Now in the Spirit are divinity plus humanity plus death plus resurrection. All of these elements have been compounded together into an anointing ointment, which is the compound Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WIND</h2>
<p>The Spirit is also symbolized by the wind (Ezek. l:4a; 37:9a; John 3:8; Acts 2:2). The Hebrew word <em>ruach</em> can be translated spirit, wind, or breath. In Ezekiel 37, <em>ruach</em> is <em></em> translated in these three ways. Ezekiel l:4a says that a strong wind came out of the north. According to the Psalms, God dwells in the north (Psa. 48:2). When people go north, they say that they are going up, and when they go south, they say that they are going down. God is up, and Satan is down. This is the principle of the universe. A strong wind coming from the north means that the strong Spirit comes from the very God.</p>
<p>In Ezekiel 1:4 there are also the cloud, the fire, and the brightness, which is the light. The wind brought in the cloud, and in the cloud is the fire. Along with the fire is the brightness, which is the light. The wind, the cloud, the fire, and the light all refer to the Spirit.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, the Spirit is also symbolized by the wind. John 3:8 says, &ldquo;The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.&rdquo; The Greek word <em>pneuma</em> is the word for wind and for spirit. Whether it means the wind or the spirit depends upon the context. The context here says that it blows and the sound of it can be heard. This indicates that it is the wind. The Spirit as the blowing wind brings God into us for our regeneration.</p>
<p>One of our co-workers was saved by the blowing of the Spirit. Before he was saved, he was a member of the Nationalist party. At that time they considered that Christianity was a tool of imperialism. Thus, this brother despised Christianity to the uttermost. He considered it as a foreign religion used by the imperialists. One day as he was sightseeing, he went to a certain mountain where there was an idol temple. When he entered this idol temple, to his surprise he saw a big Bible that was opened to Psalm 1. When he read Psalm 1, he was surprised at and inspired with what he read. He continued to read the Bible in this idol temple, and eventually he was convicted of his sins, realizing that he was a sinner before God. He wept and rolled on the ground repenting. The Spirit was a strong wind that day to get him regenerated. He was saved by the Lord, he withdrew from the Nationalist party, and he eventually became one of our co-workers. His regeneration was by the wind.</p>
<p>Others among us were not saved by such a strong wind of the Spirit. The Spirit may have come to us as a gentle breeze. Our confession may have been very gentle. We could have simply prayed in this way: &ldquo;Jesus, I love You. I am a sinner. I believe in You, and I take You. Thank You, Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Many of us were regenerated in a gentle way. Others have been regenerated in a strong and even wild way. When they were regenerated, they may have jumped, shouted, danced, or cried. The Spirit as the wind in John 3:8 is mentioned in relation to those who are regenerated, who are born of the Spirit.</p>
