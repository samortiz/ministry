   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO SCHEDULE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you were Jesus and realized that you were going to die and be raised from the dead, surely you would have made many arrangements with your disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You would have said, "Peter, John, James, and the rest of you, come here and let me give you a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Firstly I am going to die; secondly, I will be raised from the dead on the third day; thirdly, you must all meet me at a certain place, where I will do certain things among you; fourthly, you must all go to other places, where certain other things will happen; fifthly, sixthly, etc., etc., to number twenty-four."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you were Jesus, you would probably outline it in detail to the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is our natural concept; this is our religious mind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But read the last two chapters of John there is no such thing; the Lord Jesus never made any arrangements or left any schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From our natural viewpoint, what was done was a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everything occurred as a kind of accident.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But, praise the Lord, though they had no schedule, no arrangements, no appointments, they had the resurrected Christ, the living Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This Christ, according to the record of these two chapters, came to His disciples at any time and in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He just came!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He came in a way which was absolutely different from today's religion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He never came to a formal meeting there never was one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If Peter should call an urgent meeting and gather all the disciples to discuss their problems with Jesus, that would fit our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But Jesus never met with His disciples in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>JESUS APPEARS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>TO FOOLISH SISTERS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Following Jesus' resurrection, His first appearance was to a group of foolish sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In a sense, the sisters in the church life are always the foolish ones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Mentally, they are not so clear.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The brothers, on the other hand, are always clear so Peter, James and John stayed home to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They would have said to Mary, "It's foolish to go so early to the sepulchre!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why don't you stay home and sleep?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the church life the sisters are always, in a sense, doing things foolishly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But I tell you, we do need many foolish sisters in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was through these foolish sisters that the resurrection of Christ was discovered.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord's first appearance was not to the clear brothers, but to the foolish sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What can we say?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I don't think the Lord would appear to the clear Christians, but many, many times He does appear to the foolish ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is indisputable.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The sisters were undoubtedly foolish, but they saw the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They sought the Lord in a foolish way, but we can thank the Lord that they were so foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whenever we become so clear, we are through as far as the Lord is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord has made me a brother, and I must be satisfied with His creation; but sometimes I say, "Lord, why did you make me a man?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I would like to be a sister.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As a man it is so easy to miss you, but as a foolish sister, I would see you, I would meet you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I wish that I could be a sister!"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The first meeting the Lord Jesus held after His resurrection was with a few sisters there were no brothers!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That was the first meeting of the New Testament with the resurrected Christ.</S>
