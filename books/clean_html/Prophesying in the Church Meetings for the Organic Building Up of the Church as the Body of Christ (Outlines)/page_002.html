<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Lord is recovering four major items in the advance of His recovery today:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord desires to recover the priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The beginning of the priesthood in the New Testament was with John the Baptist&mdash;Mark 1:1-4:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins as the gospel of Jesus Christ.</li>
			<li>Not offering bulls and goats as sacrifices (Heb. 10:1-4) but offering sinners saved through his preaching as sacrifices (Mark 1:5).</li>
			<li>Bringing people to Christ&mdash;Mark 1:7-8.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The New Testament priests are priests of the gospel of God&mdash;Rom. 15:16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Not a few individual priests but a universal priesthood, a priestly body&mdash;Rev. 1:6b; 5:9-10; 1 Pet. 2:5.</li>
			<li>Telling out the virtues of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light, which is the preaching of the gospel of God&rsquo;s salvation in His virtues&mdash;1 Pet. 2:9.</li>
			<li>Making the saved sinners spiritual sacrifices to be offered to God for His acceptance&mdash; 1 Pet. 2:5.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The apostle Paul is the unique pattern of the priests of the gospel in the New Testament (1 Tim. 1:16), doing the work of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel in three steps of offering:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Saving sinners to offer them to God as acceptable sacrifices&mdash;Rom. 15:16.</li>
			<li>Bringing the believers up to lead them to present themselves to God as living sacrifices&mdash;Rom 12:1.</li>
			<li>Warning and teaching every saint in all wisdom to present each one full-grown in Christ&mdash;Col. 1:28-29.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord desires to recover the organic building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 4:12, 16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Body of Christ is an organism of the Triune God as the issue of the divine Trinity, not an organization of human beings&mdash;Eph. 1; John 15:1-5.</li>
		<li>The issue of the organic preaching of the gospel is that people are reborn, regenerated, to become the organic members of Christ&mdash;John 3:3, 5; 1 Cor. 4:15; Rom. 12:5.</li>
		<li>The organic building up of the Body of Christ is the increase of the Triune God in the believers for their growth in Christ&mdash;Col. 2:19.</li>
		<li>The organic building up of the Body is through the members of the Body feeding on the milk and food of the holy Word&mdash;1 Pet. 2:2; Heb. 5:14.</li>
		<li>The organic building up of the Body is through the saints being perfected by the gifts&mdash;Eph. 4:11-12, 16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Not building up a congregation but an organic Body.</li>
			<li>Not only by the gifted persons but also by every member of the Body.</li>
			<li>Not in the organizational way but in the organic way.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord desires to recover the perfecting of the common members of the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 4:11-16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord gave gifts&mdash;some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers&mdash;for the perfecting of the saints&mdash;vv. 11-12:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Unto the work of ministry.</li>
			<li>Unto the building up of the Body of Christ.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The perfecting gifts and the perfected saints, as the joints and the parts, as all the Body, cause the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love&mdash;v. 16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Through every joint of the rich supply supplying the Body.</li>
			<li>Through each one part operating in the Body according to its measure.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Ephesians 4:11 and 16 reveal the perfecting by the gifted persons as the joints of the rich supply.</li>
		<li>Ephesians 4:12 and 16 reveal the perfected saints as each one part of the Body of Christ doing the work of the New Testament ministry unto the building up of the Body of Christ by operating according to its measure.</li>
		<li>Ephesians 4:12 and 16 reveal the joints supplying and the parts operating for the purpose of building up the organic Body of Christ:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Joined closely together through every joint of the rich supply.</li>
			<li>Knit together through the operation in measure of each one part.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The building up of the church as the Body of Christ is in three levels:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Head builds up the Body by giving the gifted members as the joints to His Body&mdash; Eph. 4:11.</li>
			<li>The gifted persons perfect each one part of the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 4:12.</li>
			<li>Each one part operates in its measure to build up the Body directly&mdash;Eph. 4:16.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord desires to recover the church meetings in mutuality with all speaking for building up&mdash; 1 Cor. 14:23a, 26, 31:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Each attendant having a portion of the riches of Christ to share with others mutually for the organic building up of the church&mdash;1 Cor. 14:26, 31.</li>
		<li>Prophesying in 1 Corinthians being to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, to dispense Christ into people:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>He who prophesies builds up the church&mdash; 1 Cor. 14:4b.</li>
			<li>All believers having the capacity to prophesy and the obligation to prophesy&mdash;1 Cor. 14:31, 24.</li>
			<li>Prophesying being the excelling gift among all the gifts, making its seekers excelling&mdash; 1 Cor. 14:12.</li>
			<li>All believers being charged by the apostle to pursue, to desire earnestly, and to seek to prophesy&mdash;1 Cor. 14:1, 12, 39.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord desires to and will fulfill His words in Matthew 16:18, 1 Peter 2:5, Ephesians 4:11-16, and 1 Corinthians 14:26 concerning the building up of the church as a spiritual house for His dwelling, as a priestly body for His service, and as the organic Body of Christ for Christ&rsquo;s enlargement and expression.</li>
