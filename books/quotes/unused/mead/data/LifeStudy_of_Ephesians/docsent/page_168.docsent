   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TAKING CHRIST AS OUR LIFE AND OUR PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is a great difference between sanctification and behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In sanctification we do things without trying on purpose to do them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are the spontaneous expression of our taking Christ as our life and our person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When Christ is our life and our person, He lives within us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is He who is loving and submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To submit because of the indwelling Christ is one thing, but to submit because of behavior or outward correction is an altogether different matter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The leading ones in the churches should not tell others what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead, we all must be able to testify that we live, not according to outward teachings, but according to the Christ who dwells in us to be our life and our person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our aim is not to behave in a particular way, but simply to take Christ as our life and our person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then what we do will be the outflow of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Spontaneously, the wives will submit to their husbands, the husbands will love their wives, and the children will be obedient to their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, this kind of living will not be deliberate; it will be the issue of being filled in spirit with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the young people are helped by a message, they may say that they will never be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But even this may be religious, for the young people may unconsciously try to improve themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They may try by their own effort to do what they heard in that message.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Striving to make ourselves different is not sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to be sanctified in a genuine way, we simply need to contact the Lord and take Him as our life and our person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to pray, Lord Jesus, You are my life and my person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Lord, take me, occupy me, and possess me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>O Lord, come into every corner of my heart, fill my heart with Yourself, and make Your home in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Lord, I don t care whether or not I ll be different, and I m not concerned about behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I care only that You fill me and come out through me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you contact the Lord in this way, He will gradually and spontaneously be added into your being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This addition of Christ will sanctify you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A HEAVY BURDEN</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Subjective sanctification does not take place by teaching, but takes place by the inward working of the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the reason we emphasize the fact that in the Lord s recovery we care little for doctrine in letters, but very much for the experience of Christ as our life and our person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I cannot express how heavy is the burden on my heart concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If I can help the saints realize what sanctification is, I believe that this burden will be discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Please be impressed that sanctification definitely is not a matter of outward behavior or improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God desires to daily dispense the element of Christ into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is this element alone that causes us to be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>WASHING AWAY THE NATURAL DISPOSITION</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In subjective sanctification something of Christ is added to us, but in cleansing something of us, especially our natural disposition, is subtracted.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As we are cleansed, our natural disposition is washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Disposition is the most inward aspect of our constitution; it is the very root of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We were born with a certain disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Disposition, therefore, is altogether inward.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, character, a combination of disposition, custom, and habit, is partly inward and partly outward, whereas behavior is wholly outward.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord Jesus cares little about our behavior, more about our character, but very much about our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As Christ is adding His element into us, He is also cleansing us and subtracting our natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His cleansing washes away the natural element from the depths of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have pointed out that the Lord will wash the church from all wrinkles.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Wrinkles are caused by our natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, the only way these wrinkles can be removed is for the element of our natural disposition to be cleansed away.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>With the young people it is easy to point out what their disposition is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, if the Apostle Paul were with us, it would be difficult to discern his disposition, because he has been so deeply cleansed and purified.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His old, natural disposition has been washed away by the element of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The washing away of our natural disposition cannot be accomplished by teaching, but can be accomplished only by the impartation of the element of Christ into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At the same time the element of Christ is being added, something of ourselves is being carried away.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, on the one hand, we have the addition of Christ, but, on the other hand, we have the subtraction of the natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Gradually, Christ is being added into our being, and our natural disposition is being subtracted.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The result of this process is transformation, a metabolic change in which the new element is constituted into us and the old element is carried away.</S>
