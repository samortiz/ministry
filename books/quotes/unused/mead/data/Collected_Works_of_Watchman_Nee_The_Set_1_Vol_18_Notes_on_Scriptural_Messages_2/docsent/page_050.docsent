   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SALVATION OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ADULTEROUS WOMAN Issue No. 40 Scripture Reading: John 4:1-15, 29</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Scriptures we have read today record something very marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord preached to a most immoral woman, and this woman eventually turned to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John 4:3-7 says, "He left Judea and went away again into Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And He had to pass through Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So He came to a city of Samaria called Sychar...and Jacob's well was there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Jesus therefore, being wearied from the journey, sat thus by the well; it was about the sixth hour.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There came a woman of Samaria to draw water."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Please note that about the sixth hour the woman came to draw water.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When is the sixth hour?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all know it is twelve o'clock.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus was wearied from His journey and rested at the well.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was at that moment that a woman came to draw water.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By reading the Old Testament, we know that every time women came to draw water they always came as a group.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They either came in the morning or in the late afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, in this instance it was high noon, and the weather was very hot.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This woman came to draw water by herself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Did she not have any companions?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Did she not have neighbors?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Were there no other women that would come with her to draw water?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Indeed, she had no companion or friend.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The latter section of this chapter tells of her history.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>She was a very immoral woman.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When she came to draw water, it was high noon.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was the hottest time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This woman was a lonely woman!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No one would be her companion, and no one sympathized with her.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the hearts of many women, she was a sinner, a filthy woman; they could not go with her to draw water.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Not only were people afraid of her, but she also was afraid of people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If she came in the morning to draw water, she was afraid someone would point to her and say, "This is a very immoral woman."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If she came in the evening to draw water, she was also afraid that people would point to her and say, "This is a very defiled woman."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, she had to come at high noon to draw water by herself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She was a lonely woman, despised by the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the same time, she also despised the world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She was a lonely woman, and no one sympathized with her.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But when she came to the well to draw water this time, she met another lonely person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She was lonely and despised by people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He also was lonely and despised by people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Her loneliness was caused by her sin; His loneliness was caused by man's jealousy; He could only go back to Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Oh, when the lonely sinner met the lonely Savior, she was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"Jesus said to her, Give Me something to drink" v. 7 . This was an invitation for her to draw near.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many times you are afraid of God, but you are not afraid of a person who asks you for water.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There are many times when you are afraid of God, but you are not afraid of God asking you for water.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many times you fear God and think that He is high and fearful.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if you know that the One who is as lonely, wearied, and sweating as you are is the very God Himself, you will believe.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord is here.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord has the affection of a friend and is very approachable.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Samaritan woman said to Him, "How is it that You, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, who am a Samaritan woman?...Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Samaritan woman said this because there was no contact between the Jews and the Samaritans.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord answered by saying that if she knew two things, 1 the gift of God, and 2 who it was who was saying to her, "Give Me a drink," she would have asked of Him, and He would have given her living water.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is a pity that there are many people in the world who do not know these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today even some among us may also not know these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some sitting here may be bored, weary, or disappointed because of the burden of sin or dissatisfaction in life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The worldly road is indeed a very rugged road, and the sea of sin is indeed stormy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But if you know these two things, all will be well.</S>
