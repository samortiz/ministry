   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY BEING NUMBERED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The children of Israel were formed into a fighting army by being numbered by their families and leaders vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1-16 and according to their age vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>20-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. By the Families and Their Leaders</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The children of Israel were numbered by the families and their leaders, that is, by the source of life and under its leadership authority .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The families refer to the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In our spiritual history, there should be a source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even in the church life today, we must have a family.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Who brought you to Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Who begot you in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other words, who is your spiritual father?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this matter, the Bible is balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of course, God is our divine Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, Paul told the Corinthian believers that they might have had "ten thousand guides in Christ, yet not many fathers," for in Christ Jesus he had begotten them through the gospel 1 Cor 4:15 , imparting the divine life into them so that they became children of God and members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, those believers belonged to Paul's "family."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They did not hear the gospel, repent, and believe apart from him as their spiritual father, their source.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As believers in Christ, we all have three kinds of fathers: a fleshly father, a spiritual father, and the divine Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today's numbering depends on the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The leaders in Numbers 1 refer to the leadership under the authority of Christ in His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Just as there is order in our physical body, there must be a good order among the members in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There must be some kind of leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without leadership, it is impossible to maintain a proper situation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who claim that there should be no leadership in the church eventually assume the leadership and become the strongest leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For the church to be formed into a fighting army, we need the source of life and also the leadership in life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>B. According to Age</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The numbering is also according to age, according to maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Besides the source of life and the leadership in life, there is the need of the maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These three things must be bound together as a strong cord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today, some care only for spirituality, only for maturity; however, we should care not only for the maturity of life but also for the source of life and the authority of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From Twenty Years Old and Above</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The numbering was of all the males from twenty years old and above vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This refers to those who were able to go forth to war.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Excluding All Females</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>and the Males under Twenty Years Old</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This numbering excluded all females and the males under twenty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The females signify those who are spiritually weaker, and the males under twenty signify those who are spiritually immature.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The sisters in the church life today should not feel excluded by this, because spiritually speaking they may be men, the stronger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What counts here is not our natural status but the spiritual nature of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who are weaker and those who are immature are not qualified to go forth to war.</S>
