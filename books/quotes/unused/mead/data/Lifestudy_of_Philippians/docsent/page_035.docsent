   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. HAVING RECEIVED SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE HIGHEST STANDARD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Ephesians 2:5 Paul says that we have been saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Ephesians 2:8 he declares, By grace you have been saved through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is absolutely true that we are saved only by grace through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without grace, it is not possible for us to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many Christians today rightly emphasize the fact that salvation is by grace alone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, although they may stress salvation by grace, they fail to point out the extent of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to Ephesians 2, God s salvation brings us into the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that we have received a salvation with the highest possible standard.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have been saved by grace to be in the heavenlies with Christ Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although many Christians point out that we are saved from sin, Ephesians 2 indicates that we are also saved from death, for we have been enlivened by God, raised with Christ, and seated with Him in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>My emphasis in this message is not on the fact that we are saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is on the extent and standard of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have been saved by God s grace to be with Christ in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE NEED TO WORK OUT THIS SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Philippians 2:12 Paul tells us explicitly to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To receive salvation is one thing, and to work it out is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To work out salvation is not to accomplish salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, it is to carry out through continual obedience the salvation we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul s word about obedience in verse 12 answers to what he has previously said about Christ becoming obedient v. 8 . A very striking aspect of Christ as our pattern is His obedience unto death, even the death of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As God, Christ first took the major step of emptying Himself, of laying aside the expression of His deity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then, having emptied Himself and having taken the form of a man, He humbled Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This self-humbling is particularly related to obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Bible underscores the importance of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, in 1 Samuel 15:22 we are told that to obey is better than sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We who have received Christ as the pattern of our salvation must learn to always obey with fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Within we should have fear as the motive, and without we should have trembling as our attitude, an indication that we have no confidence in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>GOD OPERATING IN US</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to verse 13, God is operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our salvation is not merely an action; it is a living Person, the Triune God Himself, operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The God Paul speaks of in verse 13 is the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to chapter fourteen of John, the Father is one with the Son, and the Son is one with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The God in Philippians 2:13 is not only the Father, but the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is the Son and the Spirit as well as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order to prove that God in 2:13 is the Triune God, we need to consider the context of the whole book of Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The last verse of the book, 4:23, says, The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Certainly the Lord as the One whose grace is with our spirit is not separate from the God who operates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The very Christ who is with our spirit is the God who operates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, 1:19 speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There can be no doubt that the Spirit who supplies us is the Spirit who indwells us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But this Spirit cannot be separate from the God who operates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we put all these verses together and consider the context of the book as a whole, we shall see that the God who operates in us is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is the very God who is Christ in us 2 Cor 13:3a, 5 and the Spirit dwelling in us Rom 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In verse 13 Paul says that God operates in us both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Where within us does this willing take place?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It must be in our will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This indicates that God s operation begins from our spirit and spreads into our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have pointed out that the grace of Christ is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, God s operating to will in us involves not only our spirit but also our will.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, God s operation must spread from our spirit into our will.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As God operates the willing within us, He carries out His working.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This corresponds to Romans 8, where we see that God works not only in our spirit, but also in our mind and eventually in our physical body vv.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>6, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We will in our will, and we work in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Triune God operates in us from our spirit, through our will, and then into our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God s operating is for His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>His good pleasure is the heart s desire of His will Eph 1:5 that we may reach the climax of His supreme salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Every living being has a good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is especially true of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For this reason, Paul speaks of God s good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The good pleasure of a mother can be observed in the way she loves her child.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Using this as an illustration of God s good pleasure, we may say that God s good pleasure is to love us in a way that makes Him happy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God s working in us is to enable us to reach the climax of His supreme salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Praise Him that we are now in God s good pleasure!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As He operates in us, we cooperate with Him by obeying Him.</S>
