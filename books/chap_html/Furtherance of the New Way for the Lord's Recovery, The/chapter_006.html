<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>HOW TO TEACH THE NEW ONES IN THE HOME MEETINGS</h1><h2 class=head1>THE PROPER CHURCH LIFE BEING BUILT UP IN THE HOME MEETINGS</h2><p>The Lord wants us to practice His ordained way with the ultimate result of bringing the church life completely into the homes. The Bible gives us such a pattern in Acts. After the apostles passed away, however, the church, affected by various tests, fell into the condition of today’s Christianity. Instead of having the church life in the homes, the believers hold big meetings in large worship halls with one person speaking and all the rest listening. If the big meetings were eliminated, Christianity would be finished. We hope that according to what we have seen in the Bible, we could bring the church life back into the homes in the shortest time possible. In this way the church will still be able to prosper and go on even without the big meetings.<p>Just like a society or a nation, the basic factor of the church’s health is the family. If each family is strong, all the problems will be solved. If the families are not doing well, then the problems in society cannot be solved, and the proper persons cannot be produced to be the steadying strength of society. If a nation or society wants to produce useful people, it cannot rely merely on education. Rather, it must rely on healthy families because the family is its supporting strength.<p>Let us take Taiwan as an example. The progress of these past few years has been possible for the undeniable reason that the families are healthy. For the sake of building up the families and perfecting their children, the parents in Taiwan all go to work early and come home late, labor diligently, and live thriftily to have some savings for supporting their families. They mainly pay attention to the education of their children, considering the perfecting of their children to be one of the most important things in life. They even do certain things themselves in order to be a pattern to their children. This is because they know that if the family is not strong, their children will not be able to receive a sufficiently high level of education to have a secure future. Their concept of society is not necessarily strong, nor are they always patriotic, but their concept of the family is deep and strong. They firmly believe that the family is the stabilizing force of everything, the cause and factor of progress, and that if they do not take care of the family, then society and the country will be finished. This is an important factor in Taiwan’s becoming stable and prosperous.<p>The main function of the family is not to beget children. Begetting children is not a problem; people start begetting as soon as they are married. After the begetting, however, the nourishing and educating are great sciences. A proper family must carry out the begetting, the nourishing, and the educating simultaneously. Although we rely on the schools for a large portion of the education of our children, it is difficult for the schools to produce good students without the support of good families. Good students are cultivated by good families.<p>Nearly the entire supporting strength of all Christianity today is in the big meetings. They invite famous people to preach sermons and hire pastors with degrees, special talents, and eloquence who can gather, contact, and organize people. The result is that the strength of the meetings and the shepherding of the believers depends solely on the pastor. If the pastor leaves, the meetings collapse, and the believers lose their care and nourishing. Therefore, this practice of relying only on the big meetings is truly not the proper way revealed in the Bible. The Bible shows us that the proper church life must be carried out and built up in the homes.
