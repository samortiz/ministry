We must refer to the Bible to see who is qualified to form the church, and to see how the local churches are established.<p>[We need to realize that none of us is qualified to form the church. Only the Lord Jesus is qualified for this. In Matthew 16:18 He says, “I will build My church.’’ He is the unique one who is qualified to form the church.]
