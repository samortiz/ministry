   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 Man and All Other Living Creatures Were Satisfied</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is not a small thing to say that man was satisfied Gen 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Suppose Adam had been created and there was nothing for him to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suppose God had said to Adam, "I made you, but I didn't prepare anything for you to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Please wait one or two days."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The situation was not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everything had been prepared before Adam came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God had made trees that were good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Adam came out of God's creating hand, he immediately had something to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not only Adam was satisfied; all the living creatures were satisfied Gen 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later on we will see that real rest comes out of satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Can we rest if we are hungry?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as we are hungry, we can never rest.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rest depends upon satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Man ate and was satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>4 Everything Was Very Good</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Genesis 1:31 says that God looked at everything that He had made and it was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before the sixth day, God did not say, "very good"; He said, "good."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why did God say "very good" on the sixth day?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because Adam was in God's image and had been given God's dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No one murmured and no one was hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God could say, "Very good!"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That was the climax.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After God said this, came the seventh day, the day of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>5 God Rested God Was Satisfied</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God rested because He was satisfied Gen 2:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was the last item of the ultimate consummation God rested and was satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>a The Reason for Rest</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The reason for God's rest was that His glory was manifested because man had His image and His authority was about to be exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Satan, God's enemy, was going to be dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As long as man expresses God's image and deals with God's enemy, God can rest.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was not simply that God had finished His work, but in His work was a man who could bear God's image and subdue God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Based upon these two facts, God rested.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>b The Miniature of Rest the Rest of Creation</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The rest of creation was a small rest, a miniature rest.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this rest, man had the image of God and could exercise God's dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These two factors caused rest, but only rest on a very small scale.</S>
