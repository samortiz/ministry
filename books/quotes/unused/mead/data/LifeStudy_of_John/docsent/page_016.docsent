   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. To Produce Stones for God s Building 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Followers of Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to Be Transformed into Stones</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lamb with the dove attracted people to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When John the Baptist said, Behold, the Lamb of God, two of his disciples were drawn to Him, and John was very happy about it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What were the names of these two disciples?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first was Andrew, and the second should be John, the writer of this gospel, although he was humble, not mentioning himself by name.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once Andrew had been attracted, he found his brother Simon and led him to Jesus 1:41-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the Lord looked upon Simon, He changed his name to Cephas, or Peter, which means a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord referred to this word of His when He spoke to Peter in Matthew 16:18 about the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It must have been from this that Peter had obtained the concept of the living stones for the building of the spiritual house 1 Pet 2:5 , which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The significance of a stone is that it denotes a work of transformation to bring forth material for God s building 1 Cor 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In one chapter we have a Lamb, a dove, and the stone, all of which are figures.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is the meaning of these figures?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The meaning is that the Lamb plus the dove produces stones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Redemption plus regeneration and transformation produces stones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once again I say that we should not try to understand the Gospel of John merely according to the black and white letters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You must probe into the real significance of the allegories.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is a lamb?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to Exodus 12, the Passover lamb was slain for the people s sins and eaten for their satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is a dove?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From the Old Testament we have seen that a dove is a creature full of the beauty of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, it represents the third Person of the Godhead reaching humanity and imparting life to man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This dove which descends upon man matches redemption and is for the producing of stones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It does not produce preachers, ministers, or doctors of theology; it produces stones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we shall see, these stones are for the building of Bethel, the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although Andrew found the Lord before Peter did, Jesus did not change Andrew s name.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is the reason for this?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you and I had been the Lord Jesus, we probably would have changed Andrew s name to stone and John s to diamond.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, the Lord Jesus was unhurried and moved gradually, changing Simon s name, not Andrew s. If I had been Andrew, I would have said, Lord, why didn t You change my name? It s not fair.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I came to You first.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why do You give Simon a new name and not me?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Lord, You have to give me a new name too.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the Lord did not change Andrew s name.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicates that everything depends on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord will never act in a rush.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Philip was the next one to be attracted to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, the Lord did not do anything with Philip.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then Philip found Nathanael and said, We have found Him of whom Moses in the law and prophets wrote, Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth v. 45 . This information was inaccurate.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Jesus was not born of Joseph, but of Mary Matt 1:16 , and was not born in Nazareth, but in Bethlehem Luke 2:4-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Nathanael said, Can anything good come out of Nazareth?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>, Philip said, Come and see.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Philip was right not to argue with Nathanael.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He realized that he was lacking in understanding, so he simply said to Nathanael, Come and see.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all have a lesson to learn from these words.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are many young Philips among us, who, after seeing something of the Lord, have gone out and spoken to others in an improper way, giving them wrong information.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, we should not argue with people, but simply tell them to come and see.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nathanael came.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although the Lord did not do anything with Philip, He did something with Nathanael, speaking to him of Jacob s dream 1:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Why did the Lord do something with Simon and Nathanael, but not with Andrew and Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is a principle here and the principle is this: the Lord does not deal with the first, but always with the second.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The first is of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>During the Passover in Egypt all the firstborn were killed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not be the first, for if you desire to be the first, you are finished with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although it may be good to be the first in school, it is not good in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Never try to be the first with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Learn to be the second.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you attempt to be the first, you will miss the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Everyone likes to be first.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, if you are willing to be second, the Lord will do something to you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Simon was second, and the Lord revealed to him the matter of being a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Nathanael also was second, and the Lord unveiled to him the house of God.</S>
