   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Man Being Estranged from the Life of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The significance of man's fall is that man was estranged from the life of God Eph 4:17-19 , signified by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the tree of life is mentioned in Genesis 2, the emphasis is on the tree itself, not on its fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 9 says, "...good for food; the tree of life."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It does not mention the fruit of the tree of life; it simply points to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man's need was to eat the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since the tree of life signifies God Himself, by eating the tree of life, man would have received God Himself as life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But by choosing the tree of knowledge, man became estranged from the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man's fall separated him from God as life, but Christ's redemption brings man back to God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The term the life of God is used only in Ephesians 4:18.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To say that we as believers have the life of God is not very accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually, what we have is not the life of God, but God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have God Himself as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not take something of God; we take God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must learn to take God Himself, the entire person, as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE OLD TESTAMENT SAINTS HAVING THE RIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>TO PARTAKE OF GOD AS THE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>FOR THEIR SATISFACTION ENJOYMENT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THROUGH THE REDEMPTION OF CHRIST,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>AS TYPIFIED BY THE PROPITIATION</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE SACRIFICES</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Old Testament times, the redemption of Christ was not yet accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was typified by the propitiation accomplished through the animal sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Under this propitiation, God was legally free to contact man, and man was repositioned to enjoy the right to take God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Psalm 36:8-9 is a unique portion in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I treasure this portion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through these verses we can realize that the Old Testament saints entered into God through the type of propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Propitiation as a type enabled them to enter into God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Psalm 36:8-9 says, "They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Old Testament, the temple of God, the house of God, signified that God Himself was enterable.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through the type of redemption, God's people could enter into Him and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today, through the reality of the redemption of Christ, we can enter into God to enjoy the fatness of His house, the flow of His life, and the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These verses mention four main points concerning our enjoyment of God as life: fatness, a river of pleasures, the fountain of life, and light.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God's dwelling place, His house, has the fatness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This indicates that God's house is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is also a river of pleasures, a river of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must learn to drink of the river of God's pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is also the fountain of life and the light.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All of these four items point to one thing: God is for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But in order to enjoy Him, we must take Him as life and live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is the fountain of life, but we must take Him as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we take Him as our life, He becomes the fatness, the river of satisfaction, and the light of life.</S>
