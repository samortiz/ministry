Our union with God in life refers to receiving the life of God at the time of our regeneration. Just as God lives through the Holy Spirit, we also, henceforth, live through the Holy Spirit. This is a union in life. We share one life with God. This is something inward. What expresses this one life is the will. The union in the will is something outward. The meaning of a union with God in the will is that we have only one will with God. These two unions are related to each other and are not independent. But here we will only speak of the union in the will; other matters are beyond the scope of our discussion. The union of the new life is spontaneous, because this new life is just God's life. There are some problems related to the union in the will, however, because the will obviously refers to our will.</P><P>After our regeneration God is seeking a union between our will and His will day by day. If our will is not fully joined to God, salvation has not yet been fully accomplished; man is not yet in full harmony with God. Not only does God desire that we receive His life, but He also desires that we be in union with Him. The will is absolutely ours. If our will is not in union with His will, then we are not in union with God.</P><P>If we read the Bible carefully, we will find a general principle concerning all sin: sin is rebellion. We perish due to the sin of Adam, and we are saved through the obedience of Christ. Formerly we were sons of rebellion, but God wants us to be children of obedience. Actually, rebellion is agreeing with our own will, while obedience is submission to God's will. God saved us so that we would deny our will and be joined to His will. Believers today often commit a great mistake here. They think that spiritual life is simply a matter of happiness in their emotion and knowledge in their mind. They diligently seek after all kinds of feelings and biblical knowledge; they think that these things are most excellent. At the same time, they accomplish many good, great, and important works according to their feelings and thoughts, thinking that these works will be most pleasing to God. Little do they realize that God does not require believers to feel or think anything; He only requires believers to be joined to Him in their will. He desires to see believers wholeheartedly seeking after what He is after and willing to do what He says. Without the believers' unconditional surrender and willingness to accept the whole counsel of God, all of their so-called spiritual living is superficial, no matter how much holiness and joy they feel, and no matter what strange teachings they obtain. All visions, dreams, voices, signs, zeal, work, activities, and labor are outward. If believers are not resolved in their will to finish God's course, everything else is useless.</P><P>If we are joined to God in our will, we will immediately cease from all activities that originate from our self. This means that we will no longer have any independent acts. To our self we have become dead, and to God we have become alive. This does not mean that we will act for God according to our impulse or ways. It means that we will move as a result of God's moving and that we will be delivered from all activities of the self. In other words we have changed our center and starting point. Formerly, all of our works were centered upon our self, and all activities originated from our self. Now everything belongs to God. God does not ask about the nature of the things we initiate; He only asks who initiates them. God does not care for anything that is not completely free from the self, no matter how good it may be.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_056.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_058.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 08: The Present Testimony (1) &nbsp; pg 57</div><br></body></html>
