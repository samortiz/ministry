These lessons may be considered as a pair, like two "sisters." They are brief, so they need much labor and development on our part.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE UNIQUE FOUNDATION HAVING BEEN LAID</H2><P>We have to tell the saints that all real service is a building work. The church service is not merely a work, but a building work. There are many works which are not building works. Only certain works are building works. Since we are going to serve, to build, we have to realize that we cannot lay a foundation. The unique foundation has been laid by the apostle Paul. Today we are still building on his foundation. Paul said, "According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation.." (1 Cor. 3:10a). Then he said, "For another foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ" (v. 11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. BUILDING ON THE UNIQUE FOUNDATION</H2><P>Our service must be a building work on the unique foundation (1 Cor. 3:10m). We cannot lay a foundation, nor can we build something on another foundation. We have to strongly stress these points. Even though all denominations claim that Christ is their foundation, actually many works in today's Christianity are building works on some other foundation. We do not like to set up social and charitable works such as schools and hospitals. The apostle Paul did not do this kind of work. Our service must be a direct building on the unique foundation. There is much charitable work in Christianity which is good, but it is not built upon Christ as the unique foundation. Whatever we do in the church must be something built directly on Christ. This is why the apostle Paul spoke such a strong word in 1 Corinthians.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. BUILDING WITH GOLD, SILVER,<br>AND PRECIOUS STONES</H2><P>The proper building materials for the church are gold, silver, and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12a). Gold symbolizes the divine nature of God the Father. Silver symbolizes Christ's redemptive work. Precious stones symbolize the Spirit's transforming work. This indicates that what we build upon the foundation of Christ should be something of the Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_077.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_079.html">Next</a> </body></html>
