<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>15. To Restore a Brother, Overtaken in Some Offense, with Meekness (a Gentle Expression of Humility) Protects Us from Being Tempted Also</H2><P>Sometimes when you go to restore a certain one, who you are aware has committed a sin, you do not have an attitude of humility and gentleness; rather, you are proud secretly. Consequently, after a few days, you may be tempted also to commit the same sin which he committed. Hence, to restore a brother, overtaken in some offense, with meekness (a gentle expression of humility) protects us from being tempted also (Gal. 6:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>16. Self-boasting, Self-exaltation, Self-glorification, and Lusting after Vainglory Are All Ugly and Base Expressions of Pride</H2><P>In addition, we must see that self-boasting, self-exaltation, self-glorification, and lusting after vainglory are all ugly and base expressions of pride (Gal. 5:26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Self-justification</H2><P>The third thing which the co-workers and elders need to beware of is self-justification, the justifying of oneself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Self-justification Indicates Condemning of Others and Exalting of Yourself</H2><P>All the self-justified ones always condemn others and exalt themselves.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Lord Came Not to Condemn Men but to Save Men by Forgiving (Forgetting) Their Sins</H2><P>In John 3:17 the Lord said, "For God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." The Lord came not to condemn men but to save men by forgiving (forgetting) their sins.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Church Is Neither a Police Station Arresting People nor a Law Court Judging People, but a Home Raising Up Believers, a Hospital Healing and Recovering Believers, and a School Teaching and Edifying Believers</H2><P>The church is not a police station arresting people in order to find out their wrongdoings. The church is neither a law court judging people in order to decide whether or not they are guilty. Rather, the church is a home raising up believers that they may become grown-ups. Furthermore, the church is a hospital healing and recovering believers. When the Lord was on the earth, He ate with tax collectors and sinners, and for this He was criticized by the Pharisees. The Lord told the Pharisees, "Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill" (Matt. 9:12). The Lord seemed to be saying to them, "You Pharisees don't need Me. I came as a Physician to open a hospital to receive and heal those who are sick." Moreover, the church is a school teaching and edifying believers.</P><P>We co-workers and elders need to carefully consider the above items so that we may avoid these common errors.</P>
