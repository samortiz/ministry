<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST VERSUS THE LAW</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 1 and 2</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Luke 24:27, 44-45; Psa. 1—2</h1><h2 class=head1>INTRODUCTION</h2><p>All Christians know that in the Bible there is a wonderful book called the Psalms. Yet most of them merely know that this book is wonderful; they cannot tell why it is so wonderful. The Psalms are indeed very impressive to the reader. Whoever reads the Psalms is touched. The reason the Psalms are so touching is because they are not mere teachings; they are the sentiments and impressions of the godly saints in their experiences. Moreover, these expressions are uttered in praises to God, not in ordinary talk. These are not praises according to doctrine, but praises according to the feelings and impressions which the godly saints have derived from their experiences. Therefore, we may define the Psalms as follows:<p>They are the expression, in their praises to God, of the sentiments and impressions of the godly saints in their experiences, in and through which Christ is revealed and the Church as God’s house and God’s city is typified.<p>In the Psalms Christ is revealed, but we cannot say that the church is revealed, because in the Psalms the church is still hidden as a mystery. Therefore we can say only that the church is typified. In the types we see something of the church as the house of God and as the city of God. But it was not prophesied, predicted, or revealed.<p>The Psalms are so inspiring and impressive, firstly, because they are praises. All the writings of the Psalms are in the form of praises. Secondly, all these praises were not composed by knowledge, doctrine or understanding of teachings. They were composed with the sentiments and impressions of experiences, many experiences. Whenever we speak of our experience, there is something inspiring, and it will be impressive. On the contrary, whenever we utter mere doctrine, there is no inspiration. We need to speak out of our experiences. The Psalms are the expressions, sentiments and impressions of experiences. Thirdly, all the Psalms are the expression of godly saints in their praises, not an expression of gossiping people. I use these two words in a very special way—godly saints. The Psalms are the expression of their praises.<h2 class=head1>GOD SPEAKS IN THE SAINTS’ SPEAKING</h2><p>Now we must see an exceedingly important matter. Because the writers of the Psalms are godly saints, because they are praising, and because they are expressing something of their sentiments and their experiences, they are very close to God. Because of their nearness and openness to God, they provide a way for God to utter something within their utterance. While they are speaking, God comes and speaks in and through their utterance. This point is of great importance. The Psalms are the expression of the godly saints; yet in their expression the door is open for the Lord to speak; the opportunity is given for God to utter something in their utterance. It is for this very reason that some find it difficult to understand the Psalms. On the one hand they are the expression of the godly saints, and yet on the other hand they are the expression of God Himself.<p>For example, the authorship of Psalm 2 is not mentioned; by itself no one can know who wrote it. At the heading of most of the Psalms the author’s name is mentioned, but not Psalm 2. Surely God was not the scribe. Surely Christ was not the writer. In any case, regardless of the authorship, we have verse 7, “I will declare the decree…” Who is this “I”? Who is it that said, “The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.” When we come to the New Testament, in the Acts and in Hebrews, we are clearly told that this word was spoken by the Lord Jesus after He was resurrected. The “I” here is Christ, but Christ was not the writer of this Psalm. Acts 4:25 reveals that this Psalm was written by David. David was the author. How then could he say, “I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee”? David could say this because he was so godly, so near to Christ, and so open to God that he paved the way and opened the door for the Spirit of Christ to enter into his utterance. When he was praising, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, uttered something in his utterance of praising. We must keep this point in mind; it is exceedingly vital. Many times in the Psalms the Spirit of Christ entered into the utterances of the writers to utter something. On the one hand it was and still is the utterance of the writers, but on the other hand it is the utterance of Christ.
