<p>When you send spiritual food to people&rsquo;s homes, you must have the boldness to &ldquo;put it on the table.&rdquo; Do not think you will offend them. You must have the boldness to ask everyone in that home to eat. This way requires your faith and your confidence. You must have faith and boldness to knock on people&rsquo;s doors. Before the Lord Jesus told the disciples to go and disciple all the nations, He said, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.&rdquo; Then He continued, &ldquo;Go therefore&rdquo; (Matt. 28:19). All authority is given to the Lord, and because we are His members, the authority is transmitted to us. Therefore, we go, not with shaking but with boldness and power. You need the faith, and you need the boldness. You should pray, &ldquo;Lord, I do not believe my fears. I have the authority. Before my knocking at the door I give commandment to all the demons to leave this house. Demons, you have no right to remain here. I have the authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes it is not the one with whom you speak that would not believe; it is you who would not believe. When you say, &ldquo;Let us be baptized,&rdquo; you have to say it with faith. Before a newly saved one hears your speaking, he may have said that he would not be baptized. But when he hears your speaking, this word would convince and subdue him. Immediately he would change his mind.</p>
<p>Do not ask people if they would be baptized. If you ask them, they would probably say no. You must say something positive. Your word will become power and authority, subduing them. You must have the faith, and you must be willing to see them baptized. Always have the boldness. You do not know how subtle the demons are. While you will be talking to people, the &ldquo;flaming darts of the evil one&rdquo; will come (Eph. 6:16). One dart will bring the thought, &ldquo;He will not understand.&rdquo; Another dart will be the thought, &ldquo;Even if he understands, he will not believe.&rdquo; Another dart will be the lie, &ldquo;Even if he believes, he would not be baptized.&rdquo; Do not listen to all the lies. Every lie is a dart. Simply reject them. You have to say: &ldquo;Lord, I take the helmet of your salvation. I do not take all the darts. I believe that this one understands; I believe that this one would believe; and I believe that this one will be baptized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You must command the demons to leave. When you talk to a sinner for their salvation, there is a battle. The Lord Jesus told us that when one sinner repented there would be joy in the presence of the angels of God (Luke 15:10). This may indicate that before the repentance of the sinner, there was a battle between the good angels and the evil spirits. This is the reason that the Lord Jesus, before charging the disciples to go out to disciple the nations, told them that all authority had been given to Him in heaven and on earth. We go out not just to preach the gospel; we go out to command the demons to leave and to command people to believe.</p>
<p>Be trained in this way. Do not forget that you are not going out alone. You are going out with Him. Actually, He is going out with you (Matt. 28:20). Be aggressive and bold in the spirit to obey the Lord&rsquo;s command to go and disciple the nations. Do not leave any ground to the enemy. Always be aggressive and on the offensive. Do not be defensive. Do not invite or take a negative thought. Even if the situation is very dark, you should say: &ldquo;I do not believe the darkness. The darkness is a lie. With me there is no darkness. Wherever I am, there must be light.&rdquo; This should not be your outward preaching but your inward practicing. While you are talking to sinners, you have to practice in this way. Take the food-to-go, and have the confidence that this is the best food and that everyone would take it.</p>
<p>Throughout our many years in this work, both in the Far East and in the United States, our going out sometimes produced little result. However, since we have begun to go out in the new way of knocking on doors to establish home meetings, many people have opened to us. When we do this, we exercise the Lord&rsquo;s authority. This is a strong proof that what we are undertaking is something of the Lord. Do not care about losing your face. When you speak, speak with faith and boldness.</p>
<p>You must go with the food-to-go. You must go with the gospel. You must go with believing. You must go baptizing. Go, believing that everyone would take what you would offer. You must have the belief. When you shoot a basketball, you must have the faith that it will go in the basket. If you are doubting, the ball probably will not enter the basket. When you are doubting, the ball will also &ldquo;doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may love the Lord and His recovery, yet could we be for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and not care to see the increase and spread of the church? Forget about inviting others to your meeting. The way to have the increase and spread is by going to knock on doors, door-to-door, with boldness, with faith, and full of confidence. A person who would go in this way will always convince people.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The New Way to Carry Out the Increase and Spread of the Church &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
