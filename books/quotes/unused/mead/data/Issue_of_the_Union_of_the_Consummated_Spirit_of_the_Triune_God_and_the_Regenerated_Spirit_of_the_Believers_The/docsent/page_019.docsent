   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS Scripture Reading: Eph 4:3-6 OUTLINE The issue of the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of the believers is the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The building up of the Body of Christ is not of human work, nor is it the forming together of a group of people by man's natural way; hence, it has absolutely nothing to do with man's work, effort, ways, ideas, moral teachings, philosophy, or any religious system or activities.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The building up of the Body of Christ is the constitution, in the aforementioned two spirits, of the processed and consummated Triune God with a group of tripartite men whom He has redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, transformed, and conformed to His image.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This constitution is constituted with: The believers who are redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed by God as its outward framework.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The processed and consummated Triune God as its inward element: The Father of the Triune God is the source of the inward element.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Son of the Triune God is the inward element itself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Spirit of the Triune God is the essence of the inward element Eph 4:4-6.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All three are dispensed, transfused, and built into God's redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That they and the redeeming and transforming God may be constituted into one entity as the organic Body of Christ, being God yet man and man yet God Eph 4:3-4a.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such a constitution of divinity with humanity is uniquely one in the universe; it should not and cannot be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This constitution is the union and mingling of God and man: divinity constituted into humanity to be man's dwelling place and humanity built into divinity to be God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the harvest of the Triune God's selection in eternity and of the works of His old creation, redemption, and new creation in time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In such a great achievement, the operating Triune God is the Benefactor, and the tripartite men who respond to His operation are the beneficiaries; both are also the satisfied enjoyers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is God's eternal heart's desire and His ultimate purpose; this is also something that the tripartite men can never think of nor hope and ask for.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the Triune God's anticipated multiplication and His expected increase.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is something beyond the imagination of all the religionists and philosophers, yet we who are graced by God can actually taste it and participate in it for eternity.</S>
