   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just as our human life has its totality and a living person is the totality of the human life, so also the eternal life has its totality and the totality of the divine life is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The eternal life eventually will be the New Jerusalem.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Father is the fountain as the source, Christ the Son is the spring, and the Spirit is the flowing river, and this flowing issues in the eternal life, which is the New Jerusalem as the destination of the flowing Triune God.</S>
