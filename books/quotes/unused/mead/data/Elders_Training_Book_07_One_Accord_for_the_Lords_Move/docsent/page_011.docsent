   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONE IN TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 4:17, 7:17 and 16:1 indicates that Paul taught all the churches the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All the churches were under one teaching, the teaching of the apostles Acts 2:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whatever I have been teaching is the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I do not desire to pass on anything of myself, but whatever I have ministered is altogether according to the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I do not have my own teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>My teaching is a part of the apostles teaching, the unique teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The three thousand who were added to the church on the day of Pentecost continued steadfastly in the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul carried on the same teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord s word in John 16 tells us that He would have more to speak when He came back as the Spirit of reality vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The teaching of the apostles was completed by Paul s teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul told us clearly in Colossians 1:25 that his ministry was to complete the word of God, which means to complete the teaching of the apostles, to complete the revelation of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I had no part in this completion work so I do not add anything to the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I must testify that the Lord has given me many visions Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>1:1; Acts 2:17 , but not visions like those of Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The visions I have received all come from the printed pages of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I reject, condemn, and even curse any teaching that is not from or that is not according to these printed pages.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I only take whatever is revealed in the Bible, so whatever I minister is not my teaching, but the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The apostles do not include me because the teaching of the apostles, who gave the complete revelation of God, has been fully completed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After the final writing of John the Apostle, the book of Revelation, the entire divine revelation had been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is in this final book that the Lord through John testifies concerning the words of this book: If anyone adds to them, God shall add to him the plagues which are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city, which are written in this book" Rev 22:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only the book of Revelation declares this because this was the Lord Jesus declaration at the very end of His holy, divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After its completion, the Lord Jesus, the One who was qualified to open the scroll of the new covenant Rev 5:4-5 , declares that this is the end. After the book of Revelation, no one has any position to add anything or to take away anything, because the divine revelation has been fully finished and completed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today very few would add something to the revelation, but many are deducting something.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Too many deductions have transpired already.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some cut off any portion of the Word that does not fit their understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No doubt, they will suffer loss 1 Cor 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They will lose the participation in the tree of life and in the blessing of the eternal, holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I dare not add anything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Please do not think I am passing on my teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I dare not have any teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am not teaching anything of my thought or my invention.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am teaching the Bible; I am teaching the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul instructed the church in Corinth to do what he had directed the churches of Galatia to do 1 Cor 16:1 , so all the churches under Paul s ministry were one in the apostles teaching Acts 2:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Romans 16:17 tells us that some make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The teaching which you have learned is the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since I came to the United States, whatever I have ministered to you has been something of the apostles teaching, and you have to learn of this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Be cautious of anyone who would cause you to practice in a way that is contrary to the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 there are two main points: 1 do not teach differently; 2 the economy of God in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach differently.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In other words, do not teach anything that differs from the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The apostles teaching is not the teaching on a particular doctrine like baptism by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a little part of the apostles teaching, but it is not the main thing, the central lane.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The main thing, the central lane, of the apostles teaching is God s economy, not the economy of the Old Testament of the law but God s economy in faith, His New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The constituents of God s New Testament economy are the very Person of Christ, the very redemptive work of Christ, and the very reproduction of Christ and His work, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I did not come to you to teach you baptism by immersion, tongue-speaking, healing, types, or prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many of you can testify that when I touch typology and prophecy, I touch them with much stress on Christ, on His redemptive work, and on His church, the Body, as the reproduction of His being and His work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These are the categories of all my teachings throughout the years.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Any stress or emphasis on things other than these major items in the central lane have to be considered as different teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you read 1 Timothy 1 carefully, you can realize that what was condemned by the apostle as different teachings was not altogether heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They taught things from the Old Testament such as genealogies v. 4 and the law given by God to Moses vv.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The law is not heresy, but to teach the law is a different teaching from the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Different teachings stress something other than Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To be one in teaching is to be uniquely one in the teaching of the apostles, not in the minor things such as the presbytery, the gifts, baptism by immersion, foot washing, head covering, or the ordinances of the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should not stress things which are not so crucial to the central lane of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not ignore them, but if we are taking care of the apostles teaching, they should not be the emphasis of our teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>First Timothy 6:3 says, If anyone teaches differently and does not consent to healthy words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the teaching which is according to godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The healthy words are those of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Has the Lord Jesus ever stressed baptism by immersion?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Has He ever stressed healing?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Has He ever stressed tongue-speaking, gifts, presbytery, foot washing, or head covering?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The answer to these questions is no. John 14 17 and Matthew 5 7 and 24 25 are the stress of the Lord s teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>These are the healthy words of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If anyone of us would stress something based upon the Scripture, yet other than what the Lord stressed, that would be a different teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>First Timothy 6:3 also refers to the teaching according to godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the teaching of the apostles after the Lord s ascension, which is mainly Paul s teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>First Timothy 3:16 tells us that the great mystery of godliness is God manifested in the flesh, which is first Christ and then the church as the continuation of Christ s manifestation of God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The teaching which is according to godliness, the teaching of the Apostle Paul, is altogether regarding the church as the great mystery of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>First Timothy 6:3 covers the Lord s words in the four Gospels plus all that He has been speaking since His ascension through His apostles from Acts through Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we are teaching things other than what the New Testament stresses, we are teaching differently, and it will be hard for us to be really one.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we have many different teachings, we will also have many different practices resulting in division.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It would then be impossible to have the one accord, the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In Ephesians 4:13-14 the wind of teaching and the oneness of the faith are mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The faith is the contents of the complete gospel according to God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Whatever the Lord spoke in the four Gospels and whatever He continued to speak in the Acts and in the Epistles through the apostles is the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The very contents of the New Testament Bible is the very contents of God s New Testament economy as the faith in which we have our belief.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We all need to arrive at this faith, so we should not stress the different winds of different teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If you would be carried about by the winds of teaching, this indicates that you are still a babe according to Ephesians 4:14.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We are not for the teachings which can be considered as winds, but we are for the oneness of the unique faith which is the very contents of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>To have different teachings in the Lord s recovery is altogether not authentic.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have to keep the principle of one teaching, not my teaching nor your teaching but the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Our one teaching has to be the teaching which is our faith, the very contents of which are the New Testament Bible, the very constituents of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is the teaching we should pass on, and this is the teaching all the churches should take and should remain in. By this way we surely can be one in one teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We will not carry out anything different which would produce different divisions.</S>
