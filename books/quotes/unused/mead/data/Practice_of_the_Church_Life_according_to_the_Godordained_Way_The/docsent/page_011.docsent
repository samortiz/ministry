   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"A King," "the Philosophy of a King"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Third, one of the dissenters said that among us there is the problem of "a king."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He also said that there is the problem of "the philosophy of a king" see The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion, published by Living Stream Ministry, pages 100-101 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that in their conspiracy the dissenting ones wanted to put down the philosophy of a king.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In using the term "the philosophy of a king," the dissenters mean that in the recovery there is a strong teaching concerning a definite leader among us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word philosophy here means logic or teaching, and the king here refers to a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the New Testament, in one sense, there is the philosophy, or teaching, of a definite leader among God's people, and in another sense, there is not such a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Of the twenty-seven books in the New Testament, fourteen were written by the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In his Epistles he was very strong to emphasize the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 1 Corinthians 4:16, 11:1, and Philippians 3:17, Paul entreated the saints to imitate him because he imitated Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Hebrews 13:17 he charged the believers to "obey the ones leading you and submit to them."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verses such as these indicate that there is teaching in the New Testament concerning the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, neither the New Testament nor my ministry teaches anyone to be a king.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although the apostle Paul taught strongly concerning leadership, in 2 Corinthians 4:5 he said that the apostles preached Christ Jesus as Lord, and themselves as the believers' slaves for Jesus' sake.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that we are not kings but are slaves to serve the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In speaking of "a king," no doubt the dissenting ones are referring to me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have been with the saints and the churches in the United States for more than thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To whom have I been a king?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such a statement concerning me is a reviling, not merely a defamation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Control of the Churches</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>by the Living Stream Ministry Office</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Fourth, the dissenters have accused the Living Stream Ministry office of controlling the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But I would ask, which church has the office controlled?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They say that the office gave orders to the churches, commanding the churches to do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, this kind of accusation is false.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Living Stream Ministry office serves hundreds of churches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The office does not give orders to the churches, but it does ask the churches to coordinate with the office.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For instance, in printing our books, it is difficult to decide how many copies we should print.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the initial years we did not have a proper way to make this decision; consequently, we printed more copies of some of the books than were needed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, the office asked the churches to submit standing orders for books and tapes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This has been a great help to the office.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sometimes, when a church has not submitted its standing order, the office asks the church to turn in its order.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is not the issuing of a command to that church but merely an asking of that church for its cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The ministry office has also had to coordinate among the churches the procedure for the distribution and viewing of the video tapes of the semiannual trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is mainly concerning these kinds of things that the office has communicated with the churches to coordinate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Besides these things, I cannot find any evidence that the Living Stream office controls any church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After hearing such an accusation, I asked any church who felt that they were under the control of the office to inform me of this, but to this date no church has confirmed this accusation.</S>
