   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRAY-READING THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Greek, the antecedent of which in verse 17 is the Spirit, not the sword.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This indicates that the Spirit is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Both the Spirit and the word are Christ 2 Cor 3:17; Rev 19:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to receive the word of God by means of all prayer and petition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to verses 17 and 18, we are to take the word of God by means of all prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These verses indicate that we may take the word by pray-reading, that is, by praying with the words of Scripture and over them, using the words of the Bible as our prayer to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The term pray-reading is not found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, the fact of pray-reading is according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Just as the Bible reveals the fact that God is triune, even though the word Trinity is not found in the Scriptures, so the Bible contains the fact of pray-reading, even though this term is not actually used.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I can testify that to pray-read the word is better, higher, richer, and fuller than simply to read it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Day by day I am watered, filled, satisfied, enlivened, strengthened, nourished, and cherished through pray-reading the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, by pray-reading I am sanctified, purified, and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although I certainly would not impose pray-reading on others, I would never give it up.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is too sweet, too good.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Simply by praying over John 1:1, for example, I am nourished, filled, and satisfied in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>PRAYING AT EVERY TIME IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we receive the word by means of all prayer and petition, we should pray at every time in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The spirit in verse 18 is our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, this spirit is the mingled spirit, our spirit mingled with God s Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whenever we pray as a means of taking in the word, we need to be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The spirit is the proper organ for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we have pointed out many times, we can be in spirit simply by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus from deep within.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we call O Lord Jesus, we turn from the vanity of the mind to the spirit of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How sweet and enjoyable it is to call on the Lord Jesus in spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By praying in spirit we apply Christ as the whole armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we take the word by praying in spirit, we spontaneously contact Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Immediately, our praying and reading become living, and we are empowered by Christ and covered with Him as our armor.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, we have the realization that we are in the Body and that Christ with all that He is and has is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this way we apply Him as the all-inclusive armor.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>NOT FIGHTING BUT ENJOYING</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we are in the Body, we actually do not carry on the spiritual warfare; we simply enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead of struggling in the battle, the battle becomes an enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because we pray in spirit to apply all the aspects of Christ as the armor, spiritual fighting becomes an enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We enjoy Christ as the reality that girds us and as the righteousness that covers and protects our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, we enjoy Him as the firm foundation of the gospel of peace and as our shield of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ Himself is faith to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As Hebrews 12:2 says, He is the Author and Perfecter of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With Christ as our shield, we are defended from the flaming darts of the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Moreover, we enjoy Christ as the helmet of salvation that covers our head, and also as the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Psalm 23:5 says, Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This indicates that the battlefield is a place of feasting.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We feast in the presence of the enemy, enjoying Christ as reality, righteousness, peace, faith, salvation, and as the living word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We enjoy Him and apply Him by praying in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE KILLING POWER OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have pointed out that by pray-reading we take the word of God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Usually when we speak of taking the word of God into us, we think of the word as nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, in Ephesians 6 the emphasis is not on the nourishing word, but on the killing word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The nourishing word is for our building up, whereas the killing word deals with the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this context, we should pray-read the word not mainly to receive nourishment, but primarily to experience the sword as the killing instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more we pray-read the word, the more we should experience the killing power of the word.</S>
