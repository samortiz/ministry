   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SUBTLETY OF THE ENEMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN OPPOSING THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once we see the vision of Christ, we are qualified to see the vision of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, with the matter of the church, you may sense that there is a cost and that you will have to pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you are not willing to pay the price, you may go back to the vision of Christ and say, "It is sufficient that we know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not talk about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us speak to others concerning Christ, telling them what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let us preach Christ to sinners and let us minister Christ to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is enough that we talk about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no need for us to talk about the church."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This kind of speaking is subtle; it is a sugar-coated excuse for not paying the price to practice the church life on the ground of the unique unity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At this juncture let us consider the Lord's word to Peter in Matthew 16.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Immediately after Peter declared concerning the Lord Jesus, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God," He said to him, "Upon this rock I will build My church" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>16, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that knowing Christ and experiencing Christ are for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today some condemn us, saying that we are too much for the church, that we make the church greater than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some go so far as to say that we make the church an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This argument is subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Oh, the subtlety of the enemy!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ died on the cross for the church Eph 5:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we are too much for the church, Christ was the first one to be too much.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>LOSING THE SELF FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After we have seen the vision of the church, the Lord will open our eyes to see the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We will see that we need to be built up in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are not just members of the church; we are members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For the Body we must not only pay a price we must lose the self.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By the Lord's mercy I can testify that from the time I first began to meet on the proper ground more than thirty years ago, I have not changed in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, after coming to this ground, by the Lord's mercy I began to realize and practice the Body, and I am still practicing the Body today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have not moved from this ground, and I have not changed my position on this ground.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You may not change in the matter of the ground, but you may change your position on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As an illustration let us suppose that various kinds of material are brought to a certain lot, or site, as the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All these materials are now on the same ground.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, it is possible for them to remain on the building site and yet have a change of position on that site.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In like manner, we have been brought to the proper ground of the church and on this ground we are practicing the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Perhaps a "soft" brother is put together with a "hard" brother.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The "soft" one may cry out to the Lord, saying, "Lord, I cannot stand being with this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I want to have a change."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This brother is seeking a change not of the ground but a change of position on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He remains on the ground, but he wants a change of relationship on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the situation with many in the church life, and it may be your situation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You have not changed concerning the ground, but you may have changed in position, in relationship, again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some of today's Christians are wandering among the denominations, among different grounds.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At present they are meeting with a particular group, but tomorrow they may begin to meet with a different group.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Others are not wandering among different grounds, but they are wandering in their position on the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This indicates that with them there is a lack of building.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They have not been built up with others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But once we have been built up, just as the materials in a house or a meeting hall cannot change their position, so we will not be able to change our position.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are fixed in place and can no longer wander from one position to another.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Why is it so difficult for us to be built up?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The difficulty is the self.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It does not matter whether the self is good or bad, pleasant or ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As long as there is the self, there cannot be any building.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For instance, some brothers have a dominating self, and because of this dominating self they cannot go along with others in doing things for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No matter what the situation may be, these brothers must be the dominating ones.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How, then, can they have the building?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In order for them to be built up with others, the self must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The problem is not their strong character; it is their dominating self.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It may be right for them to be strong, but they should not dominate others.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A person who is built up with others may be very strong, but he is properly related to others and constantly has fellowship with others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A marble column in a building is strong, but it is related to others.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is strong, but it does not dominate.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The situation is the same with a strong brother who has been built up with others in the Body.</S>
