   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MEETING CHRIST IN RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As long as we are not in resurrection, we cannot experience Christ, because Christ today is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even if you are a Christian, you cannot experience Christ if you remain in the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But when you are willing to be conformed to Christ's death and are spontaneously brought into resurrection, you will meet Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here, in resurrection, Christ becomes our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Take being nice as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The sisters are usually very nice.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This niceness, however, is natural.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When some sisters hear this, they may decide to no longer be nice.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But to do that is to be sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The way is neither to be nice nor to not be nice; it is to be conformed to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whoever we are, whether we are young, middle-aged, or elderly, we all need to be conformed to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even the teenagers need to be put into the mold of Christ's death and conformed to it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we are not conformed to the death of Christ, we simply cannot experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In speaking of the resurrection in verse 11, Paul specifically speaks of the out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that Paul wanted to be in the outstanding resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He did not simply want to graduate; he wanted to be the valedictorian, an outstanding graduate.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul desired this because he realized that by this outstanding resurrection he was experiencing Christ, was partaking of Him, and was enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here in this resurrection Christ was truly the life-giving Spirit to him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In our daily living we need to learn to practice one thing: To check whether we are conformed to the death of Christ before doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not say that a certain thing is good, scriptural, spiritual, or heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The thing you plan to do may be very heavenly or spiritual, but in doing it you may not be heavenly or spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not a matter of how we do a certain thing; it is a matter of who is doing it, we or Christ, the natural life or the resurrected life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even singing a hymn to God is wrong if we sing it in the natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our singing, and our praises also, must be in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not question whether something is good or bad, right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead, check whether or not you are conformed to the death of Christ in doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you are being conformed to His death, you will be in resurrection, and in resurrection you will meet Christ, experience Christ, and enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ today is the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you are not in resurrection, you need to repent that you may be brought into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then in resurrection you will meet Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because Christians do not realize this, they exert very little influence on the people around them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But a Christian who is in the process of resurrection should influence others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today's Christians have so little influence.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We, however, must not be a continuation of today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must be known by our experience of being conformed to Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to forget everything ethical or religious and concentrate on practicing being conformed to the death of Christ, so that by any means we may attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I can testify that day after day I experience Christ and enjoy Christ in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the message of the book of Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We shall continue to be processed into resurrection until our whole being is resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we shall simply need to wait for our body to be redeemed, that is, for our body to be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This was Paul's meaning in Philippians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was in the process of being resurrected by being conformed to the death of Christ.</S>
