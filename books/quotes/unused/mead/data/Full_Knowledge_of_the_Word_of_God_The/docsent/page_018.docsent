   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Brethren told us that in order to interpret these prophecies, one must maintain two governing principles.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First, in Daniel 2 there is a great image, the head of which is of fine gold; the arms, of silver; the belly, of brass; the legs, of iron; and the feet, partly of iron and partly of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It also has ten toes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This image represents the history of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Babylon is represented by the golden head, Medo-Persia by the arms, Alexander's Greece by the brass belly, and the Eastern and Western Roman Empires by the two iron legs.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With the passing of the Roman Empire, the idea of democracy began to spread.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The French Revolution represents the coming of clay, when kings could no longer practice totalitarianism.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Gold, silver, brass, and iron are metals which signify emperors.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Clay signifies the people, the common man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But clay contains iron, which is stronger than clay.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is today's situation, partly of iron and partly of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although democracy has been promoted, the practices of dictatorship and totalitarianism still prevail.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This great image is the principle by which the Bible explains the world situation, and we cannot go beyond it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The second principle is the matter of the seventy weeks in Daniel 9.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One week represents seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Seventy weeks are four hundred ninety years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first sixty-nine weeks, totaling four hundred eighty-three years, began from the day Artaxerxes the king commanded the rebuilding of Jerusalem and ended with the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to history, the day of the Lord Jesus' crucifixion was exactly the last day of the four hundred eighty-three years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In summary, we must have the great image in Daniel 2 and the seventy weeks in Daniel 9 as two lines; then we can properly interpret the prophecies of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Two Opposing Schools</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In addition, there are also two theological schools.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One is the Calvinist school of predestination, which I call the revelation of God's predestination.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Calvin saw that our salvation was not initiated by ourselves, but rather that we have been selected and predestinated by God before the foundation of the world Eph 1:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This predestination is eternal and unchangeable; therefore, the saved ones will never perish.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the other hand, those of the Arminian school believe that whether we are saved eternally or not depends upon ourselves, that is, that we are responsible for our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, we must do our best to walk according to God's will, or else we may still perish.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I call this "elevator salvation": when we are saved we are up; when we sin we are down.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Baptist church accepts Calvin's revelation of God's predestination, and so do the Presbyterians.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Pentecostals, holiness groups, and the Assemblies of God are mostly Arminian in that they emphasize human responsibility and ignore God's selection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Calvin saw the revelation of God's predestination, and this is right.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These two schools are always in conflict with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Arminian doctrine is mainly based upon the five warnings recorded in Hebrews and the warnings given by the Lord Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, if we fail to be a faithful servant, when the Master comes back, we will be punished and cast into outer darkness, where there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth Matt 24:45-51; 25:14-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Based upon these verses, they claim that even a saved one can perish.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Later, people like Govett, Panton, and Pember rose up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Their doctrine stands between the revelation of God's predestination and the teaching of human responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They saw the truth concerning the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They said that after being saved, we are saved forever and will never perish.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But we must follow the Lord faithfully; then when the Lord comes back, we will receive the kingdom as a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are not faithful, we will not be able to enter the kingdom and we will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is based on 1 Corinthians 3, which says that we should be careful about how we build vv.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>10-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Are we building with gold, silver, and precious stones, or are we building with wood, grass, and stubble?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we build with gold, silver, and precious stones, when the Lord comes back, we will be rewarded in addition to our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the other hand, if we build with wood, grass, and stubble, our work will be burned by the fire of judgment, and we will suffer loss but not eternal perdition: "But he shall be saved, yet so as through fire" 1 Cor 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many proofs in the New Testament concerning the kingdom reward and punishment were initially seen by Govett and Panton.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What I have mentioned thus far is not my imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I am also a student of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have studied this book for sixty years; this is why I am able to explain it to you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Bible expositors of the past can be grouped into these several schools.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have studied them and would like to present them to you for your learning.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we began to expound the Bible, we profited a great deal from the saints before us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have seen that the highest theology is that held by the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once you have their theology, you can put aside all the others.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What I have said is based on this high theology.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Brothers and sisters, all that I have spoken to you describes the way of studying the Bible which we have learned during the past sixty years.</S>
