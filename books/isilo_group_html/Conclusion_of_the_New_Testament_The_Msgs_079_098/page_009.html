THE SEVEN SPIRITS</h2><p>In the book of Revelation the Spirit is called the seven Spirits (1:4; 4:5; 5:6), the sevenfold intensified Spirit to counteract the degradation of the church. The seven Spirits in Revelation 1:4 undoubtedly are the Spirit of God because They are ranked among the Triune God. As seven is the number for completion in God&#8217;s operation, so the seven Spirits must be for God&#8217;s move on earth. In substance and existence God&#8217;s Spirit is one. In the intensified function and work of God&#8217;s operation His Spirit is sevenfold. It is like the lampstand in Zechariah 4:2. In existence it is one lampstand, but in function it is seven lamps. At the time the book of Revelation was written, the church had become degraded, and the age was dark. Therefore, the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God was needed for God&#8217;s move on earth.<p>In Matthew 28:19 the sequence of the Triune God is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. But in Revelation 1:4 and 5 the sequence is changed. The seven Spirits of God are listed in the second place instead of the third. This reveals the importance of the intensified function of the sevenfold Spirit of God. This point is confirmed by the repeated emphasis on the Spirit&#8217;s speaking in 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 14:13; and 22:17.<p>The title &#8220;the seven Spirits&#8221; indicates that the Spirit has been intensified sevenfold. This Spirit intensifies all the elements of the Spirit: divinity, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, reality, life, and grace.<p>Revelation 4:5 says, &#8220;Out of the throne come forth lightnings and voices and thunders; and seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.&#8221; The seven lamps here refer to the seven lamps of the lampstand in Exodus 25:37 and the seven lamps of the lampstand in Zechariah 4:2. The seven lamps of fire which are the seven Spirits of God signify the enlightening and searching of the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God. In Exodus 25 and Zechariah 4 the seven lamps, signifying the enlightening of the Spirit of God in God&#8217;s move, are for God&#8217;s building, either for the tabernacle or the rebuilding of the temple. Here the seven lamps are for God&#8217;s judgment, which will issue also in God&#8217;s building-the building of the New Jerusalem.<p>Revelation 5:6 says, &#8220;I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.&#8221; Eyes are for observing and searching. Christ as the redeeming Lamb has seven observing and searching eyes for executing God&#8217;s judgment upon the universe to fulfill God&#8217;s eternal purpose, which will consummate in the building up of the New Jerusalem. Therefore, in Zechariah 3:9 He is prophesied as the stone, which is the topstone (Zech. 4:7), with seven eyes for God&#8217;s building. These seven eyes are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth, running &#8220;to and fro through the whole earth&#8221; (Zech. 4:10).<p>The seven Spirits as the seven eyes of the Lamb are also for transfusing. When Christ looks at us with His seven eyes, these eyes, which are the seven Spirits, will transfuse Christ&#8217;s element into us. Whereas the seven Spirits as the seven lamps of burning fire are for enlightening and burning, the seven Spirits as the seven eyes of the Lamb are for observing, searching, and transfusing. As the Lord enlightens and judges us, He looks at us, and through the seven Spirits as His eyes He transfuses Himself into us for our transformation.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 079-098) &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
