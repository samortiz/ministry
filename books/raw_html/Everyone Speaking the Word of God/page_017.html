</ol>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING FOR THE OPENING AND<br />
SPREADING OF THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>In this message we come to the point of the word of God increasing, multiplying, and prevailing. First, we need to pray for the word of God, asking God to open a door for His word. The churches on the whole island of Taiwan really need to receive this burden and pray for this matter. Not only do the unbelievers need a door to be opened among them; even many Christians in the denominations, especially those in the Catholic Church, need God to open a door among them, because they themselves have closed the door. Because they lack enlightenment, they have fallen into darkness, thinking that they already know the truth but not actually understanding it. Today the Lord has opened His Word not for us only, but for all the Christians, even for the people of the whole world. We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, open the door for us.&rdquo; Paul asked the believers to pray &ldquo;that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ&rdquo; (Col. 4:3).</p>
<p>Second, Paul said, &ldquo;Pray concerning us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified&rdquo; (2 Thes. 3:1). Running is a matter of the way. Once the door is opened, there is still the need to have a way. Ordinarily, people walk on the way first and then go through the door. But according to the Bible, we first must go through the door, and then we can walk on the way (Matt. 7:14). As soon as the door is opened, the way is wide open to let the word of God run and be glorified.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD OF GOD INCREASING AND MULTIPLYING</h2>
<p>Acts 12:24 says, &ldquo;The word of God grew and multiplied.&rdquo; This growth and multiplication of the word took place in three stages in the book of Acts. The first stage was during the ministry of Peter. During this time Acts 6:7 says that &ldquo;the word of God grew.&rdquo; The second stage was at the time when Peter&rsquo;s ministry was coming to an end. Although Peter was put into prison, God released him from that prison, and as a result &ldquo;the word of God grew and multiplied&rdquo; (Acts 12:24). The last stage was in Paul&rsquo;s ministry. While Paul was in Ephesus, he prevailed greatly in the struggle for the truth. Therefore, Acts 19:20 says, &ldquo;So the word of the Lord grew mightily and was strong.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD OF GOD PREVAILING</h2>
<p>In Revelation 19 the Lord Jesus coming down out of heaven appears as a general fighting a battle. He is riding on a white horse, and His name is called &ldquo;The Word of God&rdquo; (Rev. 19:11, 13). The word of God that we speak today is the Lord Jesus. Eventually, as we continue to speak, our speaking will cause the Lord Jesus to come forth. When the Lord comes, He comes as a warrior, a general. On His garment and on His thigh the name &ldquo;King of kings and Lord of lords&rdquo; is written (Rev. 19:16). He is fighting for His kingdom.</p>
