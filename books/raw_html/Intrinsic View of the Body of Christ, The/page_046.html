<P>There are also those from within who may be considered as "indoor barking dogs." One of them may ask you where you meet. Then he may ask you if you know a certain brother there. When you say that you do, he will begin to tell you many things about this brother. Then when you go to your next meeting and see this brother, the sight of his face will quench you. Your feeling and attitude toward him will have been affected, and your oneness with him will have been damaged.</P><P>There is much barking today to distract us from the oneness of the Body of Christ. Much of this barking comes from the religious world. We pointed out previously that the saints who have gone to Russia for the Lord's move have seen that the Russian Orthodox tradition still remains there. Some refused to be baptized after they received the Lord because they had been baptized when they were infants. Although religion was cut off in Russia by Lenin more than seventy years ago, the "barking" of traditional religion still remains. This barking can distract the proper, normal Christians from the way of the oneness of the Body. On our Christian way, there is much barking to distract us.</P><P>Sometimes the wives can speak things to distract their husbands. A wife may say, "In the past we used to attend every meeting. But now I don't like to go to the church meetings too often." The husband then may ask, "Dear, what is the reason?" She may then say that two of the elders are not very nice and that she does not like to see them. Such speaking will spontaneously, secretly, and hiddenly distract her husband. By receiving this speaking, her husband will be cooled down in his feeling toward the church.</P><P>How can we overcome all of this barking? The invisible vision keeps us. Paul told King Agrippa, "I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision" (Acts 26:19). Paul did not disobey the heavenly vision which he had received. Vision keeps us. Vision strengthens us. The barking cannot affect us because we have seen something so real. I hope that all of us will see a vision of the real oneness in this universe. If we see such a vision, we will not be distracted by anything. We will not be distracted by the division and confusion in Christianity. We will only care for what we have seen in the trance. Through these messages, the Lord has brought us into a trance. In this trance, we have seen the oneness in reality. We see that we have to remain in this oneness because we were born into it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Oneness in Practicality</H2><P>The other aspect of the oneness is the oneness in practicality. All of the believers in Christ were born into the oneness of reality, but we all need to go on until we arrive at the oneness in practicality.</P>
