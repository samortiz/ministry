<P>The first item in the history of the universe is God; the second item is the created universe, and the third item is man. The fourth item is the mingling of the first and the third items. Jesus Christ is the mingling of God and man. The Bible in Isaiah 9:6 says that He is wonderful. This verse also says that a child is born to us and a son is given to us, yet His name is called the eternal Father. Isaiah 7:14 says that a virgin will conceive and bear a son, and she will call His name Immanuel. These verses show that the Son is the Father and that the Child is God. Immanuel means God with us. Jesus is God with us. He is God and He is also God incarnated to dwell among us.</P><P>This One is God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;and this One is also a man. This man is wonderful in what He is, wonderful in His Being. Jesus is a wonder in the universe because He is God the Father, God the Son, God the Spirit, and also a man. Is He not a wonder? He is the fourth major item in the history of the universe.</P><P>The fifth item is Christ's death. His death was a joint venture. God the Father, God the Son, God the Spirit, and man were all involved in the death of Christ. They all were joined in a joint venture to accomplish redemption. There is a group of stars in the universe in the form of a cross, which is called the Southern Cross. Jessie Penn-Lewis, in her speaking about the cross of Christ, referred to this group of stars. This shows that Christ's death is a great thing in the universe.</P><P>The sixth major item in the history of the universe is the resurrection of Christ. The principle of resurrection is involved with all kinds of living things. In the book of Isaiah, the kingly family of David was likened to a big tree. One day this big tree was cut down to the very root. Only a short stem was left. Isaiah 11:1 says, "Then a twig will come forth from the stem of Jesse,/And a branch from his roots will bear fruit." Christ as a twig came out of the stem of Jesse. This twig eventually became a branch. Here we can see the principle of resurrection. Christ's coming was the resurrection of the kingly family of David. The principle of resurrection can also be seen in nature. When a seed is sown into the earth, it dies and then it rises up. This is resurrection. The New Testament tells us that Christ rose up from the dead.</P>
