   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PROVED BY MIRACLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us examine some of the deeds of Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew 11:2 and 3 say, "Now when John heard in the prison of the works of the Christ, he sent word through his disciples and said to Him, Are You the Coming One, or should we expect another?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John wanted to make sure that Jesus was the Christ sent from God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If He was not, John would wait for another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verses 4 and 5 say, "And Jesus answered and said to them, Go, report to John the things that you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; and the dead are raised and the poor have the gospel announced to them."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jesus answered neither "yes" nor "no."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He only asked the messenger to tell John of the things heard and seen.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He wanted John to think about them and decide for himself if Jesus was the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jesus proved His divinity by the miracles He performed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here is a man who accomplished things that are impossible for human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You cannot help but confess that He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>John 7:31 says, "But many out of the crowd believed into Him and said, Will the Christ, when He comes, do more signs than this man has done?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many people testified that He performed all kinds of miracles which no man could do.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>CLAIM TO DIVINITY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John 10:24 says, "The Jews therefore surrounded Him and said to Him, How long will you hold our soul in suspense?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the one hand, the Jews hardened their hearts and refused to acknowledge His divinity, and on the other hand, they were puzzled by the many supernatural miracles that He performed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They gathered around Him and pressed for an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is one thing in which Jesus never gave in: His claim to divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He performed what mortals could not.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These acts testify to His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He told the people clearly, "The works which I do in My Father's name, these testify concerning Me" v. 25 . On the one hand, He made His claim, and on the other hand, He performed miracles to justify His claim.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>BELIEVE HIM FOR HIS WORKS' SAKE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In John 14:11 He said to His disciples, "Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the same as saying that He is the invisible Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"But if not, believe because of the works themselves."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If He had not done anything impossible, this word would have had no value at all.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If He had not performed any extraordinary acts, they would have asked back, "What works have You done?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do not know what You are talking about."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the disciples knew of the acts He did.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All these acts prove that He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>HE SHOWED WHAT GOD IS</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to check Jesus of Nazareth against a fifth qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If He is God, He has to show us what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Is He kind, or is He severe?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Is He gentle, or is He fierce?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What kind of a God do we have?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As a matter of fact, Jesus did show us what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a most wonderful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The eternal, invisible God is now seen by us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is no need to conjure up an untouchable and far transcendent God or imagine what He is like; He has revealed Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He has dwelt in our midst and walked among us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Jesus of Nazareth is the very God dwelling among and with man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He has manifested God's nature and attributes to us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is no need to search for God anymore because He has revealed Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our mentality is too limited.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our hands are too short, and our viewpoint too narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we were left to ourselves to study and search for God, we could only conclude that He is the unknown One.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now we know that God desires to reveal Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In fact, He has revealed Himself to us already.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>GOD HAVING SPOKEN IN HIS SON</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have said that the two means whereby God communicates with us are the written and spoken language.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For this reason, the Bible and Jesus of Nazareth are the two indispensable factors in our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When you take away either one, God becomes the gravest problem in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hebrews 1:1 says, "God, having spoken of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These speakings constitute the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"Has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son" v. 2 . This is Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whoever is in Christ now may know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To have heard the words of Jesus of Nazareth is to have heard the words of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Dear reader, what is your attitude towards Jesus of Nazareth?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thomas confessed, "My Lord and my God!"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>John 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Peter proclaimed, "You are..the Son of the living God!"</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Matt 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Martha said, "I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God" John 11:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even a Roman centurion exclaimed at the sight of Jesus hanging on the cross, "Truly this was the Son of God" Matt 27:54b .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I hope you will make the same confession.</S>
