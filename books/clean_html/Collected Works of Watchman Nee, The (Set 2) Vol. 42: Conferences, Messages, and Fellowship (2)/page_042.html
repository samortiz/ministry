<h2 class="head2">No Condemnation in Christ</h2><p>We have to read two more verses. Romans 8:1-2 says, "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." These two verses describe the kind of people who are not under condemnation. We think that those who have repented, who are righteous, and who are doing good are not condemned. But God says that those who are in Christ are not condemned. As long as a person is in Christ, that is good enough; there is no need to do anything anymore. Those who are in Christ are not condemned. There is no other condition. Why is a person no longer condemned when he is in Christ? It is because when Christ was judged on the cross, he was judged in Christ as well. The judgment that Christ went through became his judgment. Christ's experience on the cross became his experience. In Christ we are no longer condemned. The words no longer imply that there is not a second time. Christ was judged and condemned on the cross. We are in Christ, and Christ has borne our judgment. This is good enough, and there cannot be any further condemnation in Adam. If I borrow one hundred dollars and return it later, my creditor cannot demand one hundred dollars any longer. Since we have been terminated on Christ's cross once, we have been judged already, and now there is no condemnation to those who are in Christ.</p><p>I am not as bold as others may think. I used to think about what would happen to me if I were to go to hell. A few times when I was sick, I feared for what would happen if I went to hell then. Today I believe that God has judged and punished me once and for all in Christ. I am very happy today, because I am no longer condemned in Christ. Brother Lui is a businessman. If anyone owes him money, and he collects what is owed at the end of the year, he would not go and ask for more money later. This is what all honest people do in this world. Thank God that our debt has been paid by Christ on the cross, and God can no longer come to us for payment.</p><h2 class="head2">No Longer Impotent in Christ</h2><p>Those who borrow feel intimated by their creditors, and those who have not borrowed can be afraid to borrow. Suppose you only earned one dollar a month, and the dollar is only good for one meal. What can you do except borrow? This is like a believer who realizes that his sins are forgiven, but at the same time always worries that he will sin again. What should he do? A Greek scholar wrote thirty years ago that the word condemnation in Romans 8:1 has two meanings in Greek. It has a legal meaning and a general meaning. In the legal context it means condemnation, but in the general context it does not mean condemnation, but encumbrance or impotence. Hence this verse means that those who are in Christ are no longer condemned and are no longer impotent! In Adam we were impotent to withstand sin; we were crippled. We were impotent in respect to many sins and unable to overcome them. We made resolutions, prayed, and struggled, but we still failed. None of these ways worked. But now we are made potent in Christ. Christ is strong. Everyone who is in Christ is no longer impotent, but has become potent. The question is not whether we have power in ourselves. The question is how much has been transmitted into us from Christ. When we are in Christ we receive everything from Christ. The whole issue therefore rests on whether or not we are in Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">The Freedom of the Law<br />of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus</h2><p>Why are we no longer condemned in Christ? Why are we no longer impotent? Verse 2 provides an explanation: "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." The word "for" indicates that verse 2 is preceded by something in verse 1. The word "for" explains and relates to the things mentioned in verse 1. Hence, verse 2 gives the reason for verse 1.</p><p>Verse 2 mentions a law. What is a law? A law is a rule that never changes; it is something that always remains the same. The Chinese government has a law which says that whoever murders will be executed. This is a law. It does not matter if Chang or Lee or anyone else murders; he will always be executed. The law of gravity is also a law. Every object that falls will fall toward the ground. It does not matter if the object falls today or tomorrow; it does not matter if it falls in Nanking or Peking. As long as you let go of an object, it will fall to the ground. This is what is meant by a law. This verse says that sin is a law. This means that sin always acts the same way. Man always sins. No matter who he is, he always sins. He will sin today, and he will sin tomorrow. Suppose I have a quick temper. If I lose my temper easily at Mr. Chen and lose my temper easily at anyone who is similar to Mr. Chen, this means that similar temptations produce similar results. Everyone is proud and everyone has a temper. When the right temptation comes, everyone falls to pride and temper. Similar conditions produce similar sins every time. We seldom commit new sins. Most of the time we have our private sins which we are fond of committing. This shows that sin is a law. Every sin we commit is a familiar sin. We may have struggled with them for years already, yet we repeatedly commit the same sin or sins. It is easy for us to know that we sin. But do we realize that sin is a law? Sin is not just a conduct, but a law.</p><p>This verse also mentions the law of death. What is death? The biblical definition of death is extreme weakness. If a man is sick, you know that you should give him a word of comfort. However, you do not have the strength to do it; this is the law of death. You know that you should be holy, righteous, and patient. However, you cannot make it; this is the law of death. Everyone who is sitting here today is bound by the law of sin and of death. Every time you fall, you fall because of the same sins, and every time you fail, you fail in the same things. You may commit sins that others do not commit, and you may not be able to do things that others can do. But every person has his own version of the law of sin and of death.</p><p>There is a way to overcome the law of sin and of death; it is by the law of the Spirit of life. The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death. Only Christ is not bound by the law of sin and of death. I have in my hand a copy of the New Testament. Although it is not moving, it has a constant tendency to fall. It has not fallen, however, because there is an opposite force holding it up. The force of my three fingers has stopped it from falling. Gravity is a force; it pulls the book downward. My fingers are another force; they keep the book from falling. Hence, I can say that my fingers have freed this book from the law of gravity. My hand is the "savior" to this book. The same is true with the Lord's salvation in us; He holds back the power of sin with the Holy Spirit. Although my fingers are small, they can withstand the great force of gravity. Does this book need to make up its mind, struggle, or hope not to fall? No. My three fingers have prevented it from falling. The same is true with our salvation. We do not have to do anything. As long as we are in Christ, the law of the Spirit of life will free us from the law of sin and of death. The work of deliverance from perdition has nothing to do with us. In the same way, freedom from sin is accomplished only in Christ. When we are in Christ, we can overcome all sin. Everything is accomplished in Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">EVERYTHING BEING IN CHRIST</h2><p>I thank God that I am saved, forgiven, justified, and have eternal life. None of these things originate from myself; they are all given to me in Christ. This is why the Lord said that He is the Beginning and the End (Rev. 22:13). Thank God that I am in Christ. Around me, in front of me, and behind me there is just Christ. Christ occupies everything. Christ, Christ, Christ, everything is Christ. What are we? If we have anything, it is because we are in Christ. Last night I spoke on the meaning of being in Christ. Tonight I spoke on overcoming sin in Christ. I do not know how to make this more clear to you. We are completely useless in ourselves. Everything is Christ, Christ, Christ. Christ is everything, and everything is in Christ.</p>
