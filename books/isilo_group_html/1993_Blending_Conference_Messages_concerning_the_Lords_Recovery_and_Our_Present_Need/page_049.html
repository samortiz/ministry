Regardless of what the reason is for division, that is not a legitimate reason in the eyes of God. No division is legitimate, and no division is justified, regardless of how strong our reason is. All problems in the church can and should be solved through proper and adequate fellowship by praying together sincerely and thoroughly (Acts 15:1-31). The proper prayer and fellowship without pride and self-interest, under the light of the pure word of the Scriptures, will solve every problem among us and preserve us in oneness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Apostle Charging Us to Turn Away<br>from Those Who Make Divisions and<br>to Refuse a Sectarian Man</H2><P>In Romans 16:17 the apostle charged us to turn away from those who make divisions, and in Titus 3:10 he charged us to refuse a sectarian man, after a first and second admonition. According to Romans 14:1&#151;15:13, we need to receive all genuine believers, regardless of their different views concerning doctrine and outward practices. However, we cannot tolerate any kind of division, because division is an insult to the person of the Triune God and a violation of the constitution of the Body of Christ and the practice of the Body life. According to the clear and definite word of the apostle Paul in Romans 16:17 and Titus 3:10, we need to turn away from those who purposely make divisions, and we also need to refuse those whose purpose in contacting others is to cause division. This is according to the practice of the quarantining of lepers in the Old Testament typology (Lev. 13:45-46; Num. 12:10-15). Because leprosy is very contagious, a leper was put aside temporarily for the profit of the whole congregation of Israel. If a person is sick with a highly contagious disease, he should be quarantined, separated even from his family members, until he is healed. In like manner, if anyone is spiritually sick of the disease of division, having become a divisive person, he must be quarantined. This will protect the entire church from the contagious germs of division, and the church will be safeguarded in oneness.</P><P>6 brothers</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>1993 Blending Conference Messages concerning the Lord's Recovery and Our Present Need &nbsp; pg 49</div><br></body></html>
