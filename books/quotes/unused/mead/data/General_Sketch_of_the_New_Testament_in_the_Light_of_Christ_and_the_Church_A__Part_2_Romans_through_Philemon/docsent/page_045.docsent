   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Church as the Body of Christ in the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is in this Triune God that we are all regenerated, transformed, composed, and built up as a Body for Christ with humanity mingled with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a real wonder!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to understand the church, we have to know the church in the way of one God, one Lord, one Spirit, and one Body 4:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How can fallen people be the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is by faith and baptism v. 5 . By faith we believe into the Triune God, and by baptism we are separated from the old things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, we are still in the old creation with an old body, so we also need one hope of our calling v. 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The one God is in the one Lord, the one Lord is the one Spirit, and the one Spirit is in the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now we share in this one Body by faith and baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the reason that everyone must believe in the Lord Jesus and be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To believe in the Lord Jesus is to be identified with Christ and united with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To be baptized is to be buried, to have a clearance, a complete severance from the old living, the old creation, and all old matters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is by faith and baptism that we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this way we become the Body of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, we need something more because we still live in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In our spirit we are in the new creation, but our old body still remains in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, we hope in one thing that Christ will return to saturate our body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By His life He will swallow up death, and by the newness of life He will swallow up all the oldness of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is our hope.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the above verses show us the church in the Triune God, which is the aim of God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE CHURCH AS THE NEW MAN, THE BODY, THE FULLNESS, THE BRIDE, THE DWELLING PLACE OF GOD, AND THE WARRIOR</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now we may see what the church is in God's intention.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the third main point in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Ephesians there are at least seven different titles assigned to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, it is the church and the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Ephesians 2:15 tells us that Christ created one new man in Himself out of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our natural concept may be that the new man is an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Accordingly, we may think that there are many new men.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, the new man is not an individual man but a corporate man, because verse 15 says that it was created from two peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Strictly speaking, when 4:22-24 says to put off the old man and put on the new man, it refers to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We know this from 2:15b-16a, which says, "He might create the two in Himself into one new man, so making peace, and might reconcile both in one Body."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This indicates that the one new man is the one Body, and the one Body is the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church is the new man, and this new man is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to 1:23, this Body is also the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In addition, the church is the bride, the counterpart, of Christ, just as Eve was the counterpart to Adam Eph 5:23-32; Gen 2:21-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These four aspects of the church the new man, the Body, the fullness, and the bride form a group.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The new man is the Body, the Body is the fullness, and the fullness is the counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Besides these four aspects, the church is also God's habitation, His dwelling place in spirit Eph 2:21-22 , and the soldier, the warrior 6:10-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The warrior is not an army but a corporate Body to put on the whole armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The whole armor of God is one item and not many.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The one Body is one person that wears the whole armor.</S>
