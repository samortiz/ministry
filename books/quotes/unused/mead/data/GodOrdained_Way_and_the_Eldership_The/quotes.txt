[1]  CONTENTS Practicing the Priesthood of the Gospel according to the God-ordained Way The Need in the Eldership in the God-ordained Way
[2]  If you would receive mercy from the Lord to live Him, to live for Him, and to preach Him to gain sinners for Him, just do it yourself.
[3]  I am looking to the Lord that each one of you would make a decision to get one person saved for the church life every year.
[4]  They love the church, they are for the church, and they support the church financially, but they are not bearing fruit.
[5]  I would like to present a simple way to bear fruit.
[6]  Whether or not this can be worked out depends upon our endeavoring.
[7]  You need to contact people directly and individually, laboring in the gospel two to three hours every week.
[8]  You should find out who is available for you to contact and then contact them directly and continually over a long period of time.
[9]  If you take this way of directly contacting people one by one, I can assure you that you will bring two people into the church every year.
[10]  We must make a strong decision to labor in a personal way for the increase of the church.
[11]  Eventually Peter said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" v. 16 . The Lord Jesus responded to Peter by telling him, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens" v. 17 . The Lord was asking the disciples who He was, but eventually what came out was a revelation concerning Christ being the rock.
[12]  The Body of Christ is not directly covered in the four Gospels.
[13]  The Lord said that in His Father's house there are many abodes v. 2 . The many abodes are the many members of the Body of Christ Rom 12:5 , which is God's temple 1 Cor 3:16-17 . This is adequately proven by John 14:23, which says that the Lord and the Father will make an abode with the one who loves Him.
[14]  The apostles' teaching includes two main and crucial items.
[15]  Ephesians 4 speaks of one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father vv.
[16]  We have to admit that over a period of time, we gradually drifted back to the practice of deformed Christianity.
[17]  Eventually, the elders among us nearly replaced the saints.
[18]  All the things of the church were in the hands of the elders and on the shoulders of the elders.
[19]  In addition to learning the new way of preaching the gospel, we also need to be brought into the organic practice of prophesying for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ.
[20]  Now I would like to say a word of love, advice, and warning.
[21]  We should not think that we will abandon the churches which are in the old way.
[22]  On the one hand, you elders must take care of the church and participate in the normal church life.
[23]  If the church in your locality has a burden for another church, you should just give directly to them.
[24]  Then you will be in fellowship with the church to whom you gave the gift, and they will be brought into fellowship with you.
[25]  I hope that my fellowship in these two chapters will impress you and protect you in the Lord's recovery and in His ordained way, so that the Lord would use His recovery through His ordained way to build up His Body.
