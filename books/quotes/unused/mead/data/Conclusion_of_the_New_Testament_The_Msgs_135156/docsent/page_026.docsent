   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FORTY-TWO THE BELIEVERS THEIR PRESENT 26</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall cover more aspects of the believers' experiencing and enjoying Christ as the One living in them. f For Them to Have Him Formed in Them</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ lives in the believers for them to have Him formed in them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Galatians 4:19 Paul says, "My children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To have Christ formed in us requires transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the book of Galatians, Christ has been revealed in us 1:16 , He is now living in us 2:20 , and He will be formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To have Christ formed in us is to have Christ grown in us in full.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, Christ was born into us at our regeneration, now He lives in us in our Christian life, and He will be formed in us at our maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul's word about Christ being formed in the believers implies that we are being constituted of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ is living in us, He is being formed in us, and He is becoming our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To have Christ formed in us is a living, organic matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is now living in us so that we may be constituted of Him organically.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He intends to constitute our whole being our mind, emotion, and will of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, our whole being will be constituted of the element of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that He will constitute every part of our soul so that we may have His form, His image, in every part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For Christ to be formed in us means that His element is being constituted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, His constitution is becoming our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is not merely a matter of the element of Christ being within us but of having the element of Christ constituted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be constituted of Christ in this way involves a process of organic transformation and formation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The word "formed" in Galatians 4:19 corresponds to the word "image" in 2 Corinthians 3:18, where Paul tells us that we are being transformed into Christ's image.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This image is a form.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ must be formed in us so that we may express Him by being in His image.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As the living One, He with His element is working within us organically, constituting Himself into our being so that we may have His form and express His image. g For Them to Magnify Him</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ lives in the believers for them to magnify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul said, "Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death" Phil 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Paul's bodily sufferings Christ was magnified, that is, shown or declared great shown to be without limitation , exalted, and extolled.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, to magnify Christ is to express Christ without limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is to show to the whole universe that the Christ who lives in us and whom we live is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul, even when mistreated in prison, could display the unlimited greatness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul was happy in the Lord, and in his happiness he showed forth the immeasurable Christ he experienced and enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this way Paul expressed, exhibited, exalted, and extolled Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was a living witness of Christ, testifying of His ability, power, patience, love, and wisdom, all without measure.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>While Paul was in prison, he expressed the greatness of Christ in an enlarged way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word "magnify" means to make something large to our sight.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may wonder how Christ can be magnified since He is already universally great.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to Ephesians 3:18, the dimensions of Christ the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth are immeasurable, for they are the dimensions of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although Christ is vast, extensive, and immeasurable, in the eyes of unbelievers He may be virtually nonexistent.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, in our daily living we should magnify Christ, making Him great in the eyes of others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to let others see Christ in the way of enlargement, in the way of magnification.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to the human concept, Christ is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But when others see us living Christ, they will realize that He is not limited.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As believers, we should be a magnifying glass in relation to Christ so that others may see Christ magnified through us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As Christ lives in us and is formed in us, we shall live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then Christ will be magnified in us.</S>
