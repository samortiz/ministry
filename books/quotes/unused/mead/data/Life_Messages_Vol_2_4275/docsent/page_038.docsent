   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SOURCE OF OUR CONCEPTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But we have our own ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Where have all our concepts come from?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are buried in the deep, dark tomb of our concepts!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Fall</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our concepts are firstly the result of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's intention was that the man He had created should partake of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was to be man's life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God warned man not to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil; if he did, he would surely die Gen 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Man disobeyed and thus fell.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He rejected the tree of life and chose the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This tree of knowledge became a tomb, where man today is still buried.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Culture</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Culture arose after the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Genesis 4:17-24 describes its beginnings in the inventions that were made.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Culture is not from the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Its source is the tomb of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our concepts are rooted in our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some are based on our national origins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some are from the past; others are modern.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Religion, Philosophy, Ethics</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Religion, philosophy, and ethics have all influenced our concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Religion, especially Judaism, appeals to the Jewish mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To the Greek, philosophy is what matters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To the Chinese, ethical behavior is all-important.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In fact, all of us have the desire for good behavior deeply rooted in our concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The concepts we have taken from religion, philosophy, and ethics are a hindrance to our initial receiving of the Lord and then to our living by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Human Virtues</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Within all human beings there is the thought of being virtuous.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We like to be thought of as kind and generous.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We like to have a reputation for being mild-mannered and patient.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We like to give the impression that we are pleasant and gracious.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Wherever I have been in many different parts of the world I have found this same aspiration on the part of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Spiritual Aspirations</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The spiritual seeking of Christians is in this same realm.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First they seek for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then they strive for victory over sin, the world, and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The only interest of such Christians is in being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A BURIAL TOMB</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These are the seven layers of the tomb in which we are buried: the fall, culture, religion, philosophy, ethics, individual virtues, and spiritual seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The reason it is hard for us to live by Christ is that most of us still remain in this tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have no condemnation for the good things of our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We respect religion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We admire philosophical thought.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We justify ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We appreciate human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are impressed by people with a spiritual air about them, who are seeking to live a holy life; we do not realize that while they are caring for their spirituality and personal holiness but disregarding the church, they are still buried in the tomb of concepts.</S>
