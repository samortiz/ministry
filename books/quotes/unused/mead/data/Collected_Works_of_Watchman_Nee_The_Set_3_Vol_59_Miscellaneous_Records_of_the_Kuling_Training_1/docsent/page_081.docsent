   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE QUESTIONS CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SUBMISSION AND AUTHORITY Date: Morning, June 29, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Kuling Mountain</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Suen Lu-dian: You said that God does not want man to obey His authority while being rebellious to a deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What should a person do if his parents forbid him from going to the meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Watchman Nee: We have to differentiate between submission and obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Submission is a matter of inward motive and attitude, while obedience is a matter of outward act and move.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to God's Word, we should be absolute and unconditional in our submission, but relative and conditional in our obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Acts 5:29 Peter said, "It is necessary to obey God rather than men."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If someone in authority wants us to sin, we have to be submissive in attitude but we should not obey.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, a mother may try to force her daughter to join her in a mahjong game.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is wrong for a Christian to engage in mahjong, and the daughter must not obey her mother.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet she should still be respectful and submissive in her attitude, and she should not be rebellious or argumentative in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She can lower her head and softly say, "Mother, I do want to honor your word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I wish I could obey you, but I cannot follow you in this matter because I have believed in the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Submission is absolute, while obedience is relative.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Acts the Jewish Sanhedrin forbade the apostles from preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The apostles were submissive in their attitude, but they had to be faithful to the Lord's gospel commission, and they could not heed the prohibition of the Jewish council.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, they did not disobey in a rancorous and tumultuous way; rather, they disobeyed humbly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There should not be any malicious remark or rude expression.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once a man touches authority, he becomes soft and tender.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a man is rough and hard, it proves that he has never touched God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even when a submissive man disobeys, he disobeys meekly and tenderly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the deputy authority is wrong, one can put off the matter of obedience, but there is still the absolute need of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We cannot bang the table or stomp the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We cannot drop our countenance or raise our voice.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We cannot disobey in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible does not allow anyone to say to his parents, "Whatever you would have been profited by me is now corban.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do not have to take care of you anymore" Mark 7:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Submission in heart, attitude, and word is absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to be firm about these three points.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As long as something is not sinful, it should serve as a gateway for us to learn submission and obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our submission must be absolute, while our obedience depends on the nature of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many people have a problem with obedience because they have a rebellious spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we take care of our heart, our attitude, and our words, we will be proper persons.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whenever there is a conflict between deputy authority and direct authority, we can choose to submit to the deputy authority but not to obey him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Any prohibition of God's commission, such as a ban on the preaching of the gospel, should be met with submission, not obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Any charge to commit God's forbidden acts, such as an enjoinment to sin, should likewise be met with submission, not obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We cannot revile the rulers of the state or our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot stage revolutions or insurrections.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In attitude and heart we should always be submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The preaching of the gospel, however, is a direct injunction of the Lord; no matter how much men oppose us, we should still persevere in it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nebuchadnezzar commanded all men to worship his image, but God's people could not obey him even though he was the king.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In all other things we should submit and obey.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Dr. F. B. Meyer once spoke of a sister who came to him, asking, "My mother takes me to many social functions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I feel that they are not profitable, and I do not like to go.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I often have tried to turn down my mother's invitations, but I know I should submit to her.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What should I do?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Dr. Meyer said, "You should go, but you should ask the Lord to guard your heart." When a man is taught by God, he is softened.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The daughter in this case should have said to her mother, "I will go, but I would prefer that you allow me not to go."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If she did not stand on the ground of submission, it would be useless even if she stayed home.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Inwardly there still would not be submission in her.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After the sister heard Dr. Meyer's word, she accompanied her mother to the social functions, but she was different.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Before there had always been a rumbling in her heart as well as on the floor, but now there was no rumbling in her heart and no noise on the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>She experienced more blessing by going than by staying behind.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Children should always be submissive in their attitude toward their parents, but their actual conduct should be determined by the circumstance, especially when the actions are of a questionable nature.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When parents force their children to go to certain places, their children may go along with much stomping and trampling.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They may go in a fit of anger and return in a fit of anger.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some parents may want their children to sin, and their children may choose to stay with a rebellious attitude at home.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In either case whether or not the children go with their parents they have gained no spiritual lesson from their action.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the case of parents stopping their children from going to meetings, we do not have a clear-cut situation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is a borderline case.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A person's attitude to his parents in such a case should be, "I wish I could go to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you do not allow me to go, I will submit and stay, but I hope that you will allow me to go next time."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we argue with our parents for two hours and insist on going to meetings, we are not acting in a way that is becoming as a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Parents may want their children to go to places that the children do not want to go.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If sin is not involved in the matter, there is not a clear decision.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Submission is absolute, but obedience is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If the parents insist that their children should or should not go to a certain place, the children should obey.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If the parents do not insist, the children can choose.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In either case, the children should be submissive in attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we have this kind of attitude, God will release us in His own way.</S>
