   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NOURISHING THE NEW ONES IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After they have believed and are baptized, they are saved Mark 16:16 , and have been born of God John 1:12 to be members of the Body of Christ 1 Cor 12:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since they are regenerated through the living and abiding word 1 Pet 1:23 , they are as babes needing to be fed with the milk of the word that they may grow 1 Pet 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Firstly, we have to use verses such as John 3:5-6; 4:23-24; and 1 Corinthians 6:17 to show them that the Holy Spirit has entered their spirit to give it life, and that these two spirits have been mingled into one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From now on, they must strengthen their mingled, regenerated spirit by calling on the name of the Lord 1 Cor 12:3 and by praying Eph 6:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Secondly, we must use verses such as John 6:63, 2 Timothy 3:16, 1 Peter 2:2, and Matthew 4:4 to show them that the Word of God is Spirit and life to be the supply to their regenerated spirit as spiritual air, water, and food.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They need to pray-read and read the Word of God every day to be filled with the Spirit and grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thirdly, We must use verses such as Romans 8:6 and Galatians 5:16 to show them that we have a sense of life within us that is of the mingled regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From now on they need to live and walk by the sense of life within them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This sense of life is the sense of the mingled regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We sense life and peace whenever we are doing things according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We sense death whenever we are doing things according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These three points are the three foundation stones of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The new ones must be clear about them and practice them to be established in their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are many other points you may use to help your new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Chapter nineteen of The Scriptural Way to Meet and to Serve for the Building Up of the Body of Christ will render you further help.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>PERFECTING THE YOUNGER ONES TO FUNCTION</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After the new ones become more established in the faith, you need to perfect them further.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You must teach them everything you have learned Matt 28:20; 2 Tim 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You must cause them to be just like you: loving the Lord, having morning revival, living a victorious life, etc. As you sow Christ into them as a seed of life John 12:24 , they will grow up to love the Lord just like you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you have kept your first love toward the Lord, they will have the first love toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you are living uniquely for the gospel, they will live uniquely for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you help your friends receive salvation, they also can help their friends receive salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whatever you are in life, they will be.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whatever you are perfected in, they will be perfected by you in the same things Eph 4:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 11:1, "Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ.''</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You can say the same thing to your new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If to you to live is Christ Phil 1:21a , then to them to live will also be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is too wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You will be a little apostle, a little evangelist, a little prophet, a little shepherd and teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you would do this for ten years, you will surely experience much life and you will grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After ten years, you may become a mature apostle, evangelist, prophet, shepherd and teacher.</S>
