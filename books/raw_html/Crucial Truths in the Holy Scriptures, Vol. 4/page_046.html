	 <h2 class="head2">Every Believer Being a Member One of Another</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;We who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 12:5).</p>
<p>In the new covenant the believers are members one of another. This is the fifth special characteristic of the new covenant. Romans begins with our status as sinners and then, step by step, brings us to our status as members who serve in the Body of Christ in Romans 12. The believers who serve God are the Body of Christ, the church, and are members one of another, manifesting their function in the Body. In the old covenant the church was a hidden mystery, but in the new covenant the church has been manifested (Eph. 3:5-10). Therefore, a unique characteristic of the new covenant is that the believers are members one of another in the Body.</p>
<p>In the new covenant God wants the believers in Christ to express Christ throughout the universe as the Body of Christ, which is the church. In the new covenant God wants the members of the Body of Christ to serve Him. We are the Body of Christ and members one of another because we have received the life of Christ. The life of Christ was not available to those under the old covenant; consequently, those under the old covenant could not experience the reality of being the Body of Christ and of being members one of another. This is possible only under the new covenant; therefore, it is a special characteristic of the new covenant.</p>
<p>None of the preceding points were possible under the old covenant. They are realities only in the new covenant. If we want to know the true service of the new covenant, we must understand these five special characteristics. After seeing these five special characteristics, we can see the service of the new covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SERVICE OF THE NEW COVENANT</h2>
<p>The service of the new covenant is based entirely on the special characteristics of the new covenant. With each characteristic of the new covenant, there is a corresponding aspect of service. Consequently, the special characteristics of the new covenant are also the characteristics of the service of the new covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Being according to Ordinances<br />
but according to Life</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Not according to the law of a fleshy commandment but according to the power of an indestructible life&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 7:16).</p>
<p>The service of the new covenant is not related to ordinances but to life because the law of the new covenant is not according to letters but according to life. The law of letters is dead; the law of life is living. Service according to ordinances is dead, but service according to life is living. Both the law of letters and the service according to ordinances in the old covenant are dead. In contrast, both the law of life and the service according to life in the new covenant are living. Therefore, service in the new covenant has nothing in common with service in the old covenant.</p>
<p>The service of ordinances is according to fixed ordinances. It is rigid and constant, and it does not require any leading. The service of life is according to the sense of life. It is flexible rather than systematic, and it requires the leading of the Lord. In the service of ordinances, there also is no need for fellowship with God; we need only to follow an established ordinance. But in the service of life, we must rely on God and fellowship with God in order to properly serve Him.</p>
<p>The service of ordinances is weak because it has no life. The service of life is strong because it is living. Hebrews 7:16 says that the Lord, as the Priest of the new covenant, is serving God in the new covenant. He does not serve according to weak ordinances but according to the power of an indestructible life. The Lord&rsquo;s service is strong and powerful. The Lord is our Head. Since His service is powerful according to His indestructible life, our service should be the same. Today we do not serve God according to weak and dead ordinances but according to the power of an indestructible life. Therefore, our service also is strong and powerful.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Being of the Letter but<br />
Being of the Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Not of the letter but of the Spirit&rdquo;; &ldquo;In spirit, not in letter&rdquo;; &ldquo;In newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 3:6; Rom. 2:29; 7:6).</p>
<p>The service of the new covenant is not according to ordinances but according to life, and it is not of the letter but of the Spirit. Ordinances are of the letter, but life is of the Spirit. Not serving according to ordinances means not serving according to the letter. Serving according to life means serving according to the Spirit. The letter of the law is not only dead but also old. The Spirit of life is not only living but also new. Therefore, service according to the letter is dead and old, but service according to the Spirit is living and new. The service of the old covenant is dead and old because it is according to the letter, but the service of the new covenant is living and new because it is according to the Spirit.</p>
<p>The service of the old covenant is based on written regulations, and these written regulations are the letter. Those who served God under the old covenant only had to follow written regulations in order for their service to be proper. Their service according to the letter required neither the inspiration of the Spirit nor the leading of God. Therefore, there was no need to fellowship with God, because everything could be done according to written regulations.</p>
<p>The service of the new covenant is based on the living Spirit. God still wants man to serve Him under the new covenant, but He does not provide written regulations for man. Instead, He puts His Spirit into man and wants man to act according to His Spirit. Therefore, service under the new covenant must be according to the Spirit of God, not according to the letter.</p>
<p>Serving according to the letter means serving according to the regulations of the letter. Such service follows set regulations. In principle, anything that is done in a fixed way, according to rules, or is based on old practices, whether it involves prayer, preaching, or other kinds of service, will be a service that is according to letter. Such service cannot be counted as service in the new covenant. Even service that issues from the inspiration of the Spirit or is carried out in fellowship with God can become a service that is according to the letter if it is not continually carried out through the inspiration of the Spirit in fellowship with God. Any service or work that is old, formal, or ritualistic cannot be counted as new covenant service.</p>
<p>When some Christian groups worship, they read prayers that are printed in a prayer book. The prayers at their weddings, funerals, and other services all come from printed prayer books. These prayers are fully in the realm of the letter, and they cannot be considered as service in the new covenant. Some do not pray from prayer books, but they pray the same prayers every day. These prayers, which are recited like lessons, are completely according to the letter and cannot be considered as service in the new covenant. Similarly, when some preach, they use the same message or copy the words of others, often repeating their words in an old way. This type of preaching, which is set and old, is according to the letter and cannot be considered as service in the new covenant.</p>
<p>Service in the new covenant must be based on the inspiration and leading of the Lord that comes out of fellowship with Him. It must be new and living. This kind of service is not according to set texts or rituals, nor does it have an old and dead flavor. It is from the operation of the Spirit; it is new and living. It causes people to feel the presence of God and to touch God Himself. Our service in both prayer and preaching must be in this way in order to be the new covenant service.</p>
