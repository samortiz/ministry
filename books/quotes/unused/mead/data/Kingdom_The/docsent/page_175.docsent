   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TALENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the parable of the talents.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As genuine Christians we have two aspects in our relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first aspect is the relationship of life, and the second is that of our work or function with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have both a life and a work relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the one hand we are the virgins waiting for the Lord's coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the side of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the other hand we are also the Lord's servants, serving Him with the talents He has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the side of work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With the virgins the matter of love is a very important part.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With the servants the matter of functioning and serving is the important part.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to take care of these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In life we must be like virgins wise to get our vessel filled up with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As to the matter of work and ministry, we must be the faithful servants who are exercising and using all the talents we have received from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As virgins we need oil in our vessel; as servants we need to use our talents.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Oil signifies the Spirit that fills up our spirit and eventually our whole inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The talents signify the gifts and functions of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All real Christians have some gifts and functions given by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These functions are of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we would be those who love the Lord and who are waiting for His coming back, we need the infilling of the Spirit for the maturity of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, we need to use the gifts or the talents given to us by the Spirit to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the parable of the talents, the Christians were in three categories.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those in the first category received five talents, those in the second received two talents, and those in the third received one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the parable, the problem was not with the first or second category, but only with the third.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There was no problem with those who had received five talents or with those who had received two, but the problem was with those who had received only one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The five-talented ones represent the stronger believers who have more gifts and more functions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It seems somewhat easy for the five-talented ones and the two-talented ones to function and serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But it seems more difficult for the less talented members to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is because they consider that they have received so little.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They consider that their function, their service, and their work mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because they do not have a large portion, they tend to let the more gifted ones replace them in their function.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The danger is for the one-talented members to give up their function.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But there is no excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All must serve.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To the consideration of the one-talented members, the Lord is a hard master.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He gathers where He does not scatter, and He reaps where He has not sown.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One day the Lord will come back, and when He comes back He will reckon with all His servants.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All His servants will have to settle their accounts with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At the Lord's coming back the problem will not be with the five-talented or the two-talented believers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The problem will be with the one-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They will excuse themselves saying that the Lord is too hard.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>And the Lord will not deny that He is hard.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In a sense the Lord is really hard.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He does reap where He didn't sow, and He does gather where He didn't scatter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>So in a sense, it is right to say that the Lord is hard.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you have ever been in the Lord's service, you do have the experience that, in a sense, the Lord is hard.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For example, concerning the church meetings, do not consider that you can function because you feel the Lord has given you something.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many times it is not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Rather, when you come in, your sensation may be that you have nothing, but the Lord still requires you to function.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You may excuse yourself saying that the Lord has given you nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means the Lord has not scattered anything to you or sown anything into you, but now He requires some reaping, some harvesting.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many times this is the principle in God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the way of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is because, on the one hand we all have to learn to be diligent, and on the other hand we all have to be those who serve by faith.</S>
