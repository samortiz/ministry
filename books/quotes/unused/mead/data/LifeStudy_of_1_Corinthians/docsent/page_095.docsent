   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A WARNING NOT TO DESTROY GOD S TEMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 3:16 and 17 Paul says, Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If anyone destroys the temple of God, God shall destroy him; for the temple of God is holy, which you are.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here Paul warns us not to destroy God s temple.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I was a young Christian, I thought that the temple in verses 16 and 17 referred merely to the church in a broad, general sense.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later, as a result of much study and experience, I came to see that whereas the temple in verse 17 may refer to all the believers universally, the temple in verse 16 refers to the believers collectively in a certain locality, as in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The unique spiritual temple of God in the universe has its expression in many localities on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Each expression is a temple of God in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, the temple must mean the built up church in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The temple is built up with the believers in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Regarding the building, first we must gather the materials, and then the materials become part of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In chapter three Paul warns the Corinthians to take heed how they build.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the positive side, he indicates that they should build on the foundation with gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the negative side, he warns them about destroying the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Greek word rendered destroy also means ruin, corrupt, defile, mar.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To build with wood, grass, and stubble is to ruin, to mar, God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the context of chapter three, we may destroy the temple either by laying a foundation other than Christ, or by building on the foundation with wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For the Corinthians to say that they were of Paul, Apollos, or Cephas was to lay another foundation and thus to mar the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, to build with natural things was also to ruin the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The problem with the Corinthians was that they had other foundations consisting of their preferences and choices.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the context, we defile the temple of God when we boast in men and say that we are of a particular person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who have their own choices and preferences may consider themselves wise; actually, they are foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we shall see, at the end of chapter three Paul points out that all things and all servants of the Lord are ours.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is no need for us to have preferences or choices.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we should not say that we are of anyone or anything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All are ours, we are Christ s, and Christ is God s.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we consider the last verses of chapter three according to the context of the first three chapters of this Epistle, we shall see that Paul s concept is that saying we are of someone is to destroy the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul seems to be saying here, The church is in the process of being built up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some parts have already been built.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not destroy the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not mar it, ruin it, or defile it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you build the church with your natural being or your natural makeup, you defile the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You also ruin the church when you say that you are of Apollos, Cephas, or Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you destroy the church in this way, God will destroy you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the one hand, to be destroyed by God is to be deprived of the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is to lack the feeding, the drinking, the eating, the planting, the watering, and the growing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is also to miss the opportunity to gain the gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the other hand, to be destroyed is to be judged by fire and to have our work consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, if we build with gold, silver, and precious stones, our work will remain, and we shall receive a reward v. 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I encourage you to pray-read these verses in the light of what we have covered in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you do this, you will be nourished and have the divine element infused into you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then you will experience more transformation, and the church will have more building.</S>
