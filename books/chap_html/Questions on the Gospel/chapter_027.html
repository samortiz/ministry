<h1 class=msg>QUESTION TWENTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>CONCERNING CHRIST’S CRUCIFIXION</h1><p>There are two aspects to the crucifixion of Christ: being crucified by man and being crucified by God. Acts 2:23 and 36 and 3:15 speak of being crucified by men, while Isaiah 53:6 and 10 speak of being crucified by God. Which part of Christ’s crucifixion was done by man and which part was done by God?<h2 class=head1>ANSWER</h2><p>When we read the Bible, we can clearly see that the crucifixion of Christ involves the matters of man crucifying Him and God crucifying Him. From the seven sentences spoken by the Lord on the cross, we can understand which part of the crucifixion was done by man and which part was done by God. According to human time, the crucifixion lasted for six hours. During the first three hours, the Lord spoke three sentences, and during the last three hours, He spoke four sentences. Why did He not speak more or less during the first three hours? If we read carefully, we realize that the first three hours of the crucifixion were the work of man, while the last three hours were the work of God.<p>During the first three hours, lasting from nine in the morning until noon (Mark 15:25), man was mocking, scourging, reproaching, crucifying, and railing at the Lord on the cross. All this was heaped upon Him by man.<p>In the last three hours, lasting from noon until three in the afternoon, the crucifixion was the work of God. We know this because from noon until three there was darkness over all the land. This was definitely beyond man’s capacity. The veil of the temple was also suddenly split in two from top to bottom. This was also beyond man’s capability. Furthermore, the earth was shaken, rocks were split, and even tombs were opened (Matt. 27:45, 51-52). All of these could not be the work of man. They were altogether the work of God.<p>During the first part of the Lord Jesus’ crucifixion on the cross, man did everything that he could do. During the last part, God also did all that He could do. The first part of the crucifixion expressed all the hatred of man toward God. The last part revealed all the love of God toward man. Therefore, one might say that the cross is the meeting point of love and hatred.<p>Now let us look at the three sentences spoken by the Lord during the first three hours.<p>First, He said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing” (Luke 23:34). How could God forgive those who murdered an innocent person? How could the Lord even pray in such a way? If God answered this prayer, would He not become unrighteous? In order to answer this, we must be clear that the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross in order to bear the sin of the world. The righteous God could forgive our sins only by the cross because “without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness” (Heb. 9:22). Furthermore, only from His position on the cross could the Lord Jesus pray such a prayer. Otherwise, the Lord Jesus’ prayer as well as God’s forgiveness would have been unrighteous.<p>Second, He said, “Truly I say to you, Today you shall be with Me in Paradise” (Luke 23:43). How could such a thief enter into Paradise? If all the thieves were permitted to enter into Paradise, would it still be a Paradise? These, however are only man’s considerations. In the eyes of God, not only are thieves barred from Paradise, but even the so-called good people are unqualified to enter because, in Adam, all have sinned (Rom. 5:12). The Lord Jesus was able to speak to the repentant thief in this way because He is the only Mediator between God and man (1 Tim. 2:5) and because He is the Lamb of God (John 1:29). Through the eternal Spirit, He offered Himself to God without spot or blemish. Therefore, His blood can purge man’s conscience from dead works (Heb. 9:14). The thief in Paradise is no longer a thief, but one whose conscience has been purged from dead works. Today all who receive Him, that is, all who believe in His name, will have the same experience.<p>Third, He said, “Woman, behold, your son....Behold, your mother” (John 19:26-27). This verse shows us that because of the Lord’s accomplishment on the cross, we have a new relationship with God and with man. We are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God. We have fellowship not only with God but also with one another. John was not the only one who could receive Mary as his mother according to the word of the Lord. Later, even Paul (Rom. 16:13) and all the saints throughout the ages also shared this kind of feeling. How marvelous it is that by having the same life, a new relationship is produced among all the saints.
