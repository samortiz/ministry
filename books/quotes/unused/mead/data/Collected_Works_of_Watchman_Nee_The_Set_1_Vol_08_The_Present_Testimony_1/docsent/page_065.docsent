   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CIRCUMCISION Issue No. 18 Scripture Reading: Col 2:10-13; Gen 17:1, 9-14, 22-23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have read Colossians 2:11: "In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This verse makes us realize one thing: Christians are circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is to say that one portion of the inheritance in Christ is the circumcision in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order that no one miss the meaning of circumcision, we should turn to Genesis 17 where the matter of circumcision was first mentioned in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we understand what is there, we will understand Colossians 2:11.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before speaking of circumcision, we need to know some history about Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Genesis 17, Abraham was ninety-nine years old v. 1 . Prior to this, before he was eighty-six years old, God promised Abraham that he would be granted a son.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not only would he have a son, but he would be a father of a nation as well.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Abraham, knowing that he was becoming old and that Sarah was past the age of child-bearing, did not have the slightest hope.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, Sarah suggested that he take Hagar as a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They wanted to help God with their flesh, thinking that by so doing they could bring forth a son.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Abraham took Sarah's word, and at the age of eight-six, he brought forth a son, Ishmael 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this situation, what did God do?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God did not want man to act in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God did not want Abraham and Sarah to help by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since they depended so much on the flesh, God left them in the cold.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During a period of thirteen years, from eighty-six to ninety-nine years of age, there was nothing worth recording, that is, Abraham had no fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Abraham, at the age of eighty-six, still had the strength to do something; by the age of ninety-nine, he had no more strength.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There was no more hope.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God brought him to such a point before He came to make a covenant with him, that all the males should be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One year after the making of the covenant, Sarah brought forth Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First circumcision came; then Isaac came.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without circumcision, there could be no Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From this background we can understand why God instituted circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What God did was contrary to Abraham's doing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the age of eight-six, Abraham could still use the strength of the flesh and the method of man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the age of ninety-nine, he had lost even the slightest hope in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If anything was to be done, it would have to be done by the Almighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first time the term Almighty God is used in the Bible is in Genesis 17:1.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By this time Abraham was able to realize that unless the Almighty God did something, man was totally powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the meaning of circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now let us look at the aspects of circumcision one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE PUNISHMENT OF UNCIRCUMCISION</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 14 says, "And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You must remember that God cannot reckon those who are uncircumcised as His people, nor can He have any dealings with them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They cannot be reckoned as the descendants of Abraham, nor can the covenant of Abraham reach them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE NATURE OF CIRCUMCISION</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 12 says, "And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Circumcision is to cut off a piece of skin from man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Please consider: when God sees that a man is born, why would He want to cut off a piece of skin from him?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Is not the birth of the child the creation of God?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since God gave life to the child, why does He want man to do an additional work of cutting off a piece of skin?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Why would God not cause the child to be born circumcised?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Why is it necessary for man to do the circumcision?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What does it mean that circumcision is to be done on the eighth day?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We know that the eighth day is the day of the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Being circumcised on the eighth day means putting off the lusts of our flesh through the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The meaning of circumcision is to put off the lusts of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Why did God not ordain man to be circumcised on the day of his birth, rather than on the eighth day?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Here we see the difference between creation and redemption, the difference between the natural and the resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all understand the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Does a man become a Christian by receiving spiritual life right after he is born?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to the Bible, a child born of even the best couple still needs regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is because a person born naturally only has the power of God's creation in him; he does not have the power of God's redemption in him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Man has been created by God, but man does not have the resurrection life, the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The most adorable thing in the whole world is a newborn baby.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A child that is just born is the most undefiled.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, on the eighth day, if he is not circumcised in Christ, he will be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Brothers and sisters, perhaps you are naturally very nice, meek, and without any entanglement of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Perhaps you feel that your morality is better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But if you are not circumcised, you are not one of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If a newborn child needs to be circumcised, how much more do you and I need the same?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Eight days after a child is born, he has to be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What about you and I, who have been on this earth for more than ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We do not know how much filth our hands have touched and how much mud our feet have touched.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Even more we need to be circumcised on the eighth day!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>None of us can see God according to our natural condition.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Without circumcision, regardless how many sermons we have heard, we will still eventually perish.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>According to man's natural condition, we are destined to perish.</S>
