   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRIESTHOOD AND THE BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I began to serve the Lord, I liked to talk with people about working for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now I have no appetite for this because I have seen that it is not a matter of working for the Lord but a matter of being filled with Him, taken over by Him, possessed by Him, and saturated and permeated by and with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Serving the Lord is a matter of spending time in the presence of His shekinah glory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then He will flow Himself out of us, and that flow will be our real work and service.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This flow of God out of us is the very thing that we must take care of, for it is uniquely this that fulfills the Lord s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not a matter of working in this or that way; it is not a matter of method, form, or any kind of teaching or gift.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, it is a matter of being filled and possessed by the Lord and of being fully, thoroughly, and wholly permeated by and with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then we will become one with Him, and there will be a certain flow out of us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this flow we are one not only with God but also with all the other members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this flow we have our work and service to the Lord, the church life, the Body life, and the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The building up of the Body is not a work, nor is it any kind of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is a corporate life in the flow of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, we all must be filled with God, taken over by Him, possessed by Him, and saturated and permeated with His shekinah glory.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then we will be one with Him, and we will be one with one another in His flow.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the testimony, the recovery, and the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is also the service, and this must be the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All Christian work and service, the building of the church, and the reaching out to others must come forth from this priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has absolutely no intention in this age for us to do something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His heart s desire is that we would be fully open to Him and allow Him to fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this we must spend adequate time in His presence, allowing Him take us over, possess us, and even saturate us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the priesthood, and this is the kind of person God planned to have and desires to have today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The following hymn helps us to realize that for the building of the church, there is a great need today for such a priesthood, for such a group of people who know God in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What a blessing, what a priv lege!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Called of God a royal priest,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That this glorious, holy office</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I should bear, though last and least.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the building of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the priesthood doth depend;</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ever praying in the spirit</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I this office would attend.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If I keep this royal calling</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Under Thine authority,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Priestly duty thus fulfilling,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then the church will builded be.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now the church is but the priesthood;</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus the priesthood formed we need;</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the priests are knit together,</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then the church is built indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Through the church s degradation,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Saints this office desolate;</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Through the weakness of their spirits</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Preaching doth predominate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Most are leaning on the message</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And the preaching emphasize,</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yet neglect the priestly praying</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>And their spirits exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Deal with me and make me balanced,</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As in preaching, so in prayer;</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Leading others oft in praying,</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As Thy Word I too declare.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only serving by our praying</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Will our spirits mingled be;</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Stressing prayer as much as preaching</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus the church is built for Thee.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hymns, #848</S>
