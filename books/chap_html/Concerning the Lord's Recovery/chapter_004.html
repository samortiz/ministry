We do worship You for Yourself. Lord, we thank You for Your Word, the living Word which You have spoken to us in the Holy Scriptures. Lord, we thank You even tonight for this gathering. We trust in Your cleansing blood. Thank You for this precious blood which cleanses us all the time. Under this blood we do claim Your full anointing, and we believe right now we are under Your anointing. Thank You for the rich anointing. Lord, give us an open spirit. We are looking to You for a clear sky. Take away all the clouds. Take away all the veils. Take away all the conditional and traditional concepts. Lord, we pray You would bind the enemy and chase away the darkness from this hall. Fill this hall with Your glory, with Your presence, with Your love and grace. Lord, we thank You. We believe You are one with us and we are one spirit with You. Lord, do speak Your word in our speaking. Be one with us in this speaking. Anoint every attendant. Oh, visit everyone! Touch everyone! How we thank You for such a gathering with Your word. In Your precious name, amen.</P><P>In this message we come to the contents of God's expression in its reality. In recent messages on the Gospel of John, we pointed out that John is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings. One crucial thing we pointed out is that the entire universe was created for God's expression. The invisible God desires to express Himself, and to express Himself He needs some vessels. First, He created the universe. The heavens are for the earth, and the earth is for man. After creating the heavens and the earth with all the items, God created man. Man was made in God's image so that one day God might enter into him. Romans 9:23 indicates we are clay vessels unto glory. Surely the clay vessels are to contain Him. God made us in His own image just as a glove is made in the form of a hand with the intention that one day a hand would get into the glove.</P><P>When God created man He created a spirit within him. We have a body outwardly, and we have a spirit inwardly. Between these two is our being, our soul. We are a person with an outward organ, the body, and an inward organ, the spirit. When we touch the material world we use our body. When we touch God and the spiritual things, we use our spirit. We cannot contact God by using our body. That is the wrong organ. God made us in His image with a spirit for us to receive Him so that He might come into us to be our life and our content. Then we will be His expression.</P>
