   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THREE CATEGORIES</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>OF GOVERNING PRINCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God created an orderly universe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This order is maintained by certain governing principles.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first category of principles is physical.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Science is mainly a study of these principles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Scientists have discovered many of the governing principles which maintain the physical order in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our own solar system is governed by these physical principles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If one of these principles were violated, our solar system would be damaged or destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The whole universe is preserved and kept in order by God-ordained principles in the physical universe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The second category of principles is ethical.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Within the universe created by God, certain ethical principles exist among mankind in order to preserve mankind on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For six thousand years, mankind has been preserved by both physical and ethical principles.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>History shows that the situation of mankind is always deteriorating.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I came to the United States thirty years ago, the ethical and moral standard here was much better than it is today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The trend of mankind is downward.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yet due to the ethical principles which exist among human beings, some amount of order is being kept so that mankind can continue to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The third category of principles is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As believers, we are a particular people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are not merely involved with physical and ethical principles, we are also involved with the spiritual principles which exist in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are not only physical and ethical, we are also spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are God's new creation 2 Cor 5:17 because God has been wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The physical and ethical principles which govern the physical and ethical realms are needed for man's existence, but man's existence alone is not God's eternal goal.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's final goal according to His eternal economy is to have a spiritual realm, a realm in which His believers are His new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>GOD'S ETERNAL PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>TO HAVE THE NEW CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's eternal purpose is to have the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The difference between the old creation and the new creation is the element of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the old creation, nothing of God Himself was wrought into man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man was made by God, but nothing of God Himself entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Man without God is what the Bible calls the old man Rom 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The new creation, however, is the old creation with God Himself wrought into it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the new creation, God worked Himself into man in order to make man a partner with Himself and to make Himself a partner with man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now as Christians, we and God are partners Heb 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are in a divine partnership because He is one with us and we are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is in us, and we are in Him.</S>
