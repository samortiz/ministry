   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Revelation and light come first.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is the starting point.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must receive revelation and light from God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Yet revelation and light alone do not constitute the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One must be renewed in his mind and understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When God shines again, he will then be clear about the content of the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot convey a hazy and foggy revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At a minimum the revelation has to be clear in our mind before we can tell others about it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we are not clear ourselves, we cannot speak of it to others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If the revelation we have received is not clear to us, we cannot release it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even when we have received revelation, we cannot release it unless our mind is first clear about it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What we say may not be wrong, but we will not have the ministry of the word, and the Lord will not be released through us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After we receive light, our mind must first be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If our mind is muddled, the light we see will not remain.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Consequently, we need a renewed mind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The old mind cannot be used; it has to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If our mind is not clear, we cannot be a minister of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet even if our mind is clear, we still may not be a minister of the word because we still do not have the proper words.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Others can only hear our words; they cannot hear our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not have the appropriate words, we may speak for hours on the platform without conveying what we know.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why we have to have words from God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Words come to some people as soon as their mind captures the light.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With others, it may take a few days or even a few months.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whether the words come sooner or later, there must be a clear word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must receive a clear word from the Lord before we can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Without such a word we cannot speak.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is not a need for many words; all we need is one or two sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once we receive these one, two, three, or five sentences from the Lord, we can release all the revelation we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Unless we have perfect assurance within ourselves, we cannot stand up to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we have not received any light, our ministry will go nowhere.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without light, there is no ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But after we have received light and then have thoughts concerning it, we still need some life-releasing words.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are not talking about clever or wise words but life-releasing words.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As soon as these words pierce into others, life gushes forth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As soon as these words are released, life is released.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Life has to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sometimes, one or two phrases are enough to release life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to pay attention before the Lord concerning these words.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We call these words of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Without such words of revelation, we cannot speak God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should remember that when God gives us a burden, He also gives us a word to discharge the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Both are from God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He gives us light within, and He also gives us thoughts within.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When both light and thoughts are present, we have a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This burden will make us uneasy; we will be pressed and constrained.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet the God who gives us the burden will also give us the words to discharge the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is God who gives us the burden, and it is God who enables us to discharge the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He will give us the words that will discharge life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One or two phrases are enough to release this life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not walk away with a burden on our shoulder.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to find a way to release this life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Unless we can do this, we do not know how to work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we go to the brothers and sisters, we should not go with an empty water bottle in our hand; we should be prepared to give them water.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must find the way to discharge the water before we open our mouth to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I often see a brother speaking at length without releasing what he wants to release.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He tries very hard to release it, but he cannot discharge anything.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we have learned some lessons from the Lord, we will notice that this brother is going around in circles.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He may reach a certain point where the water is about to flow, yet he circles around again and the water is still held back.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When he reaches a certain point, he only needs to speak a certain word and the burden will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Yet he lacks that inner word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He has not learned to acquire the crucial words before he begins to minister the word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is no wonder that the longer he speaks, the more he misses the point.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must wait before God for the proper word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is best to have the proper word as soon as our mind captures the light.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we do not receive the word when we capture the light, we should pray for such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>One day we will find that our own eloquence is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The strange thing is that before a man learns to be a minister of God's word, he may think that he has eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But man's natural eloquence can speak of many things except the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Human eloquence is useless in relating the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Life can never be released through human eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Words of life can only be found through revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>No matter how eloquent we are, we will never succeed in releasing life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We have to admit that Paul was a good speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Yet in Ephesians 6:19 he said, "And for me, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known in boldness the mystery of the gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In the original language utterance is "word."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Paul asked the Ephesians to pray for him that he might receive the word to make known the mystery of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Fleshly eloquence is useless in spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There must be God-given words.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Ministry of the word is something inward, not outward.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we do not have the inward word, we have nothing worth speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The trouble with many people is that they keep on speaking, even though they are unable to release what they have within them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We should not search for these words when we are standing on the platform; we should have these words within us ahead of time.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must first find these words before God before we can speak them to others.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>A minister of God's word must learn to know the inner word.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He must learn to first touch the revelation and then release the words.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>May the Lord make us those who are rich in words.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We must not only have a burden; the burden must be supplemented with words so that it can be discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The only thing that can discharge our burden is the phrases that we have within us.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>These phrases are actually a part of the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What then is a burden?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>First, a burden is the light we receive in the spirit, the thoughts that capture the light, and finally the inner words that supplement the light and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The last step of the burden is the release of the inner word.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The combination of these three things makes up the burden of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Burden is light plus thoughts plus the inner words.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Our burden is to release God's revelation to man, and God's revelation is released through the words of revelation that we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>May God show us the relationship between burden and the inner words.</S>
