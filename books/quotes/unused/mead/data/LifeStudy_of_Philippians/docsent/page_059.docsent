   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR SHORTAGE IN LIVING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our daily living is an indication of what we are and where we are concerning the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may talk a great deal about Christ, but in our daily living we may not actually be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead, we may be in our culture, national philosophy, or domestic logic.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we are in the church meetings or with the saints, we may have a lot to say about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in our daily life we may live in our national philosophy, domestic logic, or family concept.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>During the years we have been in the Lord s recovery, we have come to know that the Lord is the all-inclusive Spirit and that we are one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord is now the Spirit dwelling in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although we know this as a doctrine, in our daily life much of the time we do not live one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead, we often live in our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may pray, Lord, we thank You that You are the life-giving Spirit and that we are one spirit with You.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nevertheless, day by day we do not live Christ moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not practice being one spirit with Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Recently the Lord has pointed out to me my shortage in living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Most of the confession I make to Him is related to this lack.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Day by day, I spend too little time living one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Too much of the time I live in something other than Christ, in many good things that are not Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because this is our situation, all of us need the Lord to have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Both we and the Lord have come to a point of crisis.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A critical situation definitely exists among many of us today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yes, we have seen the vision that Christ is our life, that He is the life-giving Spirit, and that we are one spirit with Him, and we talk a great deal about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, in our practical life day by day, we do not live Christ every moment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are not found by others in Christ continually.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may be very familiar with 3:7-10.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But how much have we gained Christ, how much are we found in Christ, and how much do we experientially know Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because of our urgent need to experience Christ, it is not my burden in these messages to present Bible teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is to minister Christ to the saints that they may grow in the divine life, which is Christ Himself, and may advance in the experience of Christ and enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>EXPERIENCING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>IN THE POWER OF RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In verse 10 Paul says, To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His suffering?, being conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to this verse, Paul aspired not only to know Christ, but also to know the power of Christ s resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The power of Christ s resurrection is His resurrection life which raised Him from among the dead Eph 1:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The reality of the power of Christ s resurrection is the Spirit Rom 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To know, to experience, this power requires identification with Christ s death and conformity to it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Death is the base of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To experience the power of Christ s resurrection, we need to live a crucified life according to the pattern of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our conformity to His death affords a base for the power of His resurrection to rise up that His divine life may be expressed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The participation in Christ s suffering the fellowship of His sufferings Matt 20:22-23; Col 1:24 is a necessary condition for the experience of the power of His resurrection 2 Tim 2:11 by being conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul was pursuing to know and experience not only the excellency of Christ Himself, but also the life power of His resurrection and the participation in His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With Christ, the sufferings and death came first, followed by the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>With us, the power of His resurrection comes first, then the fellowship of His sufferings and conformity to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We first receive the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then by this power we are enabled to participate in His sufferings and live a crucified life in conformity to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Such sufferings are mainly for producing and building up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Being conformed to Christ s death is the very base of the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we are not conformed to the death of Christ, we do not have the base for the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order to experience Christ, we must be conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But to be conformed to the death of Christ, we must have the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By participating in Christ s sufferings, we are ushered into a position to experience the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then, when we experience the power of Christ s resurrection, we know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Philippians 3 the sequence is knowing Christ, knowing the power of Christ s resurrection, knowing the fellowship of His sufferings, and being conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But in our spiritual experience, the sequence is reversed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Daily we are conformed to Christ s death; then we participate in His sufferings, know the power of His resurrection, and, by knowing the power of resurrection, we know Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to Paul s sequence, first we receive the excellency of the knowledge of Christ by seeing the vision of Christ; second, we count all things to be refuse; third, we gain Christ and are found in Him; and fourth, we know Christ, experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In order to experience Christ, we must be in the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We cannot be in our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The more we know the power of Christ s resurrection, the more we shall participate in the sufferings of Christ and thereby have the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we experience the fellowship of Christ s sufferings, we shall then be conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As we are conformed to the death of Christ, we are ushered into the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is by this resurrection power that we know Christ and experience Him.</S>
