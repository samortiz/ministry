<h1 class="title">THE NEED OF THE PRESENT WORLD,<br />
THE DIVINE TRUTHS<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY,<br />
AND THE BLESSING<br />
ON THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h1>
<p>Since October of 1984, at the time when I finished writing the notes in the Recovery Version of the New Testament, I began to have the burden to reconsider the practice of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We are here in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and we do not like to go on blindly or do anything in a contented way. We like to be on the alert as to what the Lord is doing, what He wants today, and what He wants to do among His children. Over the past sixty years, under the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I have been watching over the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and the situation of today&rsquo;s Christianity. I also did my best to observe the world situation. Based upon my observation, I would like to fellowship in this chapter concerning three things: the need of the present world, the divine truths that the Lord has shown us throughout the years, and all the blessings we have been receiving from the Lord through these many years.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF THE PRESENT WORLD</h2>
<p>First, we need to see what the need of the present world is. During the past sixty years I have studied the world situation. Soon after I got saved, I began to study the Bible, others&rsquo; writings concerning the Bible, the history of the church, and many biographies of the spiritual giants throughout church history. Also, by His mercy and under His grace, I had the opportunity to read the central messages of the great Bible preachers and teachers in the past twenty centuries.</p>
<p>I began to study the world situation soon after the first World War. Before that time, the so-called Reformed theology was very prevailing in Europe. Reformed theology does not believe that Christ will come before the one thousand years of the millennium. Reformed teachers preach and teach post-millennialism, which means that Christ will come after the millennium. According to their thought, mankind could be improved in society and adjusted by culture, by education, and by the teaching of the Bible. They probably did not believe that a Christian has two natures&mdash;a new divine nature plus the old human nature. They thought the old human nature could be improved and adjusted. This kind of teaching annuls regeneration. Even though they might not say this, what they taught implied this. Suddenly to their surprise, Germany began the first world war in Europe, and that war nullified the Reformed theological concept that human society could be improved by culture, education, and Bible teaching. Even though the Bible was taught so much in Europe, World War I still broke out. After that war, Reformed theology decreased in popularity. Then many of the Bible teachers began to write something concerning prophecy, Christ&rsquo;s second coming, and the millennium.</p>
<p>When we were being raised up by the Lord in those days, we studied the writings of the great Brethren teachers who saw many prophetic truths concerning Christ&rsquo;s second coming. The Brethren were raised up by the Lord in the early 1800&rsquo;s. In the next approximately one hundred years the Brethren teachers put out many teachings. The visions, the revelations, they received of the Lord were like a flood coming to them all the time. We received great help from their writings. Besides the Brethren, we also received much help from the inner-life people, among whom were William Law, Andrew Murray, Jesse Penn-Lewis, and the speakers of the Keswick Convention. The Keswick Convention speakers and the inner-life teachers were quite prevailing and wrote a number of good books. However, since the end of the second world war in 1945 nearly no valuable spiritual life book has been written.</p>
<p>When I came to the United States in the early sixties, I subscribed to some of the top Christian publications. I looked at these publications for about four or five years and I saw nearly no spiritual study of the Bible or nearly no spiritual teaching from the books of the Bible, nearly no divine revelation, and nearly nothing concerning the inner life. At the end of the seventies, I noticed that many seeking Christians began to love to study the Bible. Also, a number of Christian publishers began to reprint the old expositions of the Bible. Some even reprinted Dean Alford&rsquo;s New Testament. Although some of these good and older expositions have been reprinted, it is difficult to find some new writing on the Bible or on the inner life which is valuable and spiritual today. In the last century England was so rich in producing good, spiritual, Christian, and scriptural writers. During the last century and up to the first third of this century, many spiritual books came out by many good writers and speakers, among whom were D. L. Moody, A. B. Simpson, Charles Trumbull, Mary E. McDonough, and Ruth Paxson in the United States. Today, however, it is hard to find Christian literature which is purely in life, truth, and light.</p>
<p>The thoughtful people of today realize that they need a proper life, a philosophical, logical life. They do not want a religious or superstitious life, but a practical life. They do not want to live merely in a scientific or material way, but they are seeking something very logical and even philosophical. Today&rsquo;s students in the universities and colleges are very logical, philosophical, rational, and practical, seeking something real in their human life. If you would go to the campuses today, you could see that so many young people are seeking something. In other words, they are seeking the truth, the true meaning of human life, the reality of human life.</p>
<p>The world situation today is that all the philosophical and logical young people are seeking something practical, real, and meaningful to their human life. They may be very much involved in their university studies, yet deep within they are seeking the reality of human life. They do not like being nonsensical, superstitious, or religious. They want to be practical and real. Furthermore, the seeking Christians are seeking after the proper Bible knowledge. The ones who serve in the bookroom in Taiwan told us that the ones who do not meet with us come to buy our Recovery Version and our Life-study of the Bible. They care for the books on the knowledge of spiritual things. All of this indicates that deep in the human heart and the Christian heart there is a need, a thirst, and a hunger after the truth. We have to believe that this is the Lord&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>Our brothers who formed the gospel team went purposely to speak the truth on the college campuses. They discovered that there are many young students that are hungry for the truth. Because of the hunger they saw, they were encouraged and stirred up to have a burden to visit, if possible, all the campuses in the United States. They do not have the burden to preach the superficial, religious things, nor even to preach the shallow gospel. Their burden is to preach the deeper truths. The first message in their gospel preaching was concerning the Triune God. That message attracted a good number of thoughtful, young people. They were attracted by the subject of the Triune God.</p>
<p>The present need of the present world is the truth. Some brothers from the United States went to Taiwan to visit the college campuses there. They discovered that all the students were open not to the superficial things but to the deeper truths. They want to hear the deeper truths from the Bible. When some of them see our Recovery Version of the New Testament, they want to get a copy for themselves. Our God who is the moving and working God is really moving and working in the human heart in these last days, turning human intention toward the seeking after Himself. Many people cannot express exactly what they are seeking after, yet we know that what they are seeking after is the reality of the Triune God. The reality of the Triune God is the real meaning of our human life. The reality of the processed Triune God is what today&rsquo;s world needs.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRUTHS IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>We also need to realize the extent to which the Lord has shown us the divine truths throughout the years. From the 1930&rsquo;s until this present day very few spiritual books have been published outside of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery which are full of life, truth, and light. This is why Brother Nee&rsquo;s books have become so prevailing. In 1950 we began to publish <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> in Chinese. Soon after I came to the United States, we began to publish <em>The Stream</em> magazine in 1963. The first spiritual book we published in the United States was <em>The All-inclusive Christ.</em> Since 1974 I have realized that the most needed thing for the Lord&rsquo;s move on this earth is the release of the truths from the entire New Testament. I began to have two annual trainings to have the Life-study on all the books of the New Testament. Thank the Lord that at the end of 1984 with twelve years of labor we finished the Life-study of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. I had a further realization that we needed to put out something as an index, which I called <em>The Conclusion of the New Testament,</em> on seven great persons: God, Christ, the Spirit, the believers, the church, the kingdom, and the New Jerusalem. This conclusion may be considered as a kind of index. If you want to know anything concerning God in the New Testament, you can come to the section on God and find all the verses concerning Him in His many different aspects.</p>
<p>Due to the need, I also began to compose the <em>Truth Lessons.</em> The <em>Truth Lessons</em> are arranged to be covered in four years. Each year has four volumes and each volume contains twelve lessons. Thus, forty-eight lessons can be taught in one year. The purpose of these volumes is to provide a person with a general knowledge of the Bible according to the divine truth with the spiritual principles and also to bring one into a full enjoyment of God&rsquo;s full salvation. Now all the saints in all the churches will have the <em>Truth Lessons,</em> a Recovery Version of the New Testament, Life-study messages covering every book of the New Testament, and <em>The Conclusion of the New Testament</em> as an index for our study.</p>
<p>Since the recovery came to the United States in the early sixties, we began the publication work on a very small scale. Every year the publications have been increasing. Now we have sixty full-timers laboring in the publication work: fifteen in Anaheim, California, fifteen in Irving, Texas, and thirty in Taipei, Taiwan. Now we are going to open up a Spanish office in Monterrey, Mexico, to publish the Spanish translations.</p>
<p>Especially over the last three years, the Lord has shown us the New Testament economy of God. A book published by us containing forty-four chapters and entitled <em>God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy</em> could be considered as a consummation of what the Lord has shown us in His recovery. The highest revelation that we have received from the Lord is God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>In one recent message we called the Spirit the processed, compound, all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, sevenfold intensified, and consummated Spirit. We have put out many messages with many verses from the Bible to reveal such a Spirit. Again, this shows us how the Lord has given His truth to us more and more over the years. The standard of the truth in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is very high today.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I have pointed out my concern that there are very few among us who have really gotten into all these truths. On the other hand, I can assuredly say that many of you who have been sitting under this ministry for ten years have received many riches. When some brothers among us went out and began to teach others, they were surprised at how much they did know and have retained over the years. By being under this ministry, you have been saturated and soaked in the truth day after day. You have received something unconsciously and could never be the same. Even the dear brothers who were with us for some time and left still recognize the worth of what they received in the recovery. As long as you have been in the recovery for some time, you cannot wash away what you have received because all the truths have been constituted into you.</p>
<p>I would like to relate a few incidents which show how the truths we have received from the Lord have touched some of the Lord&rsquo;s children. Recently, a certain sister among us went with some others to the airport to meet some other brothers and sisters. While they were waiting, they met four American missionaries, among whom was a couple. The wife of that couple saw this sister&rsquo;s Recovery Version of the New Testament and asked if she could look at it. While this sister was talking to the wife&rsquo;s husband and to others, the wife could not stop reading the notes on the text of the New Testament. Finally, she asked this sister where she could get a copy of the Recovery Version, saying that the writer of the notes surely is a great scholar.</p>
<p>A sister in Taiwan gave a testimony that she met a seeking and learned Southern Baptist sister who had heard some negative speaking concerning us and who was influenced by it. When this seeking sister looked at a copy of the other sister&rsquo;s Recovery Version of Matthew and read the first note on the first verse of Matthew, she asked the other sister to get her a copy. She was caught by that one note and was eventually brought into the church life. Another older sister in southern California who did not meet with us got a copy of the Matthew Recovery Version, and when she read the first note in Matthew, she began to weep. This note captured her heart.</p>
<p>We have to see the need of today&rsquo;s world, and we have to realize what the Lord has given us and how much we have today. These truths concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy should not be just for ourselves but for the entire earth and especially for all the children of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BLESSING ON THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>A good number of saints have been very faithful in the recovery to learn the truths, attend the meetings, and keep a good testimony. Mostly all the dear saints in the recovery bear a living, positive testimony in their working place, in their schools, in their neighborhoods, and among their relatives. Some of the saints may wonder, though, why we are seemingly so small with very little increase in the churches. Our eyes must be opened to see the positive side of our situation.</p>
<p>Before I came to this country in 1961, there were very few churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the western world. At that time in the Far East, there were a little over two hundred twenty churches. Among these two hundred twenty churches, over one hundred were in the Philippines. Those one hundred churches were raised up by one brother who studied the sixty lessons of the basic truths published by our bookroom in <em>The Ministry of the Word.</em> By using these lessons, he established over one hundred churches. These one hundred churches were all raised up and established by these lessons. In 1985 I went to the Philippines and saw this brother. He told me that our church age had passed through the sixty lessons of basic truths and now we are in the stage of the Life-studies. Today there are three hundred twenty-five churches in the Far East.</p>
<p>Since 1962 two hundred eighty churches have been produced in the western world, which includes Africa, Australasia, Europe, North America, and South America. There are some saints in Zimbabwe in Africa who are meeting as the church. I also received a report that on the island of Tasmania, which is south of Australia, there are some saints meeting as the church. These statistics show us the Lord&rsquo;s blessing on His recovery over the last twenty-four years.</p>
<p>In Central America and in South America the people&rsquo;s hearts are open to the truth. Latin America has been dominated by the Catholic Church for centuries. Then the Pentecostal movement went there. Generally speaking, Latin America is devoid of the truth and many people are tired of Catholicism and Pentecostalism. They are seeking the truth. When you present the truths that we have seen to them, they eagerly receive them. This again shows the Lord&rsquo;s blessing on His recovery.</p>
<p>We have passed through so many attacks, disturbances, tests, and trials, yet the Lord has brought us through. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been firmly founded on a rock, which is a standing of the divine truth and the divine life. Everything in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is firmly founded and now is the time for us to go on. Thank the Lord that He has cleared up so many things and He has founded us upon a firm foundation. We are built upon a foundation, a rock, of the divine truth and the divine life. Now that we have seen what the need of the present world is, the divine truths the Lord has shown us, and the blessing upon the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must go on to see what our responsibility is. In the next chapter we will fellowship concerning our need to bear some responsibility.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">GO! BY RISING UP!<br />
AND BEING FILLED WITH<br />
THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT<br />
ESSENTIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:19; Mark 16:15; Acts 13:52;<br />
4:8, 31; 13:9; 2:38; 5:32b</h1>
<p>In this chapter we want to fellowship further concerning the need of the present world, the divine truths that the Lord has shown us throughout the years, and the blessings we have been receiving of the Lord through these many years. Then we want to go on to see what our responsibility is.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF THE PRESENT WORLD</h2>
<p>In the six thousand years since man abandoned God, gave up God, and left God to take his own way, man has attempted to enjoy himself with culture, with politics, with religion, with philosophy, and with science by improving his education. All the educated people became very thoughtful, philosophical, and logical. In the past forty-one years since the end of World War II, nearly every nation has endeavored to educate its people. Thus, on this earth in any continent the people are thoughtful, philosophical, and logical. Many realize that mankind has tried culture, politics, religion, philosophy, science, plus education, and that none of these things has ever satisfied. Man realizes he needs something practical, but he does not know what his practical need is.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we know that the practical need of mankind is the reality of the Triune God. Even many Christians are short of the divine revelation of the processed and consummated Triune God. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we have such a revelation. The Lord has given us a revelation to such an extent, nearly to the top standard. Our God, who is our need, is the processed Triune God. He is the very Triune God, who was embodied in the Son and who was consummated in the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God for our portion, to be our life, our contents, and our everything. This is the very God who can meet the practical need of mankind. Not only does the unbelieving world need Him, but also all the Christians need Him. Thank the Lord that we have this divine truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HIGH STANDARD OF THE DIVINE TRUTHS</h2>
<p>In one message given in the 1985 winter training, I pointed out that the believers who are in the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of transformation, are enjoying the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation by living in the organism of the divine Trinity and participating in the dispensing of the divine Trinity. These words are a part of our heavenly vocabulary. Many people on this earth have never heard such things. We all should be excited that we are enjoying the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the purpose of the divine conformation by living in the organism of the divine Trinity and participating in the dispensing of the divine Trinity. We are abiding in the divine grapevine, which is the organism of the divine Trinity. In this organism we participate in the dispensing of the divine Trinity. This indicates the high standard of the divine truths the Lord has shown us.</p>
<p>This particular message in the winter training covered John 14&mdash;16 plus chapter seventeen as the Lord&rsquo;s concluding prayer to His preceding message. If you are going to understand this section, you have to know how to section the entire twenty-one chapters of the Gospel of John.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John basically comprises three sections. The first eleven chapters comprise the first section, which is on the matter of the Lord putting Himself out as a &ldquo;sample,&rdquo; that He as the divine life could meet the need of man&rsquo;s every case. These eleven chapters contain nine cases. The first case was the case of Nicodemus (2:23&mdash;3:36), and the last one was the case of Lazarus (11:1-57). Nicodemus was an elderly, moral, experienced, and learned man in need of life&rsquo;s regenerating, and Lazarus was a dead one in need of life&rsquo;s resurrecting. In between these cases are seven other cases. The Lord as life met all the needs of all the cases.</p>
<p>The second section of John&rsquo;s Gospel begins in chapter twelve and is concerning the Lord&rsquo;s multiplication for His glorification. This section begins with those in a little house in Bethany welcoming Him, serving Him, and loving Him to the uttermost (12:1-11). Then the Jews welcomed Him, and even the Greeks were seeking after Him (12:12-21). Humanly speaking, this was a golden time for Jesus on this earth. He was warmly welcomed by everyone. At that time Andrew and Philip, thinking that this warm and wonderful welcome was glorious, came to tell Him that the Greeks wanted to see Him. The Lord responded to Andrew and Philip in this way: &ldquo;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit (v. 24).&rdquo; Andrew and Philip may have understood the people&rsquo;s wonderful reception and welcome of Jesus as His being glorified. The Lord&rsquo;s thought, however, was not one of being welcomed but of being sown into the ground to die that many grains, much fruit, would be brought forth. This was His glorification. In 12:28 the Lord said, &ldquo;Father, glorify Your name.&rdquo; There came then a voice out of heaven, &ldquo;I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.&rdquo; Actually, the Lord&rsquo;s multiplication is His glorification.</p>
<p>The section on the Lord&rsquo;s multiplication for His glorification continues in chapter thirteen. Generally speaking, Christian readers consider chapter thirteen of John to be on foot-washing, which is related to the disciples&rsquo; loving one another. Actually, the footwashing was to point out the one who was going to betray the Lord and to speed this one up to go out to prepare the Lord&rsquo;s betrayal for the Lord&rsquo;s glorification. John 13:31 says, &ldquo;Then when he [Judas] went out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him.&rdquo; The Lord sent the betrayer to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; Him for thirty pieces of silver (Matt. 26:15), and He went to the place where Judas would bring His opposers to seize Him. After Judas left, the Lord told His disciples, &ldquo;Now is the Son of Man glorified&rdquo; (13:31). Then He continued in John 14&mdash;16 to give a message, and after this message, He prayed as a conclusion. John 17:1 says, &ldquo;These things Jesus spoke, and lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.&rdquo; After this prayer, He led His disciples to the garden of Gethsemane to get Himself ready for being betrayed. Remember that the section from chapter twelve through chapter seventeen of John is concerning the Lord&rsquo;s multiplication for His glorification.</p>
<p>From chapter eighteen through chapter twenty-one is the third section of John. From chapter eighteen He was betrayed, judged, and crucified to accomplish redemption. Then in chapter twenty He was resurrected and that was the time of His multiplication. Therefore, He came back to His disciples, calling them &ldquo;My brothers&rdquo; (20:17). His brothers, who are His Body, the church, are His multiplication for His glorification.</p>
<p>Based upon this bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the Gospel of John and specifically of the subject of John 12&mdash;17, we can see that there is a case in John 14, a case in John 15, and a case in John 16 illustrating the Lord&rsquo;s glorification. The first case was the Father&rsquo;s house (14:2), the second case was the grapevine (15:1), and the third case was the new child (16:21). The Father&rsquo;s house with all the abodes, the grapevine with all the branches, and the new child with all His members are corporate items illustrating the real glorification of this wonderful Christ. God needs, in the universe, a dwelling place, the Father&rsquo;s house; He needs a divine organism, the grapevine, to express Himself; and He needs a new man to work out His will. These three items consummate in the New Jerusalem. Eventually, the New Jerusalem will be the house of God, the eternal organism to express God, and the eternal new man to carry out God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. This wonderful bird&rsquo;s-eye view of John will help us to realize the marvelous extent to which the Lord has opened up the divine truths to us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S BLESSING ON HIS RECOVERY</h2>
<p>I would also like to relate something of our recent experience in Taiwan which shows how the Lord&rsquo;s blessing is with us. In October of 1984 I went to Taipei and I was led by the Lord to carry out and finish three &ldquo;risks.&rdquo; First, fifty-two elders were established overnight in Taipei and twenty-eight more were added later. Approximately ninety percent of these elders are under forty years of age, and some are a little over thirty years of age.</p>
<p>Second, we realized that we had been on the island of Taiwan for over thirty-six years and we had still not evangelized the entire island. As a result we made a decision to rise up and evangelize, &ldquo;gospelize,&rdquo; and &ldquo;truthize&rdquo; the entire island of Taiwan within five years. We are calling for five hundred full-timers every year for the next five years, giving us up to twenty-five hundred full-timers. This is a big risk.</p>
<p>Third, I proposed that for the Lord&rsquo;s move for evangelizing Taiwan, we needed a large center for training. We acquired thirty-seven and a half acres on which to build this center, which cost about eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars. After making the decision to purchase this property, we made an announcement to the twenty-one halls of the church in Taipei concerning the need. On the Lord&rsquo;s day nearly the entire amount of cash came in to purchase the property from each offering box in the twenty-one halls. No one knows who offered how much, but the land was paid off mostly by one Lord&rsquo;s day offering.</p>
<p>Later, about two hundred and fifty full-timers were raised up on the island of Taiwan. Since approximately one hundred and thirty of these full-timers were raised up in Taipei in 1985, over five thousand have been baptized in the church there. This is the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>In December of 1985 we had two big gospel meetings in a stadium in Taipei that can seat twelve thousand people. To my surprise, this stadium was filled over its seating capacity with fourteen thousand people for the first gospel meeting. There were at least seven thousand newcomers there. When I sounded the call at the end of the meeting for the unsaved ones to receive the Lord, approximately fifteen hundred to two thousand people came forward. Again, this is the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>In the last two meetings of the 1985 winter training in Irving, Texas, I fellowshipped about the matter of going full-time, and one hundred ninety-eight responded to the call to be full-time. Again, we can see the Lord&rsquo;s blessing on His recovery. The present need of the world and of all the Lord&rsquo;s children is the Triune God. We are those who have the truth concerning this processed and consummated God, and we are experiencing the Lord&rsquo;s blessing wherever we go.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
<p>Now we must see what our responsibility is. We all need to do one thing&mdash;go! In the New Testament, there are two small words that are great in their spiritual significance&mdash;come and go. In Matthew 11:28 the Lord tells all who labor and are burdened to &ldquo;come to Me...and I will give you rest.&rdquo; In the last book of the New Testament, Revelation, there is a call for the thirsty sinner to come and drink the water of life (22:17). After the Lord had stayed with His disciples for three and a half years, He took the lead to go (through His death and resurrection). They did not know that the Lord&rsquo;s going was His real coming to them (John 14:2-3; cf. vv. 18, 28). He took the lead to go and He came back in resurrection.</p>
<p>In Matthew 28:18-19 the Lord told the disciples, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord did not say to go to disciple the nations <em>and</em> baptize them. He said go to disciple the nations, baptizing them. Discipling includes baptizing. We disciple others by baptizing them. I have heard Christians debating as to where people were to be baptized, how people should be baptized, and what kind of water people should be baptized in. But I hardly ever heard a stress on baptizing people into the name, that is, into the Person, of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit. The Lord charged us to go to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the Triune God, the processed and consummated Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Profession&mdash;The Divine Priesthood</h2>
<p>Some may feel that if we mean business with the Lord to go, this means to be full-time. All of the believers are God&rsquo;s priests and our profession is the divine priesthood. Whatever a priest does is to God&rsquo;s service. We may need to make a living, but this does not mean that we do not go. Acts 8:1 tells us that a great persecution fell upon all the saints in Jerusalem, and all of them were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria except the apostles. Thousands of believers left Jerusalem and carried out the spreading of the gospel (Acts 8:4). Were these ones who were scattered full-timers? In a sense they were and in another sense they were not. No doubt, some of them still had jobs, but they all went. They all were the goers to disciple the nations. Without that persecution, they probably would not have gone. The persecution kept them from remaining in Jerusalem. The Lord&rsquo;s word in Acts 1:8 that the believers were to be His witnesses first in Jerusalem, then in Judea, and then in Samaria was fulfilled through that great persecution. When that great persecution came, thousands of believers were sovereignly sent to spread the gospel.</p><h2 class="head2">Claiming the Facts of the Breathing<br />
and Outpouring of the Spirit by Faith</h2>
<p>Soon before His ascension, the Lord told the disciples to wait in Jerusalem until the Holy Spirit would come upon them (Acts 1:4, 8). After the Spirit came upon them, they would go to be His witnesses in Jerusalem as a start and unto the remotest part of the earth, as the consummation of His ministry in the New Testament. On the day of resurrection, the Spirit of life, the essential Spirit, was breathed into the Lord&rsquo;s disciples (John 20:22). Then on the day of Pentecost the Spirit was poured upon them economically (Acts 2:4, 17). Now all of us as the disciples of the Lord have the Spirit within us essentially and the Spirit upon us economically.</p>
<p>Some may say that they do not have any sensation or feeling concerning having the Spirit within essentially and the Spirit upon them economically. We need to realize, however, that neither do we have any feeling concerning the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. These are divine facts that are substantiated not by feeling, but by faith in what Jesus has accomplished. Jesus has died for me. Jesus was resurrected for me. Jesus breathed His Spirit into His believers and Jesus poured out the Spirit economically upon all His believers. He has baptized His entire Body into the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13). We do not need to have any feeling concerning these divine facts. We just have to claim these facts and say, &ldquo;Thank You, Lord Jesus, that You died for me, You were resurrected for me, You breathed Your Spirit into me, and You have poured out Your Spirit upon me. Thank You, Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Repent and Obey</h2>
<p>Merely to say that we need to claim the essential and economical aspects of the one Spirit by faith, though, is still too objective. Acts 2:38 and 5:32b tell us that if we are going to receive, enjoy, and experience the Spirit, we need to repent and we have to obey. God gives the Spirit to those who obey Him. If we mean business to believe that the Spirit has been given to us within essentially and has been poured out upon us outwardly and economically, we have to repent of all of our sins, our weaknesses, our filthiness, our mistakes, our wrongdoings, our offenses, and whatever is an evil and sinful thing in the eyes of God, toward God, and toward man. You must have a thorough repentance. Then you obey. To do this is to rise up. You can never go without rising up.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the principle is that we need to rise up and go. You can only go by rising up. How can we rise up? A balloon can only rise up by being filled within with air. Just to have the air within the balloon, however, will not make the balloon buoyant. The air outside the balloon is also needed. When the balloon is filled with air inwardly and outwardly, it becomes buoyant. We all need to go, but shall we go by our own effort and our own resolution? This does not mean anything. We need to go by rising up, by being filled with the consummated Spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit has been consummated and has been breathed into us and poured upon us. He is here waiting for us to participate in Him. The food and drink may be here, but you can only participate in the food and drink by eating and drinking. How are you going to drink the Spirit, and how are you going to eat the Spirit? By repenting and obeying. Sometimes a mother may tell a naughty child that if he does not behave, he will get nothing to eat. To obey is to behave. We all need to behave by obeying what the Lord says. Then we will get something divine to eat, with which to be filled.</p>
<p>We need to obey and repent to empty out all the dirt, the filthiness, within us to be filled with the Spirit. We need to get ourselves cleared up fully. We cannot redeem ourselves, but we have to repent. The Lord has redeemed us and His blood has been shed for the forgiveness of our sins. He is ready to forgive us and wash us all the time, yet the forgiveness and the washing of the blood need our repentance. Without repentance, even God cannot forgive us. The basic principle for both the unbelievers and the believers is that we all need to repent. God cannot forgive anyone unless that person repents. First John 1:9 tells us, &ldquo;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&rdquo; Confessing is the practical repentance. If you repent, surely you would confess. You would confess specific sins, failures, and wrongdoings.</p>
<p>Every day that we live on this earth we get dirty to some extent. This is why we need to wash our hands at least several times a day. This earth is full of dirt which requires our regular washing. Even our physical body itself discharges waste. Because we sweat, we need to wash regularly. In the spiritual realm, we also need much washing, but the washing, the forgiveness, depends upon our repenting.</p><h2 class="head2">The Need of Thorough Confession</h2>
<p>If we are going to rise up, we have to repent and make a thorough confession. Some may say that they were saved years ago and have already been forgiven of all their sins. I agree with this. However, you cannot say that because you washed your hands two weeks ago that you do not need to wash your hands anymore. Neither can you say that you took a shower two months ago so there is no need for you to take another shower. This is wrong. Even after half a day, you need to wash again. In like manner, you need to make a thorough confession of all your shortcomings, weaknesses, wrongdoings, and sinfulness to have a conscience without offense toward God and men (Acts 24:16). Man may not know what you have been doing, but God surely knows. According to Matthew 12:36-37, every man shall have to render an account in the day of judgment of every idle word which they speak. It is possible to deceive man, but you cannot deceive God. If we mean business with Him we need to repent and make a thorough confession.</p>
<p>It would be wonderful if all of us could spend one or two hours with the Lord personally to make a thorough confession. I once spent more than two hours in fellowship with the Lord to make a thorough confession and that was after I had been saved for at least ten years. It is always better to make such a confession by yourself. Do not make confession corporately. Corporate confession is not so good. You can never make a thorough confession corporately because you are afraid of other people hearing you. We all need a private time to confess everything to God. We do not need to be afraid of Him knowing our sins since He knows them all already. Since He knows the record of all our sinful doings, it is best for us to ask Him to rid us of that record by confessing. All of us need this.</p>
<p>In order to go by rising up we need to make a thorough confession, a fine, detailed confession. We need to confess all the small things. Even if you were unhappy with a brother, you have to confess that unhappiness. If you were unhappy with your wife, you need the confession of that unhappiness. You have to confess all your sins. Do not go to the Lord in a rough way. It is not sufficient to tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, You know I am sinful. I don&rsquo;t have the time to confess everything, but thank You that You shed Your blood and Your blood washes me.&rdquo; In order to have a fine forgiveness, you must make a fine confession, confessing to the Lord in a detailed way. Everyone who has done this and who does this can testify that after a thorough confession they are filled with the Spirit within and clothed with the Spirit without. They have the inward, essential filling of the Spirit and the outward, economical filling of the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Bible tells us clearly that the essential Spirit has been breathed into the believers of Christ and that the economical Spirit has been poured out upon His Body. Since we are members of His Body, surely the pouring out of the Spirit is our inheritance, our lot, our portion. Some Christians separate the Spirit from the Father and the Son. Actually, God the Father is embodied in the Son and the Son is realized as the Spirit. The Son is the embodiment of the Triune God and the Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. Now we have this consummated Triune God within us and upon us. We need to believe this and take it.</p>
<p>We do not need to beg Him to give us the Holy Spirit since the Holy Spirit has been given already. What we need to do is make a thorough repentance with a thorough confession before Him. Then experientially we will be filled within and without with the Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. Then we will rise up and become so buoyant.</p>
<p>We all need to go by rising up and by being filled with the consummated Spirit essentially and economically. We are filled by repenting and obeying. All of us need to have a solid time with the Lord to make a thorough confession. A husband and a wife can even make an agreement with one another that they are going to have such a time and would not like to be disturbed. When you are having such a time it is best to take the phone off the hook. Find some place in your house or somewhere else where you can be alone to make a thorough confession. We need to mean business with the Lord. We need to go by rising up and we need to make a thorough confession that we would be filled with the divine air that we would be brought into the divine air. Thus, we are filled within with the essential Spirit and filled without with the economical Spirit. We will be buoyant.</p>
<p>If this confessing and repenting become our practice, we will always come to the meetings buoyant. There is a hymn which says, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Man in the glory...How buoyant is He!&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #505). If you make such a thorough confession to the Lord, you will be buoyant for at least three days. If you find yourself becoming not so buoyant, then make a thorough confession again. We need to confess thoroughly all the time. Before coming to minister the Word, I always exercise to get myself thoroughly cleansed in the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood. This is why I am buoyant in the ministry. When we become buoyant, we go.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Letting Nothing Dim Our Vision</h2>
<p>Verses three and four of <em>Hymns,</em> #890 say:</p>
<p class="hbody">Hallelujah! Christ is Victor,<br />
Therefore do and dare;<br />
Go wherever Jesus sends you<br />
In prevailing prayer.</p>
<p class="hbody">Hallelujah! Christ is Victor,<br />
No defeat nor fear<br />
Evermore must dim thy vision!<br />
Christ the way will clear.</p>
<p>We should not let anything dim our vision or make our vision weak. Too often we let something dim our vision and make our vision so vague. This is our sinfulness. If we would confess our sins thoroughly, this thorough confession would clear the sky. Then our vision could never be dim. Go wherever He would send you. Do not let anything dim your vision. Go by rising up and being filled with the consummated Spirit essentially and economically.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT<br />
FOR THE MEETINGS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 18:20; Acts 4:31; 1 Cor. 12:8; Col. 3:16; Eph. 5:18-19; John 6:63b; Eph. 6:17-18a</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYER, THE WORD, THE SPIRIT,<br />
AND THE MEETING</h2>
<p>In Acts 4:31 four things are covered concerning the proper way to meet. First, the apostles with the saints prayed. Second, they spoke the word of God. Third, they were filled with the Holy Spirit. These three things, prayer, the Word, and the Spirit, compose a fourth item&mdash;their meeting. This one short verse unveils to us a clear and full picture concerning the way we need to take for our meeting. We need the Word and the Spirit for the meetings, but without prayer the Word is not so real to us, and without prayer the Spirit is not so living to us. We need to exercise our prayer to receive the Word and to apply the Spirit for the meetings.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the way that Christians meet today is against the few principles revealed in Acts 4:31. Throughout the many centuries of its history, the church became degraded. In nearly all of the things related to the practice of the church, the church degraded from taking the divine way to taking the human way. Concerning the matter of how to meet, in particular, the church degraded to the human, worldly way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MATTHEW 18:20</h2>
<p>The first verse in the New Testament which tells us something concerning how the believers in Christ should meet is Matthew 18:20: &ldquo;For where two or three are gathered together into My name, there I am in their midst.&rdquo; This verse unveils to us that the basic number for a local church meeting is two or three. Two or three are gathered into the name, not two or three thousand or even twenty or thirty.</p>
<p>In Matthew 16 and 18 the universal church and the local church are unveiled not in a doctrinal way but in a very experiential, practical way. In Matthew 16 the Lord unveiled the universal church by saying that He would build His church upon the rock of the divine revelation concerning Christ (vv. 16-18). Then in Matthew 18 the Lord unveiled the local church in an experiential way by telling us how to recover a backsliding or sinful brother. In His fellowship concerning how to recover a backsliding brother, the Lord opened a little window for us to see how we believers in the local church should meet.</p>
<p>I do not believe that many of us have ever thought that the basic way to meet with the saints in the local church is by two or three. You could never have a meeting just by yourself; you need someone else to meet with. Due to tradition and to our environment we do not consider a gathering of two believers as a Christian meeting or as a church meeting. However, the Lord&rsquo;s word shows that a local church should have meetings by two or three.</p>
<p>In Matthew 18:20 the Lord does not say that the two or three meet together in His name, but that these two or three are gathered. The verb in this verse is in the passive voice, which indicates that the two or three are gathered by someone. The meeting is not initiated by the meeting ones but by the unseen Lord who gathered them. Every time we meet, our meeting should not be from us but from Him. He motivates, He initiates, and He gathers us. The meetings related to a local church should be something started from Christ. He has to be the Initiator. He has to call us, invite us, and even somewhat &ldquo;push us.&rdquo; Whenever we meet, there are a number among us who have been pushed to the meeting. Without the Lord&rsquo;s pushing, many of us would not meet together. Our meeting is not initiated by us but by &ldquo;the Pusher.&rdquo; The Lord Himself is the Gatherer. He pushes us and brings us together to meet.</p>
<p>The proper translation of Matthew 18:20 is not that two or three are gathered together &ldquo;in My name&rdquo; but &ldquo;into My name.&rdquo; The Lord does not mean that we just gather together in His name or we just meet in His name. To meet in His name is much different from being gathered together into His name. We are not gathered together into a physical meeting place, but we are gathered together into the name. Because the name always denotes the person, we are gathered into the person of Jesus Christ. We are gathered and even somewhat pushed by the Lord into His name.</p>
<p>For us to be brought into something also means that we are coming out of something else. Actually, the Lord&rsquo;s pushing is always a rescue. He rescues us from so many things in our environment. Sometimes your tiredness would not allow you to come to the meeting. The Lord, however, did a lot of pushing to rescue you out of your tiredness and bring you into Himself with the other saints in the meeting. In order to gather us into His name, many times the Lord rescues us out of our homes and out of our families. Sometimes the Lord may rescue a sister out of her husband and children or a brother out of his wife and into His name. Every day there are many things frustrating us and holding us back from coming to the meeting. To come to the meeting is a fight. You have to fight to come to the meeting, but actually the Lord Jesus is fighting within you to pull you out from so many things in your environment and gather you into His name. Matthew 18:20 also tells us that where two or three are gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name He is in their midst. Since we all have been rescued and brought into the Lord&rsquo;s name, surely He is with us.</p><h2 class="head1">SPEAKING CHRIST IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Once we are gathered together into His name, we need to speak. In Ephesians 5:19 and in Colossians 3:16 the psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are not mainly for singing but for speaking. In addition to singing the psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, we need to speak them. Due to our background, we do not have the habit of speaking the hymns and songs. We must pick up this habit and forget about our background, what we have learned in the past, and about our present environment. We must come back to the pure word in the Bible concerning how to meet. The New Testament reveals that the unique thing we have to do in the meeting is to speak. We need to speak with the Lord&rsquo;s word, with psalms, with hymns, and with spiritual songs. We all must learn to speak.</p>
<p>When many Christians come together to meet, they are there to be dumb, to be silent. Many of the ones meeting together hire a speaker. They do not realize, however, that their function to speak is killed by that one speaker.</p>
<p>Many of us do not get ourselves prepared to come to the meeting to speak. Instead, we merely come to the meeting to sit and listen. We are not used to &ldquo;bringing our mouth&rdquo; to the meeting. To merely come to the meeting to hear what another person would say is wrong. When we come to the meeting, we should get ourselves prepared to speak. The reason why the situation among many Christians today is so weak, poor, low, cold, and far off is altogether due to the lack of speaking. If we all would learn to revolt against this kind of silence and speak for Christ, speak forth Christ, and speak Christ, immediately revival would come in.</p>
<p>When I come to a meeting for ministry and everybody is silent, this silence nearly quenches me. When everybody would not speak, it is hard for me to speak. On the other hand, if everybody speaks and I have to fight to get a chance to speak, I am stirred up. If you are the only one on a basketball team who plays, there is no encouragement for you to play and it is hard for you to play. Suppose, however, that every member of the team is playing and coordinating together. This is a revival. My burden is to stir you up to revolt against the silence in the meetings. Forget about the Christianity way of meeting. When you come to the meeting, you should be prepared to speak.</p>
<p>You must speak in the meeting, but you should not speak your own word. We all have to learn to speak Christ as our word, the Word of God, and to speak His word, the word as revealed in the Bible. To speak in this way we must experience Christ. The more we experience Him, the more we have to say of Him. We should not merely say something concerning Him but we must &ldquo;say Him&rdquo;; we must say something that is Christ Himself. We have to speak the Christ whom we have experienced in our daily life, and then we have to speak His word. Colossians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.&rdquo; For the word to dwell in us richly we need to learn the word by studying the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED WITH<br />
THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD&rsquo;S WORD<br />
TO ACQUIRE AN ADEQUATE DIVINE VOCABULARY</h2>
<p>After Jesus had been conceived in the womb of Mary, she went to visit her relative Elizabeth, and during this visit she offered a praise to God (Luke 1:46-55). Mary&rsquo;s poetic praise is composed of many quotations from the Old Testament, which indicate strongly that she was very familiar with the word of the Old Testament. She probably studied the Old Testament thoroughly in order to pick up the various points and terms which composed her praise to God. This indicates that Mary was a godly woman, qualified to be a channel for the Savior&rsquo;s incarnation, and that Jesus would grow up in a family which would be filled with the knowledge and love of God&rsquo;s holy Word.</p>
<p>The tragic thing about most Christian meetings is that very few of the attendants have an adequate knowledge of God&rsquo;s Word. They are not so familiar with God&rsquo;s divine revelation. Even if the attendants have the inspiration, they do not have the words to express their inspiration. A person needs an adequate vocabulary to compose, utter, and express his thought. Without the proper vocabulary, it is very difficult to utter our experience.</p>
<p>I encourage all of you to revolt against the traditional practice of Christian meeting and come to the meeting and learn to speak. To speak, however, you must acquire the adequate vocabulary. You can acquire an adequate divine vocabulary from your experiences of Christ, from the Bible, especially from the New Testament, from the Life-study Messages, and from the notes in the Recovery Version of the New Testament. In the Life-studies and in the notes of the Recovery Version are many high, deep, and profound terms which we should learn and use. In describing the wonderful Spirit which we have received and which we now enjoy we have used seven marvelous adjectives. The New Testament clearly reveals that this Spirit is all-inclusive, processed, compound, life-giving, indwelling, sevenfold intensified, and consummated. All the ones among us who are under twenty-five years of age are in a golden time to acquire a rich spiritual vocabulary. When you are rich in vocabulary, it is easy for you to compose any sentence, any paragraph, and any article. We must spend time to increase our spiritual vocabulary. It is regretful that many of us are short of divine utterance and expression.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED WITH THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT ESSENTIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY</h2>
<p>Even if we have the adequate vocabulary we still need the Spirit. The book of Acts shows us that we need to be filled with the Spirit and we need to receive the outpouring of the Spirit. Inside we need to be filled and outside we need to receive the outpouring of the all-inclusive, processed, compound, life-giving, indwelling, sevenfold intensified, and consummated Spirit.</p>
<p>This Spirit has two aspects&mdash;the essential aspect and the economical aspect. The essential aspect is that He would enter into us as our spiritual and divine essence to be our very life supply and the spiritual content of our divine life for our life and living. The essential aspect is the inward aspect, the aspect of the divine essence. The Holy Spirit, who is today&rsquo;s consummated life-giving Spirit, is God&rsquo;s very essence, God&rsquo;s divine substance (John 4:24). This Spirit has come into our spirit (Rom. 8:16), and He enters into our being to be the very essence of God to us. He Himself is this divine essence and He comes into us to become the divine essence within us. To be regenerated is to be born of God, and to be born of God is to receive God&rsquo;s very essence into our being. God&rsquo;s divine essence has been born into our being, and this essence is nothing less than the Spirit of God. This is the essential aspect of this wonderful Spirit.</p>
<p>The other aspect of the Spirit is the economical aspect. The economical aspect refers to God&rsquo;s plan, God&rsquo;s dispensation. The essential aspect of the Spirit is for our life and living, while the economical aspect of the Spirit is for our ministry and work to accomplish God&rsquo;s plan. The Spirit enters into us as the essence, and He comes upon us for the economy. This is why we see in the Acts that the Spirit fills the disciples inwardly and comes upon the disciples, being poured out upon the disciples, outwardly. These are the two aspects of the same, one all-inclusive Spirit. First Corinthians 12:13 tells us that we were all baptized in one Spirit. This is the economical Spirit. Furthermore, we were all given to drink one Spirit. This is the essential Spirit. To be baptized is to get into the water. To drink is to get the water into you.</p>
<p>We are short of these two aspects of the one Spirit. It is a divine fact that we have Him within us as the essence and upon us for the economy of God, yet in our experience we are short of Him within and we are short of Him without. Inwardly we do not have much of the divine essence, and outwardly we do not have much of the Spirit for God&rsquo;s economy. All the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have to rise up to seek after the filling of the Spirit and after the outpouring of the Spirit. May the Lord stir us all up to seek after these two aspects of the same one Spirit.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, fundamental Christians do not care for the Spirit and some even dare not to talk about the Spirit. On the other hand, the practices of Pentecostalism related to the so-called Spirit are not built upon the divine Word. They build nearly everything upon their feelings and experiences without a strong scriptural base. We all have to come back to the pure Word. In the pure Word of the Bible, especially in the Acts and the Epistles, the Spirit is greatly emphasized. The Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and the seven Spirits are among the many titles of the Spirit&rsquo;s person. We must realize that we need the Spirit.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the life-giving Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. The Triune God, after being processed, has been consummated in the sevenfold Spirit. Today the Triune God is not &ldquo;raw,&rdquo; but He has been processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, burial, resurrection, and ascension. This processed Triune God is now consummated in the all-inclusive Spirit. This is why 1 Corinthians 15:45 says that &ldquo;the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit,&rdquo; and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says &ldquo;the Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; Today our God is the Spirit; our Savior is the Spirit; our Redeemer, our Master, our Lord, our Jesus Christ, is this Spirit. We all need to seek the filling of this Spirit inwardly for our life and living and outwardly for our ministry and work to carry out God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>For our meetings we need to be gathered together into the Lord&rsquo;s dear name. Then we will enjoy His presence in our midst. In our gathering we have to speak. Everybody should speak and learn to speak the Word, which is Christ Himself. We need to speak the word of Christ, the words of the New Testament, and sometimes even the word quoted from the Old Testament. We also need to have an adequate knowledge of the Word. This is why Paul tells us that God &ldquo;desires all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth&rdquo; (1 Tim. 2:4). If we mean business with the Lord for His recovery, especially concerning the meetings, we all have to learn the Word. Second, we have to be filled with the Triune God and we have to have the Triune God poured upon us. We have Him within and we have Him without. We all need to be wrapped up with Him. We need Him as the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT<br />
BY MAKING A THOROUGH CONFESSION<br />
OF OUR SINS THROUGH PRAYER</h2>
<p>The way to get this all-inclusive Spirit is to pray, and when you come to pray the first order of business is to offer the sin and trespass offerings. In the Old Testament, whoever came to the tabernacle to contact God had to offer the sin offering and the trespass offering. The first thing in our prayer that rises up or springs up within us is our sin. This is why we need to make a thorough confession of our sins. If you do not do this, you do not realize how many sins you have. But when you come to the Lord to contact Him, not being occupied with so many prayers for matters, things, and persons, to be filled with Him and to be a person wrapped up with Him, you will immediately have the deep sensation that you are wrong in so many matters. If you would confess your wrongdoings, one wrongdoing after another will rise up within you for your confession. It may take you one or two hours to get yourself fully cleared up and cleansed. When you get yourself fully cleared up in prayer by confessing your failures, your wrongdoings, your mistakes, your sinful things, your offenses, and your shortcomings, that will be the time you will be filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>We all need to come back to the pure Word and make a thorough confession to God. If you feel that you are wrong with others or that you have wronged others, you had better make some restitution. Get yourself right with every person, and especially get yourself right with God. After your confession, that will be the time you are filled with the Spirit. We all need to have this kind of experience. You do not need to wonder what your feeling or sensation will be after you have made a thorough confession and are filled with the Spirit. There is no need for us to seek feelings, manifestations, or signs of being filled with the Spirit. We should drop these considerations and just go to the Lord again and again, making confessions. Every day we need this kind of clearing up. Then we will enjoy the infilling of the Spirit and the outpouring of the Spirit all the time. A number of saints can testify that when they practiced making a thorough confession to the Lord, they experienced the Spirit in a rich way. I hope that you would take this word and go to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FULL OF THE WORD<br />
AND FULL OF THE SPIRIT<br />
FOR THE SMALL GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<p>We may have heard much of the fellowship concerning the small group meetings, but if we do not have the adequate word plus the infilling and the outpouring of the Spirit, it will be hard for us to practice the small group meetings. At the most, all we will be able to have as the contents of the small group meetings is a little talk which we may term fellowship. That, however, is absolutely inadequate. In our small group meetings we should speak with the Word of God, and we should speak the Word with the Spirit. We do not speak the Word just by ourselves, but we speak the Word with the Spirit. Without the Word and without the Spirit, it is hard for us to utter anything in any kind of meeting. Even in a meeting of three or four it will be hard for you to speak. Without the Word and the Spirit, you will have no intention to speak. You will feel that you have no need, no desire, no burden, and no incentive to speak. But when you have the adequate word and the infilling and the outpouring of the Spirit, you have something urging, pushing, burdening you to speak. When you speak, there will be rivers of living water flowing out of your innermost being (John 7:38). This is the overflow of the rich word through the flowing Spirit. If we want to see the churches built up practically and in a rich way in all the localities, we must practice the small group meetings with the saints speaking in this way.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I believe that a number of us have found out that the small group meetings are really helpful. We have discovered that these small group meetings really work to bring people in, to touch people, and to take care of people. At the same time, I believe that some of us have found out that it is hard to go to the small meetings. Instead, some like to come to the big meetings because they feel that they do not need to speak since someone else will be speaking in the big meetings. However, if you go to a small meeting with less than ten saints and do not speak, you will be exposed. It may be that in your small group everybody is speaking, but you do not know how to speak and have nothing with which to speak. As a result, you are bothered and even afraid to go back to your small group meeting again. We are encouraged to go to the small group meetings when we are full of the Word and full of the Spirit. When we are full of the Word and full of the Spirit we like to flow out all the riches of our Christ to others that they may enjoy the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>We must remember these two crucial points: to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly and to be filled with the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. There is no need for you to discern whether you are experiencing the essential aspect of the Spirit or the economical aspect. These are two aspects of the one Spirit. All of us need to seek after the Word and to seek after the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEKING EARNESTLY AFTER THE WORD<br />
AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Both the Word and the Spirit require our earnest seeking. To seek after the Word we need to study the Bible and pray-read the Word. We also need to study the footnotes and the Recovery Version and the Life-study Messages along with some other helpful reference books. We need to accumulate all the good terms and expressions from all the Bible books and from other divine, spiritual books to enlarge our divine, heavenly, and spiritual vocabulary.</p>
<p>We also need to pray every day and not just once during the day. We need to pray to make confessions all the time in order to keep ourselves cleared up. Through our prayer we need to get ourselves fully and clearly empty from within. Then we will be fully cleansed, not only by the blood but also by the cleansing Spirit. Then this cleansing Spirit will fill us up. He is in us, but we are filled with so many other things. If a bottle is filled up with dirt, the air cannot get into the bottle. The more dirt that is poured out of the bottle, the more air gets into the bottle. In like manner, how much air gets into us depends upon how much dirt will be poured out of us.</p>
<p>Every day we have to spend some time to pray to get fully cleared up. We must get emptied every day. You may not feel that you are so sinful, yet you have to realize you are so filled up with things other than Christ. You are occupied with all kinds of things other than Christ. In the eyes of the Lord all the occupying things are sinful. Even good things, moral things, and ethical things that are occupying you from within are sinful in the eyes of God if they are replacements of Christ. You have to confess, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me for letting this good thing occupy me to replace You within me and to usurp Your ground in me. I want to get this cleared up.&rdquo; Every day we have to get ourselves cleansed, cleaned, emptied, and cleared up.</p>
<p>From the time that we rise up in the morning until the time that we retire at night, we need to wash our hands many times. Otherwise, our hands will be fully dirtied. As Christians who are walking and living on this earth, we must realize that no place, no person, and no thing we touch is clean. We get dirty by touching all these worldly things so we need to get ourselves cleansed and cleared up from within and from without. Every day we need some time to deal with the Word and we need some time to deal with the Spirit to keep us always prepared to speak Christ, to speak for Christ, and to speak forth Christ at any time and at any place. We need to be the speaking believers everywhere and at every time. In your home, in your office, and on the street you need to speak. You need to speak even the more in the meeting. We all have to learn to be a speaking believer. To do this we need to deal with the Word all the time, and we need to have the infilling and outpouring of the all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<p>My prayer is that the saints would realize what their need is today. The Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date move is to build up the church through the small group meetings, yet the small group meetings require all the saints to have the Word and the Spirit. To have the Word requires our study and to have the Spirit requires our being filled with Him. To have Him within us and upon us all the time means that we are really one with the Spirit. Then wherever we go and wherever we are we speak. We have the encouragement within, we have the material, and we have the Spirit. We have everything we need to be a speaking member of the Body of Christ. May the Lord burden all of us to seek Him in His present day move in this way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCED IN THE WORD<br />
AND FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT<br />
FOR THE INCREASE AND MEETINGS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 5:13-14; Acts 4:31; Col. 3:16; Eph. 5:18-19; 1 Cor. 12:8</h1>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCED IN THE WORD</h2>
<p>In this chapter we shall continue to see something concerning the Word and the Spirit for the meetings. We need to pay our attention to the title of this chapter. It says, &ldquo;Experienced in the Word.&rdquo; Even among us, not many have ever realized that in the New Testament there is such a thought, the thought of being experienced in the word. Hebrews 5 speaks of the negative side, saying, &ldquo;inexperienced in the word.&rdquo; Paul, to some extent, blamed the Hebrew believers for not having adequate experience in the word of God, saying in verse 13, &ldquo;For everyone who partakes of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness.&rdquo; Paul blamed them concerning this matter because, according to the context of this book, especially chapters five and six, the Hebrew believers, after being saved and going on for a while, stopped in the course of their spiritual life at the beginning of the word of Christ, the &ldquo;good word&rdquo; in Hebrews 6:5. The good word is the word of the beginning of Christ&rsquo;s salvation (6:1). Because they stopped there and did not go on, there was the need for the Apostle Paul to write the book of Hebrews.</p>
<p>The book of Hebrews is an advance in the understanding of God&rsquo;s holy Word. Now, the word that the stopped believers must go on to experience is the word of righteousness. In the New Testament there are terms such as the word of grace (Acts 20:32), the word of life (Phil. 2:16), and the word of truth (2 Cor. 6:7). It may be easy for us to understand what the word of grace is and what the words of life and the words of truth are. However, I doubt that many, even among us, have an understanding of the word of righteousness.</p>
<p>The word of righteousness is the teaching in the book of Hebrews. Paul told the Hebrews that they had enjoyed, tasted, the good word of God, which is the beginning of the word of Christ&rsquo;s salvation, but they had not gone on. They had never become experienced in the word of God&rsquo;s righteousness, the word concerning God&rsquo;s dispensational dealing with His chosen people. We must become experienced in the word of righteousness. We need to know the truth, not just the beginning of the truth, but the advanced truth which is the word of righteousness.</p>
<p>We must be experienced in the word and also filled with the Spirit. In Hebrews 5:13-14 is the thought of being experienced in the word, and in Acts 4:31 is the clear fact concerning the filling of the Spirit. As to the Spirit we need to be filled; as to the word we need to be experienced.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>I do not like simply to pass on doctrines. We need the help to realize our real situation. What is needed today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the increase. Recently four brothers from Orange County in Southern California came to me with a purpose. They had prepared more than five pages of statistics with a spiritual budget. Those statistics show that in the past ten years the rate of increase in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has not been encouraging. It has been too low, on the average lower than ten percent.</p>
<p>In the past ten years we have built two large halls. In 1976 over eighty young saints dedicated themselves to build the first large hall in Anaheim, and five years later in Irving, Texas, we built another hall. On the first day of use during the training on Revelation the hall in Anaheim was filled with over four thousand saints. The hall in Irving was completed in the fall of 1982. Now there are approximately ninety-eight churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the United States, and seven more in Canada. This number, as a whole, is still very low. The percentage of increase today is much lower than in the years from 1963 to 1973. In those ten years the increase was always over thirty percent yearly, but in the last ten years the rate has come down even to less than ten percent. Now more of the truth has been released and so many have grown quite much in life. However, the low rate of the increase bothers us.</p>
<p>We have been meeting in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in this country since 1962. I still remember our meetings in Los Angeles in those ten years from 1962 to 1972, especially in the few years after 1969. Nearly every meeting was an exciting meeting. Whoever met with us from 1969 through 1971 could never forget the high meetings. Actually, the meetings never started in the hall or even on the way to the meeting. Before dinner time, after all the saints had come home from work, they began to meet in their homes. At the dinner table they began the meeting&mdash;singing and fellowshipping. Then they all came to the meeting in groups, singing on the way, shouting, &ldquo;hallelujahing,&rdquo; and &ldquo;amening&rdquo; on the way. At 7:30 the meeting started. If you had come at even five minutes before seven, it would have been hard to get a front row seat. But regrettably, in many of today&rsquo;s meetings only a few are sitting on the front row at 7:30; most of the saints have not yet come.</p>
<p>This is not a very positive and encouraging sign. The rate of the increase has been getting lower and lower. The high atmosphere in the meetings has also been coming down. These two things are troubling. The four brothers who came from Southern California to fellowship with me felt that they could not tolerate this situation any longer. They wanted to revolt against the present situation, to have a revolutionizing change in these two things. They said that at any cost we must uplift the rate of increase; at any cost we must uplift the atmosphere of our meetings. They said that Southern California should no longer be a &ldquo;Dead Sea.&rdquo; They considered that all the saints in over fourteen churches in Southern California are at the present time like a Dead Sea, with little flow coming in or going out. Without an inflow the Dead Sea would be dried up. In the churches today there is nearly no going out, no migration, and no producing of full-timers. This situation is a standstill. Thank the Lord that there has been a rate of increase, which is better than nothing. The recovery is not going down, but it is going up. The rate of increase, however, is too low. It is low to such an extent that we do not realize that anything is happening. It is as if there is no rate of increase at all.</p>
<p>In October of 1984 I went back to Taiwan. I went there purposely at the sacrifice of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the western world because we do have a great heritage, a big investment in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there. Because the work there was started by the Lord through this ministry, I had the full position and right to say whatever the Lord led me to say. I told the saints there that the entire situation of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, including the work in the churches, needs to be revolutionized. I told them to forget about the old way. At that time the church in Taipei had over eleven thousand meeting in twenty-one halls, with only less than six elders. In the past, for over five years, whenever I checked with the leading ones, I said that the eldership there was not strong and needed to be strengthened. They answered that nearly no one else was qualified to be an elder. After a year I checked with them again, saying that there was the urgent need to increase and strengthen the eldership in Taipei. Once more they said that nearly no one was qualified. They considered the brothers name by name, showing me that nearly no one was qualified.</p>
<p>Last October I went and I gave messages telling the churches that everything should be revolutionized and that we should not remain old. After I gave those messages in two or three conferences, they all agreed to have a change. First, in one night fifty-two new elders were established. The leading ones agreed to raise up all those &ldquo;unqualified ones&rdquo; to be elders. The former six were not excluded, but were put into a special responsibility. The fifty-two bear the direct responsibility in twenty-one halls for the church.</p>
<p>The second thing I did was to nearly annul, to kill, all the big meetings. They had only practiced to gather over eleven thousand saints into twenty-one halls and had trained about twenty or thirty speakers to take care of the speaking every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. I proposed that they should establish small group meetings with no speaker and no leader. I said that everybody should be a speaker, including the sisters and even the young boys. Everyone has to be a speaker, everyone has to be a leader, everyone has to be an usher, and everyone has to be a song leader in the small group meeting. Likewise, every home has to be a meeting hall. Thank the Lord that He blessed and confirmed this way. Much blessing has been brought in already.</p>
<p>These four brothers from Southern California who came to me went to Taipei in October, November, and December of 1985 while I was there. They saw the blessing and were inspired, touched, and very much influenced. Coming back to Orange County, they told the saints that they could not tolerate the situation there. They could not tolerate the low rate of increase and the Dead Sea situation. Ten years ago we had many migrations, but within these ten years there has been nearly none. These brothers reminded me that I had challenged them twice in the past one or two years concerning migration. There were many openings in the Southeast, in the so-called Bible belt from North Carolina to Arizona. The Lord has opened many places for us, but not many would migrate to fill the openings. They also vindicated me in the matter of the full-timers. They told the saints in Orange County that I had challenged them with the urgent and great need of more full-timers. However, among seventeen hundred saints in Southern California not many responded. Therefore, these four told the saints there that they could not tolerate the situation any longer. They are burdened to &ldquo;set a fire to burn the old house,&rdquo; to burn the old practices, the indifferent practices, the lukewarm practices, the standstill practices, the old Dead Sea practices. All the churches should be a spring, a living spring out of the living fountain to have a living flow. Honestly speaking, we cannot see this in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today.</p>
<p>We must reconsider our way, as the Lord said through the prophet Haggai, &ldquo;Consider your ways. Ye have sown much, and bring in little...and he that earneth wages, earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes&rdquo; (Hag. 1:5b, 6). What is the reason? There is nothing wrong with the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Much more of the truth has been released, but the situation among us is at a standstill. What is the shortage?</p><h2 class="head1">MOTIVATED BY THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT<br />
FOR THE MEETINGS AND THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>In Taiwan the practice of the small group meetings is not just a method. I realize that a number of the churches in the United States are now practicing the small group gatherings. However, I am really concerned that it is probably just a method without any incentive, without any inner motivation. On the day of Pentecost, those three thousand all began to meet from house to house on the same day they were saved. No doubt there was a strong motivation with them. Their motivation was not just a method. The motivation was that they heard the word of the New Testament. They were all Jews filled with the old religion of their fathers, but on the day of Pentecost they heard something new. They heard Peter speaking the gospel of Jesus! They heard how Jesus was God, how Jesus became a man, how Jesus lived among them, how He was rejected and how He was put on the cross, crucified, yet God had honored Him, God raised Him up, and He was living. They all heard the message, they received the word, they repented, they were baptized, and they received the Holy Spirit. They heard the word and they believed it. Through believing in the word they all received the Holy Spirit; they were filled up. They had to meet; they had to gather in the homes. That was not a method, but an issue, an overflow from their being filled with these two things: the word and the Spirit.</p>
<p>What about us? I would say, in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today in the United States, most of the saints in all the churches are in a standstill condition. There is no motivation. They are like a car in which there is no gasoline and whose tires have no air. They are short of gas and short of air. Even the best car with no air in the tires and no gasoline is at a standstill. It needs more gasoline. It needs more air. We must send the saints to the &ldquo;gasoline station&rdquo; to fill up the tires with air and fill up the car with gas. Then the car will run. This is not a method. To simply have a method is to have a car without air and without gas which we push and pull. This is hard. The real situation needs to be exposed. In some places the churches now realize they are at a standstill and that they have become a Dead Sea.</p>
<p>What is going on in Taiwan is that the saints are experiencing the filling of the Spirit. All the young saints received the help to repent and to make a thorough confession to receive the filling of the Spirit. When they practiced repenting and making a thorough confession, they were filled with the Spirit inwardly, essentially, and they received the outpouring of the Spirit upon them outwardly, economically. Now they have become &ldquo;crazy,&rdquo; going out to contact people one on one. They baptize people nearly every day in Taipei. The baptistery is not only in the hall, but in the homes and everywhere. If there is no baptistery, they use the bathtub. They do not need the elders to make a decision as to who should be baptized or who should not be baptized. This is absolutely right. If you have the right to preach the gospel, why would you not have the right to baptize people? Philip in Acts 8 had the privilege, the right, and the position to preach the gospel to that eunuch and to immediately baptize him (vv. 36-37). He did not say, &ldquo;Oh, I am not an elder. I had better bring you back to the church in Samaria and let the church elders have an interview with you to see whether you are qualified to be baptized or not. I am not privileged and I do not have the position to baptize you. I am just an evangelist, not a baptizer. The baptizer should be one of the elders.&rdquo; We must forget this way. We must revolutionize!</p>
<p>Everybody can preach the gospel. Everyone can baptize someone anywhere. Acts 2:47 is now the experience of the church in Taipei&mdash;&ldquo;the Lord added together those who were being saved from day to day.&rdquo; I was in Taipei for about ten weeks. Within those ten weeks over three thousand were baptized, and these baptisms took place nearly every day and everywhere. On one occasion, without my knowledge, there was suddenly a gospel-preaching meeting in the hall and young people were baptizing other young people.</p>
<p>For the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to spread, there is the need of more increase, and there is the need of meetings with a higher atmosphere. The meetings in all the churches should be very attractive, even very attracting. In 1969-1971 in Los Angeles in the hall on Elden Street, the meetings were attractive and attracted everybody. While the saints were at work, they anticipated the end of the work day when they could go to the meeting.</p>
<p>What is needed today is the motivation. The motivation is the filling of the Holy Spirit. All the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today need to be filled with the Spirit and to be poured out upon by the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">DEALING SERIOUSLY WITH THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>My burden is that we would not follow the fundamental way or the Pentecostal way in dealing with the Word and the Spirit. The fundamental way is to emphasize the Word and neglect the Spirit, and the Pentecostal way is somewhat to emphasize the Spirit and neglect the Word. In the Bible we can see that as children of God and members of Christ we surely need to have the real experience in the holy Word, and to experience the Spirit of God, essentially and economically.</p>
<p>Both the Word and the Spirit are God. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God.&rdquo; John 4:24 also says, &ldquo;God is Spirit.&rdquo; God is the Word and God is the Spirit for the purpose of reaching us. Without being the Word and without being the Spirit, how could He reach us? It would be impossible. God&rsquo;s reaching us is in the Word and in the Spirit. Thank Him that He has given the Word and the Spirit as two great gifts to us. We have the gift of the Word in our hands and we have the gift of the Spirit in our spirit. Our problem is related to how we handle these two gifts.</p>
<p>Most of the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are at a standstill, not dealing with the Word and not dealing with the Spirit. Some may say that they are dealing with the Word by reading the Bible and even by studying the Bible and reading the Life-study Messages. I admit that this may be so, yet you are not so serious in studying the Bible; you read the Bible indifferently. We do not eat our food indifferently. Every day we eat our food seriously. If I would not eat properly and seriously I would die. Every morning I like to eat a banana and some yogurt. If my wife only provides me with oatmeal for breakfast, I will respond, &ldquo;Where are the banana and the yogurt?&rdquo; My response indicates that I eat seriously. My vigor comes from that serious eating.</p>
<p>Do you study the Bible so seriously? When you read the Bible do you look for &ldquo;the banana and the yogurt?&rdquo; You may read the Bible and the Life-study Messages, but not seriously. Paul said that some were &ldquo;inexperienced in the word of righteousness.&rdquo; The Hebrew believers should have been experienced in the word of righteousness. How many of us could say that we are really experienced in the Word of God and that we do mean business in reading the Word? In the polishing of the messages we are serious in dealing with the Word&mdash;just concerning the use of one preposition we may spend fifteen minutes or more. We might ask, &ldquo;Should we use &lsquo;of,&rsquo; or should we use &lsquo;in&rsquo; or &lsquo;with&rsquo;? Upon what verse is our decision based?&rdquo; This illustrates that we need to be serious to deal with the two great gifts bequeathed to us by the ascended Christ, the holy Word and the Holy Spirit. The Word is in our hand and the Spirit is in our spirit. However, we do not handle them seriously; we just deal with them indifferently. If this is so, then for the long run we will never be healthy and vigorous. We all must become experienced in the word, and we need to have the real experience of the infilling and outpouring of the Spirit. Then we will be full of air and full of gasoline; we will be a car that will run well.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING THE WORD WITH THE SPIRIT<br />
TO GAIN THE INCREASE</h2>
<p>To gain the increase you need the Word and the Spirit. In Acts 8 Philip the evangelist, charged and burdened by the Spirit, approached the chariot of an Ethiopian eunuch who was reading the Old Testament. He asked the eunuch, &ldquo;Do you really know what you are reading?&rdquo; (v. 30). The eunuch replied, &ldquo;How can I unless someone guides me?&rdquo; (v. 31). From the very chapter which that eunuch was reading, Isaiah 53, Philip expounded the holy Word to him (vv. 32-35).</p>
<p>If Philip would have had no idea or knowledge of that chapter, he could have said, &ldquo;Sir, I do not know much. You had better bring me to Jerusalem to see Peter. Probably Peter knows this, and will be able to help you.&rdquo; Although you have not actually said this, in principle what you have done was like this. When the one you were contacting referred something to you, you did not understand and did not know what to say. You may have said, &ldquo;Nevertheless, Christ is very good. The Lord is tasteful. Just taste and see that the Lord is good.&rdquo; People would ask, &ldquo;How good is He? In what way is He good?&rdquo; You may say, &ldquo;I cannot tell you, but He is good.&rdquo; You cannot gain people in this way. You have to be experienced in the Word. Whatever you are asked, you should have the right answer immediately, not out of your own thoughts, but out of the Word. If you say something without a base from the Scriptures, people will not regard that, but if you say something which the Bible says, this will be meaningful to them. If you have a pocket-sized version of the Bible, you can open it up and say, &ldquo;The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 15:45...&rdquo; Then you can turn to that verse and read it. People will have to respect you because you know the best book among all the books.</p>
<p>If you refer people to the Bible and give them Bible verses, you will surprise them. To do this you must become experienced in the Word. The thoughtful people, especially the young college students, are desirous of knowing things and substantiating them. You may go to a college student and say, &ldquo;The Bible tells us that Jesus Christ is God.&rdquo; He would say, &ldquo;Sir, show me. What verse in the Bible tells us this?&rdquo; To answer that you do not remember so well would surely weaken your speaking. You should show him some verses which prove this point. You could use John 1:1 and 14 which say that the Word was God and the Word became flesh. Such a thoughtful person may be bothered and say that the name Jesus Christ is not mentioned in these verses. Then you have to show him Romans 9:5, which says, &ldquo;Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever.&rdquo; This will convince people. Also, by being experienced in the Word you will find a way of salvation for people. You could present them first with Romans 3:23: &ldquo;All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.&rdquo; Then you could turn to John 3:16 and many other applicable verses. Your using of the Bible will convince them that you are not talking nonsensically, but that you are speaking something solid from the best book among the human race. Whenever the Bible is used in this way, the Holy Spirit always goes along with it. The Holy Spirit always honors the holy Word. Do not waste others&rsquo; time. Simply present something so precious and so definite out of the holy Word. This will give the Holy Spirit a way to inspire people.</p>
<p>In addition to the Word, you must have the Spirit with you. Since the time we were saved, we have had the Holy Spirit within us, but He has not been within us enough in an experiential way. We may not have any experience of the Spirit for a number of days. When we talk to people, we may not have the Spirit in our experience. To be filled with the Spirit both inwardly and outwardly we must make a thorough confession every day: &ldquo;Lord, cleanse me and clear me up. I would like to pour out all the dirt and junk from within me to let you have all the ground and all the space within me. Fill me up.&rdquo; If you have such a dealing with the Lord every day, even every moment, the Spirit within you will be so fresh in your experience. When you talk to people, even though they may not know what is there, they will realize that something within you is quite new and convincing. This is the Holy Spirit working with your speaking in the Word to help the sinners. By becoming experienced in the Word and in the inward filling and outpouring of the Holy Spirit we can do a living work to catch people for the Lord&rsquo;s increase.</p>
<p>We have found out that the way to gain people directly is by one on one contact. Do not talk to too many; simply talk to one person at a time. This was very much practiced by the Lord Jesus as seen in John 3. Nicodemus came to the Lord in the night, and the Lord dealt with one person, one on one. Nicodemus came to the Lord Jesus, but in John 4 the Lord went purposely from Jerusalem to Samaria to the very well of Jacob. There He waited for one Samaritan woman to come, and He spoke to her in the principle of one on one. In chapter eight He talked to a sinful woman, one on one. In chapter nine He talked to a blind man, one on one. In Luke 19 the Lord dealt with Zaccheus in the principle of one on one. Even Barnabas took hold of Paul when he was newly saved in the principle of one on one (Acts 9:26-27). We must learn to contact people one on one. This has been and still is very much practiced in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Over one hundred thirty young full-timers are in a training in Taipei at this time. All these young people were taught, instructed, and trained to go out on the streets, to go on the campuses, and to visit homes to simply contact people in the principle of one on one. They have learned the secret of talking to people in a very short way. Within fifteen minutes people are baptized. They use Bible verses through the Spirit, and they touch people&rsquo;s heart, feeling, conscience, and understanding. They catch people. There is no way for people to escape. They become convinced and captured; they repent and are baptized. These full-timers do not use vain talk, for they have learned that people frequently say that they are busy and do not have time. They tell people that they only desire to stay with them for ten minutes. Most people would not reject them. They spend ten minutes economically. Within these ten minutes they do not speak vain things; they speak the word from the Bible through the Spirit. Every day and everywhere they gain people. Once within one week some of the saints in Taipei plus the full-timers, baptized eleven hundred and four new believers. This is to gain the increase with the Word by the Spirit. You need to be experienced in the Word and you need to have the proper infilling and outpouring of the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT<br />
FOR THE LIVING MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Before the small group gatherings were established, the saints in Taipei were used to attending big meetings. In the large meetings one speaker took care of the speaking while they simply sat there to listen. Suddenly they were assigned to go to small meetings. There was no leader there, neither was there a speaker, a singer, or a reader. No one knew what to do, but gradually they began to exercise their spirit and use the Word. They began to realize how precious the Word was. They treasured the Word in a practical way. Now when they go to the small group meetings, they have a way to use the Word. They have also been helped greatly to get into the experience of the infilling and outpouring of the Spirit.</p>
<p>For us to exercise our spirit in the meetings requires much exercise in our daily life. We need to exercise our spirit in speaking the word to everybody. When you do not have anyone to speak to, you may practice speaking to dogs, to cats, or to the windows. You may practice speaking, practice the exercise of the spirit, and practice the belief in the infilling and outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Then it will not be difficult for you in the home meetings, regardless whether the attendants are unbelievers or believers. You will have a way to exercise your spirit to talk to people with the Word according to the need. The home meetings will become very flexible according to the situation because you can meet there with two or with ten, and you can meet with people from all levels of society.</p>
<p>Even the sisters may learn to be bold to speak something for the Lord, by giving a short testimony. The result, the effectiveness, and the power will be prevailing. Through the small meetings many will be saved. In Taipei at the beginning of the year they had three hundred ninety-nine small home meetings, and they may have more today. I encouraged them not to have small group meetings with over ten attendants. Once they reach ten, they divide into two groups. The fewer people there are in a small group meeting the better it is.</p>
<p>We all need to take the way of getting ourselves experienced in the word and experienced in the infilling and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit that we may come in a proper way to any kind of meeting. Then even in the large meetings we will be able to exercise our spirit to release the word. In the meeting we can speak a good hymn to one another. However, for you to speak a hymn you must be experienced in the holy Word because a good hymn is always composed according to the biblical revelation. If you do not have much knowledge and experience in the holy Word, it will be hard for you to speak the hymns. You will only be able to repeat the words and phrases.</p>
<p>In Colossians 3:16 and Ephesians 5:18 and 19 a few important words are mentioned. Colossians 3:16 mentions teaching, admonishing, and singing. Teaching and admonishing are not in the speaking of ordinary words, but in psalms. The psalms are used to teach and admonish people and also to sing. In Ephesians 5 the word speaking is used, as well as singing and psalming. In these verses are teaching, admonishing, speaking, singing, and psalming. To do all these things you need an adequate knowledge of the biblical terms. To speak forth Christ you have to exercise your understanding, your spirit, and your heart, with the proper words, phrases, and expressions, mostly from the Bible.</p>
<p>We need to get ourselves built up in the experience of the holy Word and built up in the experience of the infilling and outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Then in any meeting it will be easy for us to release something. This will enrich, uplift, and enliven the meeting making the meeting so living. Eventually the meeting will be upholding, attracting, preserving, and even embracing people. Whenever one comes into such a meeting he will never give up coming, but will continue to come again and again. It is by this way that we can retain and hold all the new increase. By going out to contact people in the principle of one on one we gain people. By meeting in such a living way we can keep people, teach people, educate people, and build people up with the proper supply of life and truth.</p>
<p>To gain the increase and to have the proper meetings requires our experience in the Word and our experience in the infilling and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. This is all that we need. I hope that we would be deeply impressed with our need today. We all need to go to the Lord: &ldquo;Lord, have mercy upon me. Give me the help that I would be serious in handling Your Word. I want to learn Your Word seriously. I would also like to make a thorough confession to get myself fully cleansed and thoroughly cleared up that You could have every inch of space within my whole being, to fill me up and to saturate me, and even to pour Yourself out upon me as the very power from on high. Then I will be a living person with Your Word and with Your Spirit. Then wherever I am I will be a speaking person. I will speak all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we practice this way, we will surely get the increase. It will be so easy for each one of us to gain a person monthly, to bear fruit every month like the tree of life (Rev. 22:2). However, at the present time not many among us even bear fruit yearly. If everybody bears one piece of fruit yearly, we will have a hundred percent increase yearly. If you daily practice what I have presented to you, be assured that you will gain people, not only one a year, but perhaps five, six, or ten a year, perhaps even twenty a year. Then, how could we count the increase? It would be beyond our counting. It will be doubled or tripled in one year. If this is the case, in a short time your hall will be filled up. We would not need to have the training or a conference to fill the hall. Simply in the weekly church meetings the hall will be crowded with people. I have seen this kind of situation in the past. But we all have to endeavor to become rich in this kind of experience. May the Lord have mercy on us and give us grace.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY IN MATERIAL THINGS<br />
CONCERNING OUR SERVICE TO THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. l:5b-6; Rom. 15:16; John 15:2, 5, 8; Matt. 25:14-15, 19, 21, 30; Acts 2:44-45; 2 Cor. 8:12-15; 1 Cor. 16:1-2; 2 Thes. 3:8-12; 1 Cor. 9:7-14; Phil. 1:5-6; 4:15-19; Acts 20:33-35; 18:1-4; 3 John 5-8; Luke 16:9-13</h1>
<p>In this chapter we want to fellowship concerning the most crucial and practical point of the many aspects and details concerning the matter of the believers serving the Lord full-time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRIESTS OF GOD, BRANCHES OF CHRIST,<br />
AND SLAVES OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>According to Revelation 1:5b-6 and Romans 15:16, all the believers are God&rsquo;s priests. Christ has died for us and redeemed us to God that we may be His priests. According to Old Testament typology, priests are persons who are professional. They do not do anything except serve God all day for their entire lives. Priests are the serving ones to offer offerings to God. The New Testament priests do not offer animal sacrifices but living persons to God. In Romans 15:16 Paul says, &ldquo;That I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Paul served God by ministering the gospel of God to the Gentiles to offer them to God for God&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p>
<p>The Lord also told us in John 15 that He is the vine and that all the believers are the branches of the vine. The branches of the vine tree are for the very expression, the very glorification, of the Triune God. To be a priest is to offer something to God for His satisfaction but to be a branch of Christ, of the vine tree, is for the purpose of expressing God, of glorifying Him in what He is in bearing fruit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the New Testament tells us that all the Lord&rsquo;s children are His servants and even His bondslaves. He is our Master, He has bought us, and we are His bondslaves, His servants. According to Matthew 25, the Lord has given us His talents (vv. 14-15). Talents signify spiritual gifts. In the parable of the talents in Matthew 25 the man who went into another country gave one of his slaves five talents, another two talents, and another one talent. The problem was with the last slave who received only one talent (vv. 24-26).</p>
<p>We must be clear that all the believers are priests, offering people to God, branches of the organic Christ to express God for His glory, and the Lord&rsquo;s servants to serve Him by making profit for His kingdom. The Lord told us that one day He will come back to settle accounts with us (Matt. 25:19). His settling accounts with us signifies His judgment at His judgment seat (2 Cor. 5:10; Rom. 14:10) where the believers&rsquo; life, conduct, and work will be judged for reward or punishment (1 Cor. 4:5; Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; 1 Cor. 3:13-15). It would be good if there were a bumper sticker that said&mdash;&ldquo;Christ will come to settle accounts with you.&rdquo; Are you ready to give Him an account? He is the believers&rsquo; Master and He has advised us to do business (Luke 19:13), to make profit for Him. One day He will come to check with us about our account. How much is on the credit side and not on the debit side? This is something quite serious.</p>
<p>No one can make more profit than what the Lord gives. If you have received five talents, the most you can make is five. If you have received two talents, the most you can make is two. You cannot make more than the Lord gives you, but you have to make profit. Those who make profit will receive a reward to be the co-kings with Christ and to enjoy His joy in the coming kingdom (Matt. 25:21, 23). We have not enjoyed that kind of joy yet. We have only had a little taste.</p>
<p>The kingship and the Lord&rsquo;s joy will be a reward to the faithful ones, but the unfaithful ones will be put into darkness (25:30). When the Lord judged Pharaoh and Egypt, He sent darkness upon them (Exo. 10:21-23). When you are not in the divine light, you are in darkness. To be in darkness is a real suffering. The unfaithful slaves shall be cast into the outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth (Matt. 25:30). This indicates a certain amount of suffering.</p>
<p>If we believe that the Lord&rsquo;s word is trustworthy, we have to believe His word in Matthew 25. This word is as trustworthy as the word in John 3:16. In my youth I was told to recite John 3:16, but no one ever told me to recite Matthew 25:19 and 30. Christ will come to settle accounts with you, and if you are not faithful, He will put you in darkness. Paul said that if he preached the gospel voluntarily he would have a reward (1 Cor. 9:16-17). But if we are not faithful, the Lord will surely punish us. Be certain that He will come to settle accounts with us. As saved believers we are the serving ones in three categories&mdash;priests, branches, and slaves. If we are saved, we have to rise up to serve. The Lord is calling us to rise up to serve God as His priests, as the branches of Christ, and as the slaves of the Lord.</p>
<p>The branches should bear fruit. That is their profession, their job, their business, and their duty. As branches of Christ, do we bear fruit? If we do not bear fruit, we will be cut off from the vine (John 15:2, 6). To be cut off from the vine indicates that we will miss and lose the enjoyment, the fellowship, of the vine tree&rsquo;s riches. If you do not bear fruit as a branch of Christ, you will be cut off and cast out, which is to be cut off from participation in the riches of the life of the vine.</p>
<p>Also, the branches who do not bear fruit by abiding in the vine are gathered and cast into the fire for burning (John 15:6). This does not refer to eternal perdition because in chapter ten of John, the Lord Jesus told us definitely that whoever receives Him will have eternal life and will by no means perish (v. 28). A regenerated believer has no way to perish. There are many verses which assure us concerning the security of our salvation, but if we believers do not bear fruit, there will be a certain kind of punishment. We will firstly be cut off from the participation in and enjoyment of the riches of Christ and then be cast into the fire. The Apostle Paul says the same thing in 1 Corinthians 3 where those believers whose Christian works are not approved by the Lord at His coming back will be saved so as through fire (v. 15). Through fire surely indicates punishment. The Bible indicates strongly that if we believers as priests of God, branches of Christ, and servants of the Lord would not be faithful, there will be a certain punishment assigned to us. This is not what I say, but what the Bible says. D. M. Panton said that many Christians may feel that they have a ticket for entering into the kingdom, but they will eventually discover that their ticket will not be honored.</p>
<p>We all have to rise up, but this does not mean that only the full-timers who give up their jobs are priests, branches, and slaves. All of us, even the smallest ones, are priests of God, branches of Christ, and slaves of the Lord. Therefore, we all have to rise up. When I ask you to rise up, I do not mean to rise up to be a missionary going to the mission field. We must come back to the pure Word, which tells us that we all are priests of God, branches of Christ, and slaves of the Lord. None of us can escape this fact. We have to rise up to do our duty; otherwise, we will be cut off and we will suffer punishment.</p>
<p>Again, the Lord&rsquo;s speaking for all of us to rise up is not just to those who can offer all their time to the Lord. In the New Testament there is no hint that those three thousand who were saved on the day of Pentecost gave up their jobs. They sold their possessions (Acts 2:45), but the Bible does not say that they gave up their jobs. Acts 18:1-3 tells us that Aquila had the trade of making tents as did the Apostle Paul, who labored with him in this trade for a while. We have to realize that many New Testament priests, branches, and slaves have jobs. All the priests, branches, and slaves do not have to be full-timers who give up their jobs. Was the Apostle Paul a full-timer who gave up his job? Sometimes he was and at other times he was not. When the circumstances under God&rsquo;s sovereignty allowed him to serve as a priest of the gospel with his full time, he did it. But sometimes the circumstances did not allow him to do this, so he worked with his hands making tents, not only to take care of his own need but also to take care of his co-workers&rsquo; need (Acts 20:34). In the New Testament there is not such a profession of preaching.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, the work of preaching the gospel can mostly be by full-timers. To work for the preaching of the gospel on the college campuses in the United States requires full-time laborers. The recovery has been in the United States for twenty-three years, and we have discovered that the spread of the gospel of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy requires a good number of full-time workers. But we all are priests who should serve God by ministering the gospel to the sinners to make them offerings to God. We all are branches who should bear fruit for the multiplication, the glorification, the expression, of God the Father. We all are slaves who have received at least one talent with which we must do business for the Lord. We are responsible for what we do with this talent and we have to give an account to the Lord at His coming back. It is not necessary for us to be a full-time worker to go to our neighborhood. We can go to our friends, colleagues, relatives, and neighbors. All of us can preach and teach the truth in the evenings, on the weekends, and on holidays. All of us can speak for the Lord in the meetings. All of this is included in the rising up and the going out. To rise up does not mean that you will be a full-time worker, and to go out does not mean that you need to be a full-time worker. If you are not a full-time worker, you can still rise up and go out.</p>
<p>When the full-time workers are doing much work on the college campuses, the saints who are not the full-time workers can also surely participate in that work. In 1985 some full-time workers went to Berkeley, California, and caught approximately two hundred contacts for the Lord. Then many of the saints in the Bay Area who were not full-timers picked up the burden to care for these two hundred contacts. In Taipei, Taiwan there are at least one hundred thirty full-time workers working on the campuses. There are also approximately two hundred saints who are not full-time workers helping them. They can go with the full-time workers on the weekend to do something on the college campuses. None of us should be discouraged or disappointed if we cannot do the Lord&rsquo;s work with our full time. If the Lord is not allowing us to take the full-time way, we can still rise up and go.</p>
<p>If the Lord is calling us to work for Him with our full time, we should not shrink back, withdraw, or try to escape from His calling and inner leading. Be at peace to follow His leading. If He leads you to take the full-time way, you have to go this way. If He keeps you in your locality to do your job to serve Him as a branch, a slave, and a priest to support the full-time work, you will be rewarded.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SUPPLY OF FULL-TIME WORKERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Living of the Gospel</h2>
<p>Paul told us that &ldquo;those who announce the gospel live of the gospel&rdquo; (1 Cor. 9:14). The ones who give up their job to serve the Lord full-time should live by announcing the gospel. But practically speaking where will your material supply come from? When I came to the United States in the early sixties, I had no personal source of income. Some of the brothers here in the United States may have thought that the saints in the Far East were helping to take care of my living. At the same time, the saints in the Far East may have thought that since I was now in the United States, the brothers here would take care of my material supply. A brother who took care of my 1964 income tax return told me that I had only received six hundred dollars for the entire year of 1964 from the church in Los Angeles, which I was serving very much at that time. You may wonder how I lived. I lived by preaching the gospel. I do not know quite well from whom I received my material supply.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Practice of the China Inland Mission</h2>
<p>About sixty years ago, the Lord began His recovery among us brothers in China, and one of the things we studied was how the Lord&rsquo;s full-time servants could be taken care of. The general way practiced by many Christian groups is to raise funds through some organizational means. Then trained theological students are hired to be the ministers, pastors, preachers, or missionaries. Among so many Christian groups, however, the China Inland Mission formed by Hudson Taylor was different. Hudson Taylor did not take the organized way of raising support for himself and his fellow workers. He trusted in the Lord for his living and work. He let the Christians on this earth know that there was a work under his hand called the China Inland Mission so that whoever was burdened to give would have the opportunity. Many Christians from different denominations, from different countries, and other sources donated a lot for his work. He did not organize the money to hire people, but he told his co-workers that they were not sure how much they could receive of the Lord. All the missionaries had to go out by faith, trusting the Lord for their living. There was no promise as to what their salary would be. They did not know how much they would receive monthly, quarterly, or yearly. They were only told to go by faith, trusting the Lord. Whatever material supply was received by the China Inland Mission headquarters was sent to all the missionaries on a percentage basis. If very little material supply was received for one month, then very little was sent to all the missionaries on the field, so they had to trust in the Lord. This was the best way we saw among Christian groups to take care of the Lord&rsquo;s work purely. However, we still did not feel that this way was altogether according to the way shown in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Biblical Way</h2>
<p>In the Bible we see no organization, no control of money, and no hiring or firing. There is no organization and no financial center controlling and distributing the finances. All the full-time co-workers like Peter and Paul trusted the Lord to receive their supply either from the saints individually or from the churches corporately. If at any time they could not receive an adequate supply, they worked. Paul made tents for his needs and for the needs of his co-workers when the material supply was lacking. Because we made a resolution to do everything according to the Bible when we were young, we took the Biblical way. The Bible does not tell us so much in clear words what to do concerning the supply of full-time workers. In the New Testament we can only find some principles and some examples. The principle is that we should not have any organization or any financial control, but we should only trust in the Lord and serve Him as priests, as branches, and as slaves. We all should serve whether we go full-time, part-time, or whether we still have a full-time job. We all have to go. We all have to serve. The ones who do not go full-time will have a job and some regular income. Then they need to spend every cent they have received under God&rsquo;s sovereignty for God&rsquo;s interest. This is the principle in the New Testament. We cannot find any hint that the Lord wants us to organize something to control the finances in a center to hire people. This is according to the Biblical revelation in principles and in examples.</p>
<p>I have been serving the Lord full-time since 1933 and I have experienced the Lord&rsquo;s faithfulness, the saints&rsquo; love, and the churches&rsquo; care. I also have experienced both being in poverty and having material riches. When I began the ministry in the United States twenty-three years ago, I did not have any burden to encourage any saint to go full-time. As the years progressed some of the saints had no choice but to take the full-time way in their localities. When these ones began to serve the Lord full-time in their localities, the church spontaneously took care of their need. This does not mean, though, that they were hired by their churches.</p>
<p>We can realize that now there is a great need to spread the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. According to the need of the present world, the truths that the Lord has shown us, and the blessing that we have received of the Lord, we surely must take a further step, even a giant step, for the spreading of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The time has come not only in the Far East, but also in the United States for us to rise up to take a giant step to have as many full-timers as possible to go out to spread the truth. It has been proven in Taiwan that the full-time workers&rsquo; going out to spread the truth has been much blessed by the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">Having Everything in Common</h2>
<p>At the very beginning of the church life recorded in the book of Acts, the saints were, no doubt, under the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s move. On the day of Pentecost at least over three thousand saints were touched by the Lord to have everything in common. This was only practiced for a short time at the initiation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy; it did not continue for the long run as a practice of legality in the church life during Paul&rsquo;s ministry, as proven by his words in 2 Corinthians 9 and other places. The practice to have all things in common could not go on too long because there are many practical things involved. Acts 6:1 shows us that the distribution of food among them became a problem. Even under the move of the Holy Spirit, to practice having everything in common was hard. The New Testament shows us that this way did not last very long. Eventually the &ldquo;full moon&rdquo; of having everything in common waned. In Acts 20:34 Paul told us that he worked to take care of his needs and to take care of the ones who were with him. If everything were still in common by that time, there would have been no need for Paul to work. This verse in Acts 20 shows that by that time having everything in common was over.</p>
<p>In 1943 there was a great revival in the church in Chefoo, my hometown in China. Over the course of a one-hundred-day period, everyone donated nearly everything he owned. Some saints dared not to look at anything in their home when they returned after the meeting. Whatever they looked at, there was the urge within to give it to the church. The saints&rsquo; offering of everything eventually became a big problem to us. Nearly all the possessions of the approximately eight hundred saints in the church in Chefoo were offered to the church. Then we wondered how all the saints were going to live.</p>
<p>I looked to the Lord very much and considered what to do. I realized that I and the church could not bear such a burden. It seemed that the best way was for the church to keep a small part of the offerings and return the rest to the saints, telling them that from now on they should not use anything for themselves. They must use everything for the Lord, but their possessions must still be in their hands and not in the church&rsquo;s hands. It was through this offering that seventy saints, including husbands, wives, and children, were sent to inner Mongolia from Chefoo. The church supported them, giving them enough material supply to live in inner Mongolia for three months. These seventy were all sent at the same time on one boat. Another thirty were sent to the city of Antung in Manchuria with the church supplying their daily needs for three months.</p>
<p>Other Christian groups throughout the course of church history also tried to practice having everything in common, but no one has succeeded. What happened on the day of Pentecost with the believers having all things common was wonderful but temporary. We have seen that later Aquila had a job and Paul, a full-time worker, worked with him in the same trade. We must realize though that the principle of having all things common still remains. It does not remain in the way practiced in Acts 2 and 4, but in the way practiced by Paul in Acts and taught by him in his Epistles.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Principle of Equality</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 8:12-15 Paul says we must give willingly according to what we have. Those who gathered much will have no excess, and those who gathered little will have no lack. The result of such giving and receiving is what Paul calls &ldquo;equality&rdquo; (v. 14). Equality equals having everything common, but there are different means of practicing this.</p>
<p>There is an old proverb which says, &ldquo;There has never been a rich family that has lasted for three generations.&rdquo; Every rich man wants his riches to last forever, but God is sovereign to balance the social wealth. I have seen rich people whose grandchildren become poor and poor people whose grandchildren became rich. I have also seen rich Christians who loved the Lord in a sense, but they loved money more. Money was much greater and more important to them than God. They saved a lot of money for their grandchildren, but eventually all their grandchildren became poor mainly by squandering their riches nonsensically. It is hard to see a second generation among Christians who kept the riches of the first generation. God is sovereign to balance the social wealth.</p>
<p>If you want to make much money and retain it for your children and grandchildren, the end result will be a failure. The best way for us to train our children is to tell them that we only give them three kinds of assets: the Lord Jesus with His salvation, education, and morality. These are the only three things we should bequeath to our children. Let them inherit these three things. Concerning other things, it is best not to give them too much; otherwise, you will corrupt and damage them.</p>
<p>We must remember that God&rsquo;s principle is to have equality. Even in the Old Testament there is the divine way to balance the social wealth. None of the Jews could sell their property forever. At the most, they could only sell it for fifty years. In the year of jubilee everything was returned to the original owner (Lev. 25:8-17). God&rsquo;s way is to keep equality. In practice this is more practical than having everything common. Having everything common will cause many practical problems. The principle we keep is the principle of equality in 2 Corinthians 8. This is just like the receiving of manna in the Old Testament (Exo. 16:18). If you receive more, God will sovereignly arrange for you to have no excess. If you receive less, by God&rsquo;s sovereignty you will have no lack. The manna that some of the children of Israel tried to save so they could have some excess &ldquo;bred worms and stank&rdquo; (Exo. 16:20). This is the principle of equality.</p>
<p>Some may feel that since God keeps equality and that we will never lack anything, that there is then no need for them to do any work. Paul, however charged the saints in Thessalonica that &ldquo;if anyone does not want to work, neither let him eat&rdquo; (2 Thes. 3:10b). A person should eat his own food (3:12) and should not be burdensome to others. This means that a person should go to work and not look to others to support him.</p><h2 class="head2">Fellow Workers in the Truth</h2>
<p>On the other hand, the Bible encourages us to support the full-time workers. Third John 5-8 tells us we need to take care of, support, and send the traveling full-time workers forward on their way in a way that matches God, who is generous. If we support the full-timers, we are participating, sharing in, their work for the truth, and we become &ldquo;fellow workers in the truth&rdquo; (v. 8). We are not directly taking part of the full-time work, but we are indirectly sharing the same work. The believers ought to support and undertake for the need of the brothers who work for God in His divine truth and who take nothing from the Gentiles. Therefore, if you do not have the burden to be full-time, you should make more money for the Lord&rsquo;s interest. Do not work merely to support yourself, but also to support the full-time workers. Even the wives whose husbands are full-time workers could work to support their husbands and other full-timers if possible. This will be greatly blessed by the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Fellowship unto the Gospel</h2>
<p>Many of the saints in the church in Philippi were not full-time workers, but they had fellowship with Paul in the furtherance of the gospel by supplying Paul&rsquo;s daily needs. Paul told the Philippians &ldquo;that in the beginning of the gospel, when I went out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the account of giving and receiving but you only; for even in Thessalonica you sent both once and again to my need. Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit which increases to your account. But I have all things and abound; I have been filled, receiving from Epaphroditus the things from you, a fragrant odor, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God&rdquo; (Phil. 4:15-18). It is by this way that the Philippians shared in the preaching of Paul&rsquo;s ministry. They gave much support to Paul financially (4:10, 15, 16) to further the preaching of the gospel and the spreading of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Prudent Steward</h2>
<p>In Luke 16 the Lord Jesus tells us that we should be the prudent stewards to use the present money of unrighteousness to make friends for ourselves (v. 9). When we give to support the full-time workers for the furtherance of the spreading of the Lord&rsquo;s truth, many will be saved. These saved ones will become our friends in the coming kingdom age. In the age to come many who were saved through our giving will welcome us into the eternal tabernacles. It would be so good if we all had many welcomers to receive us into the eternal tabernacles.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus concludes His fellowship regarding the prudent steward in Luke 16 by saying that no steward can serve two lords. &ldquo;You cannot serve God and mammon&rdquo; (16:13). We all have to receive this fellowship not only as a teaching but also as a warning. Thank the Lord if He has given you a high education and a high position with a very good opportunity to make a lot of money. This is really the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, but be careful how you use this money. You may not be in the proper environment or have the burden or gift to be full-time to preach the gospel, teach the truth, and minister life to others; yet you may have an ability, by the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty, to make a lot of money. This money needs to be spent in the Lord&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>To hire people by organizations or to raise funds under a certain kind of central control is altogether man&rsquo;s doing, replacing God as the Master. We cannot take this way, but we have to take the biblical way. I believe the fellowship in this chapter can provide us with a sketch of the New Testament revelation of God&rsquo;s economy in material things concerning our service to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR PRACTICE CONCERNING THE PRODUCING<br />
AND SUPPORTING OF FULL-TIMERS</h2>
<p>Now we need to practice according to what is revealed in the Bible. A number of saints should rise up to go out as full-timers. The rest of us should rise up to go to our neighbors, friends, relatives, and colleagues. At the same time, we need to make money, not to be rich and not only for our living but also for the support of the full-time workers going out. This is the biblical way.</p>
<p>Since we are against organization and human control, we must ask how we are going to distribute all the gifts given by the saints for the support of the full-time workers. In 1958 I went to Toronto, Canada, to see the People&rsquo;s Church. I was told that for every twenty members in their congregation, they sent out one missionary. Their building and furniture were very old because they saved nearly every cent for sending out missionaries. I believe that one full-time worker out of twenty saints is a good principle for us to follow. In the Old Testament one tribe out of twelve became full-time&mdash;the tribe of Levi. One out of twelve Israelites was a full-time worker. Among the one hundred twenty in Acts, at least twelve were full-time workers. This is one out of ten in the principle of tithing. One out of twenty is five percent. We believers at least should give one tenth of our income to the Lord in the principle of the Old Testament. Five percent of our income should be given to support full-time workers.</p>
<p>If we mean business with the Lord for the spreading of all the truths He has shown us, we all have to bear the burden to give five percent of our income purely, solely, and definitely separate for the full-time workers&rsquo; support. Every time you give to the Lord through the church, five percent of your income should be given to the Lord to support full-time workers for His propagation. Every church that has at least twenty members should practice this. A church smaller than twenty may still have one or two among them who are burdened to be full-time. Suppose a church can only support one full-timer, but two among them are burdened and qualified to be full-time. One of these two should not be told to go back and get a job. Some churches may have twenty members with no full-time workers. Then their five percent can be given to a church that has an extra number of full-time workers. This is done not by organization but by fellowship.</p>
<p>I hope all the churches will begin to practice this regardless of whether or not they have full-time workers and regardless of how many workers they have. The leading ones should fellowship with the saints concerning giving five percent of their income for the full-time workers. Then the church should set up a separate account for the support of full-timers whether it has a full-timer or not. The funds in this account will eventually be useful. The Lord desires many full-time workers for His present move. Within 1986 I expect that all the churches in the United States would have between four and five hundred full-time workers.</p>
<p>If a church of one hundred saints only has three full-time workers, they should have an extra supply for two other full-time workers. Through fellowship with the other churches, they will be able to realize where there are places with full-time workers who need support. We all need to pray and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading regarding this matter. There should only be a principle set up with no regulation. The church needs to take care of the principle of setting aside five percent of the offerings for the full-time workers. But this does not exclude the saints from giving to the full-timers directly.</p>
<p>Among so many candidates for full-time work, a few should be encouraged to go back to their jobs because they are not so suitable, so profitable, for being full-time. Mainly they do not have the gift to teach and to preach, but they are very good in business. The full-timers also need a high education to preach and teach the truths on the college campuses. If someone has not gotten his college degree, even though he may be qualified, he should be encouraged to go back to finish college or to do a job. Then this person could make more money to help the Lord&rsquo;s work. This will not be controlled by anyone but will be observed and realized by the church in each locality. If you feel that you should go full-time, fellowship with the leading ones in your locality and with all the other full-time workers. By fellowshipping you will find out how the Lord is leading you. The leading co-workers will help in the training of the full-time workers.</p>
<p>I recently received a letter from a brother who told me that he did not have the way to serve the Lord full-time, but that he had the deep conviction and desire to be the same as the ones who were able. He said that he was ready to pour out with whatever material supply was needed and closed his letter with this statement: &ldquo;A partner with you in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.&rdquo; This letter was very encouraging to me.</p>
<p>The principle according to the New Testament is this&mdash;we trust in God. We do not control or take the way of organization, but leave the matter of support completely in the Lord&rsquo;s hands. We do not control the saints but do our best to help them, to train them, and to tell them the truth.</p>
<p>When Brother Nee was young and serving the Lord full-time, he lived in poverty, not receiving that much support. In 1948 we had a conference in Shanghai and Brother Nee stood up to say that he eventually started a business because nearly two hundred co-workers died of tuberculosis due to their lack of food supply. When he said this he wept and all of us wept in the meeting. In China every widow who remarried would be despised. He said that his going into business was like a widow remarrying, but that he did this not for himself but for his children.</p>
<p>Today the United States and Taiwan are rich countries and there is no need for us to suffer the way we did in China. The saints&rsquo; incomes are more than adequate for the full-time workers&rsquo; support. We would not organize anything or put anything in our control. Instead we leave the whole matter to the Lord. We have to pray that the Lord would bless the United States and use it for His ultimate move. Meanwhile, we should be faithful to Him in doing our jobs, not for a higher standard of living, not for bigger homes or bigger cars, but for the advancement, the furtherance, of the gospel.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY TO PRACTICE<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S PRESENT MOVE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 5:42; 1 Cor. 14:26; 12:8; 1 Tim. 3:2; 5:17</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, how we worship You and thank You that You have raised up Your recovery in these final days. Thank You, Lord, that You have opened up Your Word to us and have unveiled to us so many truths concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and the Triune God being processed and consummated. Lord, we thank You for this time. Thank You for Your present move among us. Lord, we all are here. We want to tell You that we are ready. Lord, have Your way and have a free course among us and in each one of us. Spread Your move throughout the United States and throughout the entire world. Lord, gain the glory and carry us on. Do not let us go. We like to cooperate with You. Thank You for Your mercy and thank You for Your grace. Amen.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we want to see the way to practice the Lord&rsquo;s present move. We do not want to practice anything in the past or even anything practiced among us in the United States in the past twenty-three years. We want to practice the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date move. The Lord is moving. Since Genesis 3 right after the fall of man the Lord began to move. He moved through Abel. He moved through Enosh. He moved through Enoch. He moved through Noah. He moved through Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He moved through Moses, Samuel, David, and so many others in the Old Testament. He moved through John the Baptist. He moved through the very embodiment of the Triune God, Jesus Christ, and He moved through the apostles. He moved throughout church history through many of His loving seekers. The Lord is also moving right now.</p>
<p>Our God is neither dead nor dormant, but He is living and moving here and now. The Lord is still moving on this earth among us and with us. We have the assurance to say that the Lord is moving among us up to the present day. We are talking about the way to practice the Lord&rsquo;s <em>present</em> move. Do not refer back to Elden Hall in Los Angeles. That was in the past. We are not talking about that, but about the Lord&rsquo;s present move. We all should be excited about His present move. Praise Him for the up-to-date way to practice His present move.</p>
<h2 class="head1">1. TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT<br />
INWARDLY AND OUTWARDLY</h2>
<p>The first point of the up-to-date way to practice the Lord&rsquo;s present move is to be filled! The way is to be filled, not with culture, religion, or education, but with the Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. We need to be filled with such a Spirit inwardly and outwardly, essentially and economically, for life and for work.</p>
<p>We should remember that we are not filled once for all. What Christ has accomplished is once for all, but what we have to experience is not. Time after time, day after day, morning after morning, evening after evening, all day long, we have to experience being filled with this wonderful, all-inclusive, processed, consummated Spirit for our entire lives. Every day in the morning the first thing we have to pray is, &ldquo;Lord, fill me afresh. Fill me, Lord. Fill me with Yourself as the consummated Spirit. I like to have You filling me up within and without. I want to be wrapped up and mingled with You.&rdquo; Every morning you should pray this prayer&mdash;&ldquo;Fill me up, Lord. Fill me up!&rdquo; I would like to hear many testimonies that even in your dreams you are crying out, &ldquo;Lord, fill me up! I need You to fill me up! Saturate, infuse, transfuse, soak and permeate me!&rdquo; Exhaust all the verbs in the dictionary to tell the Lord you want Him to fill you up. Do this every day. Tell the Lord, &ldquo;I was too dormant, but now I want to rise up by being filled with You.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forget about Elden Hall. Forget about yesterday&rsquo;s enjoyment of Christ. You need a fresh enjoyment. You need something up-to-date. The Lord was there in Elden Hall, but He is not there now. He is here presently moving in His recovery and He is in you. Wherever you are, He is in you, and He is in you right now. Do you believe He is repeating all the things He did in the past? He is not repeating anything. He is always going on and on and on. The Lord is working. He is moving.</p>
<p>Are you a person of yesterday? All of us should be people of today. Every day is a today. With some people every day is tomorrow and with others every day is yesterday. Some of the saints may say, &ldquo;How good it was in 1952 when I got saved!&rdquo; Even to look back to 1982 is to not be up-to-date. Do not look ahead to the future and do not look back to the past. We are people of today. Do not talk about your old experiences in the past. Talk about your experience today. Be filled today! Be filled, not yesterday nor tomorrow, but today! Every day is a today! We do not have yesterday. We had yesterday, but we do not have it now. We will never have tomorrow. All the time we have is today. Every day is a today! When we enter into the New Jerusalem, we will have today since every day in eternity is today. The only day we have is today. Be filled inwardly today! Be filled outwardly today! Be filled today!</p><h2 class="head1">2. TO PREACH <br />
THE GOSPEL AND TEACH THE TRUTHS<br />
ANY TIME AND ANY PLACE BY DIVING INTO THE WORD<br />
FOR THE INCREASE AND PROPAGATION OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>We should not preach a superficial, superstitious, or low gospel. Some saints in Taiwan began to call our Recovery Version &ldquo;the gold bar&rdquo; because of the precious, valuable truths it contains. On this basis, I would say that we all need to preach &ldquo;the gold bar gospel&rdquo; and teach &ldquo;the gold bar truths.&rdquo; We need to teach the truths of the processed and consummated Triune God and of the enjoyment of the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation by living in the organism of the divine Trinity and participating in the dispensing of the divine Trinity. We need to teach the truths concerning the New Testament economy of God and concerning God, Christ, the Spirit, the believers, the church, the kingdom, and the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>We preach the gospel and teach the truths by diving into the Word. By diving into &ldquo;the gold bar&rdquo; we will be enabled and equipped to preach and to teach. Whatever we are filled with inwardly is what we will utter. We have to be filled with all the truths by diving into the Word. We need to fill our entire house with Life-studies. Scatter all the Life-studies throughout your house so that every room has some Life-studies in it. We should only spend about five minutes to read the front page of the newspaper to get the proper knowledge of the world situation. Besides eating, sleeping, exercising for our health, and working, we should use all our time to dive into the Word. If you open to any page of the Recovery Version and read one of the notes, you will receive the profit. We have the Recovery Version of the New Testament, the Life-studies, <em>The Conclusion of the New Testament,</em> and the <em>Truth Lessons,</em> systematizing the entire Bible into one hundred ninety-two lessons. We need to get ourselves saturated, infused, filled, and soaked with all the truths contained in these writings. Then whenever you talk, you will talk the truth.</p>
<p>We all should preach the gospel and teach the truths any time and any place. Our preaching and teaching should have no limit of time and space. We preach and teach by diving into the truths. Do not think that it is only the job of the full-time workers to go out to preach and to teach. We all are priests of God, branches of Christ, and slaves of the Lord, so every day at any time and any place we preach and teach what the Lord has revealed to us.</p>
<p>We need to somewhat forget about our own enjoyment and think about the Lord&rsquo;s propagation and the Lord&rsquo;s increase. Think about the thousands of dear Christian brothers in your vicinity who need the truth which you have. They need the truth in the Recovery Version and in the Life-study Messages. They need us to go to them to read one page or one paragraph of our publications with them. They will receive the light. If we go to others again and again in this way our entire locality and region will be enlightened. We need to go out to spread the marvelous truths the Lord has shown us.</p>
<p>Our place is the best place for the Lord to propagate Himself, to get an increase for Himself. The leading ones should not be the only ones who enter into the preaching of the gospel and the teaching of the truths. Even the smallest ones among us should do this. In Berkeley, California, many young teenagers who passed through the summer school to study the truths concerning God&rsquo;s economy went to the campus to talk to the professors and students about the Triune God, about God&rsquo;s creation of man being for the purpose of expressing Him, and about man being a vessel, a container, to contain God. That surprised many people on the campus. This should not only be done once in a while, but once a week on the weekends. Hundreds of young boys and girls can go to the campus to tell others who the Triune God is and why He created them. If they cannot explain that much, they can open the Recovery Version to let the ones they contact read something for themselves.</p>
<p>All the saints in the recovery, old and young alike, need to go out. Go to visit your neighbor with your Recovery Version and take with you many of the rainbow booklets we have published, which contain a slightly edited version of the Life-study Messages, for the purpose of distribution. We have thousands of copies of these booklets in storage and are continuing to print more, but many of the churches have not picked up the burden to carry out the distribution. It is not a requirement for you to read all the booklets before you go to distribute them. Put some booklets into your pocket and go to your neighbor. The booklets you choose will sovereignly be the right ones for your neighbor. The titles of these booklets are capturing. By reading some of the titles of the booklets to a new one, they will be attracted to the truths contained in them. We have booklets with titles such as: <em>A Proper Living in the Relationship between Wife and Husband, The Surpassing Greatness of God&rsquo;s Power, The Hope of God&rsquo;s Calling, A Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation, The Spirit&mdash;the Pledge of Our Inheritance, The Sealing of the Holy Spirit,</em> and <em>Chosen to Be Holy.</em> If you would spend five minutes with your neighbor to give him these booklets and read the titles to him, you have done a marvelous job. We should go out to saturate all the homes with these booklets, and we have to do this to the uttermost. We should fill, saturate, and soak the homes in our localities with all the truths we have in our hands, in our hearts, and on all the tapes. The publications are the weapons and the bullets to fight the spiritual warfare. The ministry offices in Taiwan and Irving are the arsenals creating all the weapons. Many of these weapons are stored in Anaheim and Irving. We are printing every day in Irving and Taiwan to create more and more weapons, but we need some soldiers to use them.</p><h2 class="head1">3. TO PRODUCE AND SUPPORT<br />
THE FULL-TIMERS</h2>
<p>If a country, a nation, is going to be strong, it must produce and support an army. Not everyone goes to the battle, but some younger, strong, bolder, and daring ones have to be in the army. The rest of us should do everything to support our army. The full-timers may receive their support from the church or from individual saints, but they should take nothing from the Gentiles (3 John 7). Do not be bothered that some full-timers might receive more than others. Remember that there is the principle of equality (2 Cor. 8:14). If we do not keep the principle of equality, the Lord will keep it for us. We do not need to be bothered, though, because we have the living God in us. We have the principle of equality working in us.</p>
<p>When we receive more, we should give more. If you receive more, do not spend that much. My wife and I always practice to save something for the Lord&rsquo;s interest. When we give our money to the Lord for His move, it goes to our bank in heaven (Matt. 6:20). It is more blessed to give than to receive (Acts 20:35). An older brother in Taiwan who was over ninety years old had saved seventy-five thousand dollars. When he heard the news about our plan to build a training center at Lin-Ko, he decided to give this entire amount for that purpose. I thank the Lord that there are many stories like this in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Do not only think about your need; think about the Lord&rsquo;s need.</p>
<p>When we were building the meeting hall in Anaheim, California, I spent day after day in its design. The entire hall, basically speaking, was designed by me. Although I am a layman in civil engineering, I spent much time to design the stairways. About eighty young people dedicated half a year to help build this hall. When the building work was nearing completion, they told me they wanted to build a house for me. At that time, I was living in an apartment. While they were busy working on that house, I was still busy working on the meeting hall. One late night, I went back to see the house. When I saw many sisters there painting the walls, I was moved nearly to tears. That was quite inspiring. I did not care for my need but for the Lord&rsquo;s house. But He sent so many dear saints to build a house for me and take care of my need. They finished that house within eight weeks so my family could be moved in before the training.</p>
<p>One pair of doors in my house is uneven; one door is about one-eighth inch longer than the other, but I do not want to adjust it. I love those two doors because they were built by my dear brothers. In my bedroom the sliding doors of the closet do not fit the corner of the frame, but I will not let anyone adjust it. I want to keep that as a souvenir of all the divine love the Lord has exercised over me. When we were being moved in, I was still busy on the stairways in the Anaheim meeting hall. My testimony is this&mdash;if you work for the Lord, He will take care of you. When you receive more, do not keep it for yourself. When you receive more, give to the Lord.</p>
<p>I also like to see my co-workers live well. If they live poorly, I am unhappy. Do not expect others to take care of your co-workers. You have to help them. Furthermore, all the co-workers need to give at least ten percent of their income to the Lord. I can testify that the more I give to the Lord, the more He gives. The Lord&rsquo;s loving care is within us, and this working principle of equality is within us.</p>
<p>We all should do our best to save money to spend on the Lord&rsquo;s interest. Everyone should offer five percent of his income for the full-timers&rsquo; support and the church should put this into a separate account. I do not mean that any of us should live poorly but that we should not live excessively. Do not live a life that exceeds the proper necessity. You know how much you should save and how much to be restricted in your spending. The Lord will lead you. We should always have the thought of saving something for our Lord. If you can maintain a good living by nine hundred dollars, do not maintain it by one thousand dollars. Save the extra one hundred dollars for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. I do not mean that you should not have any savings. You must keep something for your children&rsquo;s education. The Lord does not want us to be foolish people. We have to keep a proper budget and we should do well in our job to take care of our wife and children properly. We still should have some surplus to offer to the Lord. We are living in the United States, a very rich country. The Lord will bless us if we give to Him faithfully. If we would all practice giving in this way, many things could be done for the Lord, and He will have a free way to go on.</p>
<p>All the elders need to fellowship with all the saints about these things and even promote them. Promote the infilling and the outward filling of the Holy Spirit with the saints. Promote the preaching of the gospel and the teaching of the truth in your locality. Promote the producing and the supporting of the full-timers. Do this every week. We are here for the Lord&rsquo;s propagation and increase.</p>
<p>In one message I said, &ldquo;In Canada you brothers have to go back to make noise. Don&rsquo;t let those people sleep so peacefully. Give them an alarm clock. Don&rsquo;t let them sleep. Wake them up. Wake them up. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been in Canada for over twenty years. How many are there? Just a small number.&rdquo; Some of the brothers from Canada went back and made a big poster of this statement and put it in their meeting hall. What I said to the Canadian brothers I say also to you. Elders, make some noise in your locality. Do not let those people sleep so peacefully. They have been sleeping too well. Give them an alarm clock. Wake them up! Elders, wake yourselves up first and then wake up others. The churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have been sleeping peacefully for quite a long time. Do not sleep anymore but wake up! Go to preach. Go to teach. Wake up! Rise up! Go! The Lord needs the propagation and the increase. Go to teach and to preach any time and anywhere. We need an army. We need bolder ones, stronger ones, who dare to die, to be full-timers to form an army.</p>
<p>The elders have many things to do. To produce full-timers is not an easy task or a light matter. It needs a lot of work. The elders need to fellowship with all those who intend to go full-time to find out whether or not they are qualified. Is their education adequate? Is their character proper? Some dear saints who love the Lord have a poor character. They always do things loosely and always treat people carelessly. They may think that Mark has twenty-eight chapters and that Matthew has sixteen chapters. When they are asked to turn to a particular book of the Bible, they may not know where it is located. They also may not possess the adequate spiritual vocabulary and utterance to preach the gospel and to teach the truths.</p>
<p>The elders have been with the saints for years and should know everyone. We depend upon the elders to exercise their discernment to make a decision as to whether someone in their locality is qualified to go full-time. It depends upon that person&rsquo;s education, spiritual qualification, gifts, and character. Is he a person who can endure trials and suffer poverty? Paul said that he knew how to be abased and how to abound (Phil. 4:12). By His mercy, I have learned how to be poor. I was poor for a long time, having gone through a long tunnel and a long night of poverty. Now I have learned how to abound. By His mercy, I have distributed much money in recent years. A full-timer should be a person who can endure suffering, suffer poverty, and withstand riches. Anyone that cannot stand the test of riches is not qualified to be a full-timer. If money comes to you and God becomes second to your money, you are not qualified to serve the Lord full-time.</p>
<p>I was happy to see that so many responded to the call for full-timers, but everyone must realize that there will be a proper sifting. Not everyone who desires to be a full-timer should be a full-timer. The producing of full-timers also involves moving in the Body as the one new man by fellowshipping locally and universally. One who becomes a full-timer will not pass a formal exam, but a spontaneous test through all the churches as to whether or not he is qualified. An army cannot be formed with loose people. A person must be trained and disciplined and his character must be built up; otherwise, he cannot be a soldier in the army. The people in the air force must be precise and accurate; otherwise, they will damage their aircraft.</p>
<p>This does not mean the elders should pour cold water on the ones who want to be full-time. They need to stir up many to be full-time and promote the matter of being full-time. Then the elders need to have the proper fellowship to find out who is qualified. Some may be what 2 Thessalonians calls &ldquo;busybodies&rdquo; (3:11). These ones should be encouraged to do a good and steady job for five years. Then they may be qualified to go full-time. The elders in each locality have to do this because they should know the saints. They need to ask the ones who want to go full-time how much they read their Bible daily and how much of the Recovery Version text and notes they have read. Based on the elders&rsquo; discernment, some of the saints should be told that the time is not right for them to go full-time.</p>
<p>You should not be disappointed if the brothers in your locality do not feel that you should be full-time. It may be that one of the elders is very strict and that he would hardly give his approval to anyone. Do not be disappointed. David was very much rejected and put down by Saul, but he was the real one God had anointed. When the time was right, David was raised up by God Himself. If you are the right person, you will be a full-timer even if the elders say no to you. This is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and no one can manipulate or control anything. If you are the right person to be a full-timer and you cannot get through in your locality, you will get through in the Body. The Body will vindicate you. If the elders in your locality say no to you, just say, &ldquo;Amen. Praise the Lord!&rdquo; Remain happy to serve the Lord in your locality. If your speaking in the meetings edifies, builds up, and saves people, even the angels will testify that you are the right one.</p>
<p>The elders should do their best to promote the matter of being full-time and if possible to raise up some to be full-time. Then the elders need to train these saints in life and in truth. They can render the help concerning how to read the Word, how to pray-read the Word, how to enjoy the Lord and contact the Lord, how to pray, and how to live a life by faith. The elders need to do something initially. Then the leading co-workers surely will regard what the elders say. The crucial key and the hinge of the practice of the Lord&rsquo;s present move is the elders. How the elders will fulfill their duty will determine how the churches practice the Lord&rsquo;s present move.</p><h2 class="head1">4. TO REARRANGE THE CHURCH MEETINGS<br />
FOR TEACHING THE TRUTH AND MINISTERING LIFE</h2>
<p>We need to forget about our old way of meeting. Most of us hold the concept that the meeting should be for our enjoyment. However, the Lord gives us the enjoyment of Himself for His purpose to spread the truth and to minister life to others. Mostly we hold the concept that we come to the meeting for our enjoyment, but we neglect the fact that our enjoyment should be for others (Eph. 3:2; 1 Pet. 4:10). We should go to preach, teach, and minister Christ to others.</p>
<p>Some saints would say that they do not come to the church meetings because they do not have any enjoyment when they come. When we come to the meeting, we surely want to receive some grace, to enjoy something of the Lord. The meetings should minister something to the attendants. However, the purpose of the meetings is not for our enjoyment, but for the spreading of the truth and the ministering of Christ to others as life. If we would forget about our own enjoyment and take care of others&rsquo; need, I believe the Lord would afford us much enjoyment. We have to change our concept.</p>
<p>Our old way of meeting is like a cocoon which we need to come out of. This cocoon eventually needs to be burned and buried. Our fellowship is an attempt to draw the churches with the saints out of the old cocoon. We need the rearrangement of the meetings for the purpose of teaching the truths and ministering life to others, and the elders need to instigate the saints to rise up for this.</p>
<p>I propose that we use the entire Lord&rsquo;s day morning for handling the truths, because people are accustomed to going to worship services at this time. We must utilize this time in the same way that the Lord Jesus took advantage of the Sabbath to preach the gospel to people. The apostles did the same thing. They did not have any intention of keeping the Sabbath or attending a synagogue, but they took advantage of people&rsquo;s custom in order to preach the word. We need a general meeting to take care of the &ldquo;Sunday goers.&rdquo; In this meeting it is possible to teach the truth and give testimonies which attract and capture others.</p>
<p>Besides this, we need to set up classes but not so-called Sunday school classes. We need classes to teach the <em>Truth Lessons.</em> The first volume of twelve lessons has already been published. There are four levels and each level contains forty-eight lessons for a total of one hundred ninety-two lessons. These lessons cover the general view and knowledge of the entire Bible plus the general view and knowledge of Christian experiences, from being called by the Lord unto maturity, reaching conformation and glorification. All the saints in the church should get themselves registered according to their choice of the appropriate level they need. Different rooms will be needed to teach these different levels.</p>
<p>In addition there is the need of a gospel meeting for the unbelievers. The saints can bring their unbelieving contacts to this meeting. Many of the Sunday goers are already regenerated and a gospel meeting may not interest them or meet their need.</p>
<p>It could be that on the Lord&rsquo;s day morning a number of different meetings take place simultaneously. If your meeting hall is too small, you can have sessions. You could hold the first session from 9 a.m. to 10:30 a.m., the second session from 10:30 a.m. to noon, and the third session from 3:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. You could also have an evening session. Do not build another hall for having these sessions, but do not be satisfied just to build a small hall. Some brothers recently fellowshipped with me concerning their intention to build a hall that can only take less than four hundred. I told them that I felt this was too small for their city and that they needed a building that could hold eight hundred to one thousand. We must realize that the age has changed. Do not say that you have been in your locality for twenty years and only have one hundred fifty people; therefore, a hall to hold four hundred people is sufficient. This is the old way. We are in today&rsquo;s move of the Lord, not in yesterday. How do you know that after three years you will not have one thousand people meeting with you? We all need the faith to believe that in every big city after three years the church will be filled with one thousand people.</p>
<p>To take care of this many meetings the church needs many speakers. The leading ones, therefore, need to make everyone a speaker. Do not say that a certain brother is not qualified. Let him do it. He is qualified. I was told by the leading brothers in Taipei that so many brothers were not qualified to be elders. I told them that fifty-two of these unqualified ones were actually qualified to be elders. The care for the twenty-one halls of the church in Taipei is now in the hands of these so-called unqualified ones. I did this based upon what Paul did in Acts. In Acts 14 he went to Lystra and Derbe to preach the gospel (vv. 6-21a). Probably within the same year he came back to establish elders in the churches there (v. 23). All the elders in the churches in Lystra, Derbe, Antioch, and Iconium were &ldquo;baby elders.&rdquo; Even though they may have been saved less than one year, they were all qualified. Some of the new elders in the church in Taipei have been in the church life for over fifteen years. Every one of them is surely qualified.</p>
<p>The elders need to give many brothers a chance to labor. Let them practice. Do not control them. The Bible never says that the church is the church of the elders. Let the church be the church of the saints (1 Cor. 14:33). If the mothers would always keep the kitchen under their strict control, none of their daughters would learn to be good cooks. The daughters need to be permitted to burn some things. Let them make some mistakes. Eventually, they will cook a delicious meal. I have been in the western world for twenty-three years and over three hundred churches have been raised up. If I had the attitude that no one was qualified, there would probably only be one church in Anaheim with three hundred fifty saints under my &ldquo;pastoring.&rdquo; I would be so contented with this single church under my care. Because I do not have any church &ldquo;in my pocket&rdquo; and because so many are qualified, there are over three hundred churches in the western world. A number of saints have said that my only fault is that I overtrust people. But it is better to overtrust. If I did not trust people, I could not do anything. Even the Lord Jesus made a purposeful &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; in choosing Judas to be one of His twelve disciples. But without Judas, how could the Lord have been crucified? Even this mistake was a blessing. I am so glad to see that my overtrusting has turned into blessing. The elders should not control the saints. Let the saints serve. They are all qualified.</p>
<p>The churches should also gather together for the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting and the prayer meeting. For the Lord&rsquo;s table a short message of life supply should be prepared. The elders with some helpers should select a short portion from our publications of about two or three pages. At the end of each Lord&rsquo;s table, a half hour can be reserved to fellowship over this message. At the end of the prayer meeting, a half hour can also be reserved to read a selected message concerning the spiritual principles of the Lord&rsquo;s service. This can also be extracted from our publications and should be about two or three pages. Then every week the saints will fellowship over a message of life supply and of the spiritual principles of the Lord&rsquo;s service.</p>
<p>Then you must have a home meeting. I hope that every home will be a meeting place of all the saints every week. The home meetings are not mainly to help ourselves, but for us to spread the truth and preach the gospel to have the propagation, the increase. Do not expect the home meetings to be so formal, so official, so spiritual, or so high. When I was in Taipei, Sister Lee and I went to attend a home meeting scheduled for 7:30 p.m. When we arrived at 7:20 p.m., no one was there except the host, and none of the chairs were arranged. As Sister Lee and I began to arrange the chairs, I was somewhat disappointed. After 7:30, everyone gradually came in with some new ones. I discovered that the reason why no one was there initially was because they all went to bring some new ones. Eventually, they caught a good number of people and they began to meet. I was so happy to hear their prayers and their sharings. A young sister prayed a marvelous prayer that really surprised me. She had only been saved for seven months. This small group only had seven basic members, but within one year they brought in nineteen new ones. I had to acknowledge that they were living and that they were for the Lord&rsquo;s interest. They do not care for the so-called normal, formal, official, or good meetings. They care for people being brought to the Lord. They care for the spreading of the truths they have received. They care for the ministering of the very life they have enjoyed. This is why the church in Taipei has baptized over five thousand people within one year.</p>
<h2 class="head1">5. TO MOVE IN THE BODY<br />
AS THE ONE NEW MAN BY FELLOWSHIPPING<br />
LOCALLY AND UNIVERSALLY</h2>
<p>We should not move individualistically nor even move merely in our locality, but in the Body. Many churches in the United States have been awakened to the fact that they have been too independent, especially since 1977. Many of the churches have been loving each other, but going on separately without adequate fellowship. With the raising up and supporting of the full-timers we need to enter into the experience of the Lord&rsquo;s one move. The elders in particular should move in the Body as the one new man. The one new man is on the entire globe and not in any specific locality.</p>
<p>We move in the Body as the one new man by fellowshipping locally and universally. No place can decide anything by itself. In your place you may feel that a certain brother is not qualified to be full-time, but the Body may feel he is the best one. Do not make any decision by yourself in your locality. Try the best to fellowship. Fellowship with the other churches in your area, in the United States, and all over the world. If you have more financial supply, it should not only be for your place but for the entire Body. I believe the Lord will not just give but rain richly His abundant blessing upon His recovery. There will be a real oneness around the globe in the recovery for the expression of His Body as the one new man moving on this earth for His interest.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">BE WATCHFUL IN LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 24:39-44; 25:1-13</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE LOST TRUTHS</h2>
<p>In this chapter I am burdened to have more fellowship concerning being filled with the Spirit inwardly and outwardly. Many Christians have taught concerning the believers having the fullness of the Spirit, yet hardly any teachers have referred this matter to Matthew 25. The reason for this is that the truths unveiled in the entire book of Matthew, which is a revelation of the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens, have been lost and even missed by most Christians. Some may quote portions of Matthew referring to the virgin&rsquo;s son being called Emmanuel and given the name Jesus (1:23, 25), to being pure in heart (5:8) and poor in spirit (5:3), which to them is to be humble, and concerning coming to the Lord for Him to give us rest (11:28). Others may even refer to Matthew 28:19, being baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, to argue concerning how to baptize people. Actually, though, what this gospel reveals has been lost. The reason why we call our version of the New Testament the Recovery Version is because this refers to the recovery of the lost truths. If you spent one day to study the book of Matthew with all the notes in the Recovery Version, you would realize that the lost truths in Matthew are recovered there.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEGRADATION&mdash;<br />
LOSING WHATEVER GOD HAS REVEALED<br />
CONCERNING HIS NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<p>Many of us would claim that we are in the recovery, but in what kind of recovery? Are we just in the recovery of the ground of the church or of meeting in the name of the Lord Jesus? The entire situation of today&rsquo;s Christianity is in degradation. Many of us who say we are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, even the ones saved among us who were never in Christianity and still remain with us, are in the degraded situation. If some Christians are asked what it means to be saved, they might answer that it means to believe in Jesus and to have your sins forgiven that you might go to heaven one day. Even some among us would say this. This kind of saying is a strong sign of the degradation of today&rsquo;s Christianity. Many of us have never been in Christianity, but we are in the degradation of Christianity. Do not think that degraded Christianity does not include you. It does not mean that because you are meeting in the recovery, you are not in that degradation. Christianity denotes a general situation of Christians, and since the end of the first century this situation has become and still is altogether a degraded situation.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be degraded? To be degraded is to lose whatever God has revealed concerning His New Testament economy. Whoever has become a Christian and yet has not come up to the level of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is in this degradation regardless of where they meet. I am quite concerned that even a good number among us are also in that degradation because we are not up to this level. To merely be saved with your sins forgiven to have a right to go to heaven is a salvation in the degradation of Christianity. This is not a salvation up to the level of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This is why I have sounded the call to rise up. Before rising up you have to wake up. Do not remain in a drowsy, stupefied condition. Today the poor preaching of the gospel in the degradation of Christianity is a kind of stupefying gospel. They preach the gospel to save people, but their kind of preaching is a stupefying. This is why I proposed that we have some bumper stickers that say &ldquo;Christ will come to settle accounts with you&rdquo; (Matt. 25:19). This statement is versus today&rsquo;s stupefied situation.</p>
<p>Our present situation in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, especially in the past few years, has been and probably still is a kind of drowsy, stupefied situation. I hope that we could pay our full attention to the two portions of the Word in the Scripture reading spoken by the Lord Jesus Himself. These two portions of the Word are actually two aspects of one matter, the matter of the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. The Lord told us that He would come quickly (Rev. 22:20), but one may think His coming has been slow because it has been nearly two thousand years since His ascension. But do not forget that to Him one thousand years are just one day (2 Pet. 3:8).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FULFILLMENT OF PROPHECIES<br />
WARNING US CONCERNING THE LORD&rsquo;S COMING</h2>
<p>I was confirmed concerning the assurance of His coming back by my study of prophecies and their fulfillment. I studied the Bible when I was young by studying its prophecies, and I was taught mostly by the Brethren teachers, who have been famous and still are in the Biblical study of types and prophecies. I also studied a number of others&rsquo; writings concerning prophecy. Through my study I was deeply impressed with one thing&mdash;the Bible in its prophecies and all the prophetic writings stressed the reformation of the nation of Israel (see Matt. 24:32 and notes). The Israelites had lost their country, their fatherland, and they all had been scattered on the earth. I wondered how Israel could ever be reformed as a nation when they had lost their homeland for over twenty-five centuries. According to my concept at that time, for such a thing to happen seemed impossible. I began to watch over the world situation related to this matter since 1925. I had the habit of always reading the first page of the newspaper every day, if possible, concerning international affairs. I remember reading the front page of the largest newspaper in Shanghai one day in 1948. The headlines said that the nation of Israel had been reformed! The newspaper told the account of how the United Nations recognized the reformed nation of Israel. The returned Israelites&rsquo; fighting away the Egyptians was a fulfillment of Exodus 23:28 which says that the Lord would send hornets before the Israelites to drive out the enemies from the good land. This was a great surprise to me. I worshipped the Lord that in His sovereignty He had reformed a nation for His people.</p>
<p>Although the nation of Israel had been reformed, Jerusalem had not yet been returned to Israel. In 1967 I had surgery done in San Francisco and was in the hospital for seven days. Within those seven days, I read in the newspaper that Jerusalem had been returned to Israel. One scene on the television showed many Arabs throwing away their new guns and only one Israeli soldier chasing them. The fulfillment of these prophecies should warn us that the Lord is coming.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING WATCHFUL FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S COMING</h2>
<p>Matthew 24:39 says, &ldquo;And they did not know until the flood came and took all away; so also shall the coming (Gk. <em>parousia</em>) of the Son of Man be.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s coming is His <em>parousia</em> or presence which will be a period of time. Verses 40-42 continue, &ldquo;Then shall two men be in the field; one is taken, and one is left. Two women shall be grinding at the mill; one is taken, and one is left. Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes.&rdquo; Both &ldquo;watch therefore&rdquo; and &ldquo;your Lord&rdquo; prove that the two men and two women in verses 40 and 41 are saved believers. The Lord would not charge unsaved people to watch, nor is He the Lord of the unsaved. Verse 43 says, &ldquo;But know this, that if the householder knew in what watch the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.&rdquo; &ldquo;Householder&rdquo; refers to the believer, and &ldquo;house&rdquo; to the believers&rsquo; conduct and work which he has built up in his Christian life. The believers need to be watchful concerning their conduct and work. Verse 44 says, &ldquo;Therefore, you also, be ready, for the Son of Man comes in an hour that you think not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This portion of the Word, Matthew 24:39-44, is on our being watchful for the Lord&rsquo;s coming. The two men or two women in 24:40-41 are the living saints because they are still working in the field and grinding at the mill. A minority of the Lord&rsquo;s saints will be living at His coming back, while the majority represented by the ten virgins (25:1), will have died before the Lord&rsquo;s coming. Ten is the major part of twelve (Gen. 42:3-4; 1 Kings 11:30-31; Matt. 20:24), and two is the remnant of twelve.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TEN VIRGINS</h2>
<p>Matthew 25:1-13 addresses what will happen to the majority of the believers who will have died before the Lord&rsquo;s coming. Ten represents the majority of the believers through all the generations who became drowsy and slept (25:5). Becoming &ldquo;drowsy&rdquo; signifies becoming sick (Acts 9:37; 1 Cor. 11:30) and &ldquo;slept&rdquo; signifies died (1 Thes. 4:13-16; John 11:11-13). While the Lord delays His coming back, the majority of the believers firstly become sick and then die.</p>
<p>Verses 1 and 2 say, &ldquo;Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom. And five of them were foolish, and five were prudent.&rdquo; The foolish ones are mentioned first because the warning here is focused on them. This parable is a warning to the foolish and unready believers. Verses 3 and 4 say, &ldquo;For the foolish, when they took their lamps, did not take oil with them; but the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps.&rdquo; Oil signifies the Spirit of God (Isa. 61:1; Heb. 1:9). Lamps signify the spirit of the believers (Prov. 20:27), which contains the Spirit of God as the oil (Rom. 8:16). Proverbs 20:27 says that the spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah. Within the lamp, our regenerated spirit, is the oil, the Holy Spirit. Man is a vessel made for God (Rom. 9:21, 23-24), and man&rsquo;s personality is in his soul. Hence, &ldquo;vessels&rdquo; here signify the soul of the believers.</p>
<p>We have the Holy Spirit in our regenerated spirit, but there is a question as to whether or not we have an extra portion of the Holy Spirit in our soul, saturating our being. The problem was not with the lamps of the virgins. Even the lamps of the five foolish virgins were burning. The fact that their lamps were &ldquo;going out&rdquo; (v. 8) proves that their lamps were lighted, having oil in them, but not having an adequate supply. They did not have the extra portion of the oil in their vessels.</p>
<p>Verse 5 says, &ldquo;Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all became drowsy and slept.&rdquo; While Christ has been delaying His coming back, millions of believers and lovers of Christ became sick and died. Verses 6 and 7 continue, &ldquo;But at midnight there is a cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Go forth to meet him! Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.&rdquo; &ldquo;Midnight&rdquo; signifies the darkest time of this dark age (night) close to the morning. That will be the end of this age, the time of the great tribulation. &ldquo;Cry&rdquo; signifies the voice of the archangel (1 Thes. 4:16). All the dead believers arose, which signifies resurrection from the dead, and trimmed their lamps, which signifies their dealing with their testimony in life. After resurrection our life for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony still needs to be dealt with if it is not perfect before we die.</p>
<p>Verse 8 says, &ldquo;And the foolish said to the prudent, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.&rdquo; After resurrection, the foolish believers discovered that they were short of the Spirit of God and needed the fullness of the Spirit of God. They are saved believers and their spirits are burning, but they do not have much oil. They do not have an extra portion of the Spirit in their vessel, in their soul, their being. Then they begged the wise ones to help by giving them some oil. &ldquo;But the prudent answered, saying, Lest there be not enough for us and for you, go rather to those who sell and buy for yourselves&rdquo; (v. 9). We should not forget that this conversation takes place after all the believers have been resurrected. After many believers have been resurrected, they will discover that they are short of the Spirit. They were short of the Spirit all the time during their life, but they were befuddled and stupefied. When they are resurrected, they will discover their shortage, but then it will be too late. They have to go and buy for themselves.</p>
<p>To buy means to pay the price. We have to pay the price for the filling of the Spirit in our soul. This filling of the Spirit is not free. The price involves items such as giving up the world, dealing with self, loving the Lord above all, and counting all things loss for Christ. This is why I said that we need to wake up that we may rise up! But to wake up and rise up requires the paying of a price. You have to drop your love of the world and so many worldly things.</p>
<p>As the foolish virgins were going away to buy, the bridegroom came (v. 10). First, all the dead saints are resurrected and then Christ comes. When He comes, the foolish ones are going to buy the extra portion of the oil. Christ comes &ldquo;and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut&rdquo; (v. 10). &ldquo;Went in&rdquo; here means to be raptured into the marriage feast with the Bridegroom, Christ.</p>
<p>Verse 11 says, &ldquo;And later the rest of the virgins came also, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us!&rdquo; This is the later rapture of the resurrected believers. All the dead believers will be resurrected at the same time, but the ready ones will be raptured first. Then the unready ones will be raptured later. By the time the unready ones are raptured, the door (not the door of salvation) to enter into the enjoyment of the Lord&rsquo;s marriage feast was shut. The foolish virgins &ldquo;came also, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us! But he answered and said, Truly I say to you, I do not know you&rdquo; (vv. 11-12). &ldquo;Not know&rdquo; means not to recognize, not to approve (see note 12<sup>1</sup> in Matthew 25&mdash;Recovery Version). The Lord never recognized or approved the foolish virgins for participation in the marriage feast because they were late in paying the price for the fullness of the Spirit. Finally verse 13 says, &ldquo;Watch therefore, for you do not know the day nor the hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christians have taught a lot concerning the fullness of the Spirit, but according to my knowledge no one has ever referred this matter to the extra portion of the oil in the vessel in Matthew 25. This is the extra portion of the Holy Spirit in your human being. You have the Holy Spirit in your regenerated spirit so you are a son of God. Yet after having the Spirit in your spirit, you need to pay the price for the further filling of the Spirit, for the extra portion of the Holy Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">WATCHING BY BEING FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>By reading the context of Matthew 25:1-13, we can see that to be watchful is to be filled with the Holy Spirit. If we are not being filled all day long, we are not being watchful. This is serious. I feel that now the Lord is working among us and taking a new step to move among us. We call this the present-day move of the Lord, but we have to realize that this is the recovery. As saved believers, we should be people who are watching all the time by being filled with the Spirit. Every day our lamp is burning and every day our soul, our being, is filled with the extra portion of the Holy Spirit. This Spirit is the saturating Spirit, which we need to allow to saturate our entire being from within our spirit to reach and even to penetrate our soul. Then we are surely watchful persons, getting ourselves ready for His coming back. We Christians have two kinds of statuses before the Lord&mdash;we are virgins in life and we are slaves for our service to the Lord. We must be watchful in life and faithful in service to be ready at our Lord&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p>If we do mean business with the Lord&rsquo;s present-day move, we must be filled with the Spirit every morning of every day. We need to confess our sins, but we also need to pay the price. The Spirit who came into our spirit was given freely, but the saturating Spirit to fill our entire being, especially our soul, is not free. It is something that you have to pay the price for, that you have to buy. When we as sinners repented and confessed our sins and believed in the Lord Jesus, we immediately got regenerated and the Spirit was given to us freely. But daily we need His filling, His saturating, from our spirit to penetrate our soul. We need to pay the price. We love ourselves so much, and we love to sleep so much in the morning. Many of us love our beds more than the Lord. In our daily life we may love a lot of things. Even though these things may not be sinful, yet they are replacements of the Lord. We may not give our first love to Him but to many other things. Now we have to drop all these other things, which means we have to pay the price to get ourselves ready.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GETTING OURSELVES READY BEFORE WE DIE</h2>
<p>We have seen that the two men and two women in Matthew 24 signify the saints who are living at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, while the ten virgins signify the majority who are dead. None of us can be sure when the Lord will come back. Neither can any of us be sure when we will die. There is a possibility for anyone of us to have a car accident. I pray frequently, especially during conference and training times, for the Lord to protect the saints from any accidents, but who can say when we will go to be with the Lord. We are not sure when He will come back. Neither can we be sure when we will go. Suppose that you go without being ready. Do you think everything will be okay? It will be okay temporarily because you will go to Paradise in Hades to rest. But when He comes back, you will be troubled. You will rise up and look at yourself and realize that the light of your lamp is not so bright. Your lamp will be going out due to the lack of oil in your vessel. If you do not get yourself ready before you die, you will be troubled at His coming back.</p>
<p>This is not my teaching, but this is the word out of the mouth of the Lord Jesus Himself. Surely we believe all the words He says to us. These two portions of the Word we are considering are very serious. This is why the entire situation today of Christianity is in degradation, and this degradation could include us. We may be in the degradation. We may be stupefied. We may have been drugged. We may not be so sober in our understanding. We may be living in such a way every day. If we love anything, we get it. We may do what we want to do and spend an entire day without prayer. We may always say we will pray tomorrow, but when tomorrow comes, we still do not pray. This is degradation. If the truths delivered in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are always bothering you, this is a strong indication that you are in the degradation of today&rsquo;s Christianity. If you were not in the degradation of today&rsquo;s Christianity, no truth would bother you. The truth would make you happy. Your response to the truths would be &ldquo;Hallelujah, I&rsquo;m for that and I&rsquo;m in that.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT TAKING ANY EXCUSES</h2>
<p>I have been praying for the churches and I am very much concerned for your spiritual situation. My main burden presently is to release all the truth into writing, so most of my time is occupied; otherwise, I would visit many of the churches. Your condition is a bothering to me because many of you are under a kind of befuddled situation, which means you are in the degradation of today&rsquo;s Christianity. Do not take any excuse. Do not say that because the church life is not so strong, you cannot be strong. You will not be able to use this as an excuse when He comes back. He only cares for whether you are ready or not. No doubt, your lamp is burning because you have been saved, but is there an extra portion of oil in your vessel, your soul, your being? Has your being been saturated with the Spirit? The age is dark, Christianity is befuddled, and even the church life may be somewhat down. All this, however, cannot be an excuse. The Lord will still check with you concerning yourself. Are you living? Are you being filled? Are you watching all day? Are you praying? Are you getting into His Word every day and remaining in fellowship with Him? You may say you are tired and that you do not have the time, but you may have a lot of time to make phone calls and to gossip. Why would you not spend ten minutes for prayer? You may talk on the telephone for over an hour and yet not have five minutes for prayer.</p><h2 class="head1">SPENDING TIME TO DIVE INTO THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>By His mercy, especially over the last ten years, I have been releasing all the high, deeper truths concerning the New Testament economy of God. According to my realization, though, all these rich truths mostly are only on our bookshelves. How many among us have spent that much time to dive into these truths? Even though all the notes in the Recovery Version were written by me, I study them again. I like to get into the notes. Early in the morning and any available time I have, I spend time to read the notes. I have recently enjoyed note 17<sup>4</sup> in Matthew 1 which says, &ldquo;Matthew comes forward and down to Christ. All the generations were directed to Christ and brought forth Christ. Christ is the goal, the consummation, the conclusion, the completion, and the perfection of all the generations, fulfilling their prophecies, solving their problems, and meeting their needs. When Christ comes, light, life, salvation, satisfaction, healing, freedom, rest, comfort, peace, and joy, all come with Him. From this point on, the whole New Testament is a full expounding of this wonderful Christ, who is everything to us. Hallelujah, Christ has come!&rdquo; If this were not printed in the Recovery Version, I could never imagine that it was written by me. I enjoy this note. Some of you can talk on the phone for twenty minutes. Could you not spend two minutes in the morning to read such a note? Just by reading such a note you will get nourished.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR REAL SITUATION</h2>
<p>Our real situation is that we are under a kind of befuddling, a kind of stupefying. Actually, many of us are in the degradation of today&rsquo;s Christianity. Are we watchful? Are we on the alert for His coming? I do not know when He will come, nor do I know when death will come to me. It may be tomorrow morning. Only the Lord knows. There could be an illness, an earthquake, a car accident, or other calamity that could take our lives. Are you ready? If you are not ready, suppose that you go. You will rest in Paradise in Hades temporarily. You will still rise up to meet Him. By that time you have to look at the situation of your lamp. Will you have sufficient oil to fill your lamp to keep it burning? You may discover that you are short of the extra portion of the Spirit.</p>
<p>I feel now is not the time for me to release more high truths. I have done enough of that already. My burden is to get your attention to rise up, to be always watchful to get yourself filled with the Spirit and with the high truths that could always wake you up. These truths are missed in today&rsquo;s Christianity and I do not have a strong assurance that these truths have all been recovered with all of you. I am a little concerned that even with you these truths are not only missed but buried. Many of you have never gotten into all the truths you have heard in the past five years. I am concerned that the truth concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is only on your bookshelves but not really constituted into you. Many of us are like other Christians. They are in degradation; you are too. What is the difference? Does meeting on the proper ground mean that you are in the recovery? Apparently you are. Actually you are not.</p>
<p>By His mercy I have been speaking to many of you for years. I feel burdened and I do have a serious and loving concern for all of you. You spend time after time to meet for ministry meetings and in your locality in the church meetings, yet have you been watchful? Are you still watching? Did you watch yesterday and today? If you pass every day without any watchfulness, do you think you will be okay when Christ returns? You may use others as your excuses. You may say that you are not watchful because of others. You may talk about the elders and about the condition of the churches, but what about yourself? It is no wonder that the final book of the Bible, Revelation, is a book sounding out a call to the overcomers (2:7, 11, 17, 26-28; 3:5, 12, 20-21). We all have to overcome the present degraded situation among Christians, which includes us. Therefore, I say again&mdash;wake up and rise up!</p>
<p>Every morning we need a time to be with the Lord. We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, I take You as my sin offering and trespass offering. I am so thankful to You that Your precious blood still washes me this morning. Lord, I need to be filled up with Yourself, with the all-inclusive Spirit within and without. I need You! I need Your saturation! I need Your soaking!&rdquo; Could you not pray in this way every morning for a short time? Have you been doing this? This is a serious matter. This is why I have said that for now I would stop delivering more deeper truths. We need some kind of a sounding to wake us up that we may be overcomers to overcome the present situation not only in Christianity but even in the recovery. We have to overcome the present situation of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I do not care whether you are an elder, a co-worker, old and experienced, or young and inexperienced. All that matters is one thing&mdash;are you watching today? We do not have yesterday or tomorrow. We Christians only have today. Every day is a today to us. Are you watching today?</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CLEAR WARNING TO ALL THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>Whether you will be living at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back or dead, the principle is the same. Among the living ones some will be taken and some will be left to pass through the great tribulation. Among the dead believers, some will be raptured first. Those who will be raptured later will suffer something. I believe that to buy the oil today is much cheaper than paying the price in the next age. Have you ever realized that according to Matthew 25 after resurrection some believers will get into the tribulation? The wise virgins told the foolish ones to go to those who sell and buy for themselves (v. 9). &ldquo;Those who sell&rdquo; must be the two witnesses during the great tribulation, the two olive trees and the two sons of oil (Rev. 11:3-4 and notes; Zech. 4:11-14). The foolish virgins will have to go to the oil sellers, the two witnesses, in the great tribulation. Today it is easy for you to get the extra portion of the Holy Spirit, but you may not do it. You may be in an idle situation day after day. To get our soul, our being, saturated and filled with the Spirit cannot be accomplished in one day. It is a lifelong matter.</p>
<p>We need to read the parable of the ten virgins again carefully according to the view of our present fellowship and with the help of the notes in the Recovery Version. When the foolish ones go to buy the oil, that will be a hard thing to do. While they go to buy, Christ comes, and the ready ones will be raptured. This is the Lord&rsquo;s word. This is not just a prophecy but a clear warning to all believers. As the virgins are we being watchful in our spiritual life?</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING WATCHFUL EVERY DAY<br />
AND ALL DAY BEFORE HIM</h2>
<p>All of us need to make a living. In Matthew 24 the two men are working in the field and the two women are grinding at the mill. They are working for their livelihood, but while they are working they should not forget about their spiritual situation. You have to make a living, but even the early raptured ones were watchful to make themselves ready while they were making a living. At the unknown <em>parousia</em> (coming) of the Lord these ready ones will be raptured first and they will enter into the enjoyment of the marriage feast of the Lamb, but the unready ones will miss it. I believe they will have bought the oil, which was good for them to be raptured, but it will not be good for them to enter into the enjoyment of the marriage feast because it will be too late. I hope that we can read these two portions of the Word in the Scripture reading again so that we may clearly see how the Lord desires for us to be in the right position of being watchful every day and all day before Him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">BE FAITHFUL IN SERVICE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 24:45-51; 25:14-30</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXTRA PORTION OF THE SPIRIT IN OUR SOUL</h2>
<p>In the last chapter we covered the matter of our being watchful in the spiritual life so that we may have an extra portion of oil. This extra portion of oil is not in the lamp but in the vessel, and is not concerning the Spirit in our regenerated spirit, which is the lamp of Jehovah, but concerning the Spirit of God in our soul, our entire being. The word soul in the Bible has several denotations. One of the denotations is our being (cf. Gen. 2:7; Exo. 1:5; Acts 2:41). Every soul is a person, and every person is a being. The soul refers to our being, to our person. Our being, our person was made by God as His vessel. Romans 9:21-23 tells us that we human beings were made by God as His vessels to contain Him. Therefore, in the parable of the ten virgins in Matthew 25:1-13 what is covered and what is stressed is the extra portion of the Holy Spirit in our soul, the saturation of our entire being with the Spirit. This is the need of all Christians, yet this is the thing that is neglected by Christians. Today not many of us are paying attention to this saturating Spirit, moving from our spirit into our soul, even into our entire being, so that we may have not only the oil in our spirit but also an extra portion of this oil to saturate our entire being.</p>
<p>Since I came to this country in 1962, I have spoken many messages on the matter of transformation. I have stressed very much that transformation could only be possible by our being saturated by the Spirit of God. Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we all &ldquo;beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus is for our redemption; the Lord Spirit is for our transformation. To be transformed is to be saturated by the Spirit. To speak of an extra portion of oil in our soul to saturate our entire being is another way to express the transformation by the Spirit. You may say we are to be transformed by the Spirit, or that we are to have an extra portion of the Holy Spirit in our soul that our being might be saturated. These two expressions indicate the same thing.</p>
<p>Christian preachers and teachers may stress that wives must submit themselves to their husbands, husbands must love their wives, children must love their parents, and that fathers must not provoke their children. However, it is difficult to find one who stresses that you need to be filled in your spirit that you may have a flow out of your spirit to have an extra portion of the Spirit in your soul. If you are filled in this way, then your love, your submission, your obedience, and your care for your children will all be a spontaneous flow out of the saturating Spirit. Since I came to this country, it has been hard for you to hear me telling the wives how to be subject to their husbands. My stress has always been on transformation. Even now I need more transformation. Do not think that I do not need it. As long as I have breath, I shall still need transformation. You also need this every day. Transformation is just like breathing. Breathing can never be terminated. Once you terminate my breathing I will be through. Therefore, we have to stress this matter. Every day in the morning you must go to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, thank You that I am here. Fill me up. Saturate me. Soak me. I want to be soaked in You and with You.&rdquo; We need such a prayer. It is not too much to have this kind of prayer three times a day. I advise the young people to have this prayer ten times daily. The more we pray this way the better. People may teach you that you should not eat so much, but no one has ever taught you not to breathe too much. Your breathing should not be reduced. Rather, you had better exercise to have more breathing, and to breathe deeply. To pray in this way is to gain the oil in your vessel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S COMMISSION AND THE LORD&rsquo;S GIFTS</h2>
<p>The two portions of the Word listed in the Scripture reading relate to being faithful in the Lord&rsquo;s service. However, there is a difference in these portions. Both are on the faithfulness toward the Lord in His service, but the first portion in Matthew 24:45-51 is on the faithfulness in the Lord&rsquo;s commission. In this portion we are told that the Lord committed something to His slaves, His servants. That committal is a commission given by the Lord to all of us. The Lord&rsquo;s commission is His charge to us to minister the life supply to His household.</p>
<p>In the second section, Matthew 25:14-30, faithfulness is not in the Lord&rsquo;s commission but in His gifts. Whenever the Lord would give us a commission, at the same time He would always give us gifts. Without gifts being given by Him to us, how could we carry out His commission? To carry out His commission, to take care of His household, we need His gifts. Both of these portions are on the faithfulness in the Lord&rsquo;s service, but one is in His commission and the other is in the gifts He has given us.</p>
<p>I would advise you all to be faithful in the Lord&rsquo;s service. Every believer, old and young, great and small, would consider that John 3:16 is the word of the Lord, but we must consider Matthew 24 and 25 in the same way. These chapters are the word of the Lord, but we did not hear much speaking and teaching about this portion. It is easy to receive John 3:16; it seems that there is no obligation or requirement in this verse. But here in Matthew 24 and 25, especially in these two portions concerning being faithful in service, this is not the case. No doubt, the talent has been given to us. That was something free. However, all the other items in these two portions are requirements and demands, demanding your watchfulness and demanding your faithfulness. Furthermore, the word in John 3:16 is short, and many of us can recite it. However, the word in these portions regarding our faithfulness is rather long, altogether twenty-four verses. Could you recite these two portions? When the Lord spoke concerning God&rsquo;s love in giving His Son for our salvation in His divine life, He seemed to indicate that this was very simple, speaking only a few verses. But when the Lord touched these two matters&mdash;watchfulness in life and faithfulness in service&mdash;He knew that He was touching some of the things which are not so easy for us to get into. Therefore, He gave twenty-four verses concerning faithfulness in our service to the Lord. If the Lord spoke more about a matter, this indicates that this matter is more important. Therefore, we have not only to recognize these portions of the Lord&rsquo;s word, but also to regard them as something not so simple. We must spend some time to get into this. With John 3:16 we will have no problem, but with these words in these two portions we have to be careful.</p><h2 class="head1">A SOBER WARNING</h2>
<p>In these two chapters we have two things to take care of&mdash;our watchfulness in life and our faithfulness in service. The watchfulness in life has very much to do with our being raptured on time, with our receiving the permission to enter into the Lord&rsquo;s wedding feast (Matt. 22:2; Rev. 19:9). This wedding feast refers to the one thousand years of God&rsquo;s kingdom on this earth. The one thousand year kingdom will be the wedding day in which we will have the wedding feast with the Lord (2 Pet. 3:8). Whether or not you will be on time to be admitted into that wedding feast depends upon your care today concerning the extra portion of oil in your being. Therefore, you have to pay your full attention to this. This is a great matter.</p>
<p>I have been practicing this watchfulness throughout the years, but I am also human. Occasionally I became negligent. I was just a little slothful about one or two days, sometimes perhaps five to six days. Then I woke up, telling myself that I was neglecting my obligation, and that I had to take care of the oil, of an extra portion in my vessel, in my soul. Concerning faithfulness it is the same. I love the Lord, and I love to serve the Lord. To teach or to minister His Word to people is really my &ldquo;hobby,&rdquo; yet we all are human. Sometimes I became tired and desired to have a few days of vacation. I wanted to stay away from this ministry of the Word, and I was advised to do so by some dear ones, even by my family. But every time I took their advice to take a vacation, I began to regret, realizing that I had to serve so I could make more profit.</p>
<p>In this parable of the talents the Lord said clearly that &ldquo;after a long time the lord of those slaves comes and settles accounts with them&rdquo; (Matt. 25:19). He will come back to settle accounts with you. The five-talented one came to report that he made another five talents. This is to use the Lord&rsquo;s gifts in full. The second one with two talents gave the same report, and they both received a reward. To these two faithful ones the Lord said the same thing: &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful slave; you were faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things; enter into the joy of your lord&rdquo; (25:21, 23). The last one, who was not faithful, lost what he had and was also put into the outer darkness (25:28-30).</p>
<p>Beginning in 1930 I began to teach these things, to minister this kind of word. My Christian friends and Christian relatives came to me, trying their best to argue with me. They asked, &ldquo;Could a saved one be cast into the outer darkness?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Dear ones, it is not I who say this. Read Matthew 25:30. Whose word is this? This is the Lord&rsquo;s word.&rdquo; Then they argued with me, asking, &ldquo;What is this darkness?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I have never been there. I do not know, but one thing I can tell you is that it is not a good place; I would not like to go there. If you are cast into that darkness you will not be rejoicing, but weeping, and gnashing your teeth. Do you want to go to a place where you will be weeping and gnashing your teeth?&quot;</p>
<p>This word was clearly spoken by the Lord Jesus, and it was sovereignly recorded in the Bible. Can you deny that this is the Lord&rsquo;s word? Can you say that this unfaithful servant is a false believer? This is what Dr. C. I. Scofield taught, and the Brethren did the same thing. This is not a false believer, that is, a tare (Matt. 13:24-30), for the Lord gave him the talents. The Lord will settle accounts with him not on this earth but at His judgment seat in the air (2 Cor. 5:10). All those who will be judged there will be real believers. How could a false believer be raptured to the air and go to the judgment seat of Christ to be judged by the Lord? It is impossible. In chapter thirteen of Matthew the Lord said, &ldquo;Allow both to grow together until the harvest, and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather first the tares and bind them into bundles to burn them up, but the wheat bring together into My barn&rdquo; (v. 30). When the Lord comes, He will send the angels to bind the tares, the false believers, and cast them into the lake of fire (vv. 40-42). How could there be a false believer who was not bound by the angels but rather raptured to the air to meet the Lord, even at His judgment seat. It is altogether not logical. Because this slave is not faithful, is he a false one? Unfaithfulness does not indicate falsehood.</p>
<p>All those who questioned me about this matter got convinced; eventually most of them had no way to argue with me. However some still said, &ldquo;Anyhow, I do not believe that a believer shall be cast into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Friends, whether you believe or you do not believe, this is the Lord&rsquo;s warning.&rdquo; Do consider this. Paul in his teaching to the Hebrews called this kind of teaching the word of righteousness (Heb. 5:13). The Lord is not sloppy, nor is He unjust. He is strict and just. Surely He saved you, but after this He gave you the Bible with much advice and many warnings. You have to take the advice, and you have to take all these warnings. Just go along with Him according to His word. I am telling you the truth: I am not sure whether I will successfully pass through the judgment seat. I hope that I would, but that remains to be seen. Paul said in 1 Corinthians 4:5, &ldquo;Therefore do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord comes, who shall both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then there will be praise to each one from God&rdquo; (cf. Rom. 14:10-12; 2 Cor. 5:10).</p>
<p>If we mean business with the Lord that He is real, that He is living, and His word is altogether trustworthy, we have to be sober. We have to be sober to rise up, learning to be watchful in life, daily seeking the extra portion of the oil to saturate our entire being that we may be ready in life to be raptured at any time. Then we will not miss the chance to enter into the wedding feast, the thousand year joyful kingdom. Secondly, we all have to be ever faithful in our service. Otherwise, we will not only miss the entrance into the wedding feast, but we will also lose our right to enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s joy in His coming kingdom. Watchfulness in life relates very much to our rapture, and faithfulness in service relates to our entrance into the Lord&rsquo;s joy to participate in His coming kingdom.</p>
<p>D. M. Panton, who taught concerning the kingdom reward, said that many Christian teachers are giving tickets for the entrance into the kingdom. However, if you bring such a ticket to the entrance of the kingdom, you will discover that your ticket will not be honored. Do not be cheated. This is the Lord&rsquo;s clear word to us. I would like to advise you, to have a loving fellowship with you, and even to warn you that we all have to be watchful in life and faithful in service.</p><h2 class="head1">MINISTERING FOOD AT THE APPOINTED TIME</h2>
<p>Now we need to fellowship concerning our practice of being faithful in service. In what way should we be faithful in the service? What shall we do? First, in Matthew 24:45-51 we are told clearly that the Lord commissioned us to take care of His household. His household refers to the believers (Eph. 2:19), who are the church (1 Tim. 3:15). The church today is the Lord&rsquo;s house and also the Lord&rsquo;s household, what we refer to as the folks. We are His house, and at the same time we are His folks. The Lord charged us, commissioned us, to minister something to His household, that is, to the believers in the church.</p>
<p>According to verse 45 what we minister is food. Verse 45 says, &ldquo;Who then is the faithful and prudent slave, whom the master has set over his household to give them food at the appointed time.&rdquo; At the appointed time we have to minister food, the life supply, to the Lord&rsquo;s people. Do not say that others have a gift of teaching to teach you the Word of God and minister spiritual food to you, but that you do not have such a gift. There is not such a thought here. All the Lord&rsquo;s servants received the gift for their commission.</p>
<p>In the second section in 25:14-30, the Lord says that He is as a master going into another country, who delivered his possessions to his servants (v. 14). In the next verse he gave talents to the servants. Possessions and talents are the items of this parable. &ldquo;His possessions&rdquo; signify the church (Eph. 1:18) with all the believers, who are His household (Matt. 24:45). The church with the believers is a real inheritance, a possession of the Lord. &ldquo;Talents&rdquo; in this parable signify spiritual gifts (Rom. 12:6; 1 Cor. 12:4; 1 Pet. 4:10; 2 Tim. 1:6). Verse 14 says, &ldquo;For it is as a man who, going into another country, called his own slaves and delivered to them his possessions.&rdquo; Verse 15 continues, &ldquo;And to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one.&rdquo; The reader of these verses may think that the five talents refer back to possessions. Possessions are the Lord&rsquo;s church, His believers, and talents are the gifts. The Lord not only gave the possessions, but He also gave the talents. Has the Lord not given you the church with so many believers? The Bible does not refer to the church of the apostles, the church of the elders, the church of the prophets or the church of the evangelists. The New Testament rather speaks of the church of God (Acts 20:28; 1 Cor. 1:2), the church of Christ (Rom. 16:16), and the church of the saints (1 Cor. 14:33). The church is the possession of all the saints, the believers.</p>
<p>The Lord, before going to the heavens, delivered to us His church with all the believers. If He had only given to us the talent to minister the life supply, then to whom would we minister? However, He gave us two categories of things: one is His possessions, the other is the talents. Today we have the church with all the believers as the possession, the portion to us, to which we can give something, and we have the talents as the spiritual gifts. You cannot say you are not gifted. Actually, you are much gifted. For this reason I have always encouraged you to function. Some may consider this to be merely my practice. They may say that in all of Christianity they only saw the practice of good preachers speaking to a crowd. They never saw a meeting with so many standing up to speak. Some have even called this a &ldquo;popcorn&rdquo; meeting. One after another stands up like popcorn popping. It is very good to have a &ldquo;popcorn meeting.&rdquo; This is altogether what we expect to have. This is not my teaching; this is the Bible&rsquo;s teaching (1 Cor. 14:24, 26, 29-32). We all have to learn to function. This is the reason that even in a ministry meeting, I always like to leave half an hour for you to &ldquo;pop up.&rdquo; Do not just be stuck to your chair. It seems as if there is a strong glue to keep many of you stuck to the chair. You have to jump up to say something. For you to speak is to minister food to the Lord&rsquo;s household at the appointed time.</p>
<p>Whoever serves food knows the appointed time. If you are serving food every day, you have to make breakfast, lunch, and dinner. To prepare a cup of coffee and buy a doughnut for breakfast is the lazy way. If we are like this in the spiritual realm, we will be poor servants to minister the life supply to the master&rsquo;s folks at the appointed time. The appointed time in the morning is breakfast. Also, good wives prepare the best sandwiches for their husbands to bring to the office for lunch at the appointed time and are accustomed to preparing a big dinner for their family.</p>
<p>In like manner, whenever we meet together, this is one of the appointed times for you to minister the proper food to the Lord&rsquo;s folks. Suppose, however, that I was sloppy, not reading the Word. If I did not labor adequately in the Word and came to speak to you, I would just be ministering to you &ldquo;a cup of coffee and some doughnuts.&rdquo; To cook a nourishing, good breakfast, requires your diligence. According to the context of this parable, the faithful one is the diligent one. Faithful here equals diligence, and slothful equals lazy. We must be diligent in seeking the Word that we could prepare to serve good food when we come to the meeting. The eating time is the appointed time, and the meeting time is the appointed time. We have the appointed time on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, on the Lord&rsquo;s Day evening, Tuesday evening, and Friday evening. The meeting times are the appointed times when we all have to minister some portion of the life supply to our folks, to our fellow believers, to our possessions.</p>
<p>The Lord has given us the church as the object for us to serve, and He has also given us the ability, the skill, the gift, to care for our obligation. We may also enlarge the interpretation of the term possessions. Do you not believe that all the sinners belong to the Lord? All the sinners belong to the Lord; they are all the Lord&rsquo;s possessions, and the Lord has given them to us. The translators of the Recovery Version were very careful in their translation of this portion. In verse 14 the possessions are delivered, and in verse 15 the gifts are given. The Lord did not give us the church with the believers; the Lord delivered these to us. In the same sense the Lord has delivered all the sinners to us. The possessions not only denote the church with the believers as the Lord&rsquo;s possessions, but also all the sinners. The Lord has surely delivered to us the church with all the believers and all the sinners that we may take care of them for His sake.</p>
<p>To care for them is simply to feed them, to minister food to them. To the sinners the proper food we minister is the gospel of Christ. The nurses in the hospitals know that they must serve the patients with different meals. Different food is ministered to different patients to meet their specific needs. It is the same with us. The entire earth is a hospital, full of sickness and full of all kinds of sick people. Even the church in a good sense is also a hospital, full of sick people. Therefore, we have to minister different words to them at the appointed time. The Lord&rsquo;s possessions are always around you. The believers, the churches, and even the more all the sinners are around you. It is your duty, your obligation, to minister food to them. If they are sinners, you have to minister the gospel of grace to them as the food they need. If they are believers sick of something, then you need to minister some word from the Bible that suits their condition, either to nourish them, to heal them, to strengthen them, or to wake them up. To do this is to be a faithful and prudent slave, ministering the proper food to the Lord&rsquo;s possessions, which are all kinds of persons, at the appointed time. When you enter into your office, you must realize that this is one of the appointed times to minister the proper food of the gospel to the unbelieving ones. When you go to school, even if you are not going there to teach but to attend classes, all the classmates around you are the Lord&rsquo;s possessions delivered to you that you may take the opportunity, the appointed time, to minister the gospel to them.</p><h2 class="head1">MAKING A PROFIT<br />
IN THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>In the first of these two portions of Scripture, the Lord spoke of food, related to our service. However, in the second portion, the parable, the Lord spoke of profit in business. We all have to make a profit. As a servant commissioned by the Lord to take care of His household, we need to serve food, but as a slave in the parable of Matthew 25:14-30, we need to make a profit. The more you preach the gospel, the more you have the feeling that you have more talent. As I am speaking, I feel my talent is increasing. The more I minister something to you, the more profit I make; it increases my talent.</p>
<p>Each one of us will have no excuse at the judgment seat of Christ. Every day is an appointed time for us to minister the proper food to anyone, and every day is a proper time for us to make some profit. For this reason I have been declaring, &ldquo;Rise up, and wake up!&rdquo; We all have to rise up and wake up to be diligent, to be faithful, to be prudent and not foolish, to minister the proper food to the needy ones at the appointed time, and also to use our talent or talents. Perhaps you only have one talent; actually most of the believers only have one talent. The danger is not with the ones who have five talents or two talents. The danger is always with the one-talented ones, who are always thinking, &ldquo;I do not have much gift; what I have is just a little; whether I function or not means nothing.&rdquo; Actually, it means much.</p>
<p>Since October of 1984 when I went to Taipei, I did many things at a risk. My burden was to stir up the saints to adequately care for their obligation in the matter of preaching the gospel. In 1985 the church in Taipei baptized over five thousand people. Recently they began to have a gospel-preaching practice. The gospel teams going out to the nearby villages baptized thirteen hundred new believers in less than two weeks. They went to the villages, baptized people, cast out demons, and healed the sick.</p>
<p>In a training of one hundred thirty young full-timers who had the burden to go to the villages, I told them that they must exercise in faith to cast out demons when they went to preach the gospel to the sinners (Luke 10:17; Matt. 10:1). According to the New Testament you do not need to wait to be asked to cast out demons. The demons are devilish, something satanic, and we must cast out anything of the Devil for God&rsquo;s kingdom. Whenever there is a case of demon possession, you have to cast out the demons. However, whenever there are any sick ones, do not go right away to heal them; you have to be asked. To cast out demons you do not need to be asked, but to heal the sick you have to be asked. When they ask you, you may do it. A little over one month after this time they went out to practice the preaching of the gospel with the casting out of the demons and healing of the sick. It really worked. I told them not to promote healing as the Pentecostals do. If you are going to promote this, eventually you will be pretending that you can heal people. When you are asked to heal the sick, just do it according to the Bible by faith. Whether the sick one will be healed or not, leave this matter to the hands of the Lord. Just act according to His Word. I am so happy to hear the news that they did this!</p>
<p>On one occasion the brothers went to a little mountain to pray. One of the villagers learned that there was a group of Christians there, and he went to join them. He asked the brothers if they were Christians. They told him they were and that they were preaching the gospel. He said that he was a Baptist, yet he had been sick for a few years, and asked if the brothers laid their hands on people and prayed for the sick. When the brothers replied that they did, he asked if they would lay their hands upon him and pray for him. The brothers agreed, and the man was healed. He was so joyful and full of praise. No doubt, this kind of person would always attract his relatives and friends. There was a revival in the villages. There was also the casting out of the demons there. However, the brothers and sisters were charged not to boast of these things and not to promote them; our boast is in the Lord Jesus Christ, and we must promote the gospel. Although the brothers and sisters went out for less than two weeks, they baptized thirteen hundred people. Furthermore, they expect to baptize many more before the completion of their gospel preaching.</p>
<p>On the one hand, those dear ones in Taiwan were making a profit. On the other hand, they were feeding the hungry sinners in the villages with the food of the gospel. Many were fed and became satisfied and so joyful. Their joy spontaneously became a testimony in those villages. To some degree it might not be so easy in the cities with educated people because the educated people are not so simple as the villagers. However, please do not think that those people in the villages in Taiwan are uneducated; they all have a certain amount of education. In the cities, in the schools and offices, we still have a great possibility to feed people with the food of the gospel. It all depends upon our faithfulness. We must be faithful. Deducting all the holidays and weekends, there are still over two hundred days in a year in which you go to your place of business or to school. Every day is an appointed time for you to minister the food of the gospel to your contacts. Do you not believe that within one year you will gain one person?</p>
<p>Apparently it has been very difficult to gain a new person. We have been cheated; we have been made disappointed. We do not have the faith, the morale, the impact with the full assurance, that we will gain someone. You had better quietly consider why, within one year of at least two hundred working days, you could not gain one. It is not logical. There has been no increase because you became disappointed.</p>
<p>All the believers should be the fishers of men (Matt. 4:19). Sometimes at the schools the fish will jump not only at your feet, but also into your bosom. However, you may not have wanted that. How can you get a fish if you have no intention to get one? You may prefer to keep the fish away. This is the real case, and this is the reason why I am fellowshipping with you in this way. You need to make some profit. You need to gain some oil.</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD OF SUPPLY AND A WORD OF WARNING</h2>
<p>Who knows that the Lord will not come back soon? Recently, the destruction of the space shuttle Challenger attracted the attention of the whole nation. I felt sorry for the ones who died in it and sorry for our country. Would that not be a warning to us, though? Who among us can know when will be the appointed time for us to die? We should take this as a warning. If a real Christian dies without the adequate supply of oil in his vessel, his soul, and if he has not made much profit for the Lord, he will regret in the next age that he had wasted his time. I believe some of those who love the Lord were warned through this incident. We do not know, as the Lord said in Matthew 24:36, the hour or the day of His coming back. We do not even know the hour, the time, or the day of the month of our death. Our life is so fragile (Psa. 39:4). With a little accident we might be killed.</p>
<p>As we read these portions concerning the watchfulness in life and concerning the faithfulness in service we should be warned. We must be enlightened that to have an extra portion of the oil, the Spirit, in our whole being, is not as simple as getting saved. We can be saved and regenerated instantly. To have the Holy Spirit come into our spirit is simple, but to have an extra portion of the Holy Spirit to fill you up, to saturate your entire being, takes much time. This is clearly indicated in the New Testament. To bear a child requires nine months. However, to grow up to be a full-grown person requires at least eighteen to twenty-one years. In the Bible the required age for entrance into the Lord&rsquo;s service as an apprentice is twenty-five years (Num. 8:24); the full, legal age for the priest is thirty years (Num. 4:3). To prepare an extra portion of the Spirit to fill your being, that is, to have the full growth, requires time. I dare not to say that I am fully grown. However, I do believe that in the Lord&rsquo;s hand there might be a record that says I have grown much. Yet, I still need some more growth. Consider your situation related to the growth in life and related to the profit for the Lord. My burden, and my heart&rsquo;s desire is to pass this fellowship on to you.</p>
<p>At this time, rise up and wake up to seek after the extra portion of the oil daily, and do some business with the talent you have received of the Lord to make a profit. If you do not, you will suffer. This suffering will not be immediately after you die; the suffering will be at His coming back. All the dead saints will resurrect to be raptured with the living ones to the air to meet the Lord and to stand before His judgment seat. Then He will settle accounts with you. You must keep a good account. We all know that to keep a good account is not a one day matter; it is a lifelong matter. You all must have some profit accumulated, a deposit built up.</p>
<p>This word in the plain speaking in 24:45-51 and in the parable in 25:14-30 is altogether adequate. We will have no excuse. Therefore, please rise up, wake up, and do not take any excuse. The one-talented one argued with the Lord, taking to Him a very good excuse, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter&rdquo; (Matt. 25:24). The Lord admitted that was true, but said, &ldquo;Evil and slothful slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter. You ought therefore to have deposited my silver with the bankers, and when I came I would have recovered what is mine with interest&rdquo; (Matt. 25:26-27). The word of the one-talented slave condemned him. Actually, we have no excuse at all. May this portion of the Word give us a word of supply and a word of warning.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">HOW TO BE WATCHFUL IN LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 24:42-44; 25:1-13; Eph. 6:17-18; 4:30; 1 Thes. 5:19; Rom. 8:4</h1>
<h2 class="head1">A BOOK ON THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS</h2>
<p>The book of Matthew has been mostly misunderstood throughout the history of the church. Many Christians think that the Gospels are not deep books, and that Matthew is merely one of these four Gospels. I would say, however, that Matthew, as the first book of the New Testament, is the most solemn, serious, and deep book because it reveals to us the kingdom of the heavens. We gave many messages on this subject in 1972 in Los Angeles which are contained in a book of fifty chapters entitled <em>The Kingdom.</em> I am concerned that many of you have not yet read this book. In 1977 we also had a Life-study of the entire book of Matthew and all these messages have been printed. We also have the Recovery Version of Matthew with all the notes to help us get into the riches of this book. In all these sources, I have pointed out strongly that the book of Matthew is a book on the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens is used by God to stir us up to take care of our Christian exercise and responsibility after being saved. After a person is born, the exercise of his human life begins. For anyone to be a proper, normal person living on this earth, he has to be exercised at least eighteen years. Everyone under eighteen should be under the care and training of his parents. If a person is born in a royal family, he has to be very much exercised to be a king. A prince who will be a successor to the throne needs to be daily exercised in everything. As Christians we all have been born into a royal family. We all should desire to be kings and rulers in the millennium with our Lord Jesus (Rev. 20:4, 6), but are we exercised in everything? Matthew, a book on the kingdom of the heavens, is a book on Christian exercise for the believers to receive a reward in the coming kingdom age that they might be free from the coming punishment. The great Brethren teachers did not see this. Even Scofield&rsquo;s reference Bible indicates strongly and incorrectly that the foolish virgins are not believers. This kind of interpretation avoids the fact of the coming punishment.</p>
<p>Some may feel that we should not use the word punishment, but discipline. Actually, however, punishment and discipline in the Bible, especially in the New Testament, are synonyms. When parents discipline their children, this means a kind of punishment. To discipline means to punish. Some children who do well in school are rewarded by their parents while others who do not are punished. The not giving of a reward is even a kind of discipline, a kind of punishment.</p>
<p>I cannot say what the millennium will be like, especially its heavenly part, which is the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, because I have not been there yet. But thank the Lord that when He was on this earth, He told His disciples all these solemn words, and under God&rsquo;s sovereignty, all these words were written down and published in the book of Matthew. Today this wonderful book is in our hands, and the Lord has mercifully opened it up to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR EXERCISE IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE<br />
TO BUY THE OIL</h2>
<p>Especially in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we have no excuse to say that we have not been warned to take care of the exercise of the Christian life. The Bible is a book full of solemn words for us to consider about our exercise in our Christian life. It is natural for human beings to be loose. I can testify personally that it is hard for me to commit a sin or to love the world, but it is spontaneously easy not to be watchful. Most of the days and hours have been spent without our being watchful. We live the Christian life without seriousness, and this is absolutely wrong. Anyone driving a car should always be watchful. If a driver is not watchful, he may kill himself or kill others. At the very least, the policeman may give him a ticket. The government is there to keep people from being so loose. In like manner, God&rsquo;s government, His kingdom, is there to keep His children from being so loose.</p>
<p>If we were only to read John 3:16, we would only have the realization of how generous God is. He has a broadened heart, the span of which is from eternity past to eternity future. God&rsquo;s heart is so broad that it embraces everyone. In John 3:16 God is very generous, but in Matthew it is different. He is a hard master who reaps where He does not sow and gathers where He does not scatter (Matt. 25:26). The Lord admitted that He was such a One. He will call a number of His slaves evil and slothful and cast these useless slaves into outer darkness, where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth (25:26, 30). This is also the word of the Lord Jesus in the Bible in the very first book of the New Testament. We have to see the solemness here.</p>
<p>There were times when I was so busy in the publication work that I was laboring from early morning until late at night. As a result, I did not have much time to pray, and I regretted this. We have to realize that in our private Christian life not to pray is more serious than not to come to the meeting. If we neglect a watchful life of prayer, this is a great negligence. This will be a lacking that causes you a great loss in your Christian life. This happens because you stop being watchful. If you do not pray for an entire day, you can never be watchful in that day. Even if you never have a praying spirit toward the Lord for half an hour, in that half an hour you can never be watchful.</p>
<p>Again, we must realize that the book of Matthew is a solemn book. The beginning of the parable in chapter twenty-five says, &ldquo;Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened to ten virgins...&rdquo; (v. 1). This is a parable concerning the kingdom of the heavens in a solemn book that wakes you up to take care of your exercise in your Christian life. A ticket from a policeman results in a financial penalty, but this parable in Matthew 25:1-13 concerns our destiny for at least one thousand years. If we do not pay the fine, the price for a traffic violation on time, the cost keeps getting higher. But if we do not pay the price required to buy the extra portion of oil in this age, the price we will have to pay in the next age will be great, high, and costly. In the Gospel of Matthew there are portions warning us to be careful about our exercise in the Christian life.</p>
<p>The parable in 25:1-13 likens all the believers to virgins. In biblical times among the Jews virgins were very much separated from contacts with outside people. In the kingdom of the heavens, the believers are likened to virgins, not to wrestlers, boxers, or football, basketball, or baseball players. Virgins signify believers in the aspect of life (2 Cor. 11:2). We are chaste virgins bearing the Lord&rsquo;s testimony in the dark age and going out of the world to meet the Lord.</p>
<p>The New Testament charges us and warns us with one heavy charge&mdash;that the Lord is coming. None of us knows the day or hour of His coming. If you do not believe in Him, you will go to the lake of fire. If you believe in Him, you escape eternal perdition in the lake of fire, but if you are not watchful in life you will receive some dispensational punishment. We had no choice regarding our physical birth. Some people may have thought that it would have been much better if they had never been born. But whether we were born or not was not up to us, but up to the Lord. Also, we have become Christians. We were predestinated, chosen, and called by the Lord. We have also been regenerated. We are Christians whether we like it or not, and our Lord is coming again whether we like it or not. What shall we do to meet Him? We must be prepared. We are virgins going out to meet the One who is coming to us as the most pleasant Person, as a Bridegroom. In this solemn book of Matthew He would not let us know when He would come (24:44; 25:13). His not letting us know means that we have to be watchful and always keep ourselves exercised.</p>
<p>We all are going out of the world to meet our Bridegroom bearing a lamp as a shining testimony. Our human spirit is the lamp of Jehovah (Prov. 20:27). This lamp should be bright and shining, so it needs oil. Oil in typology signifies the Spirit of God (Isa. 61:1; Heb. 1:9), and we need the Spirit as the burning oil. We are going out to meet Him, bearing a shining testimony, so we need the burning oil, the burning Spirit. With the lamp there is a vessel. The foolish ones have oil in their lamps, their spirits, but they do not have the extra portion of oil in their vessels, their souls. We should be in a situation of going out to meet Him and bearing His testimony. For this purpose we need more oil, more Spirit, so we have to buy the oil. This extra portion of oil could never be given to you as a gift. You could never get it freely. You need to buy the oil.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING WATCHFUL TO BUY THE OIL</h2>
<p>Now we need to see how to be watchful, which means we need to see how to buy the oil. To be watchful is to take care of the oil. When I was a young Christian, I considered that to be watchful was to look to the heavens for His coming, and even to figure out when He would come. Later I began to realize that this understanding was altogether not practical. By reading 25:1-13 again and again I discovered that to be watchful is to take care of your oil. A careless driver is not watchful about the gasoline in his tank. He may be driving to a certain destination and then suddenly run out of gas because he did not watch the gas gauge. Because of his carelessness, he suffers. Today since you are driving your &ldquo;Christian car,&rdquo; do you care for your &ldquo;gasoline?&rdquo; The gasoline in your car is the Spirit, the oil. All the time you have to buy the oil.</p>
<p>Some young Christians indicated to me that they wanted to have some enjoyment in the world, especially since the Lord was not coming back immediately. They also said that the Lord gave us the time to be joyful, which to them meant to enjoy the worldly pleasures. Perhaps when they were over forty-five then they would begin to love Him because they were not so sure that He would come back within twenty years. Even if the Lord does delay His coming back, though, do we know when we will die? Probably none of those dear ones who lost their lives when the space shuttle Challenger exploded had any inkling that they would lose their lives that day. Does anyone know when he will die?</p>
<p>You may not believe that the Lord will come back in the next twenty-five years or that you will die within this time. Therefore, you may desire to live carelessly as a Christian, loving whatever you like and doing whatever is a pleasure to you. Even if your figuration is right, sooner or later you will die, and you will die in a situation in which you will have never accumulated enough oil in your vessel.</p>
<p>To accumulate a deposit of the extra portion of the Holy Spirit in your being is not an overnight job. In order to grow and develop properly, a human being should be exercised for at least eighteen years to take in the nourishing life supply and to study, learn, and be educated. The more one lives in a loose, unrestricted way, the more he loses the chance and the time to accumulate the proper education in every way, not only in school. To be a proper person you need to learn things every day. As a man over eighty, I am still learning and acquiring new knowledge. I use my dictionary frequently to pick up new words. I told some of the young saints that I would hate to see that after ten years they are still the same. To pick up things that become a constitution of your proper being is not a matter of one day or even one year. It is a matter of daily business for a lifetime.</p>
<p>I am still concerned that when the Lord comes back or when I die that by that time I will have had a sufficient amount of oil deposited in my vessel. If I die before His coming back, I will go to Paradise in Hades to see Abraham, David, Paul and to be happy with these brothers, and yet some day I will rise up and go to the air to stand before the Lord. Whether or not I will be raptured early remains to be seen. If we are raptured late, we will miss the wedding feast (Matt. 25:10). In so many things I have the assurance, but in the matter of attending the wedding feast I do not have the assurance.</p>
<p>To be watchful does not only mean to watch for His coming. To be watchful is to prepare yourself every day by buying the oil. Every day we need to buy some oil. Our spiritual transformation is a daily and lifelong matter. Every day there should be some accumulation, some deposit of oil added to our being. We have not been that much in the proper exercise every day to exercise ourselves even every minute to buy the oil. A baby becomes a big boy by his daily eating. This boy is an accumulation, a constitution, of the food that he has eaten and assimilated. For us to be qualified to be raptured to enter into the Bridegroom&rsquo;s marriage feast requires our passing through a long period of accumulating the spiritual oil. From the time you become a Christian, you should buy the oil to be deposited in your vessel every day.</p>
<p>I went to a meeting of one particular group of Pentecostal Christians. During their meeting there was much so-called speaking in tongues and prayer, but after their meeting probably no one was watchful. In every way you could see their looseness. I exercised to be with them in my spirit, and our spirit always would restrict us in what we say and do. I believe that even in that meeting with them I gained more of the Spirit, because by His mercy I was watching by praying to be filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Christian life is not a matter of legalities concerning watching television, reading the newspaper, going to sporting events, or indulging in worldly pleasures. It is not a matter of merely whether or not something is scriptural. The Christian life is a matter that concerns our buying of the oil. You may not pray, and yet you will watch television. You may not pray, and yet you will read the newspaper. You may not pray, yet you will play sports. There are a lot of &ldquo;yets&rdquo; in your daily life. You just do not pray. You may not do anything sinful, but this parable of the virgins does not indicate that the Lord will judge us according to how much sin we have committed, but according to how much oil we have in our vessel. To receive the Holy Spirit into our spirit, our lamp, is free. But to have the Spirit saturating our soul is not free. If you are going to get the Holy Spirit to saturate your soul, you must pay the price in dealing with your soul.</p>
<p>I have had to deal with my soul in many ways to buy the oil. When it seemed like it was a good time for me to joke with a person and I joked a few sentences, I got condemned. I am not a piece of marble, but a living person. Every living person has his opinion, but many times when I tried to express my opinion, I was stopped by the buying of the oil. Many times this view has affected my daily living. Could I get more Spirit by exchanging words with my wife? Could I get more Spirit by going to a certain place? I may want to go to a certain place, but I do not have the peace within me. The point is this&mdash;every day should be a day for us to pick up the oil in every way. We need to pray from the time that we wake up every morning, &ldquo;Lord, I do not like to do anything that is not under my being watchful, that is not under my buying of the oil. I like to buy the oil at any time and in any instance. Otherwise, that will be a waste of my time.&rdquo; This should be our prayer and even our prayerful attitude. Many nights I regretted that I did not spend all of my time to be in the spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">WATCHING UNTO PRAYER</h2>
<p>In the New Testament watchfulness is wrapped up with prayer. Ephesians 6:18 tells us that we should be those watching unto prayer. We need to be watchful, on the alert for our prayer life. &ldquo;Watching unto this&rdquo; in verse 18 refers back to prayer and petition. There is no other way to get the oil except by praying. If you do not pray, that means you do not pay the price to buy the oil. Through prayer we receive more Spirit. Every time we pray we have the deep sensation that some amount of the Spirit has been gained by us in our prayer. To spend our time for prayer rather than for so many other things means to pay the price to get the oil.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUYING THE OIL FOR OURSELVES</h2>
<p>All ten virgins were raised up from the dead, but their rapture after their resurrection was according to how much oil they had in their vessels. Our initial receiving of the Spirit at regeneration is not a ticket for us to enter into the wedding feast. The sufficient oil, the adequate oil, will become our entry, our ticket, to the wedding feast. The foolish virgins discovered that they did not have the adequate supply of oil, so they wanted to borrow from the wise ones (25:8). Then the wise virgins indicated that what they had was only sufficient for them (25:9). Here is a principle&mdash;we can never borrow others&rsquo; spirituality. One&rsquo;s spirituality can only qualify himself. You cannot borrow another&rsquo;s eating, and another person cannot eat for you. It is impossible. You cannot even borrow another person&rsquo;s study. You cannot ask someone to go to school for you and borrow whatever he learns. The wise virgins told the foolish ones they had to buy the oil for themselves. When they were going to buy, the ready ones who had the sufficient oil were raptured. No doubt, that was before the tribulation.</p>
<p>The foolish ones were charged to go to those who sell the oil. According to Zechariah 4:11-14 and Revelation 11:3-4, the two witnesses during the great tribulation, the two olive trees and the two sons of oil, will be the oil sellers. That means they will give people more Spirit. The foolish virgins have to go to these oil sellers in the great tribulation to buy the oil. At that time the entire world will be a place of tribulation. As long as you are there, you are suffering; you are passing through the tribulation. If the foolish ones do not go to these oil sellers in the tribulation, they could never get the oil. This shows us that the foolish virgins will have to pay some price in suffering to get the oil, a price which they had never paid in their entire Christian lives. Even after the resurrection, they will still have to go through the suffering to pay the price for the oil. Finally, the foolish ones came (25:11), but their coming, their rapture, was too late. The point again is this&mdash;since the time we were saved, every day should be redeemed by us to buy the oil. We all need to rise up from today to buy the oil.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT GRIEVING THE HOLY SPIRIT OF GOD</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:30 tells us not to grieve the Holy Spirit of God. Do not make Him unhappy. The Holy Spirit who is now sealing us unto the redemption of our body is in us. We must make Him happy. Because He has really joined us with Him as one (1 Cor. 6:17), when we are unhappy, this indicates that He is unhappy. If you do not come to the meeting, or if you come and do not function, this makes the Spirit unhappy. At the end of the day you may not feel so good, but when you come to the meeting and function in it, you feel so happy. This means the Holy Spirit is happy within you. If you do not feel happy, this is an indication that you have grieved Him. Why have you grieved Him? Because you did not buy Him. You did not pay the price for Him. He is the oil.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT QUENCHING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>First Thessalonians 5:19 says, &ldquo;Do not quench the Spirit.&rdquo; Sometimes we even go farther not only to grieve Him but also to quench Him. Sometimes we may tell the Lord to tolerate us for a certain time and not to inspire us. We may know the Spirit is moving within us, but we may not like it. To quench the Spirit is to reject the buying of the oil. In many things we do not buy the Spirit, so we miss the chance to accumulate more and more of the Spirit in our being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WALKING ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Nearly the last charge in the entire New Testament is to walk according to spirit (Rom. 8:4), which is our human spirit mingled with God&rsquo;s Holy Spirit (cf. Rom. 8:16), our mingled spirit. To walk means to live, to act, to behave, to do things, to have our being. We have to have our being according to spirit and this is to buy the Spirit. Our thinking, our speaking, the expression of our attitude should be according to spirit. If you are having your being according to spirit, this is to buy the Spirit. But to walk, to have your being according to spirit needs us to pay a great price. You may need to stop your excessive talking on the telephone and stop your further reading of the newspaper from the first page to the next.</p><h2 class="head1">BUYING THE OIL TO ANNUL OUR BARRENNESS</h2>
<p>The real revival is to be raised up. We do not need to resurrect in the future to discover that we need to go and buy the oil. We need to be raised up today, every day paying the price to buy the Spirit. This is real revival, and I do believe that by being such persons, we will be fruitful. Many of us have to admit that we are barren. I hate to see the barrenness. We can give many excuses for this, such as our having been defamed and criticized. But how much have we been doing in these past few years in the matter of contacting others and speaking the Lord Jesus?</p>
<p>The many missionaries over the past two centuries would have never gone out if they would have made excuses. The dear missionaries who went to China could have said, &ldquo;The Chinese are closed and are too conservative. Even if they would open up their doors, they would not listen to anyone from the West. If I go, I will waste my time.&rdquo; There are always excuses against the ministry going out. But thank the Lord, these missionaries went, and they went in all kinds of hardships. According to my observation, the Presbyterian missionaries who went to China one hundred years ago were some of the best. Even though they did not know as much truth as we do, have as much light as we have, or have as much growth in life as we have, they had a heart for Jesus, to preach Him to the poor ones. They made a big success and even I am here ministering today due to their labor. They did everything to open the door for the preaching of the Lord Jesus. When we grew up, we were under their mission work and I studied at schools established by the missions. They brought the Bible to China, translated it into Chinese, and passed it on to us. Furthermore, they preached the Lord Jesus. At least they could say &ldquo;Jesus loves you&rdquo; in Chinese. Sometimes children would mock them or throw stones at them. Some were really caught by them although they nearly could only say &ldquo;Jesus loves you&rdquo; to others.</p>
<p>Saints, we have no excuse. We do not need to go that far to China. We are in our Jerusalem, which is our neighborhood. We have to go. At least we can go once a week or once every two weeks to a certain neighbor. You could go to visit the same neighbor twenty-six times within one year. I do not believe nothing will happen if we visit our neighbors in this way. Something will happen. If we all get one this year, all the churches will double.</p>
<p>The increase of some of the churches in the past few years is too low. Is this not a shame? This is due to our not buying the oil daily. If we would buy the oil daily, this will issue in something that cancels or annuls our barrenness. We will surely be fruitful. Just to encourage the brothers to go out to distribute the books is a temporary thing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING A LIFE OF BUYING<br />
AN EXTRA PORTION OF THE OIL</h2>
<p>My burden is to fellowship with you that you may rise up to live a life of always buying an extra portion of the oil by not wasting your time in doing anything. If you do something and you feel it is a waste of time, you had better stop doing it. Use that time to contact the Lord, to pray. This is to watch unto prayer. To be watchful is not to let your time go, not to waste your time, but to take every time as a chance to buy the oil. To buy the oil is the best way to redeem our time for the days are short. We all must rise up!</p>
<p>I believe I have given you enough deeper truths already. I feel burdened to fellowship with you in this way. All of us need to live such a life of buying the oil daily, even hourly. We need to buy the oil in the way we dress, shop, talk, and live. In everything we must be serious and consider the solemn parable given by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 25:1-13. Whether or not we will be raptured early to enter into the wedding feast depends upon our daily buying of the Spirit from this moment. This is a lifelong matter, not an overnight matter. To get the proper and adequate education is not an overnight matter. A person needs to begin his study from kindergarten and pass through many grades until he finishes college. Take this fellowship as something serious and solemn. This is not just advice, but my serious fellowship with all of you in love. I do hope that we all would rise up to live such a life. I do not like merely to stir up or move people because that does not work. The one thing that the Lord needs and that we need is to rise up to pay the price to buy the oil all the time in all the matters in our daily life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY TO BE FAITHFUL IN SERVICE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 24:45-51; 25:16-30</h1>
<p>We believers in Christ all need to have a serious realization that the Lord has given us a double status, a twofold status. We are the virgins in the divine life, in God&rsquo;s life, and we are the slaves in the Lord&rsquo;s service. We have seen that we need to be watchful and pray that we may always buy the oil to arrive at the maturity in life so that we might be ready for the coming rapture. In this chapter we want to see the way to be faithful in the Lord&rsquo;s service.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOUR GOSPELS</h2>
<p>The Scripture reading of this chapter contains portions from Matthew 24 and 25. As a background to our fellowship, I would like to describe each of the four Gospels with a single adjective. According to my understanding, Mark is an easy book. Luke is a pleasant book. John is a deep book. It is so deep that no one can touch the bottom of it nor the boundary. John is most profound. When you dive into it, you may get lost. John begins with the words &ldquo;In the beginning.&rdquo; No one can tell us what the beginning is. Also, the book of John does not have a conclusion, an ending. In the beginning was in eternity past and this book opens to eternity future. John does not have a conclusion like Matthew, Mark, and Luke do because John is such a profound and deep book. I would say that the Gospel of Matthew is a heavy book. The more you get into it, the more you understand it, the more you feel that you cannot bear it. Speaking in tongues is not at the conclusion of the pleasant book, the deep book, or the heavy book. It is at the conclusion of the easy book along with picking up serpents and not being harmed if one drinks poison (Mark 16:18). Many ancient manuscripts, even the best ones, omit the final twelve verses of Mark, in which the aforementioned items are listed. Luke ends with going to proclaim the forgiveness of sins (Luke 24:47). John ends with feeding the Lord&rsquo;s sheep and shepherding His lambs (21:15-16). Matthew ends with going to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the Triune God (28:19).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SERIOUSNESS OF MATTHEW 24 AND 25</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s charge at the end of Matthew is heavy, but not too heavy. The heaviest chapters in the book of Matthew are not in chapters five through seven which concern the reality of the kingdom of the heavens as the very constitution of the heavenly kingdom. The heaviest chapters are neither in chapter thirteen concerning the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. The heaviest chapters are Matthew 24 and 25 concerning the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. In these two chapters two heavy and sobering items are mentioned&mdash;the portion which is appointed for the hypocrites (24:51) and the outer darkness (25:30). The issue of these two items is the weeping and gnashing of teeth (24:51; 25:30). This is why I say that Matthew is a heavy book.</p>
<p>Matthew 24 and 25 are both a portion of the Bible and are both the word that came out of the Lord&rsquo;s mouth directly and shortly before His death. These two prophetic chapters were delivered by the Lord on the Mount of Olives (24:3). In the very night before His death, He gave another message, which is recorded in John 14&mdash;16 with a concluding prayer in chapter seventeen. John 14&mdash;17 is so deep, while Matthew 24 and 25 are so heavy. Anyone who has succeeded in a certain career gives a serious word when he dies. The message in John 14&mdash;17 is very deep, unveiling to us all the riches and depths of the divine life, of the Triune God, for our experience. The message given by the Lord in Matthew before His death is a heavy warning. He had no intention to warn the unbelievers, but rather His believers, who all have become the seeking virgins waiting for Him to come back and the slaves partaking in His service. His warning is not to sinners but to virgins and slaves. The believers have such a twofold status. We are virgins going out of the world with a bright and shining testimony, waiting for His coming back and getting ready to meet Him. We are also slaves in service serving Him with a commission. The Lord has delivered His possessions to us and has given us the talents.</p>
<p>I am sorry that such a top student and teacher of the Bible such as C. I. Scofield said that the foolish virgins and the slothful slaves were false Christians. Most of the Brethren teachers felt the same way. However, another group of Bible teachers, among whom were Pember, Panton, Govett, and Lang, repudiated the Brethren teaching. They said that surely these foolish and slothful ones are not false believers. They are genuine Christians, yet they are neither watchful in their life nor faithful in their service, so they will miss the mark in Christ&rsquo;s rapture and miss the reward in the coming dispensation.</p>
<p>We want to consider again the seriousness of Matthew 24 and 25. I do not have the burden to expound the Bible in this chapter. The truths in Matthew 24 and 25 have been adequately covered in the Life-study of Matthew and in the notes of the Recovery Version. My burden is that we would realize the seriousness of our position. Are we watchful to buy the oil every day and all day to get ready for Him to come to take us up? Have we been faithful and are we still being faithful in His service that we could be at peace when He comes back to settle accounts with us? Will we receive an appraising word and a reward from Him in the age to come or not? These are serious questions.</p>
<p>In John 10:28-29 the Lord assured us that He gave to us eternal life and that we shall by no means perish forever. The Son&rsquo;s hand and the Father&rsquo;s hand are holding us and no one can snatch us out of their hands. In Matthew 24 and 25, the Lord is not referring to eternal perdition in the lake of fire, but to a place set apart for the believers to be disciplined. The Lord did not say that believers would perish, but that many of them will be in a place where they will weep and gnash their teeth. If we believe that John 3:16 and 10:28-29 are the word of the Lord that we shall have eternal life and never perish, we should also believe the word in Matthew 24 and 25. This heavy book of Matthew tells us that if we are not faithful in His commission in 24:45-51 or in His gifts in 25:14-30, we will be put into a place called outer darkness where we are cut off from the coming Lord. To be cut asunder in 24:51 means to be separated from the Lord in His coming glory. His presence is the glory and the full enjoyment of the eternal life we have received, so this is a place where the believers will be cut off from His presence, a place called outer darkness.</p>
<p>If we believe in this portion of the Word and that the Lord will return, we must consider the seriousness of our readiness to meet Him. The Lord Jesus is coming. Are you ready to meet Him? The parable of the ten virgins shows us that to be ready for His coming we must buy the oil. To be ready is to be saturated with the oil, to get our vessel, our being, filled up with oil. To get the oil we have to pay the price; we have to buy the oil. For us to receive the regenerating Spirit did not require a price, but for us to receive the filling and saturating Spirit, saturating every avenue of our entire being, our mind, will, emotion, and conscience, does require a price. Everything related to these main parts of our being has to be saturated and filled with the Spirit who is the very oil. This is what it means to be ready for the Lord&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>Quite often I get warned by this portion in Matthew. Are you buying the oil or are you wasting time? Do you let the time slip away without getting any more saturating of the oil? Some may feel that they still have plenty of time before the Lord returns and this could be true. Even the Son, standing in the position of the Son of Man, does not know the day and hour of His coming back; only the Father knows (Matt. 24:36). If the Son of Man does not know, how could you and I know? On the other hand, none among us knows when he will die. Are any of us sure that we will be alive tomorrow morning? I am not cursing anyone, but I am warning you. Do you know that you will live for another two years? It may be that you will live a long life, but will you have bought enough oil?</p>
<p>It is not a matter of when the Lord will come or when we will die, but a matter of our having bought the oil. It is not a matter of when the exam for the students will be, but a matter of whether the students have prepared their lessons. To prepare lessons by studying is not an overnight matter. Many students in the top academic universities are very competitive. If you would try to seduce them to play some sports or watch television, they would say that they must take care of their studies. To prepare for a final examination requires you to study your lessons every day. The preparation is an accumulation of your study of the books. You may pray for two hours to repent and get yourself thoroughly cleansed, but that alone could not be sufficient to prepare yourself for His coming. The Lord might admit that you are clean and pure, but He would ask you where your oil is. A student may behave well and study for the final two days of his schooling, but that does not mean he will graduate. He will not graduate unless he has taken care of his lessons day after day. Therefore, it is not a matter of when we will die or when the Lord Jesus will come, but a matter of how much oil we have accumulated. To buy the oil takes a lifetime.</p>
<p>We have to remember that the Lord is fair. His judgment will be measured fairly to each one of us. If a person were saved last night and died this morning, I do not believe that the Lord would exercise a long judgment over him. For many of us, though, who were saved years ago and have been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for a number of years, the Lord will ask us how much oil we have bought and accumulated since we came into the recovery. A student&rsquo;s accumulated learning and knowledge over a long period of time is what qualifies him for graduation. My burden is that we would all wake up. Many of us have been asleep. This is why Paul said in Ephesians 5:14, &ldquo;Awake, sleeper, and arise from among the dead, and Christ shall shine on you.&rdquo; Today is a day that you should not lose for buying the oil. Today you must pay some price to buy the oil.</p>
<p>When I consider the subject of this chapter, the way to be faithful, my heart is nearly broken. By His mercy, I do not like to lose one day in which I am not doing my service, but the present situation in the recovery greatly concerns me. According to my observation, most of us are not doing our best to fulfill our service. This is why my burden is here. It is better for us to be exposed today than for us to be exposed at His judgment seat.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT BEATING OUR FELLOW SLAVES</h2>
<p>All of us should be those who are feeding the Lord&rsquo;s people at the appointed time (Matt. 24:45) and using the Lord&rsquo;s talents in full (25:20, 22). On the negative side, we should not be those beating our fellow slaves (24:49). You may not do your duty to perform your service, but instead you are criticizing and sometimes even strongly opposing the brothers. You are not doing the work, but beating the fellow slaves. Some of the sisters are always busy on the telephone. When they hear something good about the brothers, they are not interested in letting anyone know. When they hear something bad about certain brothers, especially the elders, they become busy on the telephone. This is why many of the elders in the local churches are afraid to do anything wrong. Once they do something wrong, nearly everyone knows through the use of the telephone. These telephone calls are all beatings. Many of the saints are beating the elders.</p>
<p>When something negative happens to any of the saints, some can never retain it. Passing on the news of this negative situation is a kind of beating. Sometimes you may have a subtle way of praying for a saint who is in a negative situation in the prayer meeting. You may not expose him at other times, but you expose him through your prayers. God knows your heart. The intention in your heart and in your prayer is not so pure. You may pretend to be so spiritual, not criticizing or judging people. You pray for people, but about ten percent of your prayer is a kind of judging. This is beating. The elders in one location may criticize the elders in another location. This is also beating the fellow slaves.</p>
<p>You waste your time of service in beating. Instead of doing the service you beat the brothers, the fellow slaves. Many of the brothers can testify that they never heard me beating others by criticizing or exposing them. My only burden is to release messages. Although I have no intention of exposing anyone, many are exposed by the light in the messages I release. That is not my job but the Lord&rsquo;s work. We all have to stop our criticizing, judging, opposing, and murmuring as a kind of beating. We must spend our time, our energy, and our everything to do a positive service for the Lord&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT EATING AND DRINKING WITH THE DRUNKEN</h2>
<p>Furthermore, we should not be those who &ldquo;eat and drink with the drunken&rdquo; (Matt. 24:49). This is to drift away further, a further fall from beating the fellow slaves. You have fallen away to the world and have become a world lover. The worldy people are drunk and even drugged with worldly things. They are stupefied with the present age. To eat and drink with them is to enjoy what they enjoy. In a good sense, when you are beating the saints, you are still interested in the church life. If you were not interested in the church life, you would never criticize the elders. Because you are so &ldquo;burdened for the church&rdquo; and so interested in the church life, you criticize the brothers and the sisters. Once you make the decision to forget about the church, to have no interest in the church, you enter into the loving of the world and you keep company with worldly people who are always being stupefied by this age. A saint who loves the world has no heart to talk about what elders are good or bad. He may once have been beating his fellow slaves, but now he is fully occupied with worldly enjoyment. He is now eating and drinking with the drunken. Nearly every day may be a happy day to him and nearly every weekend a pleasant weekend because he is enjoying the stupefying of the worldly things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT DIGGING IN THE EARTH<br />
AND HIDING THE LORD&rsquo;S TALENT</h2>
<p>We should not eat and drink with the drunken nor should we dig in the earth and hide the Lord&rsquo;s talent (Matt. 25:18). The earth signifies the world, so to dig in the earth signifies getting into the world. Any association, any involvement, with the world, even a little worldly talk, will bury the Lord&rsquo;s gift to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE RAINBOW BOOKLETS</h2>
<p>All these points we have fellowshipped should be a mirror to us to &ldquo;see what is on our face,&rdquo; to see where we are. An example that may help us to further realize where we are is our lack of bearing the burden to distribute the rainbow booklets, which contain a slightly edited version of the Life-study Messages. A few years ago many of the churches agreed to distribute these booklets. Initially, the distribution was quite encouraging, but it soon began to wane. Eventually, in nearly all the churches the rainbow booklets have hardly been distributed at all. As a result, our editing and printing of these booklets through the Living Stream Ministry office has become a real burden. We may say that we have no time or burden to spread the truth. We may have many excuses, but when we appear before the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10), the Lord will settle accounts with us (Matt. 25:19). Could you tell the Lord at His judgment seat that you had no time and no burden? I do not think He will take our excuses.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EVIL SLAVE BEING CUT ASUNDER</h2>
<p>The slothful servants who are not so faithful in the Lord&rsquo;s commission have an excuse that the Lord is not coming back immediately, that He is delaying His coming (24:48). As a result, they begin to mistreat fellow believers and partake of the worldly things. Their excuse is that if the Lord would return right now, everything would be solved; they would not have the time to love the world. However, the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 24 tells us He would not take this kind of excuse. At His coming back He will cut off or cut asunder His unfaithful slaves (v. 51). To cut asunder does not mean to cut into pieces. When we were saved we became attached to Christ, the anointed One (2 Cor. 1:21). Even if we are in a backslidden condition, the Lord will not cut us off. But if we remain unfaithful and slothful, at His coming back He will cut us off from this attachment. He will carry out a cutting asunder between us and Him. We will be cut off from His glorious presence into a place which will be the portion of the hypocrites. The portion of the unbelievers is eternal perdition, while the portion of the slothful slaves is a temporary, dispensational punishment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NO EXCUSES AT THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The slothful slave who was not faithful with the Lord&rsquo;s talent also had an excuse. He said, &ldquo;Lord, I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter; and I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth; behold, you have what is yours&rdquo; (Matt. 25:24-25). The Lord admitted that He is strict in what He demands of His slaves for His work and indicated that since the slothful slave knew this, he should have done something. The Lord admitted that in a sense He does not sow, yet He claims the reaping. He does not scatter, yet He claims of you the gathering. We may make many excuses that it is really hard to reap anything or to gather anything. We may present these excuses to the Lord at the judgment seat, putting the blame entirely upon Him. We may tell Him, &ldquo;Why did You delay Your coming back? Why are You so hard, reaping where You did not sow and gathering where You did not scatter?&rdquo; The Lord will not listen to our excuses, but instead will cut us off from His presence and take away the gift He has given to us. This is not my teaching, but this is what the Lord tells us in Matthew 24 and 25.</p>
<p>I hope that this fellowship can be used by the Lord to open our eyes to see that the way we have been taking is not the right way. Instead of making so many telephone calls, use the time to go to contact your next door neighbor and give him a rainbow booklet we have published. If you visited one of your neighbors once every two weeks, continuously, regularly, properly, and with a sincere burden and some prayer, do you not believe this person could be caught by the Lord? We cannot take anything as an excuse. We cannot say that many have been poisoned against us or that our particular area is a place full of Christians. We must ask ourselves how much time we have spent in visiting others with gospel tracts, with the Bible, and with some of the rainbow booklets. If you try this week after week and even day after day, you will see the result. The Bible tells us that the husbandmen or farmers should labor with patience, expecting to see the gathering (1 Cor. 9:10; 2 Tim. 2:6). You cannot say it is hard to reap a harvest before you have even sown something. That is not fair. You have to do the sowing, the cultivating, and the watering to help the crop grow. After a certain time according to the natural law, something will grow up. We all must ask ourselves whether or not we have done our duty. We have to realize that some day we will stand before the judgment seat.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD COMING BACK<br />
TO SETTLE ACCOUNTS WITH US</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word tells us that He will come back and He even warns us to get ready to meet Him. He will come back to settle accounts with us (Matt. 25:19). We will have to tell Him what we have been doing and what we have been gaining for Him. This is why I say that Matthew is a heavy book. If you do not feel that Matthew 24 and 25 are heavy, it may be that you are deeply stupefied. A sensitive person will have the deep sensation of how heavy these chapters really are.</p>
<p>George Whitefield, who was more powerful than John Wesley, was once preaching the gospel, telling people about the lake of fire. One of the listeners stood up and ran to embrace a big column in the hall and cried out that he was afraid of falling into the lake of fire. He preached the lake of fire in such a prevailing way that one of his listeners was warned to the uttermost. George Whitefield did not merely talk about the lake of fire, but he showed that the unbelievers would go there. In this chapter we are talking about the Lord&rsquo;s judgment seat and His settling accounts with you and with me. This is more than serious. I hope that we would all wake up. The Lord is coming and He will settle accounts with us.</p>
<p>According to the complete revelation of the Bible, the dead sinners have not yet been fully dealt with. Luke 16 tells us that they are still in Hades in a section of torment where all the perished sinners are (vv. 23a, 26, 28 and note 26<sup>1</sup>&mdash;Recovery Version). Eventually all the sinners will come out of that section of torment to stand before the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-12). On the white throne, the Lord will be the judge of the dead (2 Tim. 4:1) to make a final decision for all of the sinners to go to the lake of fire. Do not think that any dead sinner&rsquo;s problems are over. In like manner, do not consider that once a believer dies his problems are over. We will stand at His judgment seat to receive something from Him according to what we have been and what we have been doing since we were saved (2 Cor. 5:10). The Lord will settle accounts with all of us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO BE FAITHFUL</h2>
<p>The way to be faithful is to scatter the Lord&rsquo;s word, which is food to every hungry one. The Lord&rsquo;s household is composed not only of believers but also of sinners. Who will go to feed the hungry, sinful people? We all have to say, &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; We have to go. It is good if we have many full-timers in the gospel, but many of us have to make a living by working in the world. If we all go full-time in the gospel, no one could support anyone. We should not put our burden upon the church or upon anyone else to support us. Paul went full-time and was supported by the churches, but quite often no church and no saints took care of him. He was forced to make tents (Acts 18:3; 20:34). When he was making tents, he was very busy in writing the Epistles and very busy in caring for the hungry ones. We have to follow his example. He was not a professional preacher. Because he made tents, he had a trade, the same trade as Aquila and Priscilla. This shows us that we need to do a job to sustain our family, to make a living, but this should not be something to occupy us and give us an excuse. We must do everything that we can to spread the Word of God.</p>
<p>Many Christians are nearly void of the truth; they have the Word of God, but they do not care for it nor do they realize how much is in it. In this age of apostasy the Lord, by His mercy, has opened up His Word to us. Many of the divine riches have been printed and published. The more the riches are put out, the more we should be condemned and burdened. Why do we not go out with these riches? Our edition of the Recovery Version is not as expensive as some other Bibles. It would be wonderful if we could distribute some copies of this version to the Lord&rsquo;s seekers. We all should have the spirit and the burden to spare some money to get some copies of the Recovery Version into others&rsquo; hands. This is one of the ways to feed the Lord&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>Some of us may not be able to afford to purchase extra copies of the Recovery Version, but all of us can distribute the rainbow booklets. We have many thousands of these inexpensive booklets stored away and we are still publishing them. If we would practice this, this will be a base for us to stand before the Lord when He comes back. None of us will care for money when we are standing before His judgment seat. To save some money and spend it on the Lord&rsquo;s work is to use the mammon of unrighteousness to make friends (Luke 16:9). When you feed others with these spiritual publications, you will surely make friends. The Lord will reward you, and those who get saved and edified will receive you into the eternal tabernacles. Furthermore, we can go to others with our Bible and read Matthew 24 and 25 to them. Many Christians need these chapters to wake them up from their stupor.</p>
<p>My burden is not merely for a particular area of the United States. My burden is for the whole earth. The entire island of Taiwan is ready to be fully evangelized. The church in Taipei recently sent out sixteen gospel teams to surrounding towns, and they baptized nineteen hundred seventy-five people within three weeks. A number of these towns are ready for established churches. Everywhere the saints went, there was absolutely no opposition to Christ. Nearly everyone is open, especially the educated ones. The island of Taiwan is full of highly educated people. All over this earth people are not content to remain in ignorance or blindness. The more knowledge and education that people get, the more they find out that human life is just vanity. They have a desire to know the truth, the reality, the &ldquo;real philosophy.&rdquo; The real truth, the real philosophy, no doubt is in the Word we have in our hands. We should go out. If we would not go out, who would? It is not adequate to raise up, fund, and establish seminaries to teach seminary students. This is not up to the standard of the Bible.</p>
<p>The Lord has given talents to all His slaves. To one He gave five talents, to another two talents, and to another one talent. Everyone was required to trade, to do business, to make money for the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom. In order to do this, we have to feed His people at the appointed time. Every day is an appointed time, a meal time. Every office hour is a meal time. There is somebody ready to eat everywhere, so we need to be those using the Lord&rsquo;s talent in full. The five-talented slave made a profit of five talents and the two-talented slave made a profit of two talents. This indicates that they used the Lord&rsquo;s talent in full, without any loss or waste, so they both received the same reward.</p>
<p>Also, by His mercy and through His grace we must do the best not to beat the fellow slaves, the fellow believers. Do not criticize or murmur about them. Do not speak anything negative about them because you do not have the time to do it. Your mouth was not made for criticizing but for speaking forth Christ. To criticize the brothers is to beat the fellow slaves. This will cause us to be punished. We should also not go into the world to enjoy ourselves with the stupefied, drugged, and worldly people. We have to be the sober ones. We should not dig into the earth to bury or hide our talent. We should have a job to maintain our living, but we should not dig into it. We are different from the worldly people. I encourage all my grandchildren to do their best to get the highest education, but I do not agree that any one of them would &ldquo;dig into&rdquo; their education just to become an expert. I also encouraged all the young people in the churches to get the highest education, but do not dig a hole that buries the talent the Lord gave you. We all need to be faithful in the Lord&rsquo;s service.</p></body></html>
