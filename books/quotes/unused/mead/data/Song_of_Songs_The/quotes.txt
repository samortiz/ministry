[1]  CONTENTS The Initial Pursuit and Satisfaction The Call for Deliverance from the Self The Call for Ascension The Call of the Cross after Resurrection The Work of God The Groaning of the Flesh PREFACE
[2]  Chapter one, verse 1 says, "The Song of songs, which is Solomon's."
[3]  The Holy Spirit has shown us a vision which ordinary men have not seen.
[4]  After she has received God's enlightening and is dealt with by Him, she realizes the vanity of her former work she has only done what man entrusted to her, but not what God ordained for her.
[5]  This maiden sees three things in the chambers: 1 She sees the blackness in Adam and the fairness in the Son of His love; 2 she sees the vanity of outward work through God's dealing; and 3 she also sees the spiritual need.
[6]  Hence, the Lord answers her according to her seeking, and He praises her and makes a promise to her.
[7]  This reminds her not to forget her duty toward the kids in her daily life, as a result of her pursuit for food and rest, and not to lock up the gates of the kids.
[8]  Verses 9 to 11 say, "I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.
[9]  "With great delight" can be translated as "joyously."
[10]  Sitting down under His shadow means being exalted, and it carries the sense of being raptured.
[11]  One is joyous because he sits under His shadow, meaning that he feels as if he is being raptured to His presence.
[12]  Verse 7 says, "I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please."
[13]  The maiden has her shortcomings, and in this section we see what she should have gained, but has not gained.
[14]  But there is an obvious problem a wall exists between her and the Lord.
[15]  The wall encloses her, and it keeps the Lord out.
[16]  As a result, she does not say "my wall," but "our wall," meaning that the wall belongs to both her and to the Lord.
[17]  She would be able to find the Lord within her heart all the time, and she could ignore circumstances, persons, the brothers and sisters, daily duties, and many trials.
[18]  She should not try to hold on to the Lord with her own strength, but she should allow the Lord to lead her on.
[19]  Verse 10 says, "My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away."
[20]  The Lord speaks very clearly here; He wants the maiden to rise up and come away.
[21]  But if she continued in this way, she would not be able to contact the outside; the minute she contacted the outside, she would seem to lose her peace.
[22]  Verse 14 says, "O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely."
[23]  Now the Lord begins to ask for the fruit of the travail of His soul for the satisfaction of His own heart.
[24]  He is hinting that she should live for Him, and He is calling her to the clefts of the rock and the secret places of the stairs so that He can look at her there.
[25]  The Lord calls her to arise, to come out of herself, her feelings, and her introspection.
[26]  This is not the time for her to be in the house of wine; this is the time for her to live for the Lord.
[27]  Verse 15 says, "Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes."
[28]  If this word is spoken by the beloved, it is a continuation of 2:13, which says, "The vines with the tender grape give a good smell."
[29]  She is already clear that her beloved is hers, and she also knows that she belongs to her beloved, but these are not the things that she is after now.
[30]  A person who has freshly consecrated herself does not know what she should be to the Lord, yet she remembers how her beloved is to her.
[31]  Although the matter of work is touched here, the emphasis is not on the way the Lord deals with the flock, but on the relationship between the Lord and the lilies.
[32]  But she finds to her surprise that the inner feelings of His presence leave when the Lord retreats outwardly.
[33]  The Lord has not left her, but in her feelings He has indeed left her.
[34]  The Lord's way of training her is to take away her inner feelings of His presence when she cannot carry this presence to the environment in the world.
[35]  She thinks that she can embrace the Lord between her breasts all night long, just like she did before.
[36]  She would allow her union with the Lord to slip and become incomplete, and she would allow Him to act apart from her.
[37]  The Lord takes away her cherished feelings so that she will lose her feelings of His presence though not in fact .
[38]  The purpose of the Lord is to utilize her desire for fellowship in her feeling to attract her so that she would gain what she should gain.
[39]  She realizes that she is not advancing in her faith and that her feeling is gone.
[40]  The Lord teaches her to transcend over a rest that depends on time and place.
[41]  But after the Lord has taken her a step further, she realizes that a rest that depends on time and place is not complete.
[42]  But the most that the watchmen can do is to show the way or the teachings.
[43]  Although she realizes that she needs to come out before she can be with the Lord, her heart's desire is still for His presence in her feelings.
[44]  However, the Lord deals with man according to his measure.
[45]  Although there are still many lessons to learn and many things to know, the Lord is willing to be seen by the maiden, to be held by her, and to be taken away by her.
[46]  In the present stage of dealing, she has passed through sufficient trials; her pursuit is sufficient.
[47]  Since she has not yet learned to separate the soul from the spirit, the Lord does not put any further burden on her.
[48]  Although there is a mixture of the self, the Lord is willing to humble Himself and allow her to enjoy His presence once more.
[49]  In the last section the Lord was brought "into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me," and He remained there for a long time.
[50]  Since the maiden is able to remain quiet for a while and stay with the Lord in her mother's house and in "the chamber of her that conceived me," she must have passed her test and learned the lessons she was supposed to learn in the second section.
[51]  Verses 9 and 10 say, "King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.
[52]  He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem."
[53]  The palanquin, the pillars, the bottom of the palanquin, the covering, and the love belong to Solomon and to her.
[54]  B. The Beauty of the New Creation 4:1-5
[55]  Verses 1 through 5 say, "Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.
[56]  Since she has passed through the experience of 3:6 and since she has a complete union with the King, she no longer retains the praises for her own use.
[57]  Verse 6 says, "Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense."
[58]  Before a person has experienced anything deep in the Lord, and before he is thoroughly dealt with by the Lord, he likes to speak to others about his own spiritual experience, his own spiritual condition, his progress, and what he has acquired.
[59]  Although the Lord praises her, and although the Holy Spirit recognizes her total union with the Lord, she still feels her own weakness, corruption, wickedness, and uselessness.
[60]  There are many peaks of victory, and the ground of ascension is broad; there is room for movement and growth.
[61]  However, Ephesians shows us that the heavenly places chapters one and two are the very places where the enemy dwells chapter six .
[62]  Verse 9 says, "Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck."
[63]  Verse 10 says, "How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!"
[64]  When the Lord sees that the believers no longer set their mind on earthly things, but on the heavenly things in their experience, He will say, "How fair is thy love...how much better is thy love than wine!"
[65]  "Garments" speak of outward conduct, the walk, move, activity, entertainment, manner, and everything else that is on the outside, because a garment is outside of a person.
[66]  Since the maiden's dwelling is in Lebanon, she cannot help but have the smell of Lebanon on her garments, even when she walks in the world.
[67]  Since she is with the Lord in heaven, she inevitably brings forth a subconscious smell that is higher and loftier than that which is from the world.
[68]  The maiden realizes that the King considers her a garden, and she is aware of the many fruits and graces that she has received from the Holy Spirit.
[69]  Verse 5:1 says, "I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved."
[70]  Although this garden belongs to the Lord, this verse shows us that He does not come into His garden all the time.
[71]  We have to remember that although we belong to the Lord after we have consecrated ourselves to Him, it is a constant consecration that brings the Lord into our garden.
[72]  Song of Songs 5:2 says, "I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night."
[73]  Even when she does something, she does not feel that she is doing it herself; she feels that she is a bystander.
[74]  The resurrection life of the Lord is in her, and the resurrected Lord Himself is dwelling and living within her through the Holy Spirit.
[75]  In the past, we saw the cross for redemption.
[76]  Verse 3 says, "I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on?
[77]  It never occurred to them that the cross would become their shame, that they would not only lose worldly fame, but also their spiritual renown, that others would consider that God has rejected them, and that God would put them through trials and strip them of comfort and sympathy from those whom they know, who would think that they were smitten by God.
[78]  The cross must work so deeply on her until she is content with the portion that God has allotted for her and until she lets God take care of His own glory.
[79]  Therefore, she answers, "I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on?"
[80]  In her outward walk, the cross has put off the old man with its deeds.
[81]  Should she rise up to accept the loneliness and shame of the cross and to bear the misunderstanding, like putting on a coat that she has put off?
[82]  All that she sees is the preservation of her own cleanliness; she does not see that the defilement one receives in opening the door to the Lord is not really defilement at all.
[83]  Verse 4 says, "My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.
[84]  Verse 7 says, "The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me."
[85]  This time she does not go out to look for the watchmen, and she does not ask them.
[86]  They wonder how a person as beautiful as she, who has gone through as much change as she, would lose her beloved.
[87]  When she feels that she has offended the Lord and has lost His countenance, in her desperation she tries to find help even from the daughters of Jerusalem.
[88]  Verse 9 says, "What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?"
[89]  Although the daughters of Jerusalem do not have deep experiences in the Lord, and although they are not filled with the life of the new creation, they can see that the maiden is the fairest among women.
[90]  Mr. Darby said, "It is, I judge, a fine moral perfectness of thought that the bride never speaks of the Bridegroom's perfections to Himself as if she were to approve Him; she speaks of Him fully as expressive of her own feelings and to others, but not to Him.
[91]  The word "chiefest" in the original language means "lifted up as a banner" or "banner-carrier."
[92]  This means that Christ is the uplifted banner among tens of thousands of people.
[93]  Verse 14 says, "His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires."
[94]  It is no wonder that there is power and attraction, and no wonder that they still consider her as the fairest among women and join her in seeking after Him.
[95]  But after she presents her own testimony and after her attempt to help others, she suddenly receives light and the location of her beloved becomes clear.
[96]  Although He seemed to have turned away when she delayed in her obedience, actually He only retreated from her feelings; He is only showing her the pain of the withdrawal of His countenance.
[97]  Verses 5b to 7 say, "Thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead: thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them.
[98]  As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks."
[99]  Although the maiden failed through her delay and feels that she has sinned through falling into darkness, the Lord treats her just the same as before.
[100]  Verse 9 says, "My dove, my undefiled, is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her.
[101]  Verse 10 says, "Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?"
[102]  C. This Section Being an Unsettled Passage without a Conclusive Judgment 6:11-12
[103]  Verses 11 and 12 say, "I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished, and the pomegranates budded.
[104]  Only after she has been fully delivered from herself, her consecration and power of obedience have been fully put under the Lord, and she is filled with the thought of the Lord's glory to the extent that her hair becomes purple, would God dare entrust her with the power that enables her to imprison the King.
[105]  Verse 6 says, "How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!"
[106]  Since the Holy Spirit's word fully matches the Lord's will, the Lord is able to continue with the conversation, as if the previous words were actually spoken by Him.
[107]  When He hears the Holy Spirit speaking in verse 5, He cannot help but insert His word and speak directly to the maiden, who is the subject of the discussion.
[108]  At this point, the maiden is able to continue where the Lord left off because she is so one with the Lord.
[109]  The deeper a believer is in union with the Lord and the more he comes up to the standard of the maiden, the more he will be aware of his outward man and the shell of his flesh.
[110]  Verse 5 says, "Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved?
[111]  There she began her absolute union with the Lord in His death, His life, and all His grace.
[112]  The Lord answers and says that she is none other than the once-filthy sinner, who was seen by grace, called by grace, and saved by grace.
[113]  The maiden brings up those whom she has always cared for and who are younger than she is; she brings them up before the Lord to discuss them with Him.
[114]  Because she is living so much in the Lord's will, she can say, "We have ."
[115]  Verse 9 says, "If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar."
[116]  If there is anything that is of God, which causes her to build a separation between herself and that which is not of God, like a wall, then "we will build upon her a palace of silver."
[117]  She can say that she is a wall, and she can say that her two breasts are towers, but in the Lord's eyes, she considers herself as one who has obtained peace.
[118]  "Every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver."
[119]  The one thousand pieces of silver are the account that we have to give to the Lord.
[120]  Although she stands on a higher ground, and although she has a love relationship with the Lord and is different from others who serve Him out of a sense of duty, nevertheless, she does not give less than what the Lord's duty requires.
[121]  According to righteousness, she should only receive the fruits and not the silver S.S. 8:11 . However, all those who serve the Lord in love will find that when they do not take the Lord's work as a commercial enterprise, the Lord will not reward them on a commercial basis.
[122]  Verse 13 says, "Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear it."
[123]  He is not only dwelling in the heart of one who follows Him absolutely, but He is dwelling in the hearts of all those whom He delights in. The maiden addresses Him according to this relationship.
