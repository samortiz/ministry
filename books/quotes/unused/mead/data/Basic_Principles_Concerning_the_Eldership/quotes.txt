[1]  GOD S ADMINISTRATION AMONG HIS PEOPLE Scripture Reading: Gen 20:7; Exo 3:16; 7:1; Eph 2:20; 3:5; 1 Sam 8:4-9, 19-20; Matt 10:2; Mark 6:7; Luke 10:1; Acts 13:2
[2]  Prayer: Lord, we worship You for Your mercy and Your sovereignty.
[3]  We need to change our concept concerning human kingship.
[4]  In 1 Samuel 8 the elders request for a king greatly displeased God, who told Samuel, It is not you whom they have rejected, but they have rejected Me from being King over them v. 7 . This indicates that although the apostles, prophets, and elders are part of God s administration, the kingship should be kept for God Himself.
[5]  According to the Bible, there should always be a plurality of apostles, prophets, and elders.
[6]  AND CAPACITY OF THE ELDERS Scripture Reading: Acts 11:29-30; 14:23; 15:2, 4, 6, 23; 21:18; Titus 1:5 THE EARLIEST MENTIONING OF ELDERS
[7]  We need to see a few points concerning the elders.
[8]  The children of Israel had elders, but the Old Testament does not tell us how these elders were appointed.
[9]  In the same way, in the New Testament we can see that there were elders in the first local church, the church in Jerusalem, but there is no record of when or how they became elders.
[10]  The first mention of the elders in the churches is in Acts 11:29-30, which says, The disciples, according to how one was prospered, determined, each one of them, to send things for dispensing to the brothers dwelling in Judea, which also they did, sending it to the elders through the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
[11]  The migrations in the past few years have allowed a subtle practice to creep in, which we may call the transfer of elders.
[12]  An elder is like a father in a family, and fathers are not transferred.
[13]  If the elders in one tribe were weak, other elders were not transferred in from another tribe.
[14]  IN THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE APOSTLES, ELDERS, AND CHURCHES Scripture Reading: Acts 15:1-35
[15]  Prayer: Lord, we look unto You to show us more truth with the shining of Your light.
[16]  Since we have heard that certain ones who went out from among us have troubled you with their words, unsettling your souls, to whom we gave no instruction, it seemed good to us, having become of one accord, to choose men to send to you together with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[17]  Acts 15 reveals a few basic principles in God s administration.
[18]  First, the record in this chapter shows us that in the early days among the churches there was no head church.
[19]  However, in Acts 15 we can see that this was not so because the decision was not made by the church in Jerusalem.
[20]  Because Paul, who was the apostle to the Gentiles, and Barnabas could not tolerate this false teaching, they brought about much dissension and discussion v. 2 . However, neither they nor the church in Antioch made a decision concerning this matter, because they did not assume that they had the authority to do so.
[21]  The apostles and the elders were included because in God s administration the apostles represent the universal church, and the elders represent their respective local churches.
[22]  Verse 28 says, It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things.
[23]  However, just as the apostles and elders made the decision with the church, so also the Holy Spirit made the decision with the apostles and elders.
[24]  We must learn not to hide anything or do anything independently but to open everything for discussion.
[25]  The overseer then must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, of a sober mind, orderly, hospitable, apt to teach; not an excessive drinker; not a striker, but gentle; not contentious; not fond of money; one who manages well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity but if one does not know how to manage his own house, how will he care for the church of God?
[26]  Acts 14:23 records that in Paul s first journey he appointed elders in local churches not long after the churches were raised up through his ministry.
[27]  Paul does not use the word elder in 1 Timothy 3:1-7.
[28]  According to human history and our own experiences, we know that in most situations what we can or cannot do does not mean as much as what we are or are not.
[29]  Because we desire that the churches would spread, and every church needs elders, many young brothers should pray, Lord, if it is Your will, I would like to be one of the elders to take care of Your testimony in a locality.
[30]  The fifth qualification of an elder in 1 Timothy 3:1-7 is orderly v. 2 . To be orderly, or decorous, is to have behavior that always fits the situation.
[31]  The sixth qualification is to be hospitable v. 2 . The elders need to realize that serving the saints as overseers and shepherds requires much time because human life is full of turmoil.
[32]  An elder may think that listening to a brother s story is not very important, but to the brother it may be a lifeline because he thinks that there is no one besides the Lord Himself to whom he can tell his story.
[33]  The next qualification of the elders is to be apt to teach v. 2 . The word apt means tending, inclined, likely.
[34]  An overseer should be able to teach, but the point here is that he must be willing to teach.
[35]  If we have children, we should not only love our children but also have a habit to teach and instruct them.
[36]  CHAPTER SIX THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE ELDERS 3 Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 3:1-7 FURTHER QUALIFICATIONS OF THE ELDERS One Who Manages Well His Own House
[37]  In 1 Timothy 3:1-7 the apostle Paul writes concerning the requirements of the overseers, which are the qualifications of the elders.
[38]  Verses 2 and 3 concern mostly virtues and proper conduct, or the manifestation and expression of what the elders are in life.
[39]  Therefore, we must be zealous in preaching the gospel and convincing people to receive the Lord, but we must also realize that a person s salvation ultimately depends not on our effort but on God s predestination.
[40]  First Timothy 3:6 says, Not a new convert, lest being blinded with pride he fall into the judgment suffered by the devil.
[41]  This is also related to human relationships, for we cannot be proud if we are alone.
[42]  Although we may not be a new convert, we must see the principle that we must be careful not to become proud when we first become an elder.
[43]  In an established church that has a sufficient number of elders, it is good to have two or three apprentices helping the elders and learning from them how to care for the church.
[44]  Answer: The Bible does not say that an elder can retire.
[45]  However, because there are always several elders in a church, the older ones do not need to overly exert themselves, for the younger elders can bear the practical burdens.
[46]  Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God s chosen ones and the full knowledge of the truth, which is according to godliness, in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the times of the ages, but in its own times He manifested it as His word in the proclamation with which I was entrusted according to the command of our Savior God; to Titus, genuine child according to the common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
[47]  For this cause I left you in Crete, that you might set in order the things which I have begun that remain and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you: if anyone is unreprovable, the husband of one wife, having believing children not accused of dissoluteness or unruly.
[48]  For the overseer must be unreprovable as a steward of God, not self-willed, not quick tempered, not an excessive drinker, not a striker, not greedy for base gain; but hospitable, a lover of good, of a sober mind, righteous, holy, self-controlled; holding to the faithful word, which is according to the teaching of the apostles, that he may be able both to exhort by the healthy teaching and to convict those who oppose.
[49]  We have much to hope for in the eternal life, the life of God, because it is able to do many things that we are unable to do in ourselves.
[50]  However, the hope of God s promise is not only Christ as the seed of the woman but also Christ as the seed of life, the eternal life, that is sown into the believers Mark 4:26-28 .
[51]  The requirements of the elders in Titus 1 are nearly the same as those in 1 Timothy 3.
[52]  However, in Titus 1:7 Paul adds that an overseer must be unreprovable as a steward of God.
[53]  These words are not used in 1 Timothy 3, but they show that Paul s concept is that the requirements of an overseer are based not on his ability but on his manner of life.
[54]  First Timothy 5:17 says, Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching.
[55]  Here Paul indicates that it is good for the elders to teach.
[56]  CHAPTER NINE PETER S EXHORTATION TO THE ELDERS Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 5:1-7
[57]  Prayer: Lord, show us Your way in the eldership.
[58]  Because we are often polluted by our old man, our fallen nature, and our flesh, we need Your cleansing and Your forgiveness.
[59]  The pride of the elders frustrates God s grace from coming to the church, but the humility of the elders keeps a living flow of grace coming into the church.
[60]  BE HUMBLED UNDER THE MIGHTY HAND OF GOD THAT HE MAY EXALT YOU IN DUE TIME
[61]  We need to humble ourselves because pride frustrates God s grace from coming to us.
[62]  As elders, we should not be anxious for our possessions or family, but we must be concerned for the church and the saints.
[63]  At such times, we need to learn to cast all our anxiety for the church on the Lord because He cares for the church and the elders.
[64]  CHAPTER TEN THE ELDERS NEED FOR A FRESH VISION
[65]  OF THE LORD S RECOVERY Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 3:9; Titus 1:1-2, 9-11
[66]  In previous chapters we have seen the qualifications of the elders.
[67]  In this chapter we will consider the need for the elders to renew their vision of the Lord s recovery.
[68]  In order to have a clear view of the Lord s recovery, we must understand the terms the mystery of the faith; the faith of God s chosen ones; the full knowledge of the truth, which is according to godliness; the hope of eternal life; and the faithful word, which is according to the teaching of the apostles.
[69]  As elders, we need to fellowship with one another and contact the Lord in prayer concerning the vision of the Lord s recovery in order to fully realize what the Lord is doing among us.
[70]  The church is the assembly of God s called-out ones, the Body of Christ, the new man, the kingdom of God, the house of God, the bride of Christ, a warrior, a lampstand, and the testimony of Jesus.
[71]  The elders must also be apt to teach 1 Tim 3:2 .
[72]  When we begin to shepherd a brother, we may quickly discern that his need is basic knowledge of some item of the truth.
[73]  As genuine believers, we have life, but if we have seen life in a practical way, we will be able to discern life and not be misled if some try to lead the church in a wrong direction.
[74]  NEEDING TO KNOW THE LORD S RECOVERY IN TRUTH
[75]  According to the human mentality, the Bible appears to be a book of many doctrines concerning matters such as God, man s fall, and salvation.
[76]  To know the Lord s recovery in truth implies both doctrine and light, for the doctrines in the Bible convey truth, and truth is the shining of God as the divine light.
[77]  We may know that life is the Triune God, but we still need the truth, the shining of the Triune God in many aspects, in order to have the riches of life.
[78]  Of course, we do not possess the Godhead as deities to be worshipped, but because we are born of God, and God is our Father, we are the same as He is in life and nature.
[79]  We need to see that life is a person the Triune God, who in Christ has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension and has come into us as the life-giving Spirit to be our life and to mingle with us.
[80]  IN LIFE AND TRUTH 3 Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 2:4; 3:15; 4:3; Titus 1:1; 2 John 1-2, 4; 3 John 1, 3-4, 8 THE NEW TESTAMENT REVELATION
[81]  First and 2 Timothy, Titus, and 2 and 3 John, which were written during the degradation of the church, do not stress life as 1 John does but instead emphasize the truth.
[82]  First Timothy 3:15 says, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.
[83]  Second John 1-2 says, The elder to the chosen lady and to her children, whom I love in truthfulness, and not only I but also all those who know the truth, for the sake of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever.
[84]  We need to see why the truth is the necessary step to our receiving God as light.
[85]  Moreover, without God s word in the Bible, there would be nothing to believe in. Thus, John 5:24 says, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life.
[86]  In order to know the Lord s recovery in truth, we need to know the Bible not only in the way of doctrine but also in the way of truth.
[87]  Doctrines become truth to us only when we mean business with the Lord by touching Him, being willing to be touched and dealt with by Him, and having a purged conscience and an open spirit with a sincere heart that seeks after God s heart s desire.
[88]  IN LIFE AND TRUTH 4 Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4, 14, 17; 8:32, 36; 14:6; Gal 2:14; Eph 1:13; 4:24
[89]  We have seen that truth is the real content of doctrines, but we must also see that truth is nothing less than God Himself.
[90]  In Galatians 2:14 Paul says that Peter and the other Jewish believers who refused to eat with Gentile believers were not walking in a straightforward way in relation to the truth of the gospel.
[91]  We sometimes speak of certain truths, such as the truth of the church, the truth of the kingdom, or the truth of baptism.
[92]  The truth of the gospel is God revealed and realized because it is not a matter of whether the Gentiles can eat with the Jews but a matter of whether the Gentiles can enjoy God.
[93]  When we touch the content of any doctrine, if we do not touch God Himself, we still do not have the truth.
[94]  Question: What is the relationship between our receiving of the truth and our experience of it?
[95]  Answer: When we see the truth, we receive it, and it becomes our experience.
[96]  If we reject a particular teaching from the Bible, we are rejecting God in that aspect and cannot experience Him as such.
[97]  However, we must be careful not to interpret the Bible according to our old, natural concepts, for this will cause us to miss important aspects of the truth.
[98]  When we see the truth of the church ground and receive it, we apply it and experience an abundance of life.
[99]  In previous chapters we saw that life is God and that the truth is the content of the Bible.
[100]  Then when we read the Bible, the Spirit will enlighten us, and the doctrines in the Bible will become truth to us, which is God Himself, who is light, life, and grace.
[101]  THE OLD, NATURAL BEING 1 Scripture Reading: Matt 16:24-26; Luke 19:23-25; John 12:24-25; Rom 6:6; 8:13; Gal 2:20; 5:24; 2 Cor 4:10, 16
[102]  In previous chapters we saw that in order to know the Lord s recovery, we need to know God as life and the content of the Bible as the truth.
[103]  The Lord said to Nicodemus, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God John 3:3 , and Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God v. 5 . The kingdom of God in this age is the church.
[104]  When the Lord told His disciples that He would be crucified, Peter rebuked Him, saying, God be merciful to You, Lord!
[105]  If we know what the Lord s recovery is, and we see that in the recovery there is no place for the self our natural being in our opinions, preferences, and choices we will take up the cross.
[106]  THE OLD, NATURAL BEING 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:16 THE PROPER ATTITUDE CONCERNING
[107]  We need to see that in the church life there is no place for anything natural, yet because we are in the process of being transformed, we are still unconsciously and unwillingly somewhat natural.
[108]  The church life in the Lord s recovery is unique, absolutely different from any human society or religious organization; the church life is altogether a matter of Christ as life and the Bible as the truth and has no place for our natural man.
[109]  OF THE MINISTRY AND THE CHURCHES THE SPHERE AND SERVICE
[110]  We all must bear the burden to pray that the Lord would raise up more brothers to participate in the ministry so that every region would be adequately cared for.
[111]  They must allow the elders to bear the burden of the local building so that they can spend more time to minister to all the churches in a region.
