   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE IMPORTANCE OF MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is a personal aspect as well as a corporate aspect of the grace that God gives to man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the personal aspect, we can receive grace when we read the Bible, pray, seek after God, and contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, there is a corporate aspect of grace that can never be obtained through just our personal contact with God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It can be received only in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must also realize that the personal aspect of grace is not as weighty even though it is practical and necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the corporate aspect of grace, the grace received in the meetings, is great and weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, a person can be touched by the gospel and receive salvation when he thinks of God or reads a spiritual book or a portion of the Bible on his own.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, his salvation will not be as strong as it could be if he is in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who are saved in a personal way may not have a salvation experience that is thorough or strong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a person experiences salvation in a meeting, however, his salvation will be strong and thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The light we receive when we read the Bible by ourselves can be small and limited.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But when we read the Bible with others, the light we receive can be great and unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Similarly, although we can touch the Lord s presence in our personal prayer, it is often limited.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But there is an aspect of the Lord s presence in the meetings that exceeds an individual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even in our prayer, we are often limited to trivial matters when we pray by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our prayer for crucial matters is often ineffective.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is like moving boxes of different weights.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may be able to move a box that weighs twenty pounds, but it is impossible for us to move a box that weighs twenty thousand pounds by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we attempt to move such a large box, it will be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we attempt to move it, it will still be in the same place even after twenty years of effort.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to move it, we must gather others and move the box together.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a principle in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are many things we cannot move by ourselves that must be brought to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are some spiritual matters for which the personal aspect of grace is insufficient; hence, they must be brought to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some people constantly try to overcome a weakness or shortcoming by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They pray repeatedly, but no matter how much they pray, they are unable to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If they would be willing to bring that weakness to the meeting and ask others to pray with them, they will easily overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Likewise, there are matters that cannot be understood through individual seeking, but they can be easily understood if we are willing to seek with other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This shows the importance of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There are many examples of this in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the Lord Jesus appeared to the disciples on the evening of His resurrection, they rejoiced to see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, since Thomas was not with them, he missed the Lord s appearing John 20:19, 24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Mary Magdalene s experience of the Lord s appearing was fresh on the morning of His resurrection vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>1, 14-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, the weight and richness of that appearance cannot be compared to the Lord s appearance in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the Lord appeared to His disciples, He breathed into them and said, Receive the Holy Spirit v. 22 . The Lord also charged them, saying, Whose sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you retain, they are retained v. 23 . Such an appearing in which the disciples received the Holy Spirit and were commissioned was not experienced individually.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was experienced in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Concerning the two aspects of grace that God gives to man, although the personal aspect is fresh and sweet, it is far less important than the corporate aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thomas missed a great blessing because he was absent from the meeting that evening.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, he was present when the Lord appeared again in the evening of the following Lord s Day, and it was then that he obtained the blessing he had missed vv.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>26-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If he had been absent from the second evening, he would have suffered a loss that could never have been regained.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit was poured out when the disciples were gathered together; He was not poured out while the disciples were having their personal prayer time Acts 2:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These examples show that if we want the Lord s presence, the Holy Spirit s outpouring, and the Lord s blessing, we must meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Understanding the Bible, answers to prayers, understanding God s will, deliverance from sins, and the solving of problems are often matters that cannot be solved individually.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But once a person goes to the meeting, there is a way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, Christians can never be without meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I repeat, there are two aspects to the grace that God gives to man: the personal and the corporate aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Grace in the personal aspect can be obtained in private, but grace in the corporate aspect can be obtained only in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, a normal Christian should not neglect his personal contact with God, nor should he neglect coming to the meetings to worship God with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To neglect either aspect will cause us to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Moreover, the loss suffered by neglecting the corporate aspect is greater than the loss suffered by neglecting the personal aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rarely can Christians who only have a personal aspect and not a corporate aspect continue to stand firm before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It seems that those who are somewhat loose on the personal side but who continue to meet can still be sustained before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This shows that the corporate grace is greater, weightier, and more important than the personal grace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, we must meet.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>THE MEETING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christians should not only meet often but should also meet to the extent that meetings become a habit, and thus, a meeting life is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to see that meeting is not an occasional act of Christians; rather, it is the Christian life, just as eating and washing daily are part of the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Every morning we need to wash ourselves when we rise.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then at noon, we need to wash our hands again.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need to wash our hands several times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Furthermore, we need to eat three meals a day and drink water many times.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>These are not occasional acts; rather, they constitute our living.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The meeting of Christians is the same; it is a living, not an occasional act.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If Christians do not meet, it means that they do not live.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If man does not eat, he cannot live.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He will starve to death.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Likewise, if Christians do not meet, it is the same as committing suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They are killing the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It seems as if the believers at the time of Pentecost did nothing but meet.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They met from morning until night.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many people ask us why we meet every day of the week, meeting in the mornings and also in the evenings.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Frankly speaking, however, we do not meet as often as the believers at the time of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Meeting is the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As soon as Christians stop meeting, they stop living.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>NOT ABANDONING OUR ASSEMBLING TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Hebrews 10:25 says, Not abandoning our own assembling together, as the custom with some is.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Abandoning the assembling together will eventually become a habit as well.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>A Christian who develops a habit of not meeting is in a dangerous state and will certainly be unable to stand firm.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Concerning our meeting together, these five points should be adequate for this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the following lessons, we will consider how to meet and the different kinds of meetings.</S>
