   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE SIXTY-THREE THE LAW THE TESTIMONY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we have pointed out, in the ark in the Holy of Holies there were three crucial items: the hidden manna, the budding rod, and the tables of the law 9:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the past five messages we have somewhat covered the hidden manna and the budding rod.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we come to the tables of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE LAW BEING GOD S TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Bible it is difficult to find the term the tables of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Old Testament frequently speaks of the tables of the testimony Exo 31:18 , and the New Testament mentions the tables of the covenant Heb 9:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why was the law called the tables of the testimony and the tables of the covenant?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is quite easy to understand why the law was called the tables of the covenant because in the Old Testament the law was the old covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is difficult, however, to understand why the law was called the tables of the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When God commanded Moses to build the ark Exo 25:10 , He said, Thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee Exo 25:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The testimony in this verse undoubtedly denotes the law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God did not say to put the law in the ark; He said to put the testimony into it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because the testimony was placed in the ark, the ark was called the ark of the testimony Exo 25:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, the tabernacle was called the tabernacle of the testimony Num 17:8, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, we have the testimony, the ark of the testimony, and the tabernacle of the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the manna and the budding rod were placed before the law, they were put in front of the testimony Exo 16:34; Num 17:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whatever was placed in front of the testimony was before God Exo 16:33-34 , for the testimony could not be separated from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When something was before the testimony, it was before God, and when it was before God, it was before the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is this testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have seen that the ark is called the ark of the testimony and that the tabernacle is called the tabernacle of the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The law was called the testimony because it testified of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For this reason, it was God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Genesis 1:26 we are told that God created man in His own image.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God s intention is to have an expression through man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This expression is His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, the testimony of God is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God s intention has been, still is, and for eternity will be the same to work Himself into man that He may be expressed and have a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But before God accomplished this, man fell.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In his fallen nature, man tried to do good in order to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because of this, God gave man the law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God gave man the law because man did not know that, as a fallen being, he could neither satisfy God nor express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After the law was given, however, God immediately changed the term, calling it the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What God gave man was the law, but it was not mainly called the law but the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Psalm 119 the word testimony is used many times to denote the law vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>2, 88, 168 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every time this word is used in Psalm 119 it refers to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to man s concept, the law means the ten commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But God s intention was not that the law should be some commandments, but that it should be His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I was in Christianity, I never heard the term testimony used with respect to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I only heard about the ten commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Christianity, when many young people are examined for membership in the so-called churches, they must recite the ten commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although you may be able to recite the commandments, perhaps you have never heard that the testimony in Psalm 119 is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In fact, in the book of the Psalms the word testimony refers to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I say once again that in God s intention and according to His concept, the law is His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But in the human concept, the law is the ten commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you are trying to keep God s law, it will certainly be the ten commandments to you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But if you know what life is, and if, instead of trying to keep the law, you walk with God, you will realize that the law is God s testimony, God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE TWO ASPECTS OF EVERY LAW</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Every law has two aspects, the aspect of the law-keeper and the aspect of the law-maker.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Laws are for people to keep.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As we have mentioned several times in the past, the kind of law you make reveals the kind of person you are.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If bank robbers could make laws, they would legalize bank robbing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some legislators want to legalize such an evil thing as prostitution.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This reveals that they themselves are evil.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Evil lawmakers will enact evil laws.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>That the laws we make express the kind of people we are is true not only in a nation but also in a family.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the parents in a family get up very late every day and do not clean the house, they will make family laws which allow their children to get up late and to be messy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But if the parents are strict, clean, neat, and diligent, they will have a different family law.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They will require their children to arise early in the morning, to wash themselves, and then to clean their rooms.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If I visit this kind of home and see this type of regulation, I shall immediately know that the parents there must be diligent and clean.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But if I go into a home where everything is a mess and where the children are allowed to sleep until late in the morning, I shall also realize what kind of people the parents in that home are.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Since the laws we make testify to what we are, our law becomes our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the side of the law-maker, the law is a testimony; on the side of the law-keeper, the law is a commandment or regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God s law also has these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To us who attempt to keep the law, it is the ten commandments, but to God, it is His testimony.</S>
