   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verses 31-46 give the parable of the sheep and the goats.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This parable refers to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the Scriptures there are three categories of people: the Jews, the church, and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since in chapters twenty-four and twenty-five the Jews and the church have been covered, this portion describes the prophecy concerning the Gentiles at the end of time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, presently there are two interpretations regarding this parable: 1 that it refers to the future universal judgment at the end time, and 2 that it refers to the judgment of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both interpretations are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1 This judgment does not refer to a future universal judgment at the end time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>a Suppose this refers to a universal judgment in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such a judgment would necessitate the inclusion of the Jews, the church, and the Gentiles, regardless of whether they are dead or living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today there is a great fallacy in the church which asserts that there is to be a universal judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, no such thing is mentioned in the Scriptures at all.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead, the Scriptures distinctly separate the judgment on the church from that on the Jews and that on the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Based on this parable, many say that salvation can be ascertained only at the judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They hope that after they die or sometime in the future they will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this way, the church today is made merely a place where salvation is hoped for.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If indeed there is a universal judgment, we will not possibly know whether or not we are now saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>b Let us see who those are who are under the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"And all the nations" in verse 32 should be rendered "the people of all the nations, the Gentiles," or "the aliens of all the nations."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, those who will be judged are clearly the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The same word was used in Matthew 4:15; 6:32; 10:5, 18; 12:18; 20:19, 25.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Greek language, this word includes all the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>See also Romans 15:11 and Acts 15:17.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>c Again consider the time of the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is before the millennium v. 34 . In Revelation 20:11-15 there is yet another judgment, at the white throne.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we are certain that there cannot be one universal judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>d Then, consider the place of the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord is sitting upon the throne of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Revelation 3:21 there are two thrones, one of the Son and the other of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today the Lord is sitting on the throne of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the future He will be sitting on His own throne.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Matthew 25:31 refers to His own throne, the throne of the kingdom; it is on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose the people of all the nations in verse 32 were not on the earth but in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How then can these people be divided into nations?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Where are the boundaries for all the nations?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The nations' boundaries exist only on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the judgment is not on earth, those who are to be judged must have been raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This will mean that a portion of those who are raptured are the unsaved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>e All the judged are living persons, and there is no dead person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Scriptures there are only two occasions of resurrection, and they are separated by a span of a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the first resurrection there are no unsaved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here, the goats are those set for perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They, therefore, cannot be in the first resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, this judgment does not concern Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>f Satan has not yet been cast into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The words "prepared for the devil" in verse 41 are a proof of this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Prepared means that it has not happened yet.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the judgment spoken of here is the judgment at the white throne, then Satan should have been cast into the lake of fire long before.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>g The Son of Man is the Lord's name in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After a thousand years this kingdom will become the kingdom of God 1 Cor 15:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>h The prophecy needs to coincide with other portions of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Elsewhere the Scriptures clearly describe that there are several judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>2 This judgment does not pertain to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some consider sheep as referring always to Christians John 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, the same is not true here, for the following reasons:</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>a The people of "all the nations," who are the Gentiles, would then be participating in the judgment of the people in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to John 12:48, these people have never received the word of the Lord, and they do not know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>b This judgment will not be according to the laws of Moses nor according to faith, but according to their deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, they are neither the Jews nor the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>c The church was chosen before the foundation of the world, but they were chosen from the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>d They do not even know when they serve a little brother.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Suppose these are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How can they not know the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A Christian clearly serves the little brother for the Lord's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Jews give alms, knowing that it is for Jehovah's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But these people here simply do not know what they are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even the slothful servant knows, as does the evil servant Matt 25:24; 24:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>John 14:19-20 says that the church knows the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>e The judgment for us Christians is not on the earth but rather in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>f This judgment is not the first resurrection, because there are unsaved ones here.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>g This judgment is for eternal life and eternal death.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This kind of judgment has long been resolved for the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>h The saved ones and the unsaved ones cannot be put together in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>i Whoever the little brother is, he must be different from the sheep and the goats.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The little brother is a believer of the Lord one who has already been judged.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Undoubtedly, he is a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He is not a Jew, since the relationship of brotherhood between the Lord and the Jews has already been severed Matt 12:46-50; see also the text below.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If the sheep are the Christians, there will not be a clear distinction between them and the goats.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>j Christians know clearly who are the children who love God; but these people do not.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>k If they are Christians, then the salvation of a Christian is not by faith but by the good treatment of a little brother.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>l If a man is saved by giving food, providing shelter, supplying medicine, and visiting prisoners, then there will be no opportunity for the little brother to be saved, for while he is in prison, he has no possibility of carrying out these good deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The parable of the sheep and the goats can be divided into four main sections: 1 the gathering of the sheep and the goats vv.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>31-33 , 2 the dialogue with the sheep vv.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>34-40 , 3 the dialogue with the goats vv.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>41-45 and 4 the conclusion v. 46 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The first section: the gathering of the sheep and the goats.</S>
