   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE SPECIFIC EXPERIENCES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A CHRISTIAN SHOULD PURSUE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What then is the meaning of the God of Isaac?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The God of Isaac means that all of God's demands, expectations, and standards which He set forth in Abraham are fulfilled by God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Abraham we see God's purpose, and in Isaac we see the operation of God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's demands and standards are seen in Abraham, while God's provision and storehouse are found in Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The God of Abraham speaks of God setting up a standard for the vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The God of Isaac speaks of the fact that all the life and power one needs to become such a vessel and reach such a standard come from the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Isaac is the son, and the son inherits everything from the father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is no need for a son to strive with his own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We will not reach God's goal just by knowing the God of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to reach God's goal, we have to learn to know the God of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But we cannot stop there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We also should know the God of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not enough just to have Abraham, and it is not enough just to add Isaac; Jacob must also be added.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jacob was a crafty and deceitful person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet he met God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's work in Isaac was a supplying work, while His work in Jacob was a smiting and disciplining work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These two kinds of work are different.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God was always supplying Isaac, while He was always stripping Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Isaac continually received grace before the Lord, while Jacob was continually chastised by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In other words, in Isaac we see God supplying Christ to us, while in Jacob we see the Holy Spirit disciplining us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Isaac shows us the meaning of the enjoyment of the overcoming life, while Jacob shows us the meaning of the dealing of the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Isaac shows us the riches of the resurrection life of Christ which God has given to His children, while Jacob shows us how God deals with the natural life, the soulish life, and the fleshly energy until one day the root is cut off, and the hollow of the thigh is touched.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God will not stop working on us until we realize that it is spiritually useless to do anything according to our planning, our wisdom, and our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God wants to teach us one deep lesson, which is to remove our self.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, the God of Jacob completes the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob is for the God of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The life that God has given us is bound by our natural life and cannot be free.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, God needs to deal with the natural life step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A Christian must be dealt with by God to the extent that others see a mortal blow in him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Unfortunately, some Christians have been dealt with by God tens and even hundreds of times, yet they have not received a mortal blow.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only a mortal blow will subdue Jacob and stop him from his scheming, planning, energy, and activity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once the activity of the natural life ceases, the life that God gives us will be liberated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we want to see everything that is in Christ being perfected in us, we must make sure that nothing in us comes from the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must cease from everything that is natural before Christ can be fully manifested in us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What kinds of experiences should we Christians seek?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need a vision before God like Abraham had, we need a life like Isaac had, and we need the discipline of the Holy Spirit like Jacob had.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These are the three specific experiences that we should pursue.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should never think that one of them is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must have all three experiences before we can become valuable in the eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must have a vision that sees what God is after.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must have a vision that sees that everything is of Him and that He is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the same time, we must know the life of Christ and know that His grace is our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we live by the flesh, we will not reach God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His work, not ours, will make us His vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After we have seen the life of Christ, we may still be ignorant of our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Consequently, it is easy for us to replace the life of Christ with our natural strength and take the grace of the Lord to glorify ourselves and use it as our boast and our pride.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is why we need the discipline, like that which Jacob experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we have the vision, we see what God is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we have the life, the overcoming life, we can praise and have the confidence to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But there is still another aspect; God has to deal with us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we know the God of Isaac, we will have the confidence to say, "But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ" 2 Cor 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rom 8:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, we still need to know the God of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God's dealings with Jacob tell us that it is still possible for us to fail.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We cannot guarantee our trustworthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the Lord does not protect us, we can become weak and fallen at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In Isaac we know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In Jacob we know ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Because we know Christ, we have confidence, and because we know ourselves, we lose our own confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When these two combine together, we will fully live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some people have seen that God is the Father, that He is everything, and that everything is of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Yet they still try to deal with themselves, suppress themselves, and restrict themselves by their own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>While they are doing these things, there is nothing within them to positively support them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As a result, they go through much suffering only to find that they have not yet attained.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is not the spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Other people have seen that Christ is life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They have received Christ and the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But they forget that their natural life still exists.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They have not seen that their natural life needs to be dealt with just as their sins needed to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As a result, they mistakenly regard things that pertain to the natural life as manifestations of the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Again, this is not the spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is not enough just to realize that Christ is the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must also see the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In order for us to be God's people, to be His vessel, to maintain His testimony, and to reach His goal, we have to know God as the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>All three experiences are necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Having just one or two is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The day will come when God opens our eyes to see the vision of His demands.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The day will come when God opens our eyes to see His work in Christ and that Christ is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The day will come when God opens our eyes to see that He has to touch our natural life and break its strength.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we see these three things, we will go forward.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I repeat that these three things are specific experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Just as God revealed Himself to Abraham and became the God of Abraham, He has to reveal Himself to us to become our God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Just as He revealed Himself to Isaac and became the God of Isaac, He has to reveal Himself to us to become our God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Just as He revealed Himself to Jacob and became the God of Jacob, He has to reveal Himself to us to become our God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We must know God in these three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We have to know the meaning of God being the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We must have these three experiences before we can go on in a proper way.</S>
