(Less than twenty miles to the southwest is Feng Shiu Ling. It borders Tai Shun to the west and Fu Ting to the south.) It is a hub of business and also the most centrally located place among the churches in our three counties.</P><P>In 1928 when Brothers Chang Wu Sheng and Wang T'ien Tso (Brother Wang T'ien Tso passed away on Wu Tai Mountain on December 12 of last year) returned from Shanghai, the Spirit of God enlightened and led them, causing them to walk in a way they had never walked before. At that time there were only a few brothers meeting in a rented house. The Spirit of the Lord did a great work. People came from Wu Tai Mountain and Wan Yao to hear the Word. Many received grace and were saved. Between the fall of that year and the following January, there were two special prayer meetings. Many brothers and sisters who loved the Lord and who were seeking the truth came from P'u Men, Chiang Nan, Tai Sun, Fu Ting, or from other places both near and far in our area. All prayed steadfastly together with one accord and the Lord poured out extra grace, leading them to much edification. This was the beginning of our meeting which came fully under the Lord's name. Now the brothers and sisters in Wu Tai Mountain and Wan Yao meet in either Wu Tai Mountain or in Ting Pu T'ou, close to Wan Yao. The church in Ch'iao Tun Men is very isolated. There are only five brothers and sisters in the table meeting. (Recently, there are a little more than twenty people including those listening to the gospel and newly saved ones who have not been baptized.) This year Brother Chang Wu Sheng is being tested greatly. On the evening of January 26, his grocery store was completely burned down. In addition, his family (his father, mother, wife, and children) has become very sick. But by the Lord's grace, he still carries the lone burden of the work in the church in Ch'iao Tun Men. Within the last four or five months, six or seven brothers from a certain denomination in Kuan Mei (about fifteen miles south of Ch'iao Tun Men) have voluntarily left the denominations through the Holy Spirit's work. They have not yet rented a place to meet. There are still many difficulties, and it is very important for the work to continue. We hope the brothers and sisters who love the Lord will pray for this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Meeting in Ting Pu T'ou</H2><P>The locality of Ting Pu T'ou is about thirty miles northwest of Ch'iao Tun Men. In 1931 we preached the gospel there, and God worked immediately. Two of those listening were saved. One was Brother Hsieh Ch'ung Ch'ang. After he was saved, he lacked the nurturing in the truth, so he was greatly attacked by evil spirits. They almost killed him. The worst experience was recently; Satan brought him to lie down on the treadle of a sewing machine and started to lower the upper stone treadle that looks like a large ingot onto him to crush him. Suddenly the power of God caused the stone to fly outward, so he was not injured at all. Thank the Lord for leading him to overcome. Since this he has been very zealous to glorify the Lord's name. In the winter of 1931, Brother Chang Wu Sheng and I (Yu T'ing) felt deeply that the meeting there was very crucial and were praying about it. The Lord gave us a building with seven rooms. There are also two buildings to the left and right and a vegetable garden. It faces the water and has its back to the mountains. The area is very quiet. In March of 1932 we moved in to meet. Now there are ten brothers and two sisters at the table meetings. They all are recently saved. There are also a few brothers who have life and are ready to be baptized. There is a brother called Lin Yu Kao who is a young scholar. He came to hear the word in June of this year and was regenerated. He also had what seemed to be tuberculosis, but at that time, he was cured. He is experiencing Christ's resurrection life day by day, and he has never stopped praying, reading the Bible, and keeping morning watch. May the brothers in the Lord pray especially for this brother that he might go on and be able to help the meeting there.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Meeting in Chu Hsi</H2><P>Chu Hsi is more than ten miles through mountain roads from Ting Pu T'ou. In 1932 two leading brothers who helped in the work of a certain denomination there, Chang Ta Ch'a and Lin Jui Chieh, along with three unregenerated members of the denomination, frequently came to Ting Pu T'ou to listen to the Word. The two received the enlightenment from the Lord and were moved and revived by the Holy Spirit and began to understand that in God's work we should not partake of the mistakes of others. They knew it was even more wrong for believers and unbelievers to bear one yoke (that was the condition of their denomination). So they were strengthened by the Lord to leave that denomination. The pastor of the denomination tried to keep them. He did not know that they were leaving for the sake of the truth. His exhortations for them to stay were in vain. The other three members of the denomination were also regenerated and became very zealous. They are also a great help. In 1933 two young brothers (Cheng En Sheng and Teng En Ming) also heard the Word and were saved. They are really precious. In July they rented a house to meet in. After they met for several weeks, I went and stayed there for three weeks. I saw another sister being saved (she is not yet baptized). Now Brothers Chang and Lin can take care of the message for the morning meeting. In the afternoon, they remember the Lord. (There are seven people. Four were baptized last year.) They are very sincere. I am very moved in my heart by them. This work was really initiated by the Father Himself. We can only praise and thank Him!</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 25: Collection of Newsletters (1) &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
