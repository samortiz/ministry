   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Isaac</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In a sense, in Isaac the transfer of life was accomplished but it was not fully completed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We know this by the fact that Isaac still begat Esau whom God hated Rom 9:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that within Isaac the natural life still remained.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, we may say that in Isaac the transfer of life was not completed thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was completed in Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Jacob 1 Firstly Being the Supplanter Jacob</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At first, Jacob was a supplanter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His name means a supplanter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To supplant means to take the place of another, or to get something, through subtle means.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jacob was one who stole in a secret way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For instance, he stole from his uncle, Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Laban thought that Jacob was helping him with his flocks, but while Jacob was helping Laban, he made a flock for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is an example of Jacob's supplanting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the first, Jacob certainly did not have the transfer of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>2 Eventually Transformed into Israel,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>the Prince of God</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God had a way to deal with Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He transformed Jacob, the supplanter, into a prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although it took God a long time to accomplish this, at a certain time He told Jacob that his name was being changed from Jacob to Israel 32:27-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thereafter, he was called Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God did the same thing to Jacob that He had done to Abraham: He changed his name and his strength.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When God came in to deal with Jacob, Jacob was truly a supplanter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He even wrestled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was so strong in a natural way that even God found it difficult to subdue him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not laugh at Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are the same as he was.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are so strong that even God finds it difficult to subdue us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When God comes to deal with us, we wrestle with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although it is difficult for God to subdue us, eventually we shall be subdued by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jacob's wrestling forced God to touch his thigh, to touch the strongest part of his being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After that happened, he was lame.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From that day onward, his supplanting was over.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The supplanter had become a prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Throughout the remainder of his days he did not steal again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His supplanting hands became blessing hands.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He no longer supplanted; he only blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He stretched out his hands to bless whomever came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He even blessed Pharaoh, the greatest king on earth at that time 47:7, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The supplanter became a blesser.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here we have the full transfer of race with the complete transfer of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is God's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God's calling began at Genesis 12:1 and will continue until the coming of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the supplanters will be terminated and become the princes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The New Jerusalem will come in, not only as a transfer of race, but also as a transfer of life.</S>
