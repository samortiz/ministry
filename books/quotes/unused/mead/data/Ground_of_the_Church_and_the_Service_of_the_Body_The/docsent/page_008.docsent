   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE SPIRITUAL CONDITION OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I explained to him that we have never said that only we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such words are naive and immature.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, we testify that only we are standing on the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then this brother asked, What is the ground of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He asked this question not because he had doubts concerning the ground or other intentions but because the ground was difficult for him to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I could tell that he was seeking understanding, so I gave him an explanation: The church is universally one, but her local expressions are many.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, there should be only one expression in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The ground of this local expression is what we mean by the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He still did not understand, so I explained by using a type in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Old Testament God redeemed the children of Israel to be His people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moreover, He ordained that as His people they needed to meet in Jerusalem in the land of Canaan, a place that He had chosen as the dwelling place for His name.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, one day His people were taken captive to Babylon and lost the ground of God s people, that is, the ground of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once they left Jerusalem and were taken captive to Babylon, they lost the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although they were still God s people, they were not able to stand on the ground of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only Jerusalem was the place, the ground, upon which they as God s people could properly stand.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the same principle, the church is universally one, but her expression is local.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Just as Jerusalem was the proper ground for the Jews, locality is the proper ground for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although the children of Israel were taken captive to Babylon and lost the proper ground, it did not mean that they were no longer Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They were taken captive and lost the ground of God s people, but they did not lose their status as God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To say that the Jews in Babylon were not God s people would be immature, and those who believe in this kind of speaking are too naive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Jews lost the ground, but they were still God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They were still Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the seventy years of their captivity were fulfilled, some of the Jews might have said, We are God s people, so we should be in the place God ordained for us, that is, Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is wrong for God s people to be in Babylon; we should go back to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, others among them might have said, It is not necessary to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since we are already God s people, it does not matter whether we are in Babylon or in Jerusalem; all that matters is that we live before God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is to not care whether God s people are in Babylon or Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In New Testament terms, this can be compared to caring for being full of Christ but not caring for the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is as if the only thing that matters is whether God s people live in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In other words, it does not matter whether the ground is right or wrong; all that matters is the presence of Christ and having some degree of spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then I asked the brother, Is it possible to justify such an attitude?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Can you say that this is right?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He replied, I have seen many brothers and sisters in many different groups living for the Lord fervently, serving the Lord wholeheartedly, and endeavoring to keep the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Can we say that they are wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why can we not join them?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our desire was to help this brother see that even if someone is as spiritual as Daniel, he still may have a problem in regard to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Perhaps some may say, Daniel was so spiritual, yet he remained in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why then do we need to go back to Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I do not believe that anyone can take spirituality as a cover or excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The fact that Daniel remained in Babylon was something of God s sovereign arrangement for the interest of God s people; moreover, when he was in Babylon, he prayed three times a day toward Jerusalem, praying desperately for God s people to return to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This indicates that he also longed to return.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some people have said, Those who have returned to Jerusalem, that is, to the ground of the church, are not that spiritual or strong.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We absolutely acknowledge this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the days of the return from the Babylonian captivity, the spiritual condition of those who went back to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel was very improper.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some married Gentile women, some were not in one accord, and some were timid.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All these conditions were discouraging.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Nevertheless, although their condition was poor, the ground they stood upon was right.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They were in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, God could still deal with them and bless them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although the condition of Daniel was good, we cannot say that the ground he stood on was right or that he should have stood there.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was not in Jerusalem but in Babylon, a ground God opposed and cursed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This shows clearly that spiritual condition and the ground are two entirely different matters.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is possible to have one and not the other.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God s intention is that we pay attention to both our condition and the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Let us consider several people.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The first example is Madame Guyon.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I am afraid that hardly anyone among us loves the Lord more and has a greater measure of Christ than Madame Guyon.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, we cannot acknowledge that she stood on the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>She was in the Catholic Church, on a ground that we oppose.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Her case clearly shows that while a believer may be very spiritual, he may be on an improper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He may be right in his spirituality, but the ground on which he stands may be absolutely improper.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hence, we need to completely separate the matter of the ground from that of a believer s condition.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The second example is Andrew Murray.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many people throughout the years have said that he was very spiritual; nevertheless, he was still in organized Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>At this point, the brother from Hong Kong asked whether or not there was a church in Andrew Murray s time.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After I had spoken so much, he still asked such a silly question.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In response, I stressed that the church existed, but it had lost the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Hence, it is not a question of whether there was a church but of whether there was the proper ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Madame Guyon had a strong and influential role in the church, but we must acknowledge that she did not stand on the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>She stood on the ground of the Roman Catholic Church, not on the proper ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the same way, Andrew Murray was also a strong and influential saint, but he was in organized Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>His ground was organized Christianity, not the genuine church.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He was not on the proper ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He was part of the church, but he did not stand on the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I then used the example of Dr. F. B. Meyer.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He was renowned in recent church history, and even T. Austin-Sparks greatly commended him, yet he too was still in organized Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It can be said that his spiritual condition was very proper, but the ground of the church on which he stood was absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We should not ask people what they are but where they are.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We are not saying that spirituality is unimportant.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We confess that it is basic and important, but merely having this is inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Rather than asking, What are you? we need to ask, Where are you?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Let me use another illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A member of a family should live at home.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If he goes anywhere else, whether to a place where he feeds hogs and eats carob pods or to a grand and luxurious palace, it is the wrong place.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It is insufficient to be merely a member of a family; a member should also live at home.</S>
