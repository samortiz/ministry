   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A PRACTICAL TEST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A number of expositors have been troubled by the fact that verse 26 comes immediately after verse 25, where Paul speaks of walking by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some prefer to make verse 26 the opening verse of chapter six.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 26 Paul deals with vainglory, provoking, and envying.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The reason Paul mentions these matters is that they test whether or not we are walking by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only when we walk by the Spirit can we overcome vainglory, provoking, and envying.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In a sisters or a brothers house it is easy for there to be vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Certain brothers or sisters may think that they should be the leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This attitude gives rise to provoking and to envying.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Perhaps a certain sister gives a rich and releasing testimony in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Out of envy, another sister may determine to give an even better testimony in the next meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Vainglory may be found even between a husband and wife.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because of the desire for vainglory, a brother may become envious if his wife receives praise that he does not receive.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Vainglory, provoking, and envying are all of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can check whether or not we are walking by the Spirit by asking whether we have any vainglory, provoking, or envying.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a very practical way of testing our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By putting forth such a test, Paul showed how practical he was and how experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From his experience he knew what it meant to suffer from the same diseases that afflict us in our spiritual life today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For quite a long time, I was bothered by the inclusion of verse 26.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually I came to realize that without this verse it is purely theoretical to talk about living by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But when we test our living by the matters of vainglory, provoking, and envying, living by the Spirit becomes extremely practical.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In relation to others, it is easy for us to be subject to vainglory, provoking, and envying.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Romans 8:14 Paul says, For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul s thought is somewhat different here from his thought in Galatians 3:26, where he says, You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yes, through faith we have become sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But now we need a walk which proves that we are God s sons.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In such a walk we are led by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>GOD S PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Under the influence of our religious background, many of us have held the concept that God s goal in sending His Son, Jesus Christ, to die for us is that we should believe in Him, have our sins forgiven, and be qualified to go to heaven, where we shall enjoy eternal blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the Bible, however, God s goal is to have many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible certainly teaches that we are sinners, that God loves us, and that Christ came to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the Bible also says very clearly that in eternity past, before the universe came into existence, God made a plan, a purpose, according to His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This purpose is to have many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In simple words, God s purpose is sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In eternity past God s desire was to have many sons for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Bible the proper meaning of sonship is expression, for a son expresses the father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>John 1:18 indicates this: No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God s purpose is to have many sons as His corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, Ephesians 1:5 says that God has predestinated us unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many expositions of the book of Romans emphasize justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some also speak of sanctification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But according to the book of Romans, it is not God s goal merely to have many people who have been justified and sanctified by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Romans reveals that God s goal is to transform sinners into sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Romans 8:14 does not say that as many as are led by the Spirit are sanctified, spiritual, victorious, or will live in heavenly mansions.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the contrary, this verse says that those who are led by the Spirit are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, in verses 29 and 30 we see that those who are predestinated, called, justified, and glorified will be conformed to the image of God s Son.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In these verses Paul indicates that we have been predestinated not simply to be sanctified, spiritual, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God has predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son, so that His Son should be the Firstborn among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once again we see that God s intention is to have sons, many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The first chapter of the Gospel of John says that the Word, who was in the beginning with God, became flesh and tabernacled among us vv.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As many as received Him have authority to become children of God v. 12 . According to John 20:17, the Lord told Mary the Magdalene on the morning of His resurrection, Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Notice the Lord s use of the word brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord did not instruct Mary to go to His saints, believers, disciples, or apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He told her to go to His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is yet another indication that God s intention, the desire of His heart, is to have many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hebrews 2 also speaks of sons.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to verse 10, God is leading many sons into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus came to His disciples to declare to them the name of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the book of Galatians, Paul emphasizes again and again that we are not law-keepers or slaves under the law, but we are sons of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God had to do many things to make us His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He first had to send His Son to redeem us from under the law that we might receive the sonship 4:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God has also sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts to make our sonship real and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is not God s intention simply to rescue many sinners and make them holy, spiritual, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>According to His good pleasure, His purpose is to produce many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Ultimately, we, the redeemed and sanctified ones, will be God s sons in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All those in the New Jerusalem will be called sons of God, not simply the people of God Rev 21:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Even today we are more than just the people of God we are the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For us to be sons of God in a way that is real and practical, we urgently need the Spirit.</S>
