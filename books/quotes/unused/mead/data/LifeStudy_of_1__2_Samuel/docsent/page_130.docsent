   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Our Need to Be Strengthened into Our Inner Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since God's building Himself in Christ into us depends not only on Himself as the element but also on the nutrients supplied by us, we need to be strengthened into our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we remain in our soul, in our natural man, there will not be any nutrients for the growth of the divine seed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But if we are strengthened into our inner man and if we pay attention to our spirit and exercise our spirit, the nutrients will be supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then Christ will make His home in our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If Christ's making His home in our hearts did not need something from us, Paul would not have prayed for us as he did in Ephesians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here Paul prayed that the Father would strengthen us with power through His Spirit into our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This power, referred to in Ephesians 1:19-22, is the power that raised Christ from the dead, seated Christ at the right hand of God in the heavenlies, subjected all things under Christ's feet, and gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such power operates in us 3:20 , and with it God strengthens us for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Spirit through whom God strengthens us is the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, God strengthens us with Himself as the element and, on the other hand, we afford the nutrients.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through these two God in Christ carries out His intrinsic building the building of His home in our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE NEW JERUSALEM A COMPOSITION</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>OF DIVINITY AND HUMANITY</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>BLENDED AND MINGLED TOGETHER AS ONE ENTITY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The conclusion of the divine revelation in the Bible is a building, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This building is a blending and mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is proved by the description of the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 3 refers to the New Jerusalem as "the tabernacle of God," and verse 22 says, "I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The New Jerusalem as the tabernacle of God is for God to dwell in, and God and the Lamb as the temple are for the redeemed saints to dwell in. This indicates that the New Jerusalem will be a mutual dwelling place for God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, this building is a composition of human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The gates are pearls inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel v. 12 , and on the twelve foundations are the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb v. 14 . This indicates clearly that the New Jerusalem is a composition of the Triune God, who is the essence, center, and universality, and God's redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The New Jerusalem is a composition of divinity and humanity blended and mingled together as one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the components have the same life, nature, and constitution and thus are a corporate person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a matter of God becoming man and man becoming God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These two, God and man, man and God, are built up together by being blended and mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the completion, the consummation, of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all need to see this vision.</S>
