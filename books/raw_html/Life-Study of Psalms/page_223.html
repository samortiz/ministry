<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE PSALMIST'S TRUST IN GOD<br>AND HIS PRAISE TO GOD</H2><P>Psalm 71 is about the psalmist's trust in God and his praise to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Psalmist's Trust in God</H2><P>Verses 1 through 12 are about the psalmist's trust in God. In verse 5 he says, "You are my hope, O Lord Jehovah,/My trust from my youth."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Psalmist's Praise to God</H2><P>Verses 6b, 8, and 14 through 24 are the psalmist's praise to God. In verse 6b he says, "My praise is continually of You," and in verse 8 he declares, "My mouth is full of Your praise, /With Your glory, all day long."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Psalmist's Expression<br>from His Complex Sentiments<br>concerning His Enemies</H2><P>Even in this good psalm about trusting in God and praising Him, the psalmist does not forget his enemies. In verse 13 he says, "May those who are the adversaries to my soul/Be put to shame and consumed;/May those who seek my misfortune /Wrap themselves in reproach and humiliation." This word is a repetition of 70:2. Once again, this is the psalmist's expression from his complex sentiments concerning his enemies.</P>
