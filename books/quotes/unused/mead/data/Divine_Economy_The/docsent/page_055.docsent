   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By the Lord's mercy, we have seen that in the book of Revelation there is the sevenfold Spirit for the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"The testimony of Jesus" Rev 1:2, 9; 20:4 is an all-inclusive expression.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This all-inclusive term is not so easy to define.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The testimony of Jesus is the testimony of the Son coming with the Father by the Spirit to live on this earth for thirty-three and a half years and to die on the cross to clear up the universe, to release the divine life, and to resurrect from the dead to become a life-giving Spirit; the life-giving Spirit comes as the Son with the Father compounded with divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, including all the divine attributes and all the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such a compound testimony is the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This testimony has a symbol the golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The golden lampstand is the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE EMBODIMENT OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As the testimony of Jesus, the golden lampstand is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the golden lampstand there are three main factors.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, the entire lampstand is gold.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not only golden, but gold itself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In typology in the Bible, gold always signifies God the Father's divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, the golden lampstand is not a lump of gold, but a piece of gold in a definite form and a purposeful shape.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This signifies the embodiment of the Godhead, the embodiment of the Father's nature, and this embodiment is the Son, Christ Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The third factor is the seven lamps, which are shining for God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, with the lampstand are the nature, the embodiment, and the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Based upon these items, we can say that the golden lampstand is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Revelation 4:5 tells us that the seven lamps are the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since the seven lamps are the seven Spirits, the essence and the shape of the lampstand must also be something of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, the golden essence signifies God the Father, and the shape, the form, the appearance, of the lampstand signifies God the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the lampstand we see the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, so the golden lampstand is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God the Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is expressed through the Spirit this is the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to Revelation 1, the golden lampstands are the churches vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every local church is a golden lampstand, and the golden lampstand is the embodiment of the Triune God as the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, the local churches are the multiplied embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This definition is too high, too profound.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Apostle Paul did not say anything about this high, deep, and profound aspect of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians, the church is revealed as the Body of Christ 1:22-23 , the new man 2:15 , the kingdom of God, the household of God 2:19 , the temple, the dwelling place of God 2:21-22 , the fullness of the unlimited God 3:19 , the bride 5:25-27 , and the warrior 6:10-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But Paul never told us that the churches are the lampstands.</S>
