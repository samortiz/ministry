   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH 8 THE TABERNACLE 4 The Hangings of the Outer Court</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The hangings of the outer court were a wall of hangings made of fine white linen.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The hangings were portable and could be taken down and put up at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The hangings were not the same as the walls of our meeting hall, which are fixed and unalterable.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are several matters related to the hangings that deserve our attention, including the bronze sockets, the silver connecting rods, and the fine white linen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Sockets of Bronze</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Beneath the tabernacle, silver sockets supported the standing boards, which were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On top of the boards were four layers of coverings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The outer court of the tabernacle was framed with hangings of fine linen supported by bronze sockets, bronze pillars, and silver rods.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The children of Israel would set up the pillars and silver rods around the outer court, and then hang the hangings of fine white linen upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Beneath the rods were bronze sockets and pillars Exo 38:17, 29-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those familiar with the types of the Bible know that bronze signifies judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The children of Israel lifted up a bronze serpent on a pole, typifying that the Lord Jesus was hung on the cross and judged by God for the sin of the world Num 21:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, the strongest proof that bronze signifies judgment is found in Numbers 16 and 17, where two hundred fifty people from the company of Korah rebelled against God while holding bronze censers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later their bronze censers were used to cover the altar 16:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, bronze is a sign and a symbol of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever we encounter bronze in types, we need to understand that it signifies judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Lord appeared to John in Revelation 1:15, it says, His feet were like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This signifies that the Lord Jesus passed through the test of God s judgment and that the Lord is executing judgment in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord s feet having the appearance of shining bronze signifies that all the steps the Lord passed through and all He accomplished on the earth have passed through the test of God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus is able to judge the church because His feet have been fired in a furnace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since bronze signifies judgment, the bronze sockets at the base of the hangings around the tabernacle signify that the judgment which the Lord bore for us on the cross has become the base of the hangings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Connecting Rods of Silver</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On top of the bronze sockets were silver connecting rods Exo 38:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Old Testament, silver was used for expiation; therefore, it signifies redemption 30:11-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The judgment that the Lord Jesus bore for us accomplished a redemption that enables us to stand before God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The redemption that we enjoy today is based on the judgment that the Lord Jesus bore for us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, redemption is the result that issues from the bronze sockets as the base and is typified by the silver rods.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Hangings of Fine White Linen</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hangings made of fine white linen 38:16 were hung on silver rods 27:9, 11-12, 14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should pay attention to this point.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Fine white linen denotes the righteous acts of man before God, the righteousness that enables man to be acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Isaiah 64:6 indicates that our condition may be likened to a soiled garment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Luke 15 the first thing that the father did for the prodigal son when he returned home was to change his robe v. 22 . His original robe was intolerably filthy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As soon as his father saw him, his father put the best robe upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This signifies our being justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our past behavior and living offended God and were not acceptable to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They were entirely incompatible and did not match the status, position, glory, and condition of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, when we received the Lord Jesus, God gave the Lord Jesus to us as our righteousness, and thus we were justified by God in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that when we are in the Lord, He becomes our garment, the best robe, which enables us to meet God s requirement and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, our condition before God is able to match God s status and position, causing us to be justified before God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In brief, the hangings in the outer court denote our justification before God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The hangings are not only related to justification but also to the matter of forming a boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The hangings were a border, a clearly defined boundary, separating the tabernacle from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everything outside the hangings was unrelated to the tabernacle; however, everything inside the hangings was related to the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The hangings signify the boundary of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is the boundary of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What is the difference between the church and the worldly people?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The New Testament offers some explanations, but these explanations are not sufficiently clear; however, in the Old Testament the tabernacle as a type presents a clear picture.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The separating line between the church and worldly people is the clean, white condition of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This clean, white condition is the result of God s redemption, and God s redemption is based upon the judgment that the Lord bore for us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From the picture of the tabernacle we see that the boundary of the tabernacle was a line of white cloth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we examine this picture further, we can see that the white linen was hanging on silver rods that connected the pillars, which were standing in bronze sockets.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The separation, the boundary, between the church and the world is the condition of the church s being justified by God, which makes her clean and white.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This condition issues from God s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God s redemption is based upon the judgment that Christ bore for us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This point requires much care.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The bronze sockets signify the Lord s suffering the judgment of God on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Redemption issued from this judgment; hence, the silver rods were above the bronze sockets.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Redemption produces justification; hence, the fine white linen was hanging from the silver rods.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The fine white linen, however, not only signifies our justification before God but also our justification, which is expressed and hung before men to see.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we read about the types in the Old Testament carefully, we will see that the tabernacle contained fine white linen within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When a person looked at the tabernacle from a distance, he would see fine white linen.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If he entered into the tabernacle, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies, he would see fine white linen with strands of blue, purple, and scarlet, as well as embroidered cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The first layer of fine white linen in the tabernacle typifies that we are saved, justified, and accepted by God because of the Lord s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The fine white linen in the hangings of the tabernacle also indicates that our justification before God is manifested among the worldly people as the boundary between us and them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Among our colleagues, family, friends, and relatives, there should be an expression in us that we are justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The hangings, the white linen, signify the justification that we express, which is the separating boundary between the church and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This white line issues from God s redemption, and God s redemption is based upon the judgment that the Lord bore for us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hence, white linen was hung on the silver rods, and the silver rods were on the pillars standing in the bronze sockets.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The linen hangings of the outer court make the boundary between the church and the world crystal clear.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The three main items with respect to the hangings are bronze sockets, silver rods, and fine white linen.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The bronze sockets signify the Lord s bearing God s judgment, the silver rods signify the Lord s redemption, and the fine white linen signifies God s justification.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Judgment, redemption, and justification are the separating line between the church and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The church consists of those who have accepted the judgment that the Lord received on the cross and who have been redeemed and justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Everyone else is outside of the church, outside of the boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The separating boundary between the church and the world is drawn in this way: Whoever has received the Lord s redemption and God s justification by receiving the Lord Jesus judgment on the cross is within the boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Whoever has not received the Lord s redemption and God s justification is outside of the boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The responsible brothers in all the local churches must be aware that if they bring someone who has not been redeemed by the Lord or justified by God into the church, they are eliminating the boundary of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This can be likened to the tabernacle without the hangings.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Without the hangings, the tabernacle would have no boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We must be very careful in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Today in many so-called Christian churches, there are no linen hangings.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Not only have the linen hangings been taken down, but the bronze sockets have been taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This means that some who have not received the work of the Lord Jesus on the cross, who have not received the redemption of the Lord, and who have not been justified by God have become part of the so-called Christian churches.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This creates an abnormal situation of confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Our main emphasis, however, is regarding the fine white linen.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The boundary of the church is the fine white linen.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Anything that is within this boundary is fine, clean, white, and beautiful, without any filthiness or coarseness.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We must realize that justification is not merely a doctrine, that is, something objective; it is also something very subjective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Justification relates not only to our position but also to our living.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This means that we not only confess that Christ suffered judgment on our behalf, that the Lord s blood is for our redemption, and that God has justified us, but we also experience a change in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Hence, justification is not merely an objective doctrine but also our subjective experience.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Anyone who has received the Lord s work of the cross and is truly justified by God must display the condition of the fine white linen.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If a person has only the fact of justification in Romans and Galatians without the proof of the justification in the Epistle of James, we should put a question mark on the justification he has received.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If a person truly has received the justification in Romans and Galatians, he will have the works of justification in James.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The justification spoken of in James is related to works and in one s living.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>When a sinful and filthy person, who formerly did all kinds of evil, hears the gospel, receives the Lord as his Savior, and is redeemed and justified by God, there should be a great change in his living.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>It is difficult to believe that a person who is full of sinful stains will have no change in his living after receiving the Lord s redemption, God s justification, and God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If this is the case, his believing is questionable.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Zaccheus, the tax collector, had a great turn in his being after he met and touched the Lord Luke 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Once he received the Lord, his life changed.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>He said to the Lord, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much v. 8 . In the past he received but never gave.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>After meeting the Lord, he not only dealt with his unrighteous possessions but also tried his best to give away everything that he owned.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>His life was completely changed.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This shows that justification is a matter not only before God but also before man.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Justification is a wall of linen for man to see.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>It testifies that worldly people are on one side and the church is on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Those who are within the boundary of the church should be like fine white linen, expressing a significant change in their living.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The church should remove from among them a saint who is a fornicator, a covetous man, an idolater, a reviler, a drunkard, or a rapacious man 1 Cor 5:11-13 , because the boundary of the church is fine white linen.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If a saint is unclean, he will contaminate the fine white linen.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Like the lepers in the Old Testament, he is unclean, and he must be cast outside the clean white boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>He must be dealt with in another place and wait until his leprosy is cleansed before coming back within the boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Although we cannot define a certain truth based solely upon our personal experience of salvation, our experience always testifies to the meaning of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>It is inconceivable that after receiving the Lord, a person would have no change in his living before man.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The gospel is the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>If someone has received the gospel in a proper way, he will undergo an immediate change.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>This is an unalterable fact without any exceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>This change causes our walk, our behavior, and our living to be as clean as white linen.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Formerly, we were full of stains, coarseness, and roughness, but now we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>God s life is in us, and our living has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>What we express is not only clean and white but also gentle and fine.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>We have the condition of fine white linen.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>To be coarse is to be rough.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>An unsaved person is coarse and rough even in his gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>To be fine is to be gentle.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>A saved person is gentle and fine.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Most of us work in various professions, and the people whom we contact every day are worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>The separating line between us and them is not a Christian symbol that we wear, but the fine white linen within us.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>They can lie, but we cannot; they can give and take bribes, but we cannot; they can do things that wrong the nation, but we cannot; they can freely take possession of public property, but we cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>There must be a distinct separating line between us and the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>This separating line is not that we call ourselves Christians but that we bear the expression of fine white linen.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>As a result, we have a walk and living that is clean and fine.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>The worldly people should testify: This person belongs to the church and is different from us.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>We may sometimes attend certain banquets in order to meet a need.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>While others are able to eat, drink, and talk casually, we cannot, because there is a distinction between us and them.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>As a result, people will say, Oh, he belongs to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>This is the reality of the boundary of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>We are a group of people who have received the Lord s work of the cross, the Lord s redemption, and God s justification.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>The justification that we have received from God hangs upon us for others to see.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>This is not a matter related to the doctrine of justification but to expressing our condition of justification.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>We prove our justification by the condition of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>In the picture seen in this type, the hangings of fine linen were not for God to see but for man to see.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>God was within the veil, and the veil was not transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Hence, the hangings were for man to see.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>During the time the children of Israel were wandering in the wilderness, the white linen hangings surrounding the tabernacle formed a boundary whenever the tabernacle was erected.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Even people who were far away in the wilderness could see the white boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>All other colors are mixtures; only the linen hangings were clean and white.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>The tabernacle was within a white boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>This typifies that the church is clean, white, and fine to those who contact her.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>If people can say that a certain church is clean, white, and fine, the church has a proper expression.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>The boundary was not related to the bronze sockets and the silver rods but only to the clean, fine, and white linen hangings.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>These linen hangings were hung on silver rods, and the silver rods were on pillars that had their base in the bronze sockets.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>This typifies that the distinction between the church and the world depends upon the expression of justification in the saints, which is worn and is based on redemption and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>The fine white linen not only signifies the justification that we receive from God but also the expression of this justification before worldly people as a separating line between us and them.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>The church should have a boundary of linen hangings; it should be located within a clean, white boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>Today s Christianity has lost its white linen hangings.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>Its condition is just as filthy as that of society and as corrupt as that of the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>This should not be the case.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>Nevertheless, we should not use human methods to draw a separating line; instead, we should always look to the Lord for His mercy so that the power of His salvation would not depart from us.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>The gospel is the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>We should preach not only the gospel but also the power.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>It is not enough for people to merely hear the gospel; they need to touch the power.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>When we baptize people, we should not merely ask them to receive a doctrine and then baptize them into the water with a view to making them members of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>We must ask the Lord for mercy so that when people touch our gospel preaching, they also touch power.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>When people receive the gospel, a power should operate in them to the extent that they would not only be justified by God but would also wear the fine white linen of justification.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>The justification that they receive from God should be worn, hung, expressed, and displayed before men.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>This will enable others to see that they are justified by God and that they are wearing fine white linen.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>This is the real boundary of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>I have a heavy burden that all of God s children would see the separating line of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>The church is set apart.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>Hence, those in the church must also be set apart.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>A church without this separating line has lost her linen hangings.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>Anyone who enters the church must pass through regeneration and experience some definite change.</S>
