   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Once There Is a Denomination,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There Is a Division</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we will look at the second point.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our brothers say that we should have a "spiritual" fellowship, a "spiritual" unity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Does the unity of the Body of Christ refer to the "spiritual" unity as advocated by the brothers in the denominations today?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is half "yes" and half "no."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible clearly shows us that God's children should not be divided, but the denominations are obviously divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once we have a denomination, we can see a division.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As long as a division exists, do not talk about "spiritual" unity!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This behavior lacks thoroughness, as we have already mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot advocate unity on the one hand, yet advocate denominations on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We cannot keep the divisions on the one hand and talk about unity on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Just as in the illustrations concerning the cups, the lower half of the picture the many cups is wrong, while the upper half of the picture hands stretched out in fellowship is right.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I think it is clear enough that the Bible says denominations are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Galatians 5:19-21 even lists denominations sects as a work of the flesh: "And the works of the flesh are manifest, which are such things as..factions, divisions, sects..."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How does God want us to manifest the unity of the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The unity of the Body is not the unity of the whole earth, like the uniting of many churches into one united church; neither is it staying in the denominations and talking about a "spiritual" unity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is the unity of the Body as spoken of in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I would like to spend some time to study this matter with you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Church Spoken of in Ephesians</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>and Colossians Being Universal</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Both in Space and in Time</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Two Epistles in the Bible especially speak about the church: Ephesians and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everyone who studies the Bible knows that the church spoken of in Ephesians and Colossians is the "one church," which is the unique church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This church not only refers to the church on the earth, because even though the church on the earth is broad enough to include everyone according to space, it can only include a section of the church according to time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose five hundred million people are saved on the earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church in the books of Ephesians and Colossians includes more than these five hundred million people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These five hundred million are only the believers in 1951.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before this, in 1950, there were believers who had died.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even in 1951, some believers died before the counting took place.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There were also believers who died before 1950, say in 1051.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The brothers and sisters in the apostle Paul's time no longer live on this earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In other words, the church of Christ in Ephesians and Colossians includes all the saved ones throughout the whole world, in every nation and at all times, both past and present.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It covers time as well as space.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is called the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today, even if all the Christians throughout the whole world are united together, they would still not be the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although we are living, many have already died; although we are living, many more will be born.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many brothers and sisters will be saved tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are in the Body of Christ; we cannot say that they should not be counted.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, the church in any particular period of time on the earth is not the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even if all the children of God who are on this earth were gathered together, they would not be sufficient to become the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Spacewise it would be sufficient, but timewise it would be wrong to say that it is the Body, because many generations have passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the believers of past generations, all the believers of the present, and all the believers of the future are the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ephesians and Colossians speak of the church in this context.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This unity is the right spiritual unity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is impossible to maintain a church with Paul as an elder and Peter as a pastor, because they have passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, this unity is spiritual, and this all-encompassing unity is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As long as a person is a brother in the Lord, we have fellowship with him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even though some brothers have passed away, we are still one with them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are one with any brother or sister.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the genuine spiritual unity, which is universal both in time and space.</S>
