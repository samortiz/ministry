<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE SPIRIT OF THE GOSPEL<br />AND THE GOSPEL OF THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:Evening, March 2, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong<br />Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</h1><p>Witness Lee: Individually or as the church, something is wrong when there is no fruit from our gospel preaching. Church history throughout the past two thousand years shows that as soon as an individual or a church touches God's grace, many people are saved. The church in Hong Kong must preach the gospel. Today we will speak about preaching the gospel. Concerning the preaching of the gospel we have to pay attention to two things. First, the church must have the spirit of the gospel. Second, the whole church must be active in preaching.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT OF THE GOSPEL</h2><h2 class="head2">The Power of the Gospel<br />Issuing from the Spirit of the Gospel</h2><p>If our preaching merely stirs up men's emotions or turns men to outward activities, this gospel will never be powerful. In order to preach the gospel we must have the spirit of the gospel. This is the only thing that will bring in the genuine power of the gospel. About three years ago I spoke on this subject at a university in Shanghai. I said that if a young person would open his spirit to the Lord, he would surely receive the spirit of the gospel from God. Today the church must preach the gospel. The church must love sinners' souls. This is especially true of the young students. If the Lord gives you a burden in your spirit, when you see your classmates playing in the field, you should kneel down and pray for them. If you do not preach the gospel, you will not feel happy. Individually or as the church of God, we must be filled with the spirit of the gospel. If both the individuals and the church are filled with this gospel spirit, sinners will be saved continually.</p><p>D. L. Moody led over one million people to the Lord on both sides of the Atlantic during his lifetime. He was a shoemaker, but because he had a love for sinners' souls, he forsook everything for the Lord's gospel. He was very burdened for man's soul. Once he invited a young girl to his Sunday school meeting. The girl promised to come but did not show up. A few days later, Moody met her on the street and ran after her. The girl ran into a hotel, closed the doors to one of the rooms, and hid under a bed. But Mr. Moody did not give up. He followed her into the hotel and dragged her out from under the bed. The girl could not do anything except go to the meeting with him. After Moody died, a co-worker, R. A. Torrey, was on a train. A lady asked him, "Do you know who I am?" He answered, "No." She said, "I am the daughter of the little girl who was pulled from under the bed to attend the Sunday school."</p><p>Another time, Mr. Moody went out in the rain with an umbrella that did not have a top. Many curious ones came around him. As the crowd gathered, he began to tell them that God's judgment would come, and nothing that they had would hide them from this judgment. They would all be like a topless umbrella; nothing would keep out the rain. Many people were saved through such a word.</p><p>Many people criticize those who are zealous for the gospel. They say that zealous ones are mentally unstable. These ones who criticize are afraid that they will also become "mentally unstable" if they become zealous for the gospel. Actually, those who are zealous for the gospel are not mentally unstable. They are pressed by a gospel spirit, and they feel uncomfortable and painful if they do not preach the gospel. When I was saved, I did not have any peace until I preached the gospel to others. Every holiday I would write some gospel tracts and go to the villages to preach the gospel from house to house. At other times, I would preach the gospel to whomever I met.</p>
