<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRAYING TO BLEND IN SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 6:18; Jude 20; Zech. 12:10; 1 Tim. 2:8</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning how the serving ones can blend in spirit with one another and how they can lead the brothers and sisters to fellowship and blend in spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING THE SPIRIT THROUGH PRAYER</h2>
<p>We must realize that prayer is the means by which we exercise our spirit. This can be likened to walking in order to exercise our legs or to looking at objects in order to exercise our eyes. If a person&rsquo;s eyes are covered and not used for a long time, his eyes will eventually lose their function. Every organ in our body needs some form of basic exercise in order to function. The more exercise that an organ receives, the more skillful it will be in its function. If it is not exercised, it will lose its function. The function of our spirit is not an exception to this principle. Our spirit needs to be exercised through prayer. The human spirit was created so that man could contact God; this contact mainly involves prayer. Hence, if we want to exercise our spirit, we must pray. If we desire to release our spirit so that our spirit can be uplifted and come forth to fellowship and blend with others&rsquo; spirits, we must not neglect the basic exercise of prayer.</p>
<p>If we do not pray for several days or a week, our prayers will become very feeble and formal because our spirit will not be strong, fresh, uplifted, or keen. If we want to pay attention to fellowshipping in spirit, releasing the spirit, and blending in the spirit, we must learn the basic lesson of praying consistently. If we do not have an adequate practice of prayer, we should not expect that our spirit would be released or able to blend and fellowship with the spirits of the saints.</p>
<p>During the ten days prior to Pentecost, the apostles prayed continually every day. As they prayed, their spirits became strong and living, and their spirits were released and manifested. Eventually, their spirits were blended and mingled together. This situation can be likened to pouring water from several bottles into one vessel. When the water is poured out, spontaneously the water is mingled and blended together. The Bible says that we have a treasure in our earthen vessel. This treasure is God as the Spirit (2 Cor. 4:7; John 4:24). Since we have the living water of the Holy Spirit in us (7:38-39), we need to focus on letting this living water flow out from within us. The best and most proper way to let the water flow is to pray.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RELEASING THE SPIRIT THROUGH PRAYER</h2>
<p>When we speak of prayer, our attention should be focused on the release of our spirit as much as on the matters that are the subject of our prayer. The prayers of a Christian typically involve two functions. Prayer often includes petitioning; that is, prayer involves asking God for something. For example, when we encounter a certain problem, we ask God to remember us in the midst of this problem. Similarly, if we have a certain need, we petition God to meet this need, whether the need relates to our work or our finances. Even prayers for the church, the gospel, the Lord&rsquo;s work, the co-workers, the elders, or the serving ones involve the matter of petitioning. There is, however, a more fundamental aspect of prayer&mdash;the exercise of the spirit. Prayers of petition can be likened to walking to a destination by exercising our legs. On the one hand, we will reach our destination by exercising our legs, but on the other hand, our exercise will train our legs to become stronger and more agile. Prayer must involve not only petitioning but also exercising and releasing our spirit.</p>
<p>Regrettably, many believers do not exercise their spirit when they pray, and thus, their spirit lacks the proper exercise that is needed in order for it to be released. Their prayers mainly reflect their thoughts and considerations. As such, their prayers are related mainly to the soul. They pray about matters that other people have entrusted them with, about matters that they remember, or about items listed in a prayer book. We cannot say that these kinds of prayer are not acceptable to God, because our God is too great. Sometimes He even listens to and takes care of the Gentiles. He is a God who cares for people. However, prayer related to our thoughts and memories do not result in our spirit being exercised. In other words, normal prayer involves the exercise of our spirit, whereas the prayer that involves only our mind does not touch our human spirit. This can be likened to a person who moves by pulling himself forward with his arms rather than walking with his legs. Although he may reach his destination in this way, his legs will not be properly exercised, and if he continues to use only his arms, his legs will gradually lose their ability to walk. The prayer of many saints mirrors this example. We cannot say that the Lord does not hear their prayer, because the Lord does, but their spirit is not exercised in their prayer. This kind of prayer only takes care of the function of petitioning, and even though some of their petitions are answered, their spirit has not been exercised.</p>
<p>The main result of prayer should be the exercise of the spirit; praying for and obtaining things should be supplementary. Every time we pray, our spirit should be exercised. Hence, whenever we go before God, we should not rely on the thoughts in our mind or on matters that have been entrusted to us. We should rely on our spirit. We must turn to the depths of our being to touch the feeling in our spirit. Then our utterances will be according to this deep feeling. If we have a sense related to some sins, we should confess our sins; if we have a sense of joy, we should praise; and if we have a sense of sorrow, we should be willing to be sorrowful. We should always touch the feeling in the deepest part of our being and pray according to this feeling.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we cannot pray for our affairs or for the requests that we have received from others. However, these items should not be the initial focus of our prayers. Instead, we should touch God in our spirit. After we utter some words according to the feeling in our spirit, our spirit will be uplifted, and we will enter into the Spirit of God and be able to bring these items to God in a spirit of fellowship. We can say, &ldquo;Lord, I need Your leading in regard to praying for my affairs and for the requests that I have received.&rdquo; After coming to the Lord in such a spirit of fellowship, we will have a further sense within as to the content of our prayer. If there is an inner sense to pray for these things, we should pray for them, but if there is no feeling within, there is no need to pray for them. In short, we must pray according to the feeling in our spirit. If we pray in this way for five minutes, our spirit will be exercised for five minutes. If we pray for ten minutes, our spirit will be exercised for ten minutes. If we pray in this way every day for a week, our spirit will be fresh, uplifted, skilled, living, and released. Hence, in order for our spirit to be released and to blend with the spirits of the other saints, we must practice to pray in the spirit.</p>
<p>Every genuine spiritual transaction with God comes out of prayer involving the exercise of the spirit. When we exercise our spirit to pray, God is able to shine upon us, examine us, deal with us, rebuke us, break us, and come to us with a particular grace. Although it is possible to receive answers to prayers related to our affairs, this does not mean that we have received the shining and dealing that we need in order to grow. If we do not learn to touch God with our spirit in prayer, we will have little experience of touching God in a genuine way. Consequently, God will only be able to supply us with outward things, according to His mercy, but He will not be able to work on our person inwardly so that we can grow.</p>
<p>As a person receives more of God&rsquo;s grace and learns to fellowship with God through prayer in spirit, he will touch God more in spirit and will also let God touch him as he prays. He will be enlightened by God&rsquo;s light, and he will experience the condition of fellowship described in 1 John 1:7. As he fellowships with God according to the life of God within him, God, as light, will enlighten him about his condition. This enlightening will do a work of sanctifying, dealing, and stripping, and God will be able to make demands and lead him in certain ways. This kind of prayer is precious; it is much more valuable than just asking for things. This kind of prayer will cause us to touch God, taste God, and fully receive God&rsquo;s element, and this kind of prayer will cause our spirit to be strong, living, fresh, and released.</p>
