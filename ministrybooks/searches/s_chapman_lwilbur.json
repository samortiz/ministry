It was written by an American brother. At that time the liberal theology was flourishing, which says that the Bible is not the word of God, that miracles are not real, and that the resurrection of Jesus was merely a resurrection of His ideas.

Wilbur Chapman. In Chapman\u2019s days the prevailing theology was the theology taught by the modernists. The modernists say that the Lord Jesus was not God, that His death had not been for redemption, and that He had not been resurrected. Therefore, Chapman purposely wrote this hymn of five stanzas. The first stanza is on the birth of the Lord Jesus, the second stanza is on His death, the third stanza is on His burial, the fourth stanza is on His resurrection, and the fifth stanza is on His coming back. This hymn not only has a dignified tune, but its chorus is also particularly well written, pointing out the subject matter of all five stanzas. The chorus says, \u201cLiving, He loved me; dying, He saved me; / Buried, He carried my sins far [9] away; / Rising, He justified freely forever: / One day He\u2019s coming\u2014O glorious day!\u201d The content of this hymn is proper and rich, and the tune is dignified.
