   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Way Genesis 2:7</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we proceed to consider the way in which God created man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God created man exactly like a bottle with a neck and a mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Praise the Lord that I have a mouth!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How could I live without one?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God made me this way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1 To Form Man's Body</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>with the Dust of the Ground</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God formed man's body with the dust of the ground that man may have a body as his outward expression and as an organ to contact material things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God made man with dust, not with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Gold cannot produce life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you sow seed into gold, you will waste the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Dust, however, can grow life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you sow seed into the dust, the seed will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are not a man of gold, but a man of dust.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am happy to be a man of dust.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am an earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our body was formed out of dust to be our outward expression.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I have the time, I like to look at myself in the mirror, especially examining my face.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more I look at myself, the more I am convinced that I was made by God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No other person in the whole universe can fashion such a wonderful creature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The style of American cars may be improved and changed every year, but no one can improve the design of a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our ears have been perfectly designed for listening.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How awkward it would be if the members of our body were relocated!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What would happen if our nose were placed upon our forehead and turned upward?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The rain and the dust would come in. God purposely designed the nose to be turned downward that only air may enter in. Although my nose is not very attractive, I am still fond of it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God designed it for me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are many things to consider about the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Ecclesiastes 12:3 Solomon mentions the grinders, saying that when a man is old the grinders will cease because they are few.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The grinding here refers to the grinding activity of our molars.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The front teeth, the incisors, are the cutting teeth and the molars are the grinding teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we eat a piece of meat, our front teeth cut it, and the tongue sends it to the molars where it is ground into a digestible substance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to Ecclesiastes, the grinders cease because an older person usually has fewer teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Who designed us this way?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Who designed our incisors, our molars, and the saliva that is secreted to liquefy the food?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Surely God did this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Man was created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was designed by the best artist.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not pay attention to the theory of evolution.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even medical science can confirm that the human body contains all the elements found in dust such as salt, sulfur, copper, and iron.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God formed a wonderful human body out of this dust.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have no words to describe it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Look at yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Look at your shoulders, arms, and the five fingers on each hand.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>With the four fingers and a thumb man can do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What could we do if we had five thumbs on each hand?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We could not even pick up our eating utensils.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you examine your human body, you will find that it is a living bottle.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We were truly made by God.</S>
