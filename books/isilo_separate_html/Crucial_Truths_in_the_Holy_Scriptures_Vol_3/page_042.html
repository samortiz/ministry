<p><strong>1. &ldquo;To the married...a wife must not be separated from her husband (but if indeed she is separated, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband), and a husband must not leave his wife...But if the unbelieving one separates, let him separate&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 7:10-11, 15).</p>
<p>Those who are married may not be separated. Furthermore, a believing spouse may not be separated from an unbelieving spouse. If they are separated, they should be reconciled if possible. However, if an unbelieving spouse separates, the believing spouse should let the unbelieving spouse separate. There should be no legal action, because God desires reconciliation.</p>
<p>Those who are no longer married because of separation should not marry again. If believers remarry when adultery is not involved (see points 2 and 3 below in the section &ldquo;Concerning Divorce&rdquo;), the oneness of a marriage between one man and one woman is destroyed, and they become adulterers.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Have you been bound to a wife? Do not seek a release&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 7:27).</p>
<p>A brother who is bound to a wife should not and may not seek a release. This is not the Lord&rsquo;s will. The Lord wants him to learn some lessons through his wife.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;A wife is bound for so long a time as her husband lives&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 7:39).</p>
<p>While her husband is alive, a sister is bound and cannot remarry; otherwise, she will destroy the oneness between a husband and wife, and she will be committing adultery.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Remarriage</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Should the husband fall asleep, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only to one in the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 7:39).</p>
<p>If a sister&rsquo;s husband dies, the bond of oneness between husband and wife is broken. Then she is free to remarry as long as she keeps one condition: She must marry a brother in the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Widows, It is good for them if they remain even as I am. But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn with desire&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 7:8-9).</p>
<p>When the apostle Paul spoke this word, he must have been single. (We do not know if he ever married.) At this time he thought it best if widows do not remarry but remain single as he was in order to concentrate on serving the Lord. If they could not, they could remarry. It is better to remarry than to force oneself to remain single.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;I will therefore that younger widows marry, bear children, keep house&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 5:14, see also vv. 9-13, 15).</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 7 Paul clearly says that at that time he wanted widows to be as he was and remain single. He did not have a command from the Lord, but this was his hope and opinion. First Corinthians was written early in his ministry. When he wrote 1 Timothy in his later years, his manner of speaking about this matter changed. He must have observed that it was difficult for young widows, who could be easily tempted by Satan, to remain single. Therefore, at that time he wanted younger widows to marry, bear children, and keep house to give no opportunity for Satan to tempt them. Furthermore, he also commanded that widows be sixty years old before the church enrolled them for assistance. Younger widows were to be refused because the church could not know whether she would remain single as a widow in need of assistance.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Divorce</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;They are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has yoked together, let man not separate&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 19:6).</p>
<p>When a husband and wife are married, they become one flesh and are no longer two. We must pay particular attention to the Lord&rsquo;s word <em>no longer two.</em> This corresponds to a man and a woman being joined together to be a complete person. Since two are joined as one, they should not be separated. According to the Lord&rsquo;s word, this yoking is God&rsquo;s work; it is of God. Therefore, man may not separate them. People today have no problem with divorce, but the Lord says, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Marriage is God&rsquo;s yoking, but divorce is man&rsquo;s action. God only agrees with marriage; He never agrees with divorce.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Whoever divorces his wife, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 19:9).</p>
<p>Marriage is one; if it becomes two through divorce, there is confusion. Therefore, unless a man&rsquo;s wife commits adultery, he may not divorce her and marry another. If he divorces his wife and marries another for any matter other than adultery, he breaks the oneness of marriage and commits adultery.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Everyone who divorces his wife, except for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries her who has been divorced commits adultery&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 5:32).</p>
<p>If a wife commits adultery, she is an adulteress. If she does not commit adultery but her husband divorces her, forcing her to marry another, he causes her to commit adultery since she may not marry again while he is living. If she marries again, she breaks the oneness of marriage, commits adultery, and becomes an adulteress. Whoever marries her also breaks the oneness of marriage and therefore commits adultery. This is something that must not be done. In conclusion, as long as a husband or wife are living, neither party can remarry unless adultery is involved. If they do, they break the oneness of marriage and commit adultery. This breaks God&rsquo;s ordination and destroys what God has yoked. God does not approve of this.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_041.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_043.html">Next</a> </body></html>
