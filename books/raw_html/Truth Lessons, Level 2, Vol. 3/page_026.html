The Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>In order that He may be our portion for our experience and enjoyment, Christ is also the life-giving Spirit. First Corinthians 15:45 says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit." The last Adam was the Lord Jesus in the flesh. On the cross, as the Lamb of God, He took away our sin. This made it possible for us to receive His divine life. Then He was raised from the dead and became the life-giving Spirit to impart life into us. When we believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him as our Redeemer, He as the life-giving Spirit came into us as our life.</P><P>The life-giving Spirit is the reality and the life pulse of Christ's resurrection. If Christ had merely been resurrected with a body and had not become the life-giving Spirit, His resurrection would simply be a fact and could not impart life into us. However, Christ's resurrection is absolutely a matter related to the life-giving Spirit, for in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit, who imparts life into the believers. Actually, the life-giving Spirit is the processed Triune God. The Triune God has passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. Now in resurrection He is the life-giving Spirit with the life essence to enter into all those who believe and receive Him to make them the new creation. This life-giving Spirit is the totality of all that Christ is as the all-inclusive One. Christ as the all-inclusive One has now become the life-giving Spirit, the totality of all that He is for our experience and enjoyment.</P>
