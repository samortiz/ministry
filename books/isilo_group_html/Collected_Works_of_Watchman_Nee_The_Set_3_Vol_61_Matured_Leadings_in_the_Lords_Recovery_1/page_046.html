Our gospel is not an isolated call of individual voices but a concerted work in which we all consecrate ourselves to coordinate and pray together in one accord. If we do this, all the problems will go away. Otherwise, the first question that comes to mind will be, "What will be my remuneration?" In the future, I hope that we will ask instead, "How will this job give me an opportunity for the gospel?" I hope that we will all consecrate ourselves for the gospel. In this matter we cannot be sloppy. The whole church has to come solemnly and seriously to God and ask for His mercy. We confess that in the past we have not paid enough attention to the lost souls. If we are so exercised in planning and managing worldly affairs, how can we be so sloppy in preaching the gospel? This is wrong. In the past too many people have cared only for enjoying the benefit of the gospel. In the coming days I hope that many will want to share this benefit with others.</p><p>In the last century only missionaries were involved in the gospel preaching in China. During the last fifty years, we saw the need and effectiveness of the church preaching the gospel. No matter how much we tried, however, only a minority of the saints were involved; the rest did not do anything. Today we need everyone to give up everything. We all need to separate ourselves for the gospel. If we do this, we will see the whole church rising up to preach the gospel. There will not be just three or five individual preachers; the whole church will be preaching. The gospel will spread throughout China. No sacrifice is in vain as long as we can gain men's souls. The entire world cannot match the value of one human soul (Matt. 16:26).</p><p>In the future the selection of all our occupations has to revolve around the gospel and the church. As long as something is good for the gospel, it is worth paying any price for. Miss Hann was a nurse supervisor, but she decided to move to Yi-Yang. Brother Liu is an internist, but he also moved to Yi-Yang. Humanly speaking, Yi-Yang is a wasteland for good nurses and doctors. But it is not a waste at all. Our going is different. A good nurse and a good doctor care for the gospel and for souls. What good does it do if you heal a person's body but allow his soul to go the way of destruction?</p><p>We are not asking you to hand over your possessions as the first thing. We are asking you to first hand over your future, your job, and your work. When you hand yourselves over, you are not handing yourselves over to me; I cannot bear that responsibility. You are handing yourselves over for the gospel. Perhaps ten or twenty years from now, the responsible brothers will tell you to leave Hong Kong to go to another place for the gospel. You have to say, "Amen. Since the whole church has this feeling, I am willing to go. If other children of God call me to go to another place, I am willing to go there as well." The church must live before God and know His will. It has to pray about many things and wait on God. The church cannot be sloppy; it has to trust in God. You should give yourself to Hong Kong first, and then you can give yourself to other places. One day you will be able to send men to the mainland. The entire Southeast Asia lies before you. God has a free way in Shanghai already. He will also have a free way in Hong Kong. Hangchow handed itself over, and Yi-Yang was brought forth. If Hong Kong hands itself over, I do not know what will be brought forth in Southeast Asia.</p><p>Presently, the immediate need is for a big meeting hall. We should not think that as long as we can meet in two sessions on the Lord's Day, we have solved all the problems. God's blessing is related to our capacity. If we have a meeting hall that will hold a thousand people, we have to believe that God will send us the people; they will fill up the hall. Perhaps after you gain this first meeting hall, five other or nine other halls will follow. Once we hand ourselves over, we will see God's great blessings. Perhaps we still do not realize how great a hindrance we are to the Lord!</p><p>When God's grace and mercy break out, blessings will flow everywhere in the church, and all the problems will go away. In order for the whole church to rise up to serve, we have to cut off the wasted hours in our occupation. If we hold back anything, the church's prayer will not be effective, and souls will not be added to us. If we are desperate, God will have a way. Do not be afraid of problems. Whatever the price may be, we have to charge forward.</p><p>Please forgive me for saying what I am saying. I hope this word will not hurt anyone's feelings. You have to come together to pray much. May the Lord give all of us no peace. May He not let us go easily. May the Lord be merciful to us. May none of us go on carelessly. May all of us be very clear about what we are doing; that is, may we know the reason we are doing what we are doing and to what extent we should do it. May God encourage us to give all that we are and all that we have to the gospel.</p><p>I believe one day the church will reach the standard of the first apostles. Then the day of the Lord will be near.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 61: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (1) &nbsp; pg 46</div><br></body></html>
