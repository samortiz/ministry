   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. In His Repeated Victories over the Philistines</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Finally, David's being established by God was seen in his repeated victories over the Philistines vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>17-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When David inquired of Jehovah, asking whether he should go up against the Philistines, Jehovah said to him, "Go up, for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into your hand" v. 19 . David struck the Philistines and said, "Jehovah has broken forth upon my enemies before me like the breaking forth of a flood" v. 20b . David continued to do as Jehovah had commanded him and struck down the Philistines from Geba to Gezer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Israel's two most troubling enemies were the Amalekites and the Philistines.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even before Israel entered into the good land, they were frustrated by the Amalekites.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Exodus 17 the children of Israel fought a war against the Amalekites in a particular way under two leaders Moses and Joshua.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In typology these two leaders signify Christ in two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The people of Israel fought against the Amalekites under Joshua, signifying the Spirit within us, and under Moses, signifying the Christ who is in the heavens praying for us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The pneumatic Christ as the life-giving Spirit, as the reality of Christ in resurrection, is living and working within us, and the ascended Christ is interceding for us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Amalekites signify our flesh, our most bothersome enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should never think that we can overcome the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, by Christ as the Spirit within and as our Intercessor in the heavens, this enemy can be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Israel's other enemy was the Philistines, who were very close neighbors of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At times they became somewhat mixed up with Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, David, the one who killed Goliath and defeated the Philistines, became friends with Achish, a king of the Philistines.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In typology, the Philistines signify the worldly Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Philistines were very close to God's people, yet they were worldly and handled the things of God in a worldly way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Consider how they sent back the ark of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to God's ordination, the ark should not have been moved by any means other than by living priests, but the Philistines caused it to be carried on a cart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The ark, which represents God Himself, should never have been carried in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To use a cart and two cows in order to send the ark back to Israel was the worldly way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Philistines knew something about the divine things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They offered a trespass offering to appease God's anger, but they did this in a worldly way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today, we are troubled mainly by these two things: the flesh within and the worldly Christianity in our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everything concerning David was arranged under God's sovereign direction to accomplish one thing: the building up of His kingdom in His elect through the proper person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At that time the proper person was David, but today it should be the people in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In every age God has a particular thing to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this age, the twentieth century, the particular thing that God intends to accomplish is to recover everything that has been lost and is missing in today's worldly Christianity.</S>
