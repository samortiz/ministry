   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LINE OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The third line in 1 Corinthians is the line of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here we are referring to the human spirit and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapter five Paul told the Corinthians that when they came together, he would meet with them, not in his body but in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He said, "When you and my spirit have been assembled..." v. 4 . In this assembly he judged a sinful person in the name of the Lord, in the spirit, and in power by delivering such a one to Satan v. 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul was a man who behaved in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In chapter four Paul asked them whether he should come to them with a rod or in love and in a spirit of meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When he came to them the first time, he came in demonstration of the Spirit by the exercise of his spirit 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Chapter seven also shows that he was a man in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this chapter he was one with the Lord to such a degree that even when he gave his own opinion, he had the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To be a spiritual man does not mean that you have the Holy Spirit descending on you in a miraculous way to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Balaam's donkey miraculously spoke in tongues, that is, in a human tongue, but his donkey was not spiritual Num 22:28-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul, however, was genuinely spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He said in chapter seven that he did not have the Lord's commandment, but as one who had obtained the Lord's mercy, he gave his opinion v. 25 . His opinion became a part of the divine revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the end of chapter seven he said, "I think that I also have the Spirit of God" v. 40 . It seems that he was not so sure that he was in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows that to be a spiritual person is to be very human.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many Christians think that to be spiritual one must be angelic, but that is not a spiritual man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A spiritual man is very human in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word spiritual is used a number of times in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul said in chapter two that the spiritual man discerns all things v. 15 . In chapter three he said that he could not speak to the Corinthians as to spiritual men v. 1 . In chapter nine he said that he sowed spiritual things v. 11 . In chapter ten he spoke of the spiritual food, spiritual drink, and spiritual rock vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then in chapter fourteen he spoke of those who think they are spiritual v. 37 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to be spiritual, we always have to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We always have to walk, behave, and have our being in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are going to be humble, we must be humble in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, if you live and walk in the spirit, you will be humble without any consciousness of your humility.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You will have the reality of being humble without having the consciousness of it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are also told in the Bible to love one another, but our love may be a soulish love, a natural love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Such love is not the spiritual, divine love which is God Himself embodied in Christ to dwell in our spirit and to be expressed through our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must love one another in the spirit.</S>
