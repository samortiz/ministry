   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Exercising Self-control in All Things</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 25 Paul said, "And everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; they then, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul exercised self-control in all things for the gospel's sake in order to run the Christian race.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was not loose.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This shows us that he endeavored like an Olympic athlete.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you are disciplined, coached to contend, you must learn how to exercise self-control in everything in drinking, in eating, in dressing, in combing your hair, in putting on your tie, and even in your laughing or weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I saw some brothers laughing uncontrollably and some sisters weeping without ceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to learn to exercise self-control in our laughing and weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For sixty-eight years I have been under God's training and my own self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is what makes it possible for me to open up the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 2 Timothy 2:15, Paul told Timothy that he had to learn to cut the word straight like in carpentry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can expound the word of God in a proper way, in a straight way, by having ourselves exercised to do everything accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I was in Shanghai in 1947, a few of us co-workers were fellowshipping one day about our work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One sister who was a deaconess came to us in an excited way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She said, "Brother Lee, upstairs in the ceiling there is a big hole."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As she was speaking, she gestured with her hands to show me how big the hole was.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I asked her, "How big?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She said, "This big!"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The gesture with her hands was slightly smaller than before.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I asked her again, "How big?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She said, "Like this."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I asked again, "How big?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She said, "About this big."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Each time I asked, the hole she described became smaller and smaller.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, we found out that the hole in the ceiling was actually very small.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we apply this principle to ourselves, we will realize how inaccurate we are.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I was able to compose those thirty items of the character training by my learning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to be trained not merely with Bible knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We want to be trained to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The things of life grow according to regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All kinds of fruit are shaped according to the regulation of the life within them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The shaping takes place by the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Life regulates.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to be trained to grow in the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we will be regulated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because of the fall, our humanity is unregulated, so there is still the need of some outward training, which we call character training.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should be genuine, exact, and strict not only in the church meetings and church service but also in our daily life and in our private life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Where do we put our shoes after we take them off?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This shows what kind of character we have.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Everything related to how we dress and comb our hair should be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should be clean and neat, and our room with our furniture should also be clean and neat.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should polish our shoes and dust our furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul said that we Christians are like those who run on a racecourse.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To run is to exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even if we use a broom to sweep a certain area, we should not do it loosely and lazily.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should sweep in a strict and diligent way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we do not take care of things in such a way, this shows our looseness and laziness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we go to contact people, we should not go loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must run the racecourse.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should contact them in the right atmosphere and with the right gestures.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our whole being should be exercised to be proper and appropriate in our contact with others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If a young brother is speaking to a man who is about sixty, the way he sits and talks to this man should be in a very respectful manner.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He should not sit before this man in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have to run the racecourse by exercising self-control in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This renders the effectiveness to our preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whether our conversation with a gospel candidate can be effective or not depends upon how we behave ourselves, even how we seat ourselves and what our gestures are.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must take this fellowship as a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Buffeting Our Body and Making It Our Slave</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Paul said, "I therefore run in this way, not as though without a clear aim; I box in this way, not as though beating the air; but I buffet my body and make it my slave, lest perhaps having preached to others, I myself may become disapproved" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Because Paul made his body his slave, he could be enslaved to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He buffeted his body to subdue it, to enslave it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sometimes we excuse ourselves from serving the Lord by saying that we are tired.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But we have to buffet our body and make it our slave to contact people for the Lord's interests.</S>
