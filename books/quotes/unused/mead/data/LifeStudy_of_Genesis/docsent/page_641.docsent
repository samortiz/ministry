   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>10 Enthroned with Authority</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Joseph also typified Christ as the One enthroned with authority 41:40-44; Matt 28:18; Acts 2:36; Rev 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the same day Joseph was released from the dungeon, he was enthroned to be the actual ruler over the whole land of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In like manner, after Christ was resurrected, He was enthroned with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Acts 2:36 says that the crucified and resurrected Christ has been made both Lord and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the day of Pentecost, the Apostle Peter seemed to be saying to the Israelites who had rejected the Lord, "The One you rejected, put on the cross, and killed, God has raised up from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not only so, God has made Him the Lord of all."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This refers to Christ's enthronement.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What a great matter this is!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>11 Receiving Glory</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When Christ was enthroned, He received glory Heb 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Joseph also typifies Christ in this regard, for when he was released from the dungeon, he received glory 41:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Joseph's opposers not only sold him and despised him, but cast him into a dungeon.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In chapter forty-one the prison is called a dungeon.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The living conditions in Joseph's dungeon were far worse than the conditions of the prisons in this country today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The dungeon into which Joseph was cast was a pit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who put him there did so with the intention that he would be severely distressed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But God lifted him up and not only placed him on the throne, but also gave him glory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may be wondering how we can prove that Joseph received glory.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The proof is in the fact that he was clothed with beautiful garments and made to ride in the second chariot of Pharaoh 41:42-43 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His being clothed with fine linen was in contrast with his being stripped by his brothers of his coat of many colors 37:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When people saw him clothed with such beautiful garments and sitting in Pharaoh's chariot, they must have realized that here was a man in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>12 Receiving Gifts</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Joseph was released from the dungeon and uplifted to the throne, he received gifts 41:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ also has received gifts Acts 2:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many Christians know that Christ resurrected, ascended, and has been crowned with honor and glory, but not many know that after Christ's ascension, enthronement, and glorification He also received gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Acts 2:33 says that Christ received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, which He has poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What Christ received of the Father was a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In ancient times, many centuries before Christ, the same thing happened to Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Joseph was not only glorified, but also received gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In his glorification Joseph was given three things: a golden ring, some garments, and a golden chain.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The ring was put on his hand, the chain was placed on his neck, and the garments covered his entire body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These three items portray in a full way the gifts that Christ received in His ascension to the heavens, the gifts that He has passed on to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the prodigal son came home, he received the first two gifts, the ring on his hand and the robe on his body Luke 15:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that time he did not receive the golden chain, which was to be given later.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ephesians 1:13 says that we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This indicates that the Spirit of salvation is likened to a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We know that we are saved because we have been sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Fifty years ago I bought a gold-edged, leatherbound edition of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As soon as I got it, I put my seal in the front of it to indicate that it belonged to me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I was afraid that otherwise it might be lost and I would have no way to prove that it was mine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After my Bible was sealed, however, I could prove that it belonged to me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Likewise, before we were saved, we were among the common people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But on the day we received the Lord Jesus, we were sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The seal of our salvation is the Holy Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From that time onward, we have had a seal upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Suppose my Bible could say, "I don't like Witness Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I would like to belong to someone else."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But my seal in the Bible would keep it from belonging to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In like manner, we may feel that we do not want to belong to the Lord and that we would like to go along with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nevertheless, one who has been saved and sealed can never get away from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even if it were possible for you to go into hell, you would still bear this seal.</S>
