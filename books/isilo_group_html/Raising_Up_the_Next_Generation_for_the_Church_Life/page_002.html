<h1 class="title">VESSELS UNTO HONOR<br />
FOR GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL ECONOMY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:8-11; Gen. 2:7; Psa. 8:3-4; Ezek. 1:5; Rom. 9:21, 23; 2 Cor. 4:6-7; 2 Kings 4:1-6</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>We need a vision of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;the desire of God&rsquo;s heart to dispense Himself into His chosen people in His trinity for the producing of the church, which is the kingdom of God that will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal expression of the Triune God&mdash;Luke 10:42; John 3:5-6, 14-16; Eph. 2:1-10; 3:8-11.</li>
<li>The entire economy of God, and especially that in the New Testament age, is a matter of dispensing; God&rsquo;s creation of man is in the view of the divine dispensing according to the divine economy&mdash;Gen. 1:26-27; 2:7; Eph. 1:9-10; 3:8-11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is a plan made by God according to His good pleasure; God&rsquo;s good pleasure, His longing, His aspiration, is to dispense Himself into His chosen people&mdash;1:9-10.</li>
	<li>Romans 9:21 discloses God&rsquo;s purpose in creating man; we need to be deeply impressed with the fact that we are God&rsquo;s containers and that He is our content&mdash;Gen. 2:7; Acts 9:15.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s selection in His sovereign mercy has a goal, and this goal is to have many vessels to contain God and express Him eternally&mdash;v. 15; 2 Tim. 2:20-21:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>He created us in such a way that we are able to take Him into us and contain Him as our life and life supply&mdash;Gen. 2:7, 9.</li>
		<li>He created us so that we may be one with Him to express what He is and that He may be glorified in us and with us&mdash;John 13:31; 2 Thes. 1:12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>It is not a small matter to be a man; we need to see how glorious and how marvelous it is that we are men&mdash;Psa. 8:3-4; Ezek. 1:5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>It is absolutely right to say that the Bible is a book full of Christ, yet we can also say that the Bible is a book full of men&mdash;even God Himself became a man&mdash;John 1:1, 14; Acts 7:56.</li>
		<li>Man is the center of God&rsquo;s plan: if the hub, the center, of a bicycle wheel is taken away, the spokes will collapse; likewise, without man as the center, God&rsquo;s plan would collapse&mdash;Gen. 1:26-28, 31; Zech. 12:1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Does not the potter have authority over the clay to make out of the same lump one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor...in order that He might make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory&rdquo;&mdash;Rom. 9:21, 23; 2 Tim. 2:20-21; 2 Cor. 4:7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As vessels, we are not instruments or weapons&mdash;we are containers; the believers in Christ are vessels of mercy unto honor and glory&mdash;Rom. 9:11-13, 16, 20-21, 23; Judg. 9:9; 1 Sam. 2:30.</li>
	<li>Mercy, honor, and glory are actually the Triune God&mdash;Lam. 3:21-23; Heb. 2:9; Acts 7:2; Eph. 2:4; 1 Cor. 2:8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the initial stage of our experience the Triune God is our mercy&mdash;Eph. 2:4.</li>
		<li>In the progressing stage of our experience the Triune God is our honor&mdash;Heb. 2:9.</li>
		<li>In the completing stage of our experience the Triune God is our glory&mdash;Rom. 5:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Romans 9 reveals that the climax of our usefulness to God is that we are vessels to contain Him and express Him; we are His container and His expression, and He is our content and our life; He lives in us that we may live Him.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, useful to the master, prepared unto every good work&rdquo;&mdash;2 Tim. 2:21:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The believers are vessels unto honor with Christ as their treasure through regeneration; they are containers of honor because Christ Himself is honor; He is the treasure within them&mdash;2 Cor. 4:6-7.</li>
	<li>Honor is the preciousness related to Jesus&rsquo; worth&mdash;1 Pet. 2:7; Heb. 2:9.</li>
	<li>These four items together would make Timothy a vessel unto honor according to a certain standard&mdash;2 Tim. 2:21:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The word <em>honor</em> is related to our nature.</li>
		<li>The word <em>sanctified</em> indicates our position.</li>
		<li>The word <em>useful</em> implies the matter of our function.</li>
		<li>The word <em>prepared</em> reveals the matter of our training.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>A vessel unto honor has to meet a certain standard that it may contain a specific object of honor&mdash;1 Thes. 5:23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Honorable vessels are of both the divine nature (gold) and the redeemed and regenerated human nature (silver); these, like Timothy and other genuine believers, constitute the firm foundation to hold the truth&mdash;2 Tim. 2:19-20; 1 Tim. 3:15.</li>
		<li>Dishonorable vessels are of the fallen human nature (wood and earth); Hymenaeus, Philetus, and other false believers are of these&mdash;2 Tim. 2:17; Matt. 13:31-32.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To cleanse ourselves is to &ldquo;depart from unrighteousness,&rdquo; as an outward evidence of the inward divine nature&mdash;2 Tim. 2:19, 21.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>When God bestows grace on the church, He needs vessels; there is the need for more Timothys to be raised up&mdash;2 Kings 4:1-6; 2 Tim. 2:2; 3:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When a potter turns his wheel and molds his vessels, some become damaged before they even reach the fire; they do not even pass the formative stage; this is a loss&mdash;Jer. 18:1-6.</li>
	<li>It is true that we can save men from the world, but there is a greater need for raising up people from among Christian families&mdash;2 Tim. 3:15a.</li>
	<li>We have to expect the second generation, men like Timothy, to come from our own families&mdash;1:5.</li>
	</ol></li>
