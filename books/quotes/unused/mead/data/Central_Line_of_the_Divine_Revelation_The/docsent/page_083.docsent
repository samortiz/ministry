   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By Being Born according to the Spirit and</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Being Given the Spirit of God's Son into Our Hearts</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The third way in the book of Galatians to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is by being born according to the Spirit and by being given the Spirit of God's Son into our hearts Gal 4:29b, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Galatians 4:29 refers to being born according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This being born surely refers to our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our regeneration was according to the Spirit; that is, it was accomplished according to the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At one time you had never believed in the Lord Jesus because you had never heard about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, one day you did hear.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While the preacher was speaking, something was going on within you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit within you either showed you the preciousness of the Lord Jesus or convicted you of your sins or showed you how pitiful you were in your human life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a result, you regretted and repented.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even before anyone asked you to do anything, something within you spontaneously brought you to pray and to say, "O Lord, I want to believe; I want to take You.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You are too good."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You might also have said, "Lord, I am an evil person."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was your repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Your repenting just this much was sufficient for you to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Or you might have said, "Lord Jesus, You know my situation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Look at my situation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How pitiful I am!"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Just by saying this much, you were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is to be regenerated according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We were not regenerated merely by the Spirit; we were regenerated according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After the gospel meeting you might have gone back home, and your inward feeling continued.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, that was not your feeling; that was the moving of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This might have continued for a week.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the recollection of my experience, this moving of the Spirit within me lasted quite a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a result, I began to lose my taste for all the worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I began to think about my attitude toward my mother.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That was not just my thinking or my feeling by myself; that was the moving of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Perhaps after one week or after ten days, you thoroughly realized your regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is right to say that regeneration is instantaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, regeneration is also a process.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This process is the moving of the Spirit within us to regenerate us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, we were regenerated according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be regenerated by the Spirit is instantaneous, but to be regenerated according to the Spirit implies a process.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I do know of some who were regenerated not just in one week but in six months.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Spirit began to move in them a little, but they did not pay much attention to that.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, the Spirit continued to move within them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This process lasted for quite a time, until they fully realized that they were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Doctrinally speaking, regeneration is immediate and instantaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, although regeneration is instantaneous, with some persons the process is not quick but, rather, very slow.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It was according to the process of the Spirit's moving within us that we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, our regenerated being is absolutely spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Immediately after this regenerating birth, God sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts Gal 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We were born according to the life-giving Spirit, and immediately after our birth, God gave us the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is a double portion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We were born according to the life-giving Spirit, and God gave us a gift the Spirit of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This gift is also the life-giving Spirit, and this life-giving Spirit is the consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, we were born according to the consummated Triune God, and after our birth we received the gift of the consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This One is the threefold seed in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every aspect of our spiritual experience is nothing less than the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
