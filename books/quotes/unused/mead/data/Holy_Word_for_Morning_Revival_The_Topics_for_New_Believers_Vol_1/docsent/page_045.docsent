   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 7 DAY 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 Pet 2:5 You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>9 But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rev 1:6 And made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Service of the Priesthood</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Christian life there are always two aspects, the matter of life and the matter of service.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The proper Christian service is a matter of life, and it is in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such a spiritual service is presented as the priesthood in 1 Peter 2:5.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the spiritual reality, the priesthood is the building up of the priests, the coordination, the cooperation of all the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not one of the priests serves individually, but all serve in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>192</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is a great matter that we, who were once sinners, sons of disobedience, are now priests of God serving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As to our person, we are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As to our spiritual occupation, we are priests of God Rev 1:6; 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some of us may be teachers, doctors, or lawyers, but our real occupation is that of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since we are priests, we should be serving the Lord all day long in whatever we do.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>193</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What does it mean to serve God?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today's Christians would answer that to serve God is to work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This answer is wrong!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To say that a priest is a person who serves God is right, but to say that to serve God is merely to do something for God is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To realize what a priest is, we must first see God's eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God is a God of purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He has a purpose which He wants to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the revelation of the Scriptures, God has a plan to work Himself into a group of people, that He might be their life, and that they might become His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has no intention of calling us to do something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His intention is that we answer His call by opening ourselves to Him and saying, "Lord, here I am, not ready to work for You, but ready to be filled and possessed by You, and to be one with You."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then He will do something through us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whatever He does through us will flow out of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the real service which God is seeking today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>194</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Holy Priests and Royal Priests</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are the holy priesthood 1 Pet 2:5 on the one hand, and the royal priesthood v. 9 on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Old Testament types there are two different orders of priests, the order of Aaron and the order of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The order of Aaron is the holy order.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To be holy is to be separated from the common things, the worldly things, unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To be holy simply means to be sanctified, and to be sanctified simply means to be separated from the common things unto the divine things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the holy order, the holy priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The order of Melchisedec is the royal order.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Melchisedec was a king, and he was a kingly priest.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we as a Body go to the Lord and remain in His presence, we are the holy priests, the holy, separated ones before God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After we pray and are burdened by the Lord and equipped with the heavenly authority, we come out of the presence of the Lord to the people, serving them, even ministering the Lord to them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At that time we are the kingly priests, the royal priests, the heavenly ones with the heavenly authority as heavenly kings to minister the Lord to others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The priests of the order of Aaron always bring the need of the people to God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They are holy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But a priest of the order of Melchisedec brings something from God to supply others, to meet the need of others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the kingly priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The coordination, the separation, and the authority these three are the qualifications, the equipment we need to minister, to serve .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need the reality of the Body, we need the holy priesthood, and we need the royal priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>195</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
