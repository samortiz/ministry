   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When this new covenant is given to us, it is a cup Luke 22:20 , a portion for us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord shed the blood, God established the covenant, and we enjoy the cup, in which God and all that is of Him are our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The blood is the price Christ paid for us, the covenant is the title deed God made to us, and the cup is the portion we receive from God.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By speaking this word, the Lord made it clear that from the time He established the table He would be physically away from the disciples and not drink the fruit of the vine with them until He drinks it new with them in the Father s kingdom.</S>
