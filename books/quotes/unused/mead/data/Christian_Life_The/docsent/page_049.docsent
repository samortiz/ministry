   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. RESURRECTION CONQUERING DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Life could be subdued by death, but resurrection conquers death; hence, resurrection is stronger than life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have to investigate this statement.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Was the Lord Jesus' life subdued?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you say "yes," I say "no"; and if you say "no," I say "yes."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If His life was not subdued, how could He have been killed?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Acts 3:15, Peter told the men of Israel that they had killed the Author of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus' life could be subdued because He was killed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually, however, He was not subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was subdued temporarily for three days, but after three days He was not subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Apparently, visibly, and physically, He was subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But intrinsically, invisibly, and spiritually, He was not subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When He was crucified on the cross, He was stripping away all the rulers and authorities as spoken of in Colossians 2:15.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, when He was buried physically in the tomb, His spirit was very active.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After dying in the flesh, Christ was still active in His spirit to proclaim to the spirits in prison, to the rebellious angels, God's victory through Him over Satan 1 Pet 3:18b-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>While Christ's body was buried in the tomb, He was active in His spirit in Hades, so He was not subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually, He conquered death, and death was subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He walked out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, on the one hand, He was subdued by death; on the other hand, He was not subdued by death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>BEFORE HIS DEATH CHRIST BEING NOT ONLY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>BUT ALSO RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before His death, Christ was not only life but also resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before His death He told Martha, "I am the resurrection and the life" John 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ was the resurrection before He died.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is beyond our understanding, but it is a divine fact.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>CHRIST HAVING AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>TO LAY HIS LIFE DOWN OF HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>AND HAVING AUTHORITY TO TAKE IT AGAIN</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ had authority to lay His life down of Himself, and He had authority to take it again John 10:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Greek word for life here is not the eternal life, but the soul-life, psuche.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Visibly, Christ was arrested and put to death by others, but actually He laid down His soul, His human life, of Himself to accomplish redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After three days, He exercised His authority to take His life back in resurrection.</S>
