   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MINIATURE IN THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We enjoy a miniature of this consummate dispensation in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the church we have the flow of life, we drink the water of life, and we eat the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is God s dispensation in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, it is not the highest dispensation, the dispensation of the fullness of times.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As I enjoy the living water in the church, I am awaiting the ultimate dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We shall all be in this consummate dispensation, and we shall be fully saturated with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God on the throne refers to the Father, the Lamb refers to the Son, and the river of water of life refers to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 7 reveals clearly that the river of life denotes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, in Revelation 22 we have God the Father, God the Son as the redeeming One, and God the Spirit flowing with God the Son as the tree of life to be our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the dispensation of the Triune God, the top dispensation, the dispensation of the fullness of the times.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This dispensation began with Abel and has been increasing throughout the ages until it eventually will reach the dispensation of the fullness of times.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are getting close to that dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we realize this, we shall be beside ourselves with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not even the Apostle Paul was as close to the ultimate dispensation as we are.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hallelujah, we all shall share in the consummate dispensation!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Lord s recovery we have in the church life a miniature of that coming dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is why we enjoy singing these lines from a hymn in the supplement:</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Drink!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A river pure and clear that s flowing from</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>the throne;</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eat!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Tree of Life with fruits abundant, richly</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>grown;</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Look!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No need of lamp nor sun nor moon to keep it</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>bright, for</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here there is no night!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Oh, in the church life we drink the water of life and eat of the tree of life!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By eating and drinking we become saturated with God s very life through His dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more life that is dispensed into us, the higher we rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the heading up in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE LIGHT OF LIFE KEEPING EVERYTHING IN ORDER</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Where life is, there is light also.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>John 1:4 says, In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This light is the light of life John 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Revelation 21 we have both life and light.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because the New Jerusalem is saturated with light, it has no need for the light of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Revelation 21:23 says, And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the New Jerusalem we shall have the glory of the Triune God as our shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem there will be no night, no death, and no darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead, there will be life and light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This will cause everything to rise up and be in good order.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Wherever there is light, things are kept in order.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Suppose there were no lights in the city of Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What darkness and confusion there would be!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Life regulates, and light controls.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the church life we do not have regulations, but we do have the regulating life and the controlling light.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the church is full of life, it is also full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then everyone in the church is regulated by the inward life, not by outward regulations; and everyone is controlled and kept in order by the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Here in life and in light, we are headed up.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Revelation 21 we see the Head, the Body surrounding the Head, and all the nations walking in the light of the city Rev 21:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This will cause the new heaven and the new earth to be a bright sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, in the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center, all things will be headed up in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This will be the fulfillment of the heading up of all things in Christ spoken of in Ephesians 1:10.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In order for this to take place, we need the dispensation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The life that is dispensed into us eventually becomes the light of men.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the dispensation of the fullness of the times, all the nations will walk in the light of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This means that there will be no death, no darkness, no corruption, and no confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Instead, everything will be in good order, headed up under Christ, the unique Head, to express the Triune God in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This heading up of all things will be an eternal expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Today s church life is a foretaste of this.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is a miniature of the new heaven, the new earth, and the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As those in the miniature, we are enjoying the dispensation of life with light, and we are being headed up in Christ.</S>
