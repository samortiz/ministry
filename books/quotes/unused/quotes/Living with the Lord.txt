We thank the Lord for allowing us to gather once again in His name where we can worship Him and release our spirit
God had a desire, a delight, in His heart, and according to this desire, delight, He made a glorious plan in eternity past
In His plan God desires to gain a group of people as a corporate vessel to contain Him that He might be expressed through them
The Bible begins with an account of God's first work-creation-and ends with a city that is called 'the holy city, New Jerusalem'
The two-God's creation plus God's building-accomplish God's eternal plan and fulfill God's eternal heart's desire
Once we have been regenerated, this life within us begins to transform us through a metabolic process, changing our nature into His nature
Between these two ends the Bible reveals God's work to redeem us, regenerate us, transform us, conform us, and lead us into glory
God became flesh-an actual historical figure who was born in a manger more than one thousand nine hundred seventy years ago
Death did not take Him captive rather He willingly walked into death gave Himself to death and allowed death to do to Him all that it could
Today this life-giving Spirit is omnipresent-in the heavens and on earth, above us and below us, and inside of us and outside of us
Our religious concept always tells us that we should do many things and that we should do our best to be a proper husband or wife
If a wife is apart from the Lord she may even steal her husbands money and if a husband is apart from the Lord he may even lie to his wife
When we come to the meeting, we should have the real sense that we are not coming by ourselves but that the Lord and we are coming together
Outwardly we may appear to be zealous Christians, but in reality the Lord is not present in all of our busyness
The Lord wants us to completely stop all of our doing and to take Him as our life, to live by Him, and to live with Him
We must forget about our zeal, diligence, and all the good things or bad things about us; simply be one with the Lord within
The Lord's desire today is to gain a group of people who are like this that they may be His witnesses on the earth
The easiest way to open to the Lord is to learn to open up our whole being-our spirit, our heart, and even our mouth
The second thing that we need to do in order to live with the Lord is to contact the Lord's word in a proper way
Every one of us must see the simple vision that the Lord Jesus is the all-inclusive Spirit dwelling in our spirit
Together these chapters reveal that the eternal God became flesh to be the Lamb of God to accomplish redemption on our behalf
By living in this way we will not only have been regenerated and redeemed, we will also be in the process of being transformed
One day He will bring us into glory and all of us will be built up together to be His exceedingly glorious expression
As the lifegiving Spirit He is not only in the third heavens and all around us He is also in our spirit to be our life nature and everything
The Lord's desire today is that we would receive Him as our life, and live, move, and walk by Him and with Him
Even if we were to give our entire life, we still would not be able to thoroughly experience the Lord as the Spirit
We must thank the Lord that among us there are many brothers and sisters who love the Lord and have fellowship with Him
We must bow our heads and confess from the depths of our being that there is still a great lack in the churches in every locality
We all have to admit that every saint in every church is short of the reality of the experience of living with the Lord
He passed through death, entered into resurrection, and having completed everything, ascended into the heavens
If we love the Lord sincerely and genuinely, then from now on our top priority should be to practice living with the Lord
He has already entered into us to be the content of our spirit, so now we need to live by Him and with Him every day
If we simply communicate with the Lord in this way, gradually over time we will have the practice of contacting the Lord
Those of us who love the Lord and are of the Lord are truly different from the rest of the people on the earth
Our experience tells us that we can drive the Lord out of our mind, out of our emotions, and even out of the message that we are giving
Perhaps then you would ask me, 'Since the Lord Jesus does not go away, why is my spirit still depressed sometimes'?
A child does not initially understand that he has legs but when you put him on the floor eventually he will use his legs and begin to crawl
In the same way, it does not matter how little you know about your spirit; you still know how to use your spirit
Do not think too much and do not go by your emotions, being happy when you are stirred up and downhearted when you are not
There is no need to have a set method in picking hymns, singing hymns, or pray-reading, because we are all living with the Lord
Our Lord's living with us is even more involved than the living together of a husband and wife, for He is living right within us
No matter how close your husband is to you, he cannot live inside of you, and he cannot be your life or your person
When the Lord said this, He was already in resurrection, and shortly after He said this, He ascended to the heavens
He is in our spirit, so we also have to learn to release our spirit, exercise our spirit, use our spirit, and turn back to our spirit
Why is it that when you call on a philosopher or a sage, you have no feeling within, but when you call on the Lord Jesus, you do?
In all the churches all the brothers and sisters should be led to live in this practice of living with the Lord
Living with the Lord is according to the same principle as that of marriage life, which is not based upon coercion but upon love
It is truly painful for two people to live together without the sweetness of love and without being maintained in love
Of the sixtysix books of the Bible one bookSong of Songsspeaks exclusively about the loving relationship between the Beloved and His lovers
From beginning to end, Song of Songs talks about our living a life of love and mutual attraction with the Lord
In such a relationship it cannot be that one is higher and the other is lower, one is superior and the other is inferior
The Lord Jesus did not say, 'If anyone adores Me,' He did not say, 'If anyone worships Me,' and He did not say, 'If anyone fears Me'
As a man He died and resurrected, and today He still has His humanity, a resurrected humanity, and He is still Jesus, the Son of Man
After the Lord had resurrected, an angel told Mary the Magdalene and two other sisters to 'go, tell His disciples and Peter'
Outwardly you may not appear to love the Lord very much yet deep within you there is a feeling that the Lord is sweet and that you like Him
Perhaps you may not yet know how to love the Lord and, according to your inner feeling, you do not feel that you love Him
It may even be that while you are playing mah-jongg, while your fingers are on the tiles, a thought arises within you-'Jesus is good'
For two people to live together, they must love one another, and in order to love one another, they must find each other lovable
Because He is lovable and you have become lovable, and because He loves you and you love Him, the two of you will live together
Eventually, we will live together with the Lord to such an extent that when we say to the Lord, 'Lord, let us go to the movies together'!
When there is a special gospel meeting, we may say to the Lord, 'Lord, tonight there is a special meeting at the stadium
Paul did not pray for us to be prosperous, for our business to thrive, or for everything to go smoothly with us
The breadth, length, height, and depth are all infinite, and all of these infinite measurements are the Lord Jesus
The breadth is the Lord Jesus, the length is the Lord Jesus, the height is the Lord Jesus, and the depth is the Lord Jesus
Just as these four dimensions of breadth, length, height, and depth are infinite, so our Lord Jesus is also infinite
Calling on the Lord will also cause us to be rooted and grounded in love and to taste the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ
It says, 'The same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him; for 'whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved''
Although you have been saved eternally, you still have not been saved from your temper, your self, your oldness, and from the world
The way is to open ourselves to the Lord, and the way to open to the Lord is not to consider in the mind how to open to the Lord
According to our concept, we think that salvation will come from above, but instead, the Lord's salvation comes to us from within
Some may experience great joy, sweetness, and release when the Lord enters into them, but with most people this is not the case
We may not have sensed anything and may not have known that anything happened, but when we believed in Him, the Lord Jesus entered into us
Although they came to this kind of conclusion, within a few days something rose up within them without their knowledge
He had been in Christianity for many years but had never repented or believed until he heard our gospel preaching
In 1 Timothy 523 Paul told Timothy No longer drink water only but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent illnesses
Jing did not attend these parties, his colleagues did not have much fun, so they always made sure that he came
After you pray this, whatever sin you sense within, just confess that sin, and after you confess, say, 'Lord Jesus!
It was his habit to bring two packs of cigarettes with him every day, but on this morning, for some unknown reason, he forgot to bring them
Everyone came to give a toast for him, but instead of drinking with them, he simply said 'thank you' and smiled
Jing had been saved, he stopped going out with his colleagues, and as a result, his wife also could not go out with them
One day he invited seven or eight of us to his home for a love feast and asked his wife to prepare a meal for us
When we arrived at his house, we saw that there was nothing on the table to eat but cold leftovers from the day before
The moment Brother Jing walked in the door, his wife began taking paintings off the wall and throwing them at him
He was able to respond in this way, not because he had received some power from without but because there was a power within him
We may think that when the Lord saves us, He is like someone who is standing on solid ground pulling someone else out of a deep pit
When the all-inclusive Spirit enters into us, first He becomes our life, and second He becomes our life supply
His supply comes into us not only to give us power but also to work His elements; into us so that we can be transformed metabolically
When these ingredients are mixed together, they have an organic, nutritional capability of supplying you with energy
From birth we have been in our naturalness, and as we grew up, we got into culture; after we believed, we entered into religion
The religious concept is that if a person has a quick temper, he needs to be taught so that he can make a change
By believing in the Lord we are grafted into the true olive tree and are able to partake of the fatness of the root of the olive tree
When the wild olive branch is grafted into the true olive tree, the life-sap enters the branch, and the branch receives the supply
Once this branch is grafted into a true olive tree, the sap from the true olive tree supplies this wild olive branch and transforms it
In the initial stage there was not that much glory, but in the end after it has matured, you will see an olive that is full of glory
The expression from glory to glory in 2 Corinthians 3:18 means 'from one degree of glory to another degree of glory'
In these churches light would shine, enabling the believers to see that what they need is not outward teaching but the inward life supply
They would also see that when they believed and were saved the source of lifethe allinclusive Christ the allinclusive Spiritcame into them
They would learn to live in this all-inclusive Spirit, enjoy this Spirit, and receive His bountiful supply daily
After yet another two weeks there will be more growth, and in the end the fruit will be matured, and there will be sweet and fragrant olives
By being transformed in this way the brothers and sisters will eventually be altogether different from what they were before they were saved
Transformation is not sudden; it is a continuous metabolic process in life which eventually produces manifest results
Every living thing has a definite life, and every life has definite characteristics, a definite power, and a definite shape
The seed not only has the power to grow, but after a period of growth, it has the power to form that seed into the shape of a henna flower
