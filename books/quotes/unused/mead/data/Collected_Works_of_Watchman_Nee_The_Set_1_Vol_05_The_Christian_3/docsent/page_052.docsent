   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"Hold fast what you have."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What do they have?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They have the brotherly love, the little power, the keeping of the Lord's word, the not denying of His name, and the exalting of the Lord's word of endurance now and of His coming kingship in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These are the things that they have to hold fast.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord has not told them to add anything or to seek for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What they have is enough already.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord's word, His name, and His endurance are all here.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot hold fast what we do not have.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only after we have experienced the power of the Lord's word, the victory in the Lord's name, and the endurance of the Lord's cross can we continue to hold fast.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord does not call them to repentance as He did with the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Neither does He ask them to return as if they have veered off from the proper track of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is not merely saying that their way is right and that they should go on.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The question now is not whether or not what we preach, believe in, and live out is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This question has long been settled.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The question now is how our end will be.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should hold fast to what we have.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although those around us have one by one forsaken the Lord's word of endurance and His word of overcoming Satan fully in the future, we should still hold fast to this word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although the Lord's word and His name separates us from others and leads us to sufferings, we should still hold fast.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should hold fast what we have before the world, before the devil, and before the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"That no one take your crown."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is the meaning of a crown?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A crown is worn by a king.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, the crown is a symbol of kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It does not say here if the crown is "glorious," "of life," or "righteous."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But this crown, like all other crowns, is given only to those who have fulfilled the requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The "crown" is not the same as eternal life; it does not refer to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is sure that no one can take away our salvation, but a crown is something added to the common salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not all believers will have the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The glory in the future will be divided into ranks.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some will receive only one crown.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some will receive more than one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some will not receive any because they failed in their conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All those who believe in the Lord Jesus will have eternal life, but only those who suffer for the Lord will receive a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here it seems to tell us that there is a definite number of crowns.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we lose the one we have gained, it will be transferred to another one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the meaning of the parable of taking one talent and giving it to the ten-talented one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God has reserved a crown as a reward for us for every place that He has put us in and every testimony that He wants us to bear.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But due to slothfulness, self-pity, self-love, or self-will, we may lose our crown.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When that happens, God will give our crown to those after His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"Hold fast what you have that no one take your crown."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The messenger in Philadelphia did receive his crown eventually.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He has already received a crown from the Lord based on what he already has.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We do not have to wait until the judgment seat to know if we have a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our own life and work today will tell us if we have it or not.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The apostle Paul strove and ran at the beginning with the hope of receiving such a crown 1 Cor 9:24-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the end of his race, he knew that he had already received "the crown of righteousness" 2 Tim 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The messenger here also knows that he has already received a crown while he is still on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But it is one thing to have the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is another thing to preserve it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The glory we have received now can be lost through future failures.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The condition for being rewarded is to be continuously progressing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The method by which we received is the same method by which we preserve.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only by holding fast to what we have can we maintain our crown.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The believers should know that it is possible for them to lose what they have.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As such, it is possible for them to lose their crown.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To lose the truth once held fast is to have the believers' nature changed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As a result of this, the reward is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"Look to yourselves that you do not lose the things which we wrought, but that you may receive a full reward" 2 John 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now is the time when everything is drifting.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the one hand, there are revivals, but on the other hand, there are degradations.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although the Holy Spirit has worked in power, and although man has received the truth with joy, there is still the ebbing after the rising of the tide.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The backward trend of Laodicea can be seen everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Difficulties and sufferings have caused many revived ones to fall back to their original position.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Once a believer no longer holds fast to his Philadelphian nature, he will immediately become the comrade of Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many crowns have been lost.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If the Lord delays, many more crowns will be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Unless the believers prepare oil in their vessels in addition to having it in their lamps, they will soon see their lamps going out.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is a joy to follow the Lord in season; there is no hardship involved.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, when we are carried to where we "do not wish to go" John 21:18 , and we still maintain our heart for the Lord, then we will have a surplus supply.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Now is the time for the believers to be sifted.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God is using our environment to approve those who are worthy to be glorified together with His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God wants to make manifest His Son's "three hundred of Gideon."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Whether or not one will be chosen is completely his own choice.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God's arrangements and trials only show the kind of people we are.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But those who hold fast will see the hand of Christ holding their hands and His arms surrounding them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>From now on, all the responsibility is on us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The crown has already been given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we are not faithful, it will be taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>How solemn this is!</S>
