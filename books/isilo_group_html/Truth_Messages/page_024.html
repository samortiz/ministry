<h1 class="title">ONE WHERE THE SON IS</h1>
<p>Chapters fourteen through seventeen form a distinct section of the Gospel of John. In this portion of the Word, the Lord firstly gave a message to His disciples and then offered the prayer recorded in chapter seventeen. At the beginning of this section we have the subject of the Lord&rsquo;s last words to His disciples before His crucifixion: &ldquo;And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, that where I am you also may be&rdquo; (John 14:3). Here the Lord revealed His intention to bring His disciples to the place where He Himself was.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PLACE AND THE WAY</h2>
<p>The place where the Lord is actually is not a place; it is a person. In John 14:4 the Lord said, &ldquo;And you know where I go, and you know the way.&rdquo; Thomas replied that they did not know where the Lord was going, and he asked how they could know the way (John 14:5). Then the Lord said to him, &ldquo;I am the way&rdquo; (John 14:6). This indicates that the way is a person, Christ Himself. The Lord also said to Thomas, &ldquo;No one comes to the Father except through Me,&rdquo; This reveals that the place is the Father. Therefore, the way is a person and the place is also a person. Not many Christians have seen this. The way is the Son; and the destination, the place to which the way leads, is the Father.</p>
<p>Although the Son is the way, He can be the way only through crucifixion and resurrection. An uncrucified Christ could not be the way. As a whole, the New Testament reveals that Christ died on the cross and rose from among the dead to become the way for us to enter into the Father. By Him as our way we can be in the Father, just as He is in the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN THE FATHER AND IN THE GLORY OF THE FATHER</h2>
<p>In chapters fourteen and seventeen of John there are two where&rsquo;s. The first, which we have already considered, is in 14:3, and the second is in 17:24. In this verse the Lord prayed, &ldquo;Father, I desire that those whom You have given Me may also be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory which You have given Me.&rdquo; The <em>where</em> in 14:3 refers to the Father, but the <em>where</em> in 17:24 refers to the glory of the Father. Firstly the Son is in the Father and then in the Father&rsquo;s glory. The glory of the Father is the Father Himself expressed; hence, glory is the expression of the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FATHER GLORIFIED IN THE SON&rsquo;S GLORIFICATION</h2>
<p>The Gospel of John speaks of the glorification of the Father in the glorification of the Son (John 13:31-32; 17:1). At the beginning of His prayer in chapter seventeen, the Lord prayed, &ldquo;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You&rdquo; (v. 1). This is the subject of the Lord&rsquo;s prayer in this chapter. The Son was God incarnated in the flesh, and His flesh was a tabernacle for God&rsquo;s dwelling on earth (John 1:14). His divine element was confined in His humanity, just as God&rsquo;s shekinah glory was concealed within the tabernacle. Once, on the mountain of transfiguration, His divine element was released from within His flesh and expressed in glory, as seen by the three disciples (Matt. 17:1-3). But it was concealed again in His flesh. Before this prayer, He had predicted that He would be glorified and that the Father would be glorified in Him (John 12:23; 13:31-32). Now He was going to pass through death that the concealing shell of His humanity might be broken for His divine element, His divine life, to be released. He was also to be resurrected that His humanity might be uplifted into the divine element and that His divine element might be expressed, so that His entire being, both divinity and humanity, might be glorified. Thus the Father would be glorified in Him.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was in the Father, but, in a sense, He was not in the Father&rsquo;s glory. John 7:39 says, &ldquo;Jesus was not yet glorified.&rdquo; John 12:16 also indicates that Jesus was not yet in the Father&rsquo;s glory: &ldquo;These things His disciples did not understand at the first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of Him.&rdquo; When the Lord was crucified and resurrected, He was glorified (Luke 24:26). This means that after His resurrection, Christ was not only in the Father, but also in the Father&rsquo;s glory.</p>
<p>To be in the Father is to have the life and nature of the Father and to be one with Him in that life and nature. Glory, however, does not refer to life and nature; it refers to expression. Therefore, when we are in the Father, we have the Father&rsquo;s life and nature; but when we are in the Father&rsquo;s glory, we express the Father. We have pointed out that, in a sense, prior to His death and resurrection, the Lord Jesus was not in the glory of the Father. However, in another sense, on occasion He was in the Father&rsquo;s glory, as He was on the mount of transfiguration (Matt. 17:1-3). During that time on the mountain, Peter, James, and John beheld the Lord&rsquo;s glory. Furthermore, glory was evident both when the Lord fed the multitude and when He raised Lazarus from the dead. What people saw in Him at such times was the expression of the Father. After His resurrection Christ was always in the glory of the Father. In every sense Christ today is both in the Father and in the Father&rsquo;s glory.</p>
<p>We need to ask ourselves whether or not we are in the Father and in the Father&rsquo;s glory. Although we may have the confidence to say that we are in the Father, we may not have the boldness to say that we are in His glory.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Truth Messages &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
