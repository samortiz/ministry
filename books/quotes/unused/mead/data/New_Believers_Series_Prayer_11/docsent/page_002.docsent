   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Asking</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All prayers should be genuine petitions before God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After a brother was saved, he prayed every day.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One day a sister asked him, "Has God ever listened to your prayer?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To him prayer was just prayer; why did anyone have to bother about whether or not they were answered?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From that time on, whenever he prayed, he asked God to answer his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He began to consider how many of his prayers were answered.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He discovered that his prayers were quite vague and capricious.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It did not matter whether God answered them, and it did not matter whether God ignored them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They were like prayers to God for the sun to rise the next day; the sun would rise whether or not he prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He had been a Christian for a year, yet none of his prayers were answered.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All that time he had been just kneeling and muttering words.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He could not pinpoint what he had asked for.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This amounted to not having asked for anything at all.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord says, "Knock and it shall be opened to you" Matt 7:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If what you are knocking on is just the wall, the Lord will not open the wall to you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But if you indeed are knocking on the door, the Lord will surely open the door to you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you ask to go in as well, the Lord will surely let you in. The Lord said, "Seek and you shall find" v. 7 . Suppose that there are many things here.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Which one do you want?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You must ask for at least one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You cannot say that anything will do.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God wants to know what you specifically want and what you specifically are asking for.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only then can He give it to you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, to ask means to demand something specific.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to ask.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is what it means to seek and to knock.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suppose you want something from your father today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You have to ask for the specific thing you want.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you go to a pharmacy for medicine, you must say exactly what medicine you want.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you go to a market to purchase vegetables, you must say what vegetables you want.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is strange that people can come to the Lord without saying what they want.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is why the Lord says that we need to ask and ask specifically.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The problem with us is that we do not ask.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The hindrance is on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In our prayers we need to speak what we need and what we want.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not pray an all-inclusive prayer in a frivolous way, caring little whether or not it is answered.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A new believer needs to learn to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He needs to pray with a specific goal in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"You do not have because you do not ask" James 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many people go through the motion of prayer without asking for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is useless to spend an hour or two hours or even eight or ten days before the Lord without asking for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You need to learn to ask for something; you need to knock, really knock hard, at a door.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once you clearly identify the entrance and seek to go in, knock hard at the door.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When you seek something specific, you will not be satisfied with just anything; you want that particular thing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not be like some brothers and sisters who stand up in the meeting to pray for twenty minutes or half an hour without knowing what they want.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is strange that many people have long prayers that do not ask for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You must learn to be specific with your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You should know when God has answered your prayers and when He has not answered your prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If it makes no difference to you whether or not God answers your prayers, it will be hard for you to effectively pray to Him if you come across a difficulty in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Empty prayers will not be effectual in times of need.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If prayers are empty when needs are specific, one cannot expect any solution for the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only specific prayers can deal with specific problems.</S>
