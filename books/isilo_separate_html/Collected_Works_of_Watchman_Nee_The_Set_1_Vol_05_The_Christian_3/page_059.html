How few would submit to God and His Bible absolutely! The Laodicean atmosphere has pervaded the church and individuals. What man now asks is not what God's will is or what God's word says, but what the opinion of others is. They ask for the opinion of such and such a person that they respect, or they consult their own opinion. God's authority is cast behind the believers' back. There is no longer a use for God's Word except to take one or two verses from it as topics and subjects. All these are of the self-will! They are most detested by God. Man's natural opinions, no matter how good they are, are opposed to God. God's goal is that everyone who belongs to Him would fully deny themselves in everything and would daily echo the Lord's words: "I have come down from heaven not to do My own will but the will of Him who sent Me" (John 6:38). Everything that issues from us will not please God. God only approves His own will. Only those who have a heart to carry out God's will absolutely are the Philadelphians. Otherwise, if one turns the freedom of the Philadelphians into an occasion for the flesh, of which the self-will is, the word "Laodicea" will be plainly written on his face.</P><P>Now the great Laodicea, although preaching a divine Christ, is becoming more and more worldly and humanistic day by day and is becoming more and more manifest before our eyes. How should we deal with this? Perhaps we ourselves have already become a part of Laodicea. Perhaps we have never acknowledged the authority of Christ, having received Him as Savior only, without also receiving Him as the Lord. How much we need to be taught! This is the most crucial matter, for there are Laodicean churches, and there are Laodicean individuals. There are spiritual Laodiceas, and there are practical Laodiceas. Are we willing to open up our hearts honestly to receive the Lord's rebuke here? If we boast that we have received the truth but have not received the separating power of this truth, we are indeed foolish. If we have not heard the Lord's rebuke through the grace of God, at least we can learn from this letter the way to deal with the present-day Laodicean attitude. Here we see the Lord's motive and His word. These can serve as our example. We will never be wrong if we follow Him. His letter to Laodicea in that day is sent to all Laodiceans throughout the centuries. We should say what He has said. We should write down what He has written down. His attitude should be our attitude.</P><P>"[1] The Amen, [2] the faithful and true Witness, [3] the beginning of the creation of God." Here the Lord Jesus reveals Himself to the messenger in Laodicea. The name revealed by the Lord Jesus here is unlike the one in John's vision in chapter one. It seems to indicate that as the church slid further and further downward from its beginning, He withdrew further and further from His original fellowship with the church. Here the Lord again unveils His own virtues. What the Lord reveals in the last three churches are things not revealed in the first vision. He is revealing His own position in relation to the need of the church. All these characteristics show how the church ought to testify for God in the world. Yet it has failed. As a result, the Lord Jesus came in and demonstrated that in everything in which the church has failed, He has overcome. God must secure His glory. He delights to see that His people accomplish His commission. Yet if they fail, He will declare His own name.</P><P>Here the Lord did not say that He is holding the key of David to supply their need. Nor did He reveal Himself in order that they would love Him. Neither did He reveal Himself as the holy and true One with the purpose that they would worship Him. The atmosphere has changed here. His revelation here is not so warm and intimate. He is merely revealing a little of His own nature, of how He had once worked for God, and how He will be the Head of all things. This will not fail. In everything they have failed. He reveals Himself in this way as if to tell them that in none of these things they are up to His standard. Now He will reveal to them what they should do. The Lord is now saying that He will do what the church ought to have done.</P><P>(1) He is "the Amen." The apostle said, "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you through us, through me and Silvanus and Timothy, did not become yes and no, but our word has become yes in Him. For as many promises of God as there are, in Him is the Yes; therefore also through Him is the Amen to God, for glory through us to God" (2 Cor. 1:19-20). Hence, whether it be Christ or His word, they are both real and are both immovable and unshakable. He is always the Yes. Whatever He has said is trustworthy. All the promises of God are approved in Christ. The guarantor of all the promises is Christ. Why do we know that the promises of God will not fail? How do we know that what God has said will surely be carried out? How do we know that these promises will be accomplished in us? For the sake of our faith, God has given us Christ. Christ affirms all of God's promises. The person of Christ is the pledge of God. "He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not also with Him freely give us all things?" (Rom. 8:32). The fact that God has given us Christ proves that all of His promises are real. Is there anyone who would give us the greatest and the dearest thing but would still withhold the lesser things from us? Since we have Christ, we can believe in and claim all of God's promises. When we have Christ, we can say that we have received all of God's promises. If this is the case, it would be our mistake to hesitate or to be discouraged from claiming God's promises. If we do not have Christ, it is excusable for us to doubt. But now that we have Christ, it will be our sin if we still do not have faith. Hence, from now on, we can definitely believe that God does want to accomplish all His promises in us. We can also believe that Christ is praying for these promises to be accomplished.</P><P>God's word has been affirmed through Christ. How do we know that the Bible is true? It is through Christ. As long as we have one word from God, we can be eternally at rest because God's word is sure. It issues from His unlimited love and will never forsake us. It is for this reason that we believe the Bible to be inspired word for word. If we do not believe in this, it means that we do not believe in Christ as "the Amen," the One who affirms God's word. He Himself has told us that "the Scripture cannot be broken" (John 10:35). If the Lord Jesus were speaking to us here about a profound doctrine, we might merely consider that such profound doctrines in the Bible are great. Of course, it is not right even to think of them in this way. When the Lord said here, however, that the Scripture cannot be broken, He was not referring to any profound doctrine. Rather, He was talking about some title which, humanly speaking, has the least significance. "If He said they were gods, to whom the word of God came." There is a double significance here. It shows every Bible reader that the Bible is God-inspired and that the titles ascribed by the writers of the Bible to certain people are without any mistake. Man may doubt God's word, but Christ affirms God's word.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> </body></html>
