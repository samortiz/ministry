<h2 class="head1">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br />THE WORK OF THE WORKERS<br />AND THE WORK OF THE ELDERS</h2><p>The workers' work is restricted to activities such as special gospel meetings and spiritual edification conferences. The regular weekly preaching and edification remain the work of the elders. In other words, the elders are like the pastors we see today, whereas the workers are like the revivalists we see today. The workers who intend to remain in one place are not qualified to be apostles. The works of a worker are to preach the gospel and establish churches in places where no gospel has been preached. In a place where the gospel has been preached, he engages himself in special spiritual edification. Therefore, a worker cannot have a place that he can call his own. The elders are like wives who cook every day, three meals a day. The workers are like special catering cooks. They are invited to prepare a few lavish dishes and then leave. If you ate lavish dishes every day, sooner or later you would have to see a doctor. You have to be content with ordinary meals. Hence, every brother and sister must be satisfied in their mind with "workerless" meetings.</p><p>In the first century, during the first thirty or forty years of the church's history, the relationship between the work and the churches was proper. By the fourth century, after the Roman emperor embraced the Christian faith, and Christianity was formalized as the state religion, men were en- couraged to join the church, babies were sprinkled, and the church was filled with false Christians. Because of the great influx of nominal members in the church and the fact that those in authority could not bear spiritual responsibility nor could the laity help edify others, the emperor was forced to give the more spiritually mature believers a monopoly on spiritual responsibilities. In the end they became a special class of people. This group of people would work seven days a week, while the rest of the people would work only six days a week. The members would offer their money every week to support the church and the clergy's need. Eventually the priests in the Catholic Church became a professional class of people to bear spiritual responsibilities. Protestantism improved on the sacerdotal system and instituted the pastors, who are a little better than the priests, but in principle the two groups are the same.</p><p>Our work during the past ten or more years has practically annulled the system of the pastors, but unconsciously we have replaced it with the workers, and now the workers have become pastors in disguise. This is wrong. The workers should pioneer or help the meetings in all the places. They should not stay in a place and replace the work of the elders. The brothers in all the localities should be under the direction of the elders. Even when a worker resides in Foochow, he should only be a brother in Foochow. In the work there are workers, but in the church there is no such thing as a worker. For nine years I have been telling the brothers in Shanghai that I was not working there as a worker. This is a principle that a worker must absolutely keep in his work. As far as a worker's work is concerned, the Bible only gives the principle of planting and watering; it does not say that the workers have to stay behind to oversee the growth. We see this in Acts 13 and afterwards.</p><p>There was a brother in Shanghai who was not that mature. Yet when he moved to Lung-Ya, he became an elder there and began to grow very much spiritually. He did a good job there, and the brothers liked him very much.</p><p>The elders must be under the instruction of the apostles. Paul exhorted the Corinthians to put the sinning one out from the church (1 Cor. 5:13). But he could not do it for them. If you find that a worker is improper, your locality can reject him, and a worker should accept this rejection humbly. There should be a plurality of elders. Overseers are the same as the elders, and they should be plural in number.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING FELLOWSHIP</h2><p>If a local assembly is standing on the ground of the church, it will surely receive all Christians. A local church must include all saved and regenerated Christians. You can chase out the foreigners from the Foreign Concession District in Shanghai, but you cannot chase out the Chinese who are living there. The church can only remove unsaved and unregenerated people; it cannot remove those who are saved and regenerated. Seventy percent of the money collected in the church in Shanghai is used to help weak brothers. Although these brothers are weak, they are still brothers. There should also be fellowship between the different assemblies. There also exists a relationship among the workers. If one place recognizes a brother as a worker, other places should also recognize him as a worker.</p>
