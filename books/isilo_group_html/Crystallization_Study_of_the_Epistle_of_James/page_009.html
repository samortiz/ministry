The Grace Given by God</H2><P>The seventh and final factor of which the Christian perfection stressed by James is produced is the grace given by God (4:6). James mentions grace only in an elementary way by saying that the Lord gives grace to the humble.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Means by Which the Christian Perfection<br>Stressed by James Is Carried Out</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Faith</H2><P>Faith is one of the means of Christian perfection stressed by James (1:3, 6), but in the entire New Testament the means is much higher than this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Wisdom Given by God to Know<br>How to Be Perfect</H2><P>James speaks of the wisdom given by God, not to know how to fulfill God's eternal economy but to know how to be perfect (1:5; 3:13, 15, 17). James said that if we are not wise in our behavior, we should pray for God to give us the wisdom. He did not speak of a high wisdom according to God's New Testament economy but of a low wisdom according to perfection in behavior.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Crown of Life</H2><P>The crown of life is used in James as a kind of incentive for us to endure trials (1:12). This may be the highest among the means stressed by James for Christian perfection.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crystallization-Study of the Epistle of James &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
