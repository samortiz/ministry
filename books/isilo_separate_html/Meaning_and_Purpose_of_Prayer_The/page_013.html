<p>In chapter 13 the Lord washed His disciples&rsquo; feet. The principle involved in this case is that we need to let Him do what He wills in us when we draw near to Him. We should not be like Peter, who humbly said, &ldquo;You shall by no means wash my feet forever.&rdquo; Then, when the Lord said, &ldquo;Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me,&rdquo; Peter said, &ldquo;Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head&rdquo; (vv. 8-9). This is our condition. The Lord wants to work in us, but we initially will not let Him. Later, when we are willing, we want Him to do more than He intends. These are our human opinions.</p>
<p>When we draw near to the Lord, He wants to work in us, and He wants to remove certain things. Foot-washing is a sign of removing improper things in our being. We must learn to be obedient. If the Lord wants to wash our feet, we should let Him. If He does not wash our hands, we should submit. We should let the Lord wash whatever He wants to wash. We should not make any proposals or counsel Him. This is the fifth principle concerning our contacting the Lord. We must learn this lesson.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing That the Lord Does Not Change</h2>
<p>In chapter 21 the Lord manifested Himself to His disciples. This case shows that the Lord will draw near to us even when we fall into the world, that is, when we are at our weakest point and forget to draw near to Him. The disciples returned to fishing in order to make a living, but they caught nothing. The Lord knew their need and asked, &ldquo;You do not have any fish to eat, do you?&rdquo; (v. 5). The Lord knew that the disciples went fishing in order to have food. They answered, &ldquo;No&rdquo; (v. 5). Then the Lord said, &ldquo;Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some&rdquo; (v. 6). They cast their net and caught a hundred and fifty-three large fish (v. 11). When they reached the land, they saw a fire of coals, and fish were lying on it and bread (v. 9).</p>
<p>After seeing the fish they caught that day and eating the fish that the Lord had prepared, the disciples must have considered how they had returned to their old occupation in the world in order to get food. The Lord performed a miracle by letting them catch a hundred and fifty-three large fish and by preparing fish for them to eat. After eating, the disciples must have had all kinds of feelings. It must have been most difficult for Peter, because he had not only gone back to the world but also had taken other disciples with him. After he had said, &ldquo;I am going fishing,&rdquo; some of the disciples said, &ldquo;We also are coming with you&rdquo; (v. 3). This can be compared to a brother saying, &ldquo;I am going to love the world,&rdquo; and other brothers saying, &ldquo;We also are coming with you.&rdquo; The disciples went as a group to love the world; they fell into the world together. The Lord, however, did not abandon them. He continued to look after them. He let them catch fish, and He also fed them with fish and bread that He had prepared. After they ate, the Lord asked Peter, &ldquo;Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?&rdquo; (v. 15). With these words the Lord let His disciples know that He was not disappointed in them; He wanted them to continue to follow Him and to serve Him.</p>
<p>This is another major principle in our contact with the Lord. We should never think that we cannot draw near to the Lord when we are weak, love the world, and do not pray. We may not be able to draw near to the Lord, but the Lord can draw near to us. We may not be able to contact Him, but He will contact us. Concerning contacting the Lord, we are all failures. Peter went fishing, and we also &ldquo;go fishing&rdquo; like him. We fail, but the Lord never fails. When we draw near to Him, He contacts us, and even when we do not draw near to Him, He still comes to contact us. We are unreliable. We may contact the Lord today but not tomorrow, or we may contact Him this month but not next month. No matter what our condition is, the Lord remains the same. No matter how we change, the Lord never changes. Hence, in our contacting the Lord we must realize that the Lord never changes, no matter how much we may change. This is a principle.</p>
<p>We need to look to the speaking of the Holy Spirit and learn how to draw near to the Lord and contact Him. I would encourage the saints to spend time to consider the principles presented in these cases and to learn these lessons. The sweetest principle is that drawing near to the Lord is not in our hands; it is in the Lord&rsquo;s hands. We may not draw near to Him, but He will draw near to us. We may be far away from Him, but He will find us. Even when we are at our weakest point, He will draw near to us. When we are far away from Him, He will come to contact us. Even when we are cold and indifferent toward Him or have fallen into the world, He will still say, &ldquo;Do you love Me? Follow Me!&rdquo;</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> </body></html>
