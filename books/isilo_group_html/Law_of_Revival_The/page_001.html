<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book contains five messages released by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei. These messages, given in co-workers&rsquo; meetings, present the matter of revival as a spiritual law that enables believers to grow in life and to know the Lord more personally and intimately. The dates when the messages were given are not known. These messages were originally published in Chinese in <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> from 1960 to 1961.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | First | Prev | <a href="page_002.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Law of Revival &nbsp; pg 1</div><br></body></html>
