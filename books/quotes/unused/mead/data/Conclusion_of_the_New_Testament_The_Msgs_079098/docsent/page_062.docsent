   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As the Means for Them to Take Christ as Their Righteousness by Faith</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit is the means for the believers to take Christ as their righteousness by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"We by the Spirit by faith eagerly expect the hope of righteousness" Gal 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"By the Spirit" here is in contrast with "by the flesh" Gal 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, "by faith" is in contrast with "by the works of law" Gal 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The hope of righteousness is the righteousness we hope for, which is Christ Himself 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not by works of law in the flesh but by faith in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is our hope of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is our righteousness today, and He is our hope to come.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are not looking for earthly success.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By the Spirit and by faith we expect Christ as the hope of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is in the divine fellowship that we through the Spirit as the means take Christ as our righteousness by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we enjoy Christ in fellowship with the Triune God, we realize that every day, even every moment, Christ is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of ourselves we do not have any righteousness; on the contrary, our righteousness is the Christ whom we live.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we live Christ, He is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not have our own merit before God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our only merit before God is the Christ whom we live daily.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, in our fellowship with the Triune God we do not take our behavior or character as our merit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead, we take Christ as our merit, as our righteousness, enjoying Him in our fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Galatians 5:5 Paul puts the Spirit together with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to Galatians 3:14, the Spirit is typified by the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Faith may be compared to a camera that photographs the divine scenery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order to have the proper enjoyment of Christ, we need the Spirit as the all-inclusive land and faith as the means to enjoy this land.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then as we enjoy the Spirit by faith, we eagerly expect the hope of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>47.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Witnessing with Their Spirit That They Are the Children of God</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 8:16 says, "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is a Witness within us who testifies that we are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that within us someone is reminding us that we are God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes this reminding One regulates us or safeguards us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This regulating comes from the Spirit, who is witnessing with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Romans 8:14 Paul speaks of the sons of God, and in verse 15, of the spirit of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why in verse 16 does he suddenly speak of the children of God?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The reason is that the Spirit witnesses to something basic.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He witnesses to our primary or initial relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may be children without the growth of a son, and we may be sons without the qualification of an heir.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For the Holy Spirit to witness that we are all heirs of God would be premature.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Most of us are not mature enough for such a witness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, the Spirit witnesses to the most basic and elementary relationship that of being the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He witnesses with our spirit that we are God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Romans 8:16 does not say "in our spirit" but "with our spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If this verse said "in our spirit," this would mean that only the Spirit of God witnesses but that our spirit does not witness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, the Spirit witnesses with our spirit, meaning that both witness together.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Spirit of God witnesses, and simultaneously our spirit witnesses together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, sometimes we may not feel that the Spirit is witnessing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But we cannot deny the fact that our spirit is witnessing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As long as our spirit is witnessing, the Holy Spirit also is witnessing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In his wisdom Paul said that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When our spirit witnesses, that is also the witnessing of the Spirit, for the two spirits have been mingled together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>With our spirit the Spirit witnesses that we are God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Often we exercise our mind to try to figure out certain things related to our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From experience we know that this is a distraction.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What we need is the living witness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to 8:16, the Spirit witnesses with our spirit, not with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul says clearly and explicitly that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Furthermore, the Spirit bears witness that, as children of God, we should not do certain things or go to certain places.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many times this witnessing bothers us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the one hand, it assures us that we are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the other hand, it convicts us when we do things that are not in keeping with being a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This indicates that to be a child of God is to be limited and restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, this limitation and restriction is not a suffering but a protection.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thank the Lord that we are preserved and protected by the inner witnessing of the Spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The work of the indwelling Spirit in witnessing with our spirit that we are children of God is also a matter of the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As the Spirit keeps us in fellowship with the Triune God, we enjoy being children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have the sweet and intimate inward sense that we are God's children.</S>
