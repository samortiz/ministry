 <h2 class="head2">Maintaining a Good Order in the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, on the one hand, we should keep the oneness of the Body of Christ, and on the other hand, we should maintain a good order in the Body of Christ. For the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to remain in a proper condition, we need both the oneness and a good order.</p>
<h2 class="head3">By Abandoning Any Kind of Dictatorship</h2>
<p>We must maintain a good order in the Body of Christ by abandoning any kind of dictatorship (Matt. 20:25-27; 23:8-11). According to Matthew 20 and 23, we all are brothers. There is no rank among us. Ambition for higher rank in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery must be fully killed.</p>
<h2 class="head3">By Subjecting Ourselves One to Another</h2>
<p>We abandon any kind of dictatorship, but we maintain a good order in the Body of Christ by subjecting ourselves one to another (1 Pet. 5:5). Even the older ones should subject themselves to the younger ones. We have God as our Father, and we have Christ as our Lord and Head. This indicates that we should be a submissive people. Although we are all brothers, Paul told us that we should obey the ones leading us and submit to them (Heb. 13:17). The church is not an anarchy, but on the other hand, in the church the elders should not lord it over the saints (1 Pet. 5:3). There needs to be a good order in the church. According to 1 Peter 5:5, the younger men should be subject to elders, which includes all older men. The young people among us need to practice this. The elders among us, on the other hand, should have no attitude or feeling of superiority. We need a good and beautiful order in the church, with all being subject to one another in the fear of Christ (Eph. 5:21).</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A SPECIAL TRAINING FOR FOUR MONTHS<br />
TO PREPARE AND EQUIP THE BURDENED ONES,<br />
INCLUDING FULL-TIMERS, THOSE WITH A JOB<br />
OR A BUSINESS, AND STUDENTS,<br />
IN THE FOLLOWING MATTERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">In Foreign Languages</h2>
<p>We will have a special training for four months to prepare and equip the burdened ones in foreign languages. These languages at first will be German and Russian. The more languages we can learn, the more useful we can be in the spread of the divine truths.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Divine Truths</h2>
<p>We will also prepare and equip those who are burdened to go to Europe with an intensive study of the divine truths.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Manner of Life</h2>
<p>This special training will prepare the burdened ones in the manner of life. The brothers among us need to learn to dress properly, as those who live Christ. If a high-ranking person invited us to his home for dinner, we would surely go properly and appropriately dressed. We need to realize that the One who has invited us to the church meetings is the Lord Jesus. He is there waiting for us in the meeting. Therefore, we should dress properly when we attend the meetings. The brothers should wear a proper tie and comb their hair properly. They should also shine their shoes regularly. We should not be worldly, but on the other hand, we should be comely and neat. We should pray about how to cut and style our hair. The sisters, especially, need to do this. The appearance of the sisters means a lot. A sister in Christ should be comely in a proper way, remembering that she is one who fears God, worships God, lives Christ, and ministers Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Personal Contacting of People</h2>
<p>The special training will also help the burdened ones in the personal contacting of people. We have to learn to be polite when we contact people. We need to learn how to sit before people, especially before someone who is older than we are. We should also be very proper in contacting those of the other sex. The sisters should remember their position in the Lord as females. If we behave ourselves properly in our contact with people, this will open the door for the gospel and the deeper truths. Otherwise, the door will be shut. Again, this shows that we need a change. We need the training.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING THE ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>Finally, nothing is more crucial, vital, or valuable than the one accord for keeping the oneness. We must always endeavor to keep the oneness by practicing the one accord. We should always practice going along with others, not insisting on our way of doing things. We should not be &ldquo;back-seat drivers&rdquo; in the church life who are full of opinions. This does not mean that we should drop our discernment. When I do things by myself, I will take the top way. But when I go with others, I will take their way. We should learn to do this.</p>
<p>We also need to learn to teach the divine truths in the central lane of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. I served the Lord with Brother Nee for eighteen years, and we never had any discrepancy in our teaching concerning Christ and the church in the central lane of God&rsquo;s economy. In our teachings we always practiced the one accord.</p>
<p>If we open to the Lord and receive the fellowship in this book, I believe we will be blessed, we will enjoy the Lord to the uttermost, and we will be a living testimony to the people of Europe.</p>
