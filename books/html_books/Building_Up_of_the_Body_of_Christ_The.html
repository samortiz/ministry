<h1 class="title">THROUGH THE GIFTS&rsquo; PERFECTING<br />
OF THE SAINTS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:22b-23; 4:7-12, 16, 15; 1 Cor. 3:2, 6; 1 Pet. 2:2</h1>
<p>The fellowship in this book concerning the building up of the Body of Christ may be considered as a continuation of our fellowship in the book entitled <em>The Organism of the Triune God in the Organic Union of His Divine Trinity.</em> In the New Testament, there are many teachings concerning the building up of the church, which is the Body of Christ. In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus referred to the building up of the church for the first time. In Paul&rsquo;s writings there are many portions related to this matter. The most crucial passage is Ephesians 4:11-16. Verse 16 in particular is a crucial verse in the New Testament concerning the Lord&rsquo;s desire to build up His Body. After much study and consideration of the Greek text, we feel that a better translation of this verse is as follows: &ldquo;Out from whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; All the Body causes the growth of the Body through two categories of things: through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING UP OF THE ONE ORGANISM</h2>
<p>The building up of the Body of Christ is the building up of the one organism. An organism is different from an organization. A table is something organized; pieces of wood have been organized together to become an item of furniture. It is lifeless and has nothing to do with life. But our human body is altogether organic. Therefore, it is an organism. The parts of our body are not organized together. Each part is organically related to the others in life, and each part participates in the one circulation of the same blood. Our physical body is organic because it is full of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Church Being the Body of Christ,<br />
the Fullness of the One Who Fills All in All,<br />
as the Expression of the Triune God</h2>
<p>It is true that the church is a congregation, an assembly, of God&rsquo;s called out people. But if this is all that we see concerning the church, we may be led to believe that the church is a human organization like other social bodies. In Ephesians Paul shows us that the church was something in God&rsquo;s heart in eternity past since God chose us before the foundation of the world, predestinating us unto sonship (Eph. 1:4-5). To carry out His heart&rsquo;s desire, God was incarnated to be a man living on this earth. He died on the cross for our sins, was raised up from the dead, and ascended to the heavens. According to Ephesians 1, God&rsquo;s great power was wrought in Christ to raise Him from the dead (v. 20a), to seat Him at His right hand in the heavenlies (v. 20b), to subject all things under His feet (v. 22a), and to give Him to be Head over all things to the church (v. 22b). What God wrought in Christ with His great power is transmitted to the church.</p>
<p>If I had written the Epistle to the Ephesians, I might have stopped with verse 22. However, Paul continued with one more verse to describe what the church is. Verse 23 does not say that the church is a congregation or the assembly of God&rsquo;s chosen people. Rather, Paul says that the church is Christ&rsquo;s Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all. This should cause us to realize that the church is something organic. It is not something organizational without life, but it is organic and full of life.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ is particular and special because it is the fullness of the Triune God (Eph. 3:19). The Christ who fills all in all is the embodiment of the very Triune God. The Body of Christ, the organism of the resurrected and ascended Christ, is the organism of the One who fills all in all. Ephesians 3:18 speaks of &ldquo;the breadth and length and height and depth&rdquo; of Christ. These are the measureless dimensions of Christ. The One who fills all in all is measureless. His dimensions have no end. They are the dimensions of the universe. The church is the Body, the organism, of such a One. When we speak of the church rather than the Body, our thinking may become narrow. We may consider the church to be merely the assembly of the called out ones, the congregation, or an organization of saved human beings. According to the Bible, however, the church is much greater and much higher than a congregation. It is an organism, the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</p>
<p>It is difficult to comprehend the Body of Christ, but God in creation made our human body as a figure of the Body. Consider how wonderful our body is. The eyes, the ears, and every part are marvelous. Every part of my body participates when I am speaking. My speaking does not only come from my vocal chords, tongue, and lips. My eyes, my ears, my nose, and every part help me when I speak. Our body is not like that of a robot. It is living, full of life, and organic. Likewise, the church is organic. If we desire to know what the church life is, we must have a clear vision from the heavens that the church which God redeemed is not an organization but an organism. The church is a matter of life, not of organization. Over ninety percent of the problems and troubles that arise in the church life are due to the understanding that the church is an organization. If we drop the thought of organization and receive a heavenly vision of the church as an organism, most of our problems in the church will be solved. The church is an organism. It is altogether organic and full of life.</p><h2 class="head2">Through the Gifts Produced by<br />
the Head of the Body in His Resurrection</h2>
<p>The building up of the Body of Christ is through the gifts produced by the Head of the Body in His resurrection (Eph. 4:7-8,11). The gifts in Ephesians 4:11 are the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. These are the gifted persons. These gifted persons were produced not by a seminary or a Bible institute but by the Head of the Body in His resurrection. In this regard, Ephesians 4 describes a wonderful process. Christ firstly descended, not only from the heavens to the earth, but also from the earth to Hades (v. 9). Then He resurrected and ascended from Hades, not only to the earth, but also to the third heavens (vv. 8-10). When He was doing this, He was like a victorious, overcoming general. By His death and resurrection He saved those who had been taken captive by Satan. In His ascension He rescued them from Satan&rsquo;s captivity and made them His own captives. Then He brought all these captives to the heavens in His ascension to present them to God as presents. God was pleased and returned these captives to Him as gifts. Through this procedure of the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ, Christ&rsquo;s presentation of the captives to God, and God&rsquo;s returning them to Christ, all the captives became gifts. Paul was such a gift. He was a captive of Satan but was rescued out of the hand of Satan by Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. Through Christ&rsquo;s ascension and presentation of him to God the Father and through God&rsquo;s returning of him to Christ, this captive became a top gift.</p>
<p>Do you realize that you are a gift given by God to Christ for the building up of His Body? Before you were saved, you were a captive in the hand of Satan. However, through His death and resurrection, Christ has rescued you, saving you out of the hand of Satan. Furthermore, He has brought you to the heavens and presented you to His Father to please the Father, and the Father has returned you to Christ. By this process you, who were a sinner and a captive of Satan, became not only a member of Christ but also a gift. Each of us is a gift from the Triune God to the church (Eph. 4:7-8). You are so precious to the Body, and the Body cannot be built up without you.</p>
<p>We are not gifts in an organizational way. If one loses his teeth, a dentist may supply a denture to replace them in an organizational way. This denture is inorganic, but every part of our physical body is organic and indispensable. The little finger, the hand, the arm, and the shoulder are all gifts to our physical body. What could I do without my shoulders, arms, or hands? Even to be without the little finger would be awkward. While we have it, we may not feel that it is useful, but if we lost it, we would feel that we lacked something. In like manner, we are members of the Body of Christ. If any of us were not here, the church would miss us. Each of us is a gift to the Body.</p>
<p>The gifts are produced by the Head, Christ, in His resurrection. We have been crucified with Him (Rom. 6:6a; Gal. 2:20a). We were raised up from the dead, and we have also ascended in Him and with Him to the heavens (Eph. 2:6). We have been made gifts full of life in His resurrection. As gifts to the Body, we are altogether organic. All of our natural ability and strength mean nothing because being gifts given by God to Christ for His Body is something in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, not something in the natural life by our first birth. What we do by our natural life results in death, but what we do in resurrection is organic. We should act, move, and do things in the church life organically in the resurrection of Christ, not in our natural life.</p>
<p>If we do things in the church life by our natural life and strength, we are moving and acting in an organizational way. To clean the meeting hall in our natural life according to an outward arrangement is to act in an organizational way. But if we are living in the spirit, in the organic way, contacting God in resurrection, we may have the inner feeling and leading to come to the hall to clean in resurrection by life and not by organization. The proper way to clean the hall is to do it organically. Under the organizational way, sometimes those who are charged to clean the hall become offended. Those who serve in the organic way will never be offended. Whatever we do&mdash;whether we clean the hall, preach the gospel, take care of home meetings, or come to the meetings to function&mdash;must be altogether organic, not organizational. The way to have the proper church life is to move and act in an organic way.</p>
<p>In the past we charged the saints to open their mouths to say something for the Lord. Some felt that it was too hard to speak for the Lord, so we fellowshipped with them in order to help them. However, much of our fellowship may not have been organic; it may have been organizational. The right way to help the saints get into this practice is to bring them into an organic realization. We should teach them, that is, feed them, with some spiritual nourishment so that they can be strengthened and realize they have another life, the life of resurrection. They need to realize that they can live, walk, and have their being in this life every day and all day. If they live such a life, they will come to the meeting and open up their mouths organically. Organically they will utter something. You will not need to teach them to say &ldquo;Hallelujah.&rdquo; They will say &ldquo;Hallelujah&rdquo; organically, in the way that comes out of life, not out of arrangement or organization. The perfecting by the gifted persons is altogether not something organizational but organic.</p><h2 class="head2">With Nourishment (Life Supply)<br />
for the Growth in Life</h2>
<p>The gifted persons perfect the saints by nourishing them. Just as we love and care for every member of our physical body, the Lord loves and cares for every member of His Body, the church. Ephesians 5:29 says, &ldquo;For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church.&rdquo; The Body is altogether organic and needs to be cared for in an organic way by being nourished. The church as the organism of Christ is built up with nourishment, the life supply, for the growth in life (Eph. 4:16, 15; 1 Cor. 3:2, 6; 1 Pet. 2:2). Nourishment and growth result in the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>It may seem strange that the Bible uses the word <em>build</em> to describe what transpires with this organism (Eph. 4:12, 16). The Body is an organism that can be built up. The building up of our human body may be used as an illustration of the building up of the Body of Christ. Every time we eat, we build up our body. A newly delivered baby may weigh seven pounds and be twenty inches long, but after twenty years this baby may grow to be over two hundred pounds and over six feet tall. He becomes so big by growth, and this growth of his body is a building up.</p>
<p>This building takes place by the addition of certain things to our body to nourish it. The addition of inorganic things to our body does not build it up, but the addition of eggs, apples, beef, chicken, and fish builds up our body by nourishing it. Day after day, at least three times a day, we add something to our body by eating. This is the building up. Our body has been built up with many organic things. The addition of organic things to our organic body causes the growth, which is the building up.</p>
<p>We may have the concept that teaching and organizing build up the church. The New Testament does say that we must teach others, but in the biblical sense teaching means feeding. In Hebrews 5:12 Paul says, &ldquo;For when because of the time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you what are the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God, and have become those who have need of milk and not of solid food.&rdquo; In this verse Paul refers to teaching in the sense of feeding. In our teaching to the churches and the saints there must be an organic element which can be taken in as nourishment. Any teaching that does not convey nourishment is not the biblical teaching, the teaching of the New Testament. According to the New Testament way, all teaching should be organic and very rich in life and the life supply. It should be with life and full of life. After listening to this teaching, we will be nourished, and this nourishment will result in the growth in life. The organic element we receive will be digested and assimilated into our being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THROUGH THE GIFTS&rsquo; PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>The building up of the Body of Christ is through the gifts&rsquo; perfecting of the saints. Ephesians 4:11 and 12 say, &ldquo;And He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers should perfect the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Apostles&rsquo; Perfecting</h2>
<p>Much is implied by the apostles&rsquo; perfecting of the saints. Apostles are ones who preach the gospel to save sinners, bring them together to establish a church, and then appoint elders. We may think that after the apostles appoint the elders, they should leave and have nothing more to do with the church. But how could the apostles perfect the saints if they had nothing more to do with the church and the elders that they had established? The perfecting of the saints by the apostles would be impossible.</p>
<p>There were elders in Jerusalem (Acts 15:2), but the Bible does not tell us how they were established. The first instance of the appointment of elders in the New Testament is in Acts 14. Paul and Barnabas preached the gospel in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra in Asia Minor. After preaching elsewhere, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch and established elders in every church (vv. 21-23). These were young churches, and the elders were babes. After appointing elders in these churches, the apostles returned to Antioch in Syria where they confronted the problem of the heresy of circumcision, and they went to Jerusalem to deal with this problem. Following this, Acts 15:36 says, &ldquo;Now after some days Paul said to Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brothers throughout every city in which we announced the word of the Lord, and see how they are getting along.&rdquo; Within a short period of time, the apostles preached the gospel, set up churches, appointed elders, and then went back to visit the churches and elders they had established.</p>
<p>All the Epistles were written to the established churches with the elders not just to teach them, but to charge and instruct them to deal with certain problems, to do certain things, and to take care of certain matters. Paul said to the Corinthians, &ldquo;What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness?&rdquo; (1 Cor. 4:21), and in 1 Corinthians 11:34 he said, &ldquo;And the remaining matters I will set in order when I come.&rdquo; Paul intended to return to Corinth to set matters in order. According to the record of the Bible, after appointing the elders in a church, the apostles did not stay away from the church to let it go on by itself.</p>
<p>Peter was an apostle, but he stayed in Jerusalem as an elder (1 Pet. 5:1). His example shows us that an apostle may remain in a church as an elder to help the church. After the appointment of the elders, the apostles always helped the churches either by remaining with them, by visiting them, or by writing epistles to them to charge them, instruct them, and correct them. Even the Epistles to Timothy and Titus were written in the principle of helping those who had been established by the apostles. Paul instructed these brothers how to behave themselves in the church.</p>
<p>In <em>The Normal Christian Church Life,</em> Brother Watchman Nee said that after the apostles appointed the elders, the apostles would not take care of the church in its business affairs. In the business affairs, the apostles should keep their hands off of the churches. This word by Brother Nee was misunderstood and misused by some of the saints, even the co-workers. Eleven years later in 1948, he put out a set of messages which were printed in the book <em>Church Affairs.</em> On page 149 of this book he says, &ldquo;After the meeting in Hangkow [where the messages in <em>The Normal Christian Church Life</em> were given], some brothers misunderstood that though the elders are appointed by the apostles, they do not have to listen to the apostles. This is impossible.&rdquo; The apostles should never keep their hands off of the churches in the work of the ministry to build them up. Pages fourteen through twenty-four of <em>Church Affairs</em> is a long section telling us how, after establishing the elders, the apostles have to train them by teaching them how to be elders and how to take care of the church affairs.</p>
<p>By the apostles&rsquo; returning to or staying in a church to help the elders after they are established, they have the opportunity to perfect the saints. The New Testament shows us that the apostles&rsquo; practice was to preach the gospel, teach the truth, set up a church with the saved ones, establish the elders among them, and then train the elders how to be elders. Then they would stay with the elders for some time to perfect the saints. The apostles perfected the saints to do what they themselves did. They preached the gospel, and no doubt they perfected the saints to do the same thing. They taught the truth and also perfected the saints to learn the truth, know the truth, and teach the truth. The apostles set up churches and perfected the saints to do this also. Today we need this kind of perfecting so that we can preach the gospel to sinners, teach the truth to the saved ones, and establish these ones as a church.</p>
<p>If we are those who preach the gospel in the proper way, teach the truth in an adequate way, and set up churches, we are qualified to appoint elders. However, we must not set up elders and go away to rest or retire, leaving them without any perfecting. We must stay to train the elders how to shepherd the flock, the church. As an elder Peter said, &ldquo;Shepherd the flock of God among you...nor as lording it over the allotments, but becoming patterns of the flock&rdquo; (1 Pet. 5:2-3). The elders should not control but should shepherd and nourish the saints that they may grow. We must train the elders to do this. Then we have to cooperate with these elders to perfect the saints to do what we do. As we have been perfected, we will produce a number of saints like ourselves. This will cause us to be productive and will result in the duplication of the churches.</p>
<p>The apostles should perfect the saints in the things which they themselves do. A professor of mathematics teaches his students mathematics. After their graduation, the students of the professor will do the same things that he does. This is the professor&rsquo;s perfecting of the students. In the same way, the apostles must stay with a church, first to train the elders and then, with the elders, to perfect the saints. In recent years we have been short of the training of the elders and the perfecting of the saints. We have not had adequate time for this. Perhaps many of our problems have been due to this shortage. What can we expect of a local church in which the elders are not trained and the saints are not perfected? To train the elders is not simply to have a conference. The apostles must stay with the elders to train and teach them.</p>
<p>There has not been an adequate situation of training and perfecting among us. We have had meetings in which only general messages have been given week after week. The saints have received only a general perfection, not a particular perfection. However, Ephesians 4:11-12 implies that the perfecting by the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers is particular. We are short of this perfection. Our goal is to endeavor to attain it.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:11-16 has not been properly touched by the Lord&rsquo;s children. The need for the perfecting of the saints revealed in these verses has not been fulfilled. Where is the apostles&rsquo;, the prophets&rsquo;, and the evangelists&rsquo; perfecting of the saints? There may be a certain amount of the perfecting by the elders as the shepherds and teachers, but only in part and not in a particular way. In a college one must study many courses before he can graduate. In the same way, in the church life we need the perfecting by the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers. Because Ephesians 4:11-16 is the word of the Lord in the Bible, it will not only be touched but also fulfilled. Perhaps this fulfillment has already begun among us. We now desire to see what these verses mean for us. We are not satisfied or contented with our present practice of the church life, with the general meetings, the general messages, and the general rather than particular perfection. We want to cooperate with the Lord for the fulfillment of His word in Ephesians 4:11-16.</p><h2 class="head2">The Prophets&rsquo; Perfecting</h2>
<p>We must now consider how the prophets perfect the saints. This perfecting is not merely by prophesying in the sense of predicting. In 1 Corinthians 14 the word <em>prophesy</em> is used not mainly in the sense of predicting but rather with the meaning of speaking forth. We have to learn how to speak forth the Lord. Among us there is a great shortage in this matter. We do have certain gifted persons who speak to us, but speaking forth the Lord has not become a custom among us.</p>
<p>When we consider the meetings in mutuality according to 1 Corinthians 14, we usually stress that everyone has to speak in the meetings. However, this chapter stresses the speaking of the prophets in particular. This speaking is not mainly to predict, but it is to speak for God and speak forth God. To prophesy is to minister, to dispense, the Triune God into the audience. Acts 13:1 says, &ldquo;Now there were in Antioch, in the church that was there, prophets and teachers.&rdquo; When we come together for a church meeting, there should be a number of the saints who can speak Christ and speak forth Christ. To speak Christ and speak forth Christ is to dispense Christ into the needy saints that they can be nourished and have the growth in life. This growth is the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Evangelists&rsquo; Perfecting</h2>
<p>If there are some evangelists among us, they must do their duty to perfect the saints. They must stir up the spirit of gospel preaching among the saints. We are all short of the spirit of preaching. We are short of a spirit that is so burning for the gospel. If an evangelist spoke to us, we would be &ldquo;burned&rdquo; by his word. Then he would take the lead to bring others to go out with him to visit people at door after door. He could demonstrate how to talk to people.</p>
<p>An evangelist would also teach the saints the content of the practical and prevailing gospel. We may have heard much concerning God, Christ, Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection, and regeneration. However, we may not know how to present a prevailing and practical ten minute message to people. In the past I did much preaching in North China. After almost every preaching meeting, a number of saints who did not know how to preach the gospel or felt that their preaching was not very prevailing would bring their friends to me. All those dear saints had a heart to preach, but they were not trained, or perfected, in how to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>We need the evangelists to stir up our spirit of preaching and take us with them at least once a week to visit our relatives, neighbors, close friends, classmates, and colleagues. There are many people that we should visit. If we have an evangelist, a proper atmosphere will be brought in and built up among us. He will demonstrate how to talk to people about sin, redemption, Christ, resurrection, and regeneration. After being trained, nearly all the saints will have the spirit of preaching and the way to preach. We need the evangelists to perfect us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Shepherds and Teachers&rsquo; Perfecting</h2>
<p>We also need the shepherds and teachers&rsquo; perfecting. We need the teachers, not merely to teach the Bible, but to teach the saints as shepherds. According to the grammar of Ephesians 4:11, shepherds and teachers are one class of people. We all know that we have to visit people and shepherd them, but we may not know how to shepherd. We need some experienced shepherds and teachers to perfect us.</p>
<p>If we would have these four kinds of gifted persons&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers&mdash;among us for half a year, the church would be different. There is not yet such a situation of perfecting among us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A TESTIMONY OF PERFECTING</h2>
<p>In 1940 I went to Brother Watchman Nee&rsquo;s training. One day when I was walking with him, he said, &ldquo;Brother, we have the blueprint in our hand for the building up of the local church.&rdquo; Brother Nee was building the church according to this blueprint, and I also desired to have this blueprint. For a short while, I observed how he built. After I returned to my hometown and the second world war broke out, we were separated for a number of years. I had to stay in Chefoo because of the invading Japanese army.</p>
<p>From 1940 to 1942, I followed the pattern which I had learned from Brother Nee. I took the lead among the elders in Chefoo to be an elder and to train them, and they all learned from me. Because I was serving full-time, I also took the lead among the deacons and deaconesses to be a deacon to serve the saints. I did the job of an elder, a deacon, an apostle, a prophet, an evangelist, and a shepherd. I took the lead in everything. Every Monday the serving ones, the co-workers, the elders, and the deacons, came together with me from eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning to three-thirty in the afternoon to fellowship, learn, discuss, and be trained in the eldership, the service of the deacons, and in the visiting of different kinds of people for the gospel preaching and the care of the saints. At the end of 1942, a great revival broke forth in Chefoo, not by conferences, preaching, or teaching about revival, but as the result of the building up of the local church. The entire church was revived. Today we are short of such a perfecting work for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SAINTS&rsquo; DIRECT BUILDING<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:12-13, 15-16; 2 Cor. 4:1; 3:8-9; Rom. 5:18b; Jude 3b; Eph. 2:15b; 4:24</h1>
<p>We have seen that God&rsquo;s intention is to give the gifted persons&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers&mdash;to perfect the saints that all the saints may participate in the work of the building up of the Body of Christ. These gifted persons perfect the saints to be what they are. This is similar to the professors in a teachers&rsquo; college who perfect their students to become teachers like they are. A local church may be likened to a teachers&rsquo; college, and the gifted persons are like professors teaching different courses. They perfect the saints to be what they are&mdash;apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers. The gifts&rsquo; perfecting of the saints results in a proper local church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PERFECTED IN THE PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>The New Testament tells us that all the believers are priests (1 Pet. 2:9; Rev. 1:6). In order to help us understand the perfecting of the saints, we need to look at the type of the priesthood in the Old Testament. To serve in the priesthood, a priest had to be of age. When a person was twenty-five, he could be an apprentice in the priesthood (Num. 8:24). This apprenticeship lasted for five years until he was thirty years of age (4:3). Then he was considered a full-grown man and was fully qualified to be a priest.</p>
<p>The priests were perfected to do mainly four things. First, they were perfected to offer the sacrifices (Lev. 6:8&mdash;7:38). They had to learn how to offer the burnt offering, the meal offering, the sin offering, the trespass offering, the peace offering, and the other offerings. They had to learn how to work at the altar. The altar typifies the cross. We must help people to offer Christ as their sacrifices at the cross. We may say that offering the offerings equals preaching the gospel.</p>
<p>Second, the priests also had to learn how to enter into the Holy Place to display the showbread (Lev. 24:5-8; Exo. 25:30). They had to take care of this every day. The showbread signifies Christ as our life supply. As the New Testament priests, we should learn how to display Christ as the showbread to all of God&rsquo;s worshippers. We have to help the saved ones by showing them how to enter into the Holy Place to enjoy Christ as their life supply. That means that we also have to learn how to dispense Christ into people as the life supply.</p>
<p>Third, the priests took care of the lampstand in the Holy Place (Lev. 24:1-4). They trimmed the wicks and filled the lamps with oil to make the lampstand shine brightly. As the New Testament priests, we should do the same thing. We have to learn to be filled with the Spirit as the oil, and we must minister Christ as the divine light with and in the Spirit to the saints. This is to make Christ as the light shine with the Spirit. We have to help the saints to realize and enjoy Christ as their divine light, shining within them with the sevenfold Spirit. To minister such a Christ with the sevenfold Spirit to the saints is to perfect them.</p>
<p>Fourth, the priests had to burn the incense (Exo. 30:6-8). Burning the incense signifies getting into the presence of God and talking to God. We converse with God to enjoy God&rsquo;s presence, the Triune God Himself. As the New Testament priests, we must learn to fellowship with God in prayer, and we must be able to perfect the saints to do the same thing.</p>
<p>The priesthood perfects the saints to present Christ as the offerings, the sacrifices, at the brass altar, the cross. It perfects the saints in ministering Christ as the life supply and in displaying Christ as the shining light, as the lampstand with the seven lamps, the sevenfold Spirit. It also perfects the saints to present Christ to God at the golden incense altar as the all-inclusive incense that they may converse with God. The saints need to be perfected to fellowship with God in a conversational way to enjoy His presence, to enjoy the Triune God Himself. We need to be perfected to take care of these four major items of the priesthood, and we must perfect others to do the same thing. The gifted persons need to perfect the saints in these aspects. All the believers need to learn these four things.</p>
<p>The New Testament uses the word &ldquo;priesthood&rdquo; to refer to the priestly office (Heb. 7:12) and to the priestly body, the corporate body of priests (1 Pet. 2:5, 9). The Old Testament priesthood was a corporate body of priests with the high priest as their head. In the New Testament, we also are the priesthood in the sense of a priestly body. We are not separate, individual priests serving God. We serve God as priests in a corporate way. We believers are a corporate body of priests with the High Priest, Christ, as our Head. Christ as the Head of the church is the High Priest with all His saints as priests to form a priesthood. The corporate priesthood with Christ as the High Priest bearing all the people of God on His shoulders with strength and on His breast with love in the presence of God is the church life (Exo. 28:9-12, 15, 17, 21, 29-30; Heb. 7:24-26). The entire church is on the breast and on the shoulders of the Head of the priesthood.</p>
<p>Such a church life needs four classes of gifted persons&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers&mdash;to perfect all the saints to do the same thing that they do. Can we see such a scene in today&rsquo;s church life? By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we may have a little bit of perfecting work among us in each of the four major aspects typified in the priesthood, but we must admit that we are short of the perfected and perfecting priestly services. We do not have the reality of Ephesians 4:11-16 among us in a definite way. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we are short of the services of the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. This is why I have the burden to do my best to help all the saints in all the local churches realize where we should go. Ephesians 4:13 uses the phrase &ldquo;until we all arrive.&rdquo; Paul included himself and all the serving apostles and gifted ones in saying that we all have to go on to arrive. Our having to arrive indicates that we are traveling on the way. We need to be like the runners in an Olympic race. We have to strive, to struggle, to run the course until we arrive at the goal. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, He has given us a vision of His desire to build up the Body of Christ. The Lord has brought us into His recovery and put us on the course. We are running this course. We are on the way, and we have a goal. The goal is the full expression of Christ on this earth.</p>
<p>We have seen that there is the need for the gifted persons to perfect all the saints. In this chapter we want to go further to see the saints&rsquo; direct building of the Body of Christ. The building up of the Body of Christ is through the gifted persons&rsquo; perfecting of the saints. Then the perfected saints do the direct building of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING WILLING AND READY<br />
TO BE PERFECTED</h2>
<p>The Lord desires all the saints to be perfected (Eph. 4:13), but the Bible shows us that the Lord is calling for overcomers. In the seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the Lord is sounding the trumpet for overcomers. His call for the overcomers indicates that not all the saints will be perfected. Just some of them will be perfected. The ones who are willing to be perfected will be the overcomers. These overcomers will eventually constitute the bride of Christ, and this bride will be the fighting army, following Christ to fight against and defeat the Antichrist (Rev. 19:11-21). According to Revelation 17:14 the army of overcomers that follow the Lamb are &ldquo;called and chosen and faithful.&rdquo; The choosing of the Father in eternity past was for salvation, but the choosing in Revelation 17 at the end of this age is for overcoming. Thank God that we have been chosen by Him in eternity for salvation, but now we are under the test to be approved. If we are faithful to follow the New Testament teaching to run the course, to pass the test to be approved, we will be chosen to be the overcomers who constitute the army and the bride of Christ. The army is formed in Revelation 17. These chosen ones constitute a ready to fight army. Then these ready to fight chosen overcomers will be the bride in Revelation 19 to attend the wedding feast of the Lamb (vv. 7-9). After the marriage feast, Antichrist will fight directly against the descending Christ. Christ will fight him with His bride, who is the chosen army.</p>
<p>I am concerned for some of the saints because they are still not willing or ready to be perfected. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and under the covering of His blood, I would ask you as you are reading this book&mdash;are you willing and ready to be perfected? If you are not willing and ready, you will make yourself a dropout. The door is open for everyone to be perfected. I hope that we all would have a hearing ear to hear the calling of the Lord. Everyone who is contented with the present situation of the church life is not ready to be perfected, to go on with the Lord. This means that they are in the risky situation of becoming a dropout. In these days, I believe that the Lord has given me a vision with a burden for His churches, His recovery. Our present situation is not something with which we should be contented. We should feel sorry for our present situation. The recovery has been in the United States for over twenty-five years. During this period of time, we may have heard many messages, yet our situation is not up to a level with which we can be satisfied. We have to realize that we are far off from the goal. We need to say, &ldquo;Lord, I am ready and willing to be perfected by You. I will take the perfecting word through Your gifted persons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the members of the Body of Christ are parts of the one organism. What a privilege, what a mercy, and what an all-sufficient grace that we are now in the one organism of the Triune God! As living members of this organism, we need the organic perfecting. We need to be perfected to do what the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers do. We have to be perfected so that the entire Body of Christ functions in the same way that the gifted members do.</p>
<p>There is much hope that we can be perfected to do what the gifted members do. In a local church, some can do the apostles&rsquo; work to preach the gospel, teach the truth, establish churches, and appoint elders. The Lord needs many apostles, not just one or two. God&rsquo;s intention is to perfect every saint to do what the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers do. Some saints will do the apostles&rsquo; work. Some will be perfected to do the prophets&rsquo; work to speak God, speak for God, and speak forth God, ministering Christ to all the people. They will be perfected not merely to give a testimony but to give a living word of revelation. Some of the saints who were not evangelists may be perfected to be evangelists. They will be those who are on fire and burdened for the preaching of the gospel. They will have the ability and the knowledge to talk to people about sin, the fall of man, the love of God, the person of Christ, redemption, forgiveness, and regeneration. Then there will be no need for the saints to bring their unbelieving contacts to a gifted person because the saints will have been perfected to do the work of an evangelist. Some of the saints also need to be perfected to shepherd. Today very few of the ones that we baptize are under the proper care because of a lack of shepherding. This is why we lose many of the ones that we baptize. But if the saints are perfected to be shepherds, every baptized one will have a nursing mother (1 Thes. 2:7). Immediately after the new ones are baptized, the saints will pick up the burden to care for them. They will care for the new ones as they would care for newborn babes, nourishing and cherishing them.</p>
<p>The saints in a local church must be perfected to do the same work that the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers do. Because the situation is not like this today, we have to strive and to struggle by fighting. There are many resistances that we have to fight through. We all should pray, &ldquo;Lord, make me willing and ready to be perfected. I will receive the perfection from the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers. I am not content with my present situation.&rdquo; This is my intimate fellowship with you all. I hope that you are willing to accept my fellowship.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SAINTS BEING PERFECTED<br />
BY THE PERFECTING GIFTS<br />
WITH THE LIFE SUPPLY AS THE NOURISHMENT<br />
FOR THE GROWTH IN LIFE</h2>
<p>The saints are perfected by the perfecting gifts with the life supply as the nourishment for the growth in life. Proper mothers feed their babes nourishing food. We have to perfect the saints with some solid food supply that they may be nourished. This food supply actually is the life supply. Christ Himself is not only our life but also our life supply. We have to learn how to minister Christ as life to sinners and then as life supply to the saved ones. We have to help the saints by feeding them with some solid food. I have been learning throughout the years not merely to teach people but to feed people.</p>
<p>The Lord brought me into His ministry in 1932. In 1943 the Lord exercised His sovereignty to put me through many trials. The Lord allowed me to be arrested by the invading Japanese army. I was in their prison for about one month. Twice a day they judged me, tested me, and examined me. Each session lasted about three hours. During these sessions, among other things, they poured water upon me and threatened me. This took place for over twenty days. That was a real suffering, but in that suffering I learned how to trust in the Lord and how to enjoy His presence. One day I was alone in the prison and I said, &ldquo;Lord, You know that I am here just for You.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s presence was so real that I felt He was standing in front of me. I wept before the Lord. What an enjoyment that was! I enjoyed the Lord&rsquo;s presence in prison in a practical, real, and actual way. I also enjoyed the Lord&rsquo;s wisdom. Many times when I was being tested by my captors, the Lord gave instant answers to my prayers. If I had given the wrong answer without wisdom, I could have been executed by the Japanese army. While I was being asked a question, I asked the Lord to either stop the person&rsquo;s questioning or give me the wisdom to answer. The Lord answered my prayers instantly to give me the appropriate answers.</p>
<p>After I was released from prison, I contracted tuberculosis, and the doctors prescribed absolute bed rest for me. I was in bed for twelve months. My family also suffered extreme poverty during the war. They had to spare every cent to care for me in my illness. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I recovered from this serious illness. During this period of recovery, the Lord showed me that my ministry in the previous ten or eleven years had been mostly in teaching based upon the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The Lord assured me that I was not through with His recovery yet, that He would heal me. The Lord charged me to learn to minister life after coming out of this illness, this test. He charged me not to teach people according to what is right or wrong, yes or no, good or evil. I was charged not to minister anything related to the tree of knowledge, but only to minister things based upon and concerning the tree of life. The Lord showed me from the Gospel of John that what He did on this earth was always according to the principle of life. People brought questions to Him concerning good and evil, right and wrong, and yes and no. His answers always brought them to Himself as the tree of life. I gave a message on this subject in Berkeley, California entitled &ldquo;Not Good or Evil but Life&rdquo; (see chapter two of the book <em>Our Urgent Need&mdash;Spirit and Life,</em> published by Living Stream Ministry).</p>
<p>In 1942 there was a big turmoil in the church in Shanghai, and Brother Nee was forced to stop his ministry. I became sick in 1943, and I learned the lesson of the tree of life in the two and a half years that it took me to recover from my illness. In 1946, after recuperating, I went to Shanghai. My ministry in Shanghai was altogether focused on the tree of life. A number of the saints in Shanghai came to ask me who was right and who was wrong. Instead of answering yes or no, I referred them to the way that the Lord Jesus lived and acted in the Gospel of John. In John 8 the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery to the Lord. They asked the Lord, &ldquo;Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such persons. What then do you say?&rdquo; (v. 5). The Lord Jesus did not answer yes or no, according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. He said, &ldquo;He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her&rdquo; (v. 7). He answered in a way that exposed man&rsquo;s real condition in the eyes of God according to the divine light.</p>
<p>We must learn to perfect the saints but not as a Bible teacher. Bible teaching has been going on for centuries with very few of the Lord&rsquo;s children being perfected. What is needed today is the nourishment of Christ. Do not tell people what is right and what is wrong. Even if something is right, that does not mean anything in the sight of God. Only life means something. Only life counts. Let us all learn to perfect the saints not <em>by</em> something but <em>with</em> something. We need to perfect the saints with the solid life supply, the very Christ whom we enjoy. Only this nourishes the saints to perfect them.</p><h2 class="head1">UNTO THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY&mdash;<br />
UNTO THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:12 says that the gifted persons are &ldquo;for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; According to the grammatical construction, the work of the ministry is the building up of the Body of Christ. The perfecting is unto the work of the ministry, which is the building up of the Body of Christ. The word &ldquo;unto&rdquo; in Greek in Ephesians 4:12 means in view of, for the purpose of, resulting in, issuing in. The perfecting of the saints is in view of the work of the ministry, which is the unique ministry in the New Testament. Thousands of believers may be doing a work of a thousand parts, but every part should be for the unique work of the unique ministry to build up the Body of Christ. Paul referred to the building up of the Body of Christ, not to the building up of the church. Paul&rsquo;s stress was not on the building up of the church as a congregation but on the building up of the Body as an organism. The saints are perfected unto the work of the ministry for the building up of the Body of Christ as an organism. The New Testament ministry builds up an organism not an organization.</p>
<p>The British Brethren who were raised up in the early part of the nineteenth century were greatly used by the Lord. In his book <em>The Orthodoxy of the Church,</em> Brother Nee considered that at one time, the Brethren were the fulfillment of the church in Philadelphia, but they became degraded to become what is prefigured by the church in Laodicea. In 1931 the Brethren sent eight representatives to visit us in China. Brother Nee told them that they would be welcome, but he asked them to please not bring with them anything of what they represented. When they came to visit us, however, they caused much trouble among us. After their visit to us, they invited Brother Nee to visit them, so Brother Nee went in 1933. He traveled to France, England, Canada, and the United States to attend the meetings of the Brethren. He returned and told us of the confusion among them. He came back to tell us that we could not go along with the Brethren absolutely. He found out that they could have several churches, or assemblies, in one city. They did not see that in one city, regardless of how big that city is, there should be only one church, one local expression of the Body of Christ (Acts 8:1; 1 Cor. 1:2; Rev. 1:11).</p>
<p>Darby advised all the leading ones of the so-called churches in a certain city to come together once a month. G. H. Lang in his book <em>The Churches of God</em> condemned what Darby did, saying that Darby was trying to make the churches a federation. Lang said that each local church should be autonomous. The concepts of their assemblies either being unified together into a federation or being separately and independently autonomous destroyed the entire testimony that the Lord raised up among the Brethren. Today the Brethren are divided into many divisions. They have been divided over things such as whether to have a piano or an organ in their meetings. The group that favored using a piano decided to start another assembly on another street in the same city. This was an actual case. The divisions among them are mainly due to the teaching of autonomy.</p>
<p>The terms <em>federation</em> and <em>autonomy</em> may be used in the field of politics or government. On the one hand, the states of the United States are autonomous with their state governments, but on the other hand, they are a federation of states under the federal government. The terms <em>federation</em> and <em>autonomy</em> are organizational terms in the political circle. They should not be brought into the realm of the church because the church is not an organization but an organism, the Body of Christ, with one life. The members of my physical body are not independently autonomous, having nothing to do with the other members. There is only one circulation of blood in our physical body, and the members are all organically related to one another. In like manner, all the members of the Body of Christ, the organism of the Triune God, enjoy the same life and are organically related to one another. This one organism comprises all the saints, past and present, and it comprises all the local churches. All the local churches are one Body. How can we say that the local churches are separate and autonomous, when they are one Body?</p>
<p>When we visit another local church, we should not consider ourselves as guests. Wherever we go, we should consider ourselves as members of the Body. For practical matters of hospitality, we may refer to hosts and guests, but in the meetings of the church there are no guests, only members of the Body of Christ. We are the members of the unique, universal Body of Christ. If we go to a place where there is an expression of this Body, we are members of that expression. Suppose a brother from the church in New York is visiting the church in Taipei. Should he have the attitude that because he is a member of the church in New York, he is not a member of the church in Taipei? Would it be right to say that the church in New York and the church in Taipei have nothing to do with one another because they are separate autonomies? This is impossible and it is not practical. The churches are one Body. In his book <em>The Churches of God,</em> G. H. Lang quotes someone who says that each local church is a Body of Christ. If this were true, the Lord Jesus would have thousands of bodies. This concept is terrible! There is one Body of Christ in the universe, and we are members of this Body. All of the saints in the local churches should be one with one another. The Lord prayed for us in John 17 that we would be one.</p>
<p>All the local churches should be one, but this does not mean that they should be unified or federated. We do not agree with any federation. We are not one organizationally. We are one organically because we have the same one life of Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God. The Body of Christ is organic, full of life. We are one in this divine life regardless of where we go. If we go to Japan and meet with the saints there, we are one with them because we are members of the unique, universal Body of Christ.</p>
<p>All the members of the Body of Christ who do the work of the ministry participate in the unique ministry of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy (2 Cor. 4:1; 3:8-9). This unique ministry is the ministry of the Spirit, who gives life (2 Cor. 3:8). The unique ministry of the Old Testament was the ministry of death because that was the ministry of the law which condemns and kills us (2 Cor. 3:7a, 9a). But the unique ministry of the New Testament is altogether a life-giving, organic ministry. This ministry is the ministry of righteousness, which brings in justification unto life (2 Cor. 3:9; Rom. 5:18b). The ministry of the law was the ministry of condemnation unto death, while the ministry of the faith, the New Testament, is the ministry of justification unto life, so it is altogether organic. The work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ is directly by the perfected saints in the growth in life (Eph. 4:15-16). The saints grow up by being nourished, and this growing up is the building up.</p><h2 class="head1">UNTIL WE (THE GIFTED PERSONS<br />
AND THE SAINTS) ALL ARRIVE<br />
AT THE ONENESS OF THE FAITH AND<br />
OF THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE SON OF GOD,<br />
AT A FULL-GROWN AND MATURE MAN,<br />
AT THE MEASURE OF THE STATURE<br />
OF THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The saints are perfected unto the work of the ministry, the building up of the Body of Christ, until we (the gifted persons and the saints) all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. The building up of the Body is a continuous matter. We are under the process of building and we are on the way of building until we arrive at the practical oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Oneness of the Faith and<br />
of the Full Knowledge of the Son of God</h2>
<p>We need to arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God. The faith refers to the full redemptive work of Christ as the object of our believing (Jude 3b). The Old Testament ministry was a ministry of the law, whereas the New Testament ministry is the ministry of the faith. The law was the very center of all the teachings in the Old Testament. When the New Testament came, the faith replaced the law. The entire teaching of the New Testament is centered on the faith. Galatians 3 tells us that the law was there in the Old Testament but faith came (vv. 23-25). Now we are not under the law but in the faith. As the law is the center and reality of the Old Testament, so the faith is the center and reality of the New Testament.</p>
<p>The faith implies the entire teaching of the New Testament. The New Testament record is a record of the full redemptive work of Christ. The New Testament begins with the incarnation of Christ and continues with His death, resurrection, and second coming. His death and resurrection with His second coming issue in the New Jerusalem, which is the ultimate consummation of the church. We believe in Christ&rsquo;s full redemptive work that is recorded in the entire New Testament. This full redemptive work is of Christ as a person.</p>
<p>We need to arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, which is the full knowledge of the person of Christ. The person of Christ is so marvelous and all-inclusive. This person is the embodiment of the Triune God and the perfect, transformed, tripartite man. He is also the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving, sevenfold, indwelling Spirit. He is the reality of every positive thing in the universe. We need to know in full the all-inclusive person of Christ.</p>
<p>When we arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of this all-inclusive person, we will not care for minor things. In Romans 14 Paul was very general in his attitude toward doctrinal matters that did not concern the faith or Christ&rsquo;s all-inclusive person. Things such as whether to observe the Sabbath and whether to eat meat or vegetables did not matter to Paul. As long as a person believed in Christ, Paul recognized him as a brother in Christ and received him. When I was a young Christian, I was so much for the truth of baptism by immersion that it affected the way I received the believers. If a believer was sprinkled instead of being immersed, I did not care that much for him. Baptism by immersion was my first &ldquo;Christian toy.&rdquo; Children like to play with toys. Some Christians receive other believers on the basis of what they believe concerning the Lord&rsquo;s second coming and the rapture. They will not receive those who have a different view than they do regarding the rapture. This is another &ldquo;toy&rdquo; that Christians like. Humanly speaking, an older person does not like to play with toys. Only the children like to play with toys. If we are still playing with minor doctrinal matters and practices other than the faith and the person of Christ, this is a strong sign that we are still babes. A grown-up person does not care for minor things. He only cares for the marvelous, full redemptive work of Christ and the all-inclusive person of Christ.</p>
<p>We have to learn the aspects of Christ&rsquo;s person in His death on the cross and the things that He terminated and took away on the cross. We have to know Christ as the very embodiment of the processed Triune God, the complete God and the perfect, tripartite man. We also have to know how this wonderful One is being dispensed into His chosen and redeemed people for their full salvation and for His glorious expression. His chosen and redeemed ones are regenerated, they are being transformed, and eventually they will be glorified. Matters such as these should occupy us and be the subjects of our talk at home and with the saints. Anything other than these things are toys that divide us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Full-grown and Mature Man</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:13 tells us that we need to arrive at a full-grown and mature man. All of us need to grow up to reach this state. This full-grown and mature man is the church as the new man (Eph. 2:15b; 4:24). We are growing up in full measure through the direct building of all the saints perfected in the growth of life by the gifts. This means that each member&rsquo;s growth is a part of the building. The growth of all the saints equals the building up of the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Measure of the Stature<br />
of the Fullness of Christ</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:13 also says that we need to arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. The measure is the size, and this measure is of the stature. The stature is of the fullness of Christ. The fullness of Christ is the very expression of the Triune God, which is the Body of Christ (1:23). This Body has a stature, and the stature has a measure. We can arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ by the growth in life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING NO LONGER BABYISH<br />
BUT FULLY GROWING UP INTO THE HEAD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:14-16; 1 Cor. 3:1; Eph. 6:24</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE GIFTED PERSONS PERFECTING THE SAINTS<br />
TO DO THE DIRECT BUILDING WORK</h2>
<p>We saw in chapter two that the gifted persons were produced by the Head of the Body in His resurrection. They were once captives in the hand of Satan. Through His death and resurrection, Christ rescued them from Satan&rsquo;s hand. These rescued captives, through the process of Christ&rsquo;s full redemption, have been constituted into persons who are gifts. He brought them with Him in His ascension and presented them as gifts to the Father. The Father returned these gifts to Christ, who then gave them to His Body to perfect the saints for its building up.</p>
<p>We need to realize that the gifted persons do not build up the Body directly. Even the Head of the Body, Christ, does not build up the Body directly. In Matthew 16:18 He said, &ldquo;I will build My church.&rdquo; Yet in the real practice of the building of the church, Christ as the Head of the Body does not do the direct building work. The gifted persons have to perfect the saints. To perfect the saints is to build them up, to equip them, and to furnish them with whatever they need for their work. Then the saints do the direct building work. Neither the Head nor the gifted persons do the direct building work.</p>
<p>The gifted persons perfect the saints to do what they do. The saints are perfected to do the work of the ministry, the ministry that builds up the Body of Christ. The apostles perfect the saints to function as apostles. The work of the prophets is to perfect the saints to speak for God and to speak God into people. To prophesy is to minister Christ, to dispense Christ, into God&rsquo;s chosen and Christ&rsquo;s redeemed people. The evangelists perfect the saints to do what they do in the preaching of the gospel. The shepherds and teachers perfect the saints to shepherd with teaching. When we teach we shepherd, and when we shepherd we teach. Shepherding and teaching should not be separated; they must go together. First Corinthians 12:28 says that God has placed all these gifts in the church. Throughout the centuries of church history, Christ has given such gifts to His church again and again. Even today He is doing the same thing.</p>
<p>If there are some saints meeting together as a local church, there must be some among them who are the Christ-given gifts. Some of them know how to do the apostles&rsquo; work. Some know how to do the work of the prophets. Others know how to do the evangelical work. Still others know how to shepherd and teach. Not only should they function in these areas, but they should also spend their time and energy to perfect the saints. They should be like the professors in a teachers&rsquo; college who produce more teachers, more professors. This should be the situation of a local church. A group of gifted persons who have been given by the Head to the Body should not only do the work themselves but should also perfect others to do what they do.</p>
<p>Acts 13:1 says that there were prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch. The book of Acts also shows us that the apostles continued to go back to the churches after they had established them and had appointed the elders. They visited the churches or communicated with them by writing in order to perfect the saints. Through the perfecting work of the gifted members, all the members are equipped to carry out what the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers do for the building up of the Body of Christ. The Lord has shown us this, and we have to take this as our goal.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ARRIVING AT THE ONENESS OF THE FAITH</h2>
<p>This perfecting work should be going on and on until we all arrive at the three items listed in Ephesians 4:13: the oneness of the faith, a full-grown man, and the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. We need to arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God. The faith comprises the full redemptive work of Christ and the all-inclusive, wonderful person of Christ. This faith is the very contents of the New Testament teaching. The entire New Testament presents us with a picture of the incarnation of Christ through His resurrection, ascension, and second coming, issuing in the consummation of the local churches, the New Jerusalem. This is the faith in which we believe.</p>
<p>Some may say that their belief is Presbyterian, Episcopalian, Catholic, or Baptist. For Christians to have different kinds of beliefs means that they have different faiths. There have also been many councils throughout church history that have resulted in many creeds, or statements of belief. Every creed is a belief, so the many creeds indicate many beliefs. But the New Testament tells us that there is only one faith, the unique faith (Eph. 4:5; Titus 1:4). There is no other faith. A creed is not the faith. Only the reality of the contents of the entire New Testament is the faith. In Galatians Paul tells us that the law was everything in the Old Testament, but in the New Testament the faith has come to replace the law. Today we are not under the law, but we are in the faith, which is the very New Testament reality composed of Christ&rsquo;s work in redemption and His person as the embodiment of the Triune God.</p>
<p>Paul said that the gifted persons are to perfect the saints until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith. Paul said this because even at his time there were other beliefs as substitutions for the unique faith. This is why the gifted persons have to work on the saints by perfecting them until the saints and all the perfecting ones, the gifted persons, arrive through a journey and at a goal. This goal is composed of the three items in Ephesians 4:13. The first of these items is the faith as the very essence and element of the oneness. We all arrive at the oneness of the unique faith composed with Christ&rsquo;s work and person.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING NO LONGER BABYISH<br />
TO ARRIVE AT A FULL-GROWN MAN</h2>
<p>We also have to arrive at a full-grown man. A full-grown man is a mature man. Do you believe that all the members of the church have grown up into a full-grown, mature man? We have been in the church for many years, but in our constitution we may still be babes. If a brother becomes angry at his wife, is this the sign of a full-grown man? This is a sign of being babyish. Even though I am quite old, I do not have much assurance that I am a full-grown man. We have to see what our real state is. Do we live an overcoming life every day? Do we live a victorious life throughout our day? We have to live a revived life every day. Every morning we have to receive a new revival. This is just like the sunrise in God&rsquo;s creation. Each of the three hundred and sixty-five days of the year has a morning, a new start, a new sunrise. We Christians who are seeking after the Lord should live a life in which we have a new revival, a new sunrise, every day. Every day Christ has to be our rising sun.</p>
<p>From the very moment that we rise in the morning, we have to call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; We have to call on the name of the Lord continually and daily. We have to live Christ like the apostle Paul who said, &ldquo;For to me to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21). Paul was a person living nothing but Christ. Are we daily living Christ? Occasionally we live Christ, but often we forget about Christ. This is a sign that we are still babyish. Paul told the Corinthians that he did not give them the solid food for nourishment because they were still babes, infants, in Christ (1 Cor. 3:1-2). This is why we need the apostles&rsquo; perfecting, the prophets&rsquo; perfecting, the evangelists&rsquo; perfecting, and the shepherds&rsquo; and teachers&rsquo; perfecting.</p>
<p>Our daily life and our church life are full of signs that show we are not a full-grown, mature man. We need to consider our real situation in the light of the Lord&rsquo;s word. In Matthew 28 the Lord said that all authority had been given to Him in heaven and on earth, and then He charged us to go and disciple the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Triune God (vv. 18-19). The Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 28 is to us. Are we going to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the Triune God? Some think that because they are not a pastor, preacher, or elder, they have no position or right to baptize people. This thought comes from degraded Christianity. In Acts 8 an Ethiopian eunuch received the truth of the gospel from Philip. As they were going along the road, they came to some water and Philip baptized him (vv. 35-38). According to the Bible, anyone who believes in the Lord should be baptized immediately. Furthermore, the baptisms of the early believers were without regulations and rituals, but they did what was convenient according to where they were.</p>
<p>In John 15 the Lord Jesus told us that He is the vine and we are the branches (v. 5). The branches have to bear fruit. The Lord said, &ldquo;You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain&rdquo; (v. 16). In my earlier years as a Christian, I was seeking a book that could tell me how to abide in Christ. Eventually I discovered a book by Andrew Murray on this subject. I have always appreciated Andrew Murray&rsquo;s books, but all he said concerning how to abide in Christ was that we needed to consecrate ourselves to the Lord. The biography of Hudson Taylor shows us that he had a real experience of abiding in Christ. Seeking Christians today may like to talk about abiding in Christ. We may also talk about enjoying Christ, but I strongly feel that we have not paid full attention to the issue of the enjoyment of Christ by abiding in Him. The issue of our abiding in the vine is fruit-bearing. How can a branch abide in the tree and enjoy the tree&rsquo;s riches without bearing any fruit? We may say that we are enjoying all the riches of the vine tree, but where is the fruit? If we are not bearing fruit, this is a strong sign that we are very babyish.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to the Philippians is very high and rich. In chapter one of this Epistle he talked about magnifying Christ and living Christ (vv. 20-21). But in chapter two, he charged the Philippians to do all things without murmurings and reasonings (v. 14). We have to consider our situation in light of Paul&rsquo;s charge. Between the husbands and the wives, there are murmurings and reasonings. Even in the so-called church life, is there not murmuring, gossiping, and storytelling? As seeking Christians who talk about enjoying Christ and living Christ, do we still gossip and tell stories? Are we the information desk of the church life? If these signs are among us and we say that we are spiritual and grown up, we are self-deceived.</p>
<p>Another sign of our being babyish is that we would talk about another brother behind his back. If we see that a brother is wrong in something, we have to love him, pray for him, and not expose him. We should not tell anyone about his situation. As we pray for him, love him, and cover him, we can seek an opportunity from the Lord to contact him. Galatians 6:1 says that if a brother is overtaken in some offense, we who are spiritual should recover him in a meek spirit. We should not go to this fallen brother to rebuke or condemn him. We should not contact him like a lawyer or a policeman to imprison him. We have to love him, cover him, pray for him, and recover him in a meek spirit.</p>
<p>If you are wrong or if you wrong me, I should not tell anyone. I should immediately have a loving heart to cover you. I should not even let my wife know. I should pray for you and follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading to come to you. This is according to Matthew 18. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;If your brother sins, go, reprove him between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother&rdquo; (v. 15). We need to exercise a meek spirit to fellowship with a fallen brother and do the best to recover him. Our practice in our church life, however, may be just the opposite of this. We may gossip behind others&rsquo; backs. This is a sign that we are still babyish. May the Lord have mercy upon us.</p>
<p>I have to be honest and faithful to the Lord by speaking the truth to present the real situation among us. We all have to admit that we need to live a victorious life. We must mean business to live Christ without gossiping, murmuring, or reasoning. We need to live Christ until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. What a goal this is!</p><h2 class="head1">NO LONGER BABES TOSSED BY WAVES</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:14 continues with the result of our reaching this goal: &ldquo;That we may be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.&rdquo; Paul used the phrase &ldquo;that we may be,&rdquo; indicating that he included himself. Even Paul himself had the possibility of being a babe. How can we be so confident that we are no longer babes? If we are tossed by waves, this is a sign that we are babes. A babe is unsteady and easily shaken. &ldquo;Tossed by waves&rdquo; indicates that the church life with all the saints is sailing on the stormy sea. Every sea has waves and storms. The church is sailing like a boat on the sea, and the sea has many storms. I have been in the church life for over fifty years, and I was with Brother Nee for eighteen years. Throughout these years in all the places that I have been, I have seen storm after storm.</p>
<p>When I began to see these storms, I had some doubts about the work. Among all the churches that have been raised up through my ministry there were always storms. Then I realized that according to Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, there were not any good churches. If the churches were as good as we imagine, Paul would not have needed to write his Epistles to them. His Epistles were written to churches with problems. When I was young, I heard someone say that the church in Philippi was the best church. The first chapter of Philippians talks about the bountiful supply of the Spirit for magnifying and living Christ. But in the second chapter Paul charges them to do all things without murmurings and reasonings. This shows that among the Philippians there were murmurings and reasonings. When I considered the situation among the churches recorded in the New Testament, I was comforted. Even among the churches that Paul raised up, there were problems and storms. I could not expect to do better than he did. No sea can avoid the storms. We are sailing on the sea. At one time the weather may be fine. Suddenly a storm, a problem, arises. When a storm comes, would you be tossed by the waves? If you would, this is a strong indication that you are babyish.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CARRIED ABOUT BY EVERY WIND OF TEACHING</h2>
<p>The stormy sea is stirred up by the wind. The goal of the wind is to carry us away from God&rsquo;s central purpose. Paul says that we can be carried about by winds of different teachings. In 1 Timothy 1:3 Paul told Timothy to remain in Ephesus and charge certain ones not to teach differently. By that time, Ephesus was an established church with elders. This can be proven by Acts 20 which tells us that Paul sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church there (v. 17). Paul&rsquo;s calling for the elders and his fellowship with them proves that once the elders had been established, the apostle still had the position to charge them to do things. Paul charged, warned, and advised them to shepherd the flock because wolves would come in among them (vv. 28-30). Later he asked his co-worker, a young apostle, to remain in Ephesus where elders had already been established, to charge certain ones not to teach differently. First Timothy 1:3 and 4 indicate that these teachings were different from God&rsquo;s economy. To teach anything other than God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to teach differently. Paul would not allow different teachings to be taught within the limit of his work. He would not allow anything to be taught that was different from God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>Three major categories of heretical things invaded the early church to distract the saints from God&rsquo;s economy: Judaism, Gnosticism, and Greek philosophy. These three major items are dealt with in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles. In Galatians, Judaism was dealt with. In Colossians, Paul deals with Gnosticism and Greek philosophy. These three items were troubling the saints and distracting them from God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, which centers on Christ and His Body, the church. Today there are many different teachings distracting the believers. The winds of different teachings are teachings that deviate from the all-inclusive person and the full redemptive work of Christ and from the church. Any teaching that would cause us to deviate from Christ&rsquo;s redemption and His wonderful person and from the church should be considered as a teaching different from God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>These different teachings are in the sleight of men. &ldquo;Sleight&rdquo; indicates a deceiving method. The word in Greek signifies the cheating of dice players. The different teachings are used by the evil one, Satan, through man&rsquo;s deceiving method. These teachings are in the deceiving doctrines instigated by Satan in his subtlety with the sleight of men to frustrate God&rsquo;s eternal purpose to build up the Body of Christ in the growth of life. We need to check whether what we hear is making us alive to grow in life or deadening us. Anything that makes us alive to grow in life is organic and is something of God. Anything we hear or read that deadens our spirit is something satanic in the sleight of men to carry us away so that God&rsquo;s eternal purpose to build up the Body of Christ is frustrated.</p>
<p>These winds of teaching are also in craftiness with a view to a system of error. &ldquo;Sleight&rdquo; is a deceiving method. &ldquo;Craftiness&rdquo; is a subtle activity. The different teachings are of a system of error. We may feel that these teachings happen only occasionally, but in actuality they take place according to a satanic system. Satan has systematized the crafty, dividing teachings, causing errors that damage the practical oneness of the Body life.</p><h2 class="head1">DESTRUCTIVE OPINIONS</h2>
<p>In addition to the many different teachings, there are also the different opinions from those who claim that they love the Lord and love the church. They do not realize how much damage their opinions have done to the church. This does not mean that we Christians should not have any opinion. In 1 Corinthians 7 Paul said that he had no commandment of the Lord, but he gave his opinion (v. 25). It is permissible to express our opinion, but we have to consider what the result of our opinion will be. The result of Paul&rsquo;s opinion in 1 Corinthians 7 was the edification of the saints and the building up of the church. Paul was one with the Lord in giving his opinion (v. 40). Does our opinion build up or destroy? Is it a constructive opinion or a destructive opinion? If it is destructive, we should be careful. We will stand before the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10). It is a serious thing to damage the church or any saint in the churches. When we talk about other saints, is this constructive or destructive? Romans 14 reveals that the destruction of God&rsquo;s work comes from opinion (vv. 15, 20). We may behave in a destructive way because we hold a destructive opinion.</p>
<p>Whenever we hear something, we have to check whether what we hear is building us up or destroying us. Is it making us alive or deadening us? Whether or not you accept someone&rsquo;s word should depend on this principle. We will preserve ourselves from being destroyed if we check whether someone&rsquo;s teaching or talk kills us, deadens us, or makes us alive.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FULLY GROWING UP INTO THE HEAD</h2>
<p>Despite our situation of being babyish, we can be those who are fully growing up into our Head, Christ (Eph. 4:15). All of us believers are persons in Christ, but to what extent are we in Christ? To enter deeper into Christ, we need to grow into Him. Ephesians 4:15 says that we have to grow up into Him in all things, that is, in every aspect of our daily life. What is it to grow into Christ? To grow into Christ is to let Christ grow in us. When He grows, we get into Him more.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Making His Home in Our Hearts</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 3, Paul bowed his knees to the Father that the Father would grant us to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man (vv. 14-16). The result of being strengthened into our inner man is Christ making His home in our hearts (v. 17). Our heart is composed of all the parts of our soul&mdash;mind, emotion, and will&mdash;plus our conscience, the main part of our spirit. Christ is in us, but He is not settled in us. He is in our spirit, but around our spirit there are the main rooms of the heart&mdash;the mind, emotion, and will. Christ is in you, but He may not be in your mind, emotion, or will. This is why we have to grow into Him, and to grow into Him is to let Him spread. We have to let Christ spread from our spirit to our mind, emotion, and will so that He can take over, possess, and occupy our heart.</p>
<p>When a person moves into a new house, he needs to get settled down there. If this person only occupies the living room and every other room in the house is locked, he is not yet settled down in his house. Is this the condition of Christ in us? Does Christ have the freedom in our mind to think everything with us and for us? Does Christ have the way to occupy our emotion? Does Christ have the liberty to take over our will? If He did, He would be able to do whatever He likes in us and with us. Do we choose things by ourselves apart from the Lord? Christ may be limited, restricted, and even imprisoned within us. If there is no spreading or increase of Christ within us, how can we grow in Christ? To grow in Christ is to gain more of Christ. The more of Christ that we have within us, the more we grow into Him.</p>
<p>Christ needs to make His home in our hearts in all the practical aspects of our daily life so that we can grow up into Him in all things. Shopping is a real temptation to all of us. Some of us may like to read the newspaper to see what is on sale. We may like to spend our money apart from Christ on unnecessary things. When we are considering to go shopping, is Christ in our mind, emotion, and will? If Christ were in our mind, emotion, and will, we might not even go shopping for the things that we were considering to buy. In our shopping, have we grown into Christ?</p>
<p>When a husband exchanges words with his wife, he does not care for Christ. If he were to let Christ into his emotion, he would not be angry with his wife and argue with her. We need to allow Christ to take over our feeling in our emotion, our thinking in our mind, and our deciding in our will. When Christ takes over the three major rooms around our spirit&mdash;the mind, the emotion, and the will&mdash;He is spreading in us and we are growing into Him. We need to grow into Christ in the way that we talk to our wives. We need to be willing to let Christ take over and occupy our inward parts, our mind, emotion, and will. This is the way to grow into Christ.</p>
<p>Someone in the church life may have offended us, and we may want to talk about this person to someone else. But at this juncture the very Christ who is living in our spirit desires earnestly to get into our mind, to control our thinking. When we open our heart to the Lord, He may say, &ldquo;Do not think this way. Even if he wronged you, he is your dear brother. You should pray for him.&rdquo; When someone offends us, we may struggle with the Lord. We may agree with the Lord not to talk about him, but we still may want to forget about him. The Lord will remind us, however, that this is not the character of a Christian. A Christian is one who loves his enemies and prays for those who persecute him (Matt. 5:44). If we are to love our enemies and pray for them, what about this dear brother who offended us? Sometimes the Lord will say that this brother only did something wrong in our eyes; then He will show us that we were more wrong than he was. If we do not cooperate with the Lord in this matter to allow Him to make His home in our hearts, we are not growing into Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Holding to Truth in Love</h2>
<p>We can grow up into Christ by holding to truth. Holding to truth is in contrast to being carried about by the winds of teaching in sleight and craftiness. We may be easily shaken, moved, tossed, and carried away because we would not hold to truth. Truth denotes the true things, referring to Christ and His Body. Only Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, and the church, the organism of the Triune God, are the true things on this earth. Everything else is vanity. We should hold on to and care only for Christ and the church. If we only hold on to Christ and the church, nothing will be able to shake us. We will be steady in Christ, on Christ, and with Christ. We will be steady in the church and with the church. We will not be tossed or carried about by any storm or wind.</p>
<p>We hold to truth in love, the love of God, with which we love the Lord in incorruption (Eph. 6:24). Our natural love is vain. Only one kind of love is true&mdash;the divine love. With this divine love, we love the Lord in incorruption. We can love the Lord in incorruption by holding on to Christ and the church. Only Christ and the church are incorruptible. To love God in anything other than Christ and the church is to love Him in corruption. We should love God with His divine love in Christ and the church. The love that will remain is the love in incorruption, the love in Christ and the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Growing Up into the Head, Christ,<br />
in All Things</h2>
<p>To grow up is to have Christ increase in us with the nourishment, the life supply (Eph. 4:16). We cannot help the saints merely by teaching them. Rebuking or condemning does not help them either. To give Christ the way to increase in the saints, we must feed them with Christ by ministering Christ, imparting Christ, dispensing Christ, to them. When we receive the supply within, Christ increases in us. The increase of Christ in us transforms us. It changes our mind, emotion, and will. As Christ increases in us, we are transformed by growing up into Him.</p>
<p>To grow up into Him in all things means that we grow up into Him in every way and in every aspect of our daily walk. If we would let Christ take over our mind, emotion, will, and conscience to get Himself settled down in all of our inward parts, we will grow into the Head, Christ, in everything and in every aspect. To grow into the Head is to grow into Christ by subjecting ourselves to Him as the Head. When we are not letting Christ increase in us, we are not taking Him as our Head by subjecting ourselves to Him. To grow into Christ is to subject ourselves under the headship of the Head of the Body, Christ. Then we are absolutely under the direction of the indwelling Christ, and Christ has the full freedom to get Himself settled down in our whole being. He has the way to make His home deep down in our being. By this way we can grow into Christ in everything.</p>
<p>Our growing is the real building up of the Body of Christ as an organism. As parts of this organism, we need to give Christ the way to grow in us. The entire organism of the Triune God is built up by all of us living in a way so that Christ can increase Himself in every part of our being. The building up of the Body of Christ is not by organizing. How is the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God built up? The Head gives the gifts, the gifts perfect the saints, and the saints grow in life. Their growth in life is the direct building up of the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BODY OF CHRIST<br />
BUILDING UP ITSELF IN LOVE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:15-16</h1>
<p>In this chapter we want to see that the Body of Christ builds up itself in love. We pointed out in chapter one that Ephesians 4:11-16 is the most crucial passage in Paul&rsquo;s writings related to the building up of the Body of Christ. Verse 16 of Ephesians 4 is the greatest verse in the book of Ephesians. Throughout the centuries of church history, this verse has been missed, neglected, and even put aside. It is very hard for the human mind to apprehend the points which are covered in this verse.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THE BODY</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:15 and 16 say, &ldquo;But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; Does &ldquo;all the Body&rdquo; refer to the local church or to the universal church? The church has two aspects. It is both local and universal. But in our understanding of Ephesians 4:16, we need to forget about these two aspects. When we are in the new heaven and the new earth as the New Jerusalem, there will not be any consideration about the local or universal aspects of the church. The New Jerusalem is simply the church, the Body of Christ. With the New Jerusalem, the consideration about the local and universal aspects of the church is over. We need a foretaste of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>When the apostle Paul wrote Ephesians 4:16, he did not have the local or universal aspects of the church in mind. What was in his consideration was simply the Body of Christ. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 12:28 that &ldquo;God has placed some in the church: firstly apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.&rdquo; Is this the local church or the universal church? In this verse Paul is not considering the local or universal aspects of the church. In 1 Corinthians 12 the church is considered the Body of Christ. In Ephesians 4:16 &ldquo;all the Body&rdquo; includes Peter, James, John, Paul, Barnabas, Ignatius, Martin Luther, and all of us. All of God&rsquo;s chosen and redeemed ones in the past, in the present, and in the future are referred to by Paul when he says &ldquo;all the Body.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">PERFECTED INTO ONE IN THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>In John 14&mdash;16 the Lord Jesus revealed that His Body is constituted with the very essence of the Triune God. Then in John 17 He prayed that the believers would be perfected into one (v. 23) so that the church revealed in chapters fourteen through sixteen could be realized. In chapter fourteen the church is signified by the Father&rsquo;s house. In verse 2 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;In My Father&rsquo;s house are many abodes.&rdquo; The Father&rsquo;s house in this verse is not the supposed heavenly mansion. The Father&rsquo;s house is today&rsquo;s church (1 Tim. 3:15). In the Father&rsquo;s house there are many abodes, many members. The many abodes are the many members of the Body of Christ. Every member is an abode. The Father&rsquo;s house is constituted with the essence of the Triune God. In chapter fifteen is the vine tree with all its branches. This vine tree is the organism of the Triune God. The vine and the branches are an organism to glorify the Father by expressing the riches of the divine life. In chapter sixteen is the newborn child. This is a corporate child comprising the Son of God in His humanity as the Head and all the chosen and redeemed ones as the Body. According to Acts 13:33 and 1 Peter 1:3 this child was born in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God in His humanity was born in resurrection. That birth included all of God&rsquo;s chosen and Christ&rsquo;s redeemed ones. After the Lord unveiled the Father&rsquo;s house, the vine tree with the branches, and the newborn child, He prayed for all of us to be one. For the house of the Father, for the vine tree with all its branches, and for the newborn child, there is the need of oneness.</p>
<p>In John 17:21-23, the Lord Jesus prayed, &ldquo;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us...that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one.&rdquo; The oneness needs to be perfected in the Triune God. We need to be perfected in the Father, in the Son, and in the Spirit so that we can be one. We may declare or even sing that we are all in one accord, but is there the one accord among us today in the recovery? Practically speaking, where is the one accord? In February of 1986 I gave messages on the one accord to the elders, but today there is disaccord among us. When I spoke these messages, I did not have the expectation that all the saints in the recovery could be in one accord. During that time, I said that I was like Gideon sounding the trumpet for some to fight with me just like Gideon and his men fought the war for all of Israel. It is not easy to have the one accord. To be in one accord we need to be worked into the very essence of the Triune God.</p>
<p>In the entire universe, on the earth and in the heavens, there is no one accord, no oneness. This is because in God&rsquo;s creation there was a rebellion. First there was a rebellion by the angels led by Lucifer, and this rebellion was contagious. The angelic rebellion was infused into mankind, so the entire universe became a universe of disaccord. The peoples of the earth may try to be united, but disaccord prevails. History tells us that the leaders of this earth tried unsuccessfully to form the League of Nations. Later the United Nations was established. But the fact remains that the nations of this earth are not united but divided. War and disaccord prevail on this earth.</p>
<p>Our natural blood is a blood that can never be united. As long as we are natural, as long as we are in the old man, as long as we are in ourselves, as long as we are in our blood, there is no one accord. The one accord is in Jesus, who is the very embodiment of the Triune God. The Lord&rsquo;s prayer in John 17 reveals that there is oneness only in the Triune God. It is impossible for us to be one in ourselves. There is no capacity for oneness in our natural man. Even in our family life, there cannot be oneness in our natural man. Oneness is in the Triune God. Only the Triune God is one. He is Three, yet He is One. Oneness is in Him.</p>
<p>The little word &ldquo;in&rdquo; is actually a very big word in John 14&mdash;17. In John 14 the Lord Jesus said that He is in the Father and that the Father is in Him (v. 10). In verse 3 of this chapter He said, &ldquo;I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, that where I am you also may be.&rdquo; The Lord is in the Father, and He wanted His disciples also to be in the Father as is revealed in John 17:21. Through His death and resurrection, He brought His disciples into Himself. Since He is in the Father, they are also in the Father by being in Him. Hence, where He is, the disciples are also. In John 14 the Lord also revealed that in resurrection the Spirit of reality would be in us (v. 17). In verse 20 He said that in the day of resurrection the disciples would know &ldquo;that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; Our salvation is in the Triune God. Outside the Triune God, there is no salvation. Redemption, holiness, and every positive thing are in the Triune God. We need to be perfected into one in the Triune God.</p>
<p>According to Paul&rsquo;s writing in Ephesians 4, we have to arrive at the oneness. The Head of the Body gives the gifts&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers&mdash;to perfect the saints, to equip the saints, to furnish the saints, to supply the saints, and to support the saints with whatever they need that they may do the same things that the gifted persons do. When there is this kind of perfecting, the church is on the track to arrive at the oneness. As long as the saints are not being perfected by the gifted persons, we are not on the way to arrive at the oneness. The perfecting by the gifts has to be continuously going on until we all arrive at the oneness.</p>
<p>How can we be one? We all need to be perfected. In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed to the Father that we would be perfected into one in the Triune God, that we would be one as the Triune God is one. Paul told us that the Head gave the gifts to perfect the saints until we all arrive at the oneness. The Lord Jesus and the apostle Paul spoke the same thing. The saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are not on the way to arriving at the oneness because we are in a situation and condition of needing to be perfected. We need to be perfected so that we may be on the way of arriving at the oneness. For the Father&rsquo;s house in John 14, for the vine tree with the branches in John 15, and for the newborn child in John 16, there is the need of oneness. The Lord prayed for the oneness in John 17, and the apostle Paul aspired to have the oneness in Ephesians 4. Paul instructs us, teaches us, that there is the need of the perfecting of the saints so that all of us may be on the way of arriving at this oneness.</p><h2 class="head1">PERFECTING THE SAINTS BY FEEDING THEM<br />
ACCORDING TO THE TREE OF LIFE</h2>
<p>In the perfecting by the gifts, all the saints need to grow. The main thing in perfecting the saints is to nourish them. Mothers raise their children not just by teaching them but by feeding them. While the mothers are feeding their children, they may also teach them. If the children do not listen to their mother, the mother may tell them that she will not let them eat. If they behave, they can eat. If they do not behave, they do not get to eat. Feeding is the best way to train people. If we are the gifts&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers&mdash;we must learn how to perfect the saints by feeding them. The hungry saints need to be nourished with Christ as their life supply. Whenever I give a message, I pray and look to the Lord that I can have something to feed the saints. The saints are happy when they have something to eat. The best way to perfect the saints is to feed them that they may grow. In Ephesians 4:13 Paul mentions a full-grown man. In verse 15 he says that we need to grow up into Christ in all things. Then in verse 16 he says that all the Body causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love. Paul emphasized our need to grow.</p>
<p>When we feed the saints, our ministry is according to the tree of life. What we share with the saints should not be in the realm of good or evil, right or wrong, yes or no. This is in the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, a symbol of God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan. We just want to feed the saints. We do not care for what is right or what is wrong. The Lord did not send me to the United States to condemn people, to judge people, or to tell people who or what is right or wrong. He sent me to this country to present Him. In all the years that I have ministered in the United States, I have presented Christ to the saints. Let us all forget about who is right or who is wrong, about what is right or what is wrong. We need to forget about the past and go on together with the Lord and in the Lord according to the tree of life.</p>
<p>Because we are so closely related to one another in the church life, there is always friction among the saints. Love always creates problems. Because a husband and wife are close to one another, there are times of friction between them. Because we have been together in the church life for many years, there is also friction among us. This is why we need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and His sufficient grace. We should not care for who is right or who is wrong. I always make mistakes. Many times I feel that I am the totality of mistakes. My wife sees the mistakes that I make more often than anyone else. The husbands are frequently corrected by their wives. This is because the wives see all the mistakes that their husbands make. Actually, all of us are mistaken people. In the church life we have to take Christ as our person to forgive one another. We should not care for who is right or who is wrong. We should only care for life. Our living and our ministry must be according to the tree of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUT FROM WHOM (THE HEAD) ALL THE BODY</h2>
<p>First, all the saints have to grow up into the Head in all things. Then out from the Head, the whole Body issues the life supply to all the members for the building up of the Body. Sooner or later, all God&rsquo;s chosen ones, God&rsquo;s redeemed ones, will arrive at the point where they all have grown up into the Head in all things. In this growth the life supply is dispensed to all the members for the building up of the Body. I have learned the secret of dispensing Christ as the life supply to the saints. I am still trying to learn more; then I can afford even more life supply. I do not have the burden to give the saints more teaching, more knowledge, and more biblical interpretations. My burden is to dispense more of Christ as the life supply. I hope that we can all take care of dispensing Christ as the life supply and forget about right or wrong, good or evil, yes or no. Let us forget about good or evil, right or wrong, and yes or no, and only care for Christ as our life and our life supply.</p>
<p>With the Head as the source, all the Body issues the life supply to all the members for the building up of the Body. When a member of our physical body gets hurt, the rest of our body supports that wounded part with the life supply. In the Body of Christ, we should do the same thing. If a member of the Body is weakened or hurt, we should not talk about this member, criticize him, or condemn him. We should support that wounded member with the life supply. For us to dispense the life supply to the needy members depends upon how much we have grown up into the Head. The life supply that we dispense to others depends upon how much of the life supply that we ourselves have received from the Head. If I do not receive the supply from the Head, how can I have anything with which to support the other members? We have to grow up into Him in all things so that we may receive the life supply. Then we will have the life supply to dispense to others and to support others with.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING JOINED CLOSELY TOGETHER<br />
AND BEING KNIT TOGETHER</h2>
<p>The members of the Body need to be joined closely together and knit together. We are joined closely together by the joints, and we are knit together by each one part. In our physical body we have two classes of members&mdash;the joints and all the parts. It is the same with the Body of Christ. For the joints of the Body, there is the need of joining. For the parts of the Body, there is the need of knitting. In a physical building of stones, there is also the joining and the knitting. The frames of the building need to be joined closely together. The knitting is the interweaving of the stones. The stones of the building are put together by being interwoven. The joints of the Body of Christ are joined closely together, and all the parts of the Body are interwoven together. We have to be rescued from the thought that we can be individualistic and separated. There is not such a thing in the New Testament.</p>
<p>For the joints to be joined closely together is for them to be articulated and fitted closely together in harmony. The joints of our physical body should be articulated and fitted closely together in harmony. If they are not, our physical body will be in pain. Some in the church are the joints. The Bible tells us that brothers such as Peter, James, and John were the pillars of the church (Gal. 2:9), the joints. The joints should be articulated in harmony. Then there is the possibility of the building up. If the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers are not one, how can the Body be built up? The joints must be joined closely together in harmony. Then the Body can act.</p>
<p>There is also the need for each one part of the Body to be knit together, which is to be compacted together solidly through the growth in life. To be knit together is to be interwoven to become one entity. Every piece of stone in a stone building has been interwoven together, knit together, by being compacted together in a solid way. In the Body of Christ, we are being knit together, being compacted together solidly, through the growth in life. If certain members of the Body need healing, this healing will take place by the growth in life. The more that we rebuke others, condemn others, reason with others, or argue with others, the more wounds there are. The best way to turn from our rebuking, condemning, reasoning, and arguing is to call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; We need to forget about right or wrong, good or evil, and yes or no and come back to &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; If we come together to call on the name of the Lord, we will enjoy the tree of life and stay away from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Calling on the name of the Lord to enjoy Christ as our life supply issues in the growth in life. The joining and the knitting come from the growth in life. We must learn to serve the saints with some nourishment with which they may grow.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THROUGH EVERY JOINT OF THE RICH SUPPLY<br />
AND THROUGH THE OPERATION<br />
IN MEASURE OF EACH ONE PART</h2>
<p>The Body is fitted and knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part. Through every joint of the rich supply means through every gifted person, as listed in Ephesians 4:11. This rich supply is the particular life supply of Christ. For the joining of the joints and for the knitting of each one part, we need to minister, to dispense, the rich supply to all the joints and to each one part. By this rich supply of Christ, all the members of the Body will get the nourishment with which they will grow in life. The joining and the knitting come through the growth in life.</p>
<p>The knitting together is through the operation in measure of each one part, that is, through the operation in measure of every member of the Body of Christ. The joints are the gifted persons, and each one part refers to every member of the Body of Christ. Every member has a function, so every member has a measure. In our measure, we have to operate, to function, to move, and to act in our spiritual life. The real knitting of all the members comes from the operation of each one part in his measure. We need to meet according to what is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26 so that each one part may be perfected and developed in his function. The way to meet in Christianity can only build up a congregation. It cannot build up the Body by all the members exercising their function in their measure.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CAUSING THE GROWTH OF THE BODY<br />
UNTO THE BUILDING UP OF ITSELF</h2>
<p>Through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part, all the Body, joined closely together and knit together, will cause the growth of the Body. All the Body causes the growth of the Body. This is also true with our physical body. If our physical body takes in the proper nourishment and functions in a healthy way, it will cause our body to grow in life. This will result in the building up of our body. A mother feeds her child, but she cannot cause her child to have the growth. The child&rsquo;s mouth takes in the food, and his stomach digests the food. Then the food is assimilated by his body, and this causes the growth. The child&rsquo;s body causes itself to grow. In like manner, the Body of Christ causes the growth of itself for the building up of itself.</p>
<p>We have pointed out that in Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I will build My church.&rdquo; Some may think that because the Lord Jesus said this, there is no need of anyone else to build the church. But we need to realize that the Lord Jesus does not build the church directly. He builds His Body through the gifts given by Him as the Head. The gifts build the Body by their nourishment, their perfecting, of all the members. Then all the nourished members, the perfected members, build the Body directly. There are three levels of building: the Head&rsquo;s building is to give the gifts, the gifts&rsquo; building is to perfect the saints, and then the perfected saints build the Body directly, thus causing the Body to grow. Because our situation does not match this revelation, we cannot be content.</p>
<p>I returned to Taipei in October of 1984 because I realized that we needed a change in our practice of the church life so that it could match what is revealed in the Scriptures. During the three and a half years that I was in Taiwan beginning in 1984, I gave many messages on the Triune God and on Christ. I also studied our situation in the recovery with a view that we could be brought into the scriptural way of meeting and serving for the building up of the Body of Christ. What I can release of what I have seen depends upon how much the saints can receive. What kind of food we serve a person depends upon the situation of his health. The patients in a hospital have different diets according to their situation. I cannot serve the saints with certain food if their condition is not healthy.</p>
<p>In the winter training of 1987 in Irving, Texas, I told the saints that we have to take the scriptural way gradually and positively (see chapter twenty-nine of <em>The Scriptural Way to Meet and to Serve for the Building Up of the Body of Christ</em>). Gradually and positively, the Lord will work out His desire. He will perfect His church to serve, to act, to enjoy Him, and to meet together absolutely according to the Scripture. We need to meet according to what is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26 for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN LOVE&mdash;IN THE DIVINE LOVE,<br />
WITH WHICH GOD AND CHRIST LOVE US</h2>
<p>The Body builds up itself in love. This is the divine love, with which God and Christ love us. We love God and Christ in return with the divine love. We love the Lord with the very love with which He loves us. With this love we also love one another. All the members of the Body should love one another with the divine love. In the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus was very concerned for the oneness and for our loving one another. In John 13:34 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.&rdquo; In John 15 the Lord reveals that the branches need to love one another to express the divine life in fruit-bearing (vv. 12-17). We must be one in the Triune God and we must love one another with the divine love for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p></body></html>
