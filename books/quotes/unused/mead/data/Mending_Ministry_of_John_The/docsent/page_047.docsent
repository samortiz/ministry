   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN THE WRITINGS OF PAUL AND JOHN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Both Paul and John speak of the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us compare what they say.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul tells us, "Christ in you, the hope of glory" Col 1:27 ; "it pleased God to reveal His Son in me" Gal 1:15-16 ; and "it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me" Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul surely revealed the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>John, however, speaks of the indwelling in a more vital way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To say that Christ lives in us is to speak in a general, vague way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To say, as John does, that Christ is the vine and that we are the branches, that we are to abide in Him and have Him abide in us, is to speak in a specific, particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul could make the declaration, "To me to live is Christ" Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But in John 15 we can see that to live Christ is simply to be a branch abiding in the vine; what the branch expresses is spontaneously the life of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul said, "I can do all things in Him Who empowers me" Phil 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is indeed a marvelous statement, but it is too general for us to really understand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The explanation again comes from John 15, where we are told, "Abide in Me and I in you" v. 4 because "apart from Me you can do nothing" v. 5 . How can we do all things in the One who empowers us? It is by abiding in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we are apart from Him we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It seems that Paul is stating the fact positively, while in John 15 it is stated negatively.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Actually, what John 15 says about abiding is more positive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is by abiding in Him that we can do all things in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In reality it is not we who are doing, but the One in whom we are abiding and who abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As He lives out of us, He does all things through us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we see how these two ministries go along with each other, the one completing and the other mending and strengthening what was damaged, we have a good foundation for understanding the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE TWO MINISTRIES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The New Testament is a full revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This Christ is presented to us in two stages: one on earth and the second in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament only four besides a half chapter in Acts deal with Christ on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then He ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Have you been saved by the heavenly Christ, or by the earthly Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our Redeemer is the heavenly Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Are you still living in the Gospels, or can you say that you are at least in Paul's Epistles?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I trust we can all say that we are enjoying the indwelling Christ, the hope of glory; that we are experiencing Him as the all-inclusive One; and that we are in the church, the Body, the new man, the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I hope also that some of us can say that we are in John's ministry; that we are part of the lampstand; and that we are on our way to the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ's earthly ministry lasted only three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His heavenly ministry is eternal; it has already been going on for close to two thousand years and there will be no end.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is common in fundamental Christian circles to speak of the finished work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They use John 19:30, where Christ said "It is finished," to prove that Christ has completed the work He came to do.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because all has been accomplished, He is now seated on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To sit down is an indication that the work is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such a teaching indicates a lack of understanding of the two ministries of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In His earthly ministry Christ fully accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He has redeemed us, taken away our sins, and destroyed Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In His all-inclusive crucifixion He terminated sin, sins, self, the flesh, the old man, the world, Satan, and Satan's kingdom of darkness all the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Through His death His eternal life was released.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nonetheless, God's eternal purpose is not fulfilled merely by redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Redemption is part of a process.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When Christ's earthly ministry was over, the church still had not come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now in His heavenly ministry Christ is actively engaged in producing, building, and maturing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What a great work is this!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Redemption was accomplished within thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church, though, has taken two thousand years to prepare.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even in eternity Christ will still be ministering in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This, the ultimate consummation of the church, still needs His supply.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Throughout eternity He will be ministering the life supply to all God's redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Twenty-three books of the New Testament deal with Christ's heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From them we can see that Christ is busily working in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is interceding.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is carrying on His priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is administrating God's universal government.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This heavenly ministry is fully revealed by the writings of Paul and John.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Paul's ministry was to complete the revelation of Christ's heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>John's ministry was to mend and strengthen that damaged revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Without their writings we would not have any idea of what Christ is doing in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>JOHN'S MINISTRY MORE PROFOUND THAN PAUL'S</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Paul opened a number of heavenly windows to us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He opened one in Romans, another in Galatians, and a big one in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We need to do some heavenly window shopping to enjoy what all these windows show us of Christ's ministry in the heavens!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we come to John's writings, however, it is not windows which he opens to us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The whole expanse of the heavens is opened!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The windows are gone!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There are no more walls!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Consider how strong is the mending work that John does.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Paul was caught up to the third heaven 2 Cor 12:2 , but whether he saw the New Jerusalem or not, he did not tell us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>John, however, surely saw it.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>John not only opened the heavens to us; he showed us the New Jerusalem as well!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the previous messages we have covered John's mending ministry as found in his Gospel and his Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the next few messages we shall consider the mending work of John in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In this last book there are three great repairs to the damage done to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The first is the unveiling of the churches as the lampstands, as found in Revelation 1 to 3.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>A lampstand cannot easily be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The second is the presentation of a clear view of God's administration of the whole universe, found in Revelation 4 to 20.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We need not be disturbed by daily events, however alarming they seem.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>From John's mending ministry we know that the Lord is the Ruler of kings; all earthly affairs are under His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The third repair is the vision of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>How strong is this mending!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Nothing can damage the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We are not only backed by Paul's completing ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We are also enjoying John's mending ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>How strongly he mended the damage done to the church after the time of Paul!</S>
