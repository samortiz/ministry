Chapters 2 and 3 were spoken to the co-workers and concern the ground of the church and the principle of the work
Chapters 4 through 8 contain words of fellowship given to those responsible for the meetings of the church in Taipei
For two thousand years, since the passing of the apostles, the church has not been clear concerning this matter
The Roman Catholic Church and the various Protestant denominations have deviated in this matter from the teaching of the Bible
If we carefully study the teaching in the New Testament, we can see two aspects of the church-the universal aspect and the local aspect
A husband should have only one wife; hence, the fact that the church is the bride of Christ speaks forth her uniqueness
There is only one church in the universe, the universal church, which is the bride of Christ, the Body of Christ
She was expressed in Jerusalem over nineteen hundred years ago and in many places throughout Europe over fifteen hundred years ago
In the universal church there are numerous local churches, because there is a local church in every locality in which there are believers
The church in Hong Kong, the church in Manila, and the church in Taipei along with all of the other local churches are the universal church
In a narrow sense, according to the biblical revelation these workers are those sent by the Lord; that is, they are apostles
If this were the case, there would still be thirteen apostles, because Barnabas was considered to be an apostle
Acts 14:4 clearly uses the term apostles when speaking of Barnabas and Paul; hence, Barnabas also was an apostle
On the one hand, apostles are weighty people in the church; on the other hand, they are not a special group of people
An apostle is a person who is called by God and sent by Him to preach the gospel, save sinners, and establish and edify churches
Workers in a narrow sense refers to those who are sent out by God, that is, the apostles, as spoken of in the Bible
When we speak of workers, we are referring to apostles, those sent by God to preach the gospel and establish churches
On one hand, there are no apostles in the local church; on the other hand, the Bible says that God has placed apostles in the church
If we read the New Testament carefully, we can tell whether a church was composed mostly of Jewish believers or Gentile believers
By reading Acts we can see that Peter and John, as apostles in the Jewish region, established churches in that region
They established the church in Jerusalem, and through the laying on of hands, they established the church in Samaria
When an apostle is raised up, it means that this apostle has been sent to establish churches locality by locality
The church in Jerusalem did not control the church in Samaria, nor did the church in Samaria control the church in Jerusalem
The church in Manila should not control the church in Iloilo, nor should the church in Iloilo control the church in Manila
Although the church in Manila is much bigger than the church in Iloilo, the two churches are both equally subject to Christ the Head
If a local church is established and edified by a certain group of workers, it should recognize the spiritual authority of these workers
These apostles, or workers, have spiritual authority in relation to the churches that they establish and edify
Although there is a work that involves the co-workers going out to labor, there is no such thing as the work being an organization
We should never forget that when we speak of the work, we are not referring to an organization but to the work itself
One day he may sense that the Lord is calling him and sending him to Zamboanga to preach the gospel and establish a church there
After a period of time they may establish the church in Zamboanga with over one thousand saints meeting together
Since there are no headquarters or organization of the work, we have no financial control and no financial center
At the same time, every brother and sister in the church in Manila also has absolute liberty to give material supply to any local church
They do not need to ask the elders or the workers for permission, nor should anyone interfere or intervene in regard to their giving
No local church is responsible for their support, nor is there an organization of the work that is responsible for their support
They may not even know the names of the co-workers; hence, they may designate an offering only as being for the work
For this situation, we can take a simple way; that is, we can put money in an envelope and designate it for the work
These co-workers will not keep the money for their own use; rather, they will distribute it to the workers according to the need in the work
Even though a decision was made, if the church never gives the work anything, it still does not owe anything to the work
Individual saints can supply the local churches, and the local churches can supply individual believers who are in need
Individual saints, the churches, and the workers in every place can take care of other workers and the propagation work in other places
There is no authority or restriction as in an organization; everyone has absolute freedom to live before the Lord
Perhaps we may have had only one thousand yuan but the money circulated to the point that it was as if we had twenty or thirty thousand yuan
When they saw brothers and sisters in need, they can give them some money as well as send a portion to co-workers overseas
When the overseas co-workers received the offering, they might not feel that it was needed because the Lord has already given them enough
The money given by the ten saints was one thousand yuan, and when the local church received this amount, it was recorded in the account book
When a portion of it was sent out, three hundred was recorded in each of the account books of the three co-workers
Eventually, after repeated recordings, the total of all the recordings would be twenty or thirty thousand yuan
For this reason, when we were in mainland China, there was no way to calculate how much material supply we actually received
We have written to the responsible brothers in the church in Hong Kong and also want to have thorough fellowship with all of you
He considers that the work of many groups among students is too superficial, lacks a foundation, and does not bear a strong testimony
He feels that if we were able to raise up a 'students' fellowship' among the college students, it could bear a strong testimony for the Lord
When he speaks of raising up a students' fellowship, he is seeking our support in contacting and gaining students
He feels that if the saints in the local church do not join in this work, it cannot be carried out in a solid way
He said that the burden and commission he senses is to work among the college students in alliance with Christians in general
When we say this word, we are cautious and fearful, because we deeply sense that in uttering such a word, we may seem to be proud
Because we have this feeling, for the past thirty years we have been in fear and trembling lest we neglect God's intention
For this reason, although there are many things that other people like to do and have the boldness to do, we dare not do them
On our part, we should never care simply for doing things properly, while ignoring whether or not God even desires these things
Regarding this kind of action, we inwardly disagree and cannot praise these so-called alliances and cooperation
We feel that what we are doing is not only for ourselves but for all Christians, for the entire Body of Christ
We dare not say that we are able to do such a thing, but we truly feel that this burden is upon us, constraining us to carry it out
Whether or not we can accomplish this matter depends upon God's mercy to us and whether we are faithful to Him
It is difficult for us to trust the works and activities of Christianity as well as the organization of its groups
The history of Christianity and the existing practices in Christianity cause us to lose faith in this kind of alliance
Under His sovereignty, He can use many saints who have a ground that is different from ours to do a good work for Him
The Lord is so great that even Nebuchadnezzar, a king of Babylon who greatly opposed Him, was His servant and was used by Him
Almost all the work and activity of Christianity and its organized groups are directly or indirectly connected to other matters
What we pay attention to is the intention in God's heart, that is, the church-not only in its universal aspect but also in its local aspect
There are many works activities and organizations in Christianity that we cannot participate in because we need to maintain a high standard
After speaking with me, he also had a long talk with a brother co-working among us who has recently returned from the United States
In their view, Catholicism should be forsaken and isolated, but Protestantism should not be forsaken or isolated
In terms of principle, just as we do not want to have any part in Catholicism, we also do not want to have any part in Protestantism
Today people in Protestantism do not want and will not have a part in Catholicism, but they blame us for not having a part in Protestantism
The reason they do not participate in or unite with Catholicism is the very reason that we do not participate in or unite with Protestantism
My words caused this brother to speak many inaccurate things, using the same condemning words spoken concerning us by Western missionaries
One day His people were taken captive to Babylon and lost the ground of God's people, that is, the ground of Jerusalem
Although the children of Israel were taken captive to Babylon and lost the proper ground, it did not mean that they were no longer Jews
They were taken captive and lost the ground of God's people, but they did not lose their status as God's people
To say that the Jews in Babylon were not God's people would be immature, and those who believe in this kind of speaking are too naive
Since we are already Gods people it does not matter whether we are in Babylon or in Jerusalem all that matters is that we live before God
Our desire was to help this brother see that even if someone is as spiritual as Daniel, he still may have a problem in regard to the ground
Some people have said, 'Those who have returned to Jerusalem, that is, to the ground of the church, are not that spiritual or strong'
Although the condition of Daniel was good, we cannot say that the ground he stood on was right or that he should have stood there
Many people throughout the years have said that he was very spiritual; nevertheless, he was still in organized Christianity
Madame Guyon had a strong and influential role in the church, but we must acknowledge that she did not stand on the ground of the church
It can be said that his spiritual condition was very proper, but the ground of the church on which he stood was absolutely wrong
If he goes anywhere else whether to a place where he feeds hogs and eats carob pods or to a grand and luxurious palace it is the wrong place
In the case of the children of Israel, it was not a question of whether they were God's people but of where they were
Hardly anyone who has stood up to speak for God has genuinely asked this one question on God's behalf: 'Where are you'?
Since the Lord has been merciful to us and led us into His recovery, we should always focus on this central question: 'Where are we'?
Throughout the ages God has recovered much but there is still one matter that has yet to be recovered that is the matter of Where are you
Sadly until today those who are saved by God focus only on what they are but they neglect or even greatly oppose the matter of the ground
Although what we have encountered and heard may cause us to feel troubled, we cannot let ourselves be easily shaken
The reason people have an inaccurate impression is that Martin Luther emphasized the main point that God was recovering through him
Regarding the negative reactions to the matter of the ground of the church, we should have some understanding and be watchful
If the believers all kept the ground of locality, the many denominations that exist today would no longer exist or be produced
If his intention is to establish a students' fellowship, he is intentionally seeking a kind of self-expression
If he saw the ground of the church, he would not dare to establish a students' fellowship apart from such a ground
A believer who has truly seen the ground and is willing to be restricted by this ground would never dare to do such a thing
If another comes and breaks bread with us, while openly or secretly doing another kind of work among us, we cannot agree with that
You may come to break bread with us; nevertheless, if you come here to work and teach differently than we do, we will not agree'
He is similar to most believers who care only for the building of the universal church and not for the building of the local church
The work they do certainly results in some amount of building, but at the same time, their work also tears down
If one cares only for the work, he must admit that even the Catholic Church has done a considerable amount of work
The practice of today's Christianity is to take care of spreading the Lord's work, while it tears down His testimony
In contrast, it would be wonderful if Christian workers were willing to carry out their work while taking care of the Lord's testimony
Sadly, those who commend us for our spread condemn the factor of our spread, that is, the ground of the church
Although they appreciate our achievement in regard to the spread, they attempt to tear down the factor of our spread
The results we have today are all due to our stressing the ground of the church and not yielding or compromising regarding this matter
He did not stop at the recovery of the truth concerning resurrection; rather, He advanced to recover the ground of the church
The Lord has come to the East to recover the ground of the church in order to uphold the items of gold, silver, and precious stone
None of the apostles labored directly on the universal church, even though the result of their work was for the universal church
As long as we are in our physical body, we will have no way to touch the universal church; however, we can touch the local churches
The order the sequence of the Lords work of creation is wonderful and we believe that the order of His work of recovery is also wonderful
The reality of abiding in Christ is related to the Lord's death on the cross and is followed by the resurrection of Christ
We accept all the gifts that God has given throughout the past two thousand years, but we reject anything improper related to these gifts
Similarly, we receive the matter of fellowshipping with the Lord by abiding in Him, which was recovered through Andrew Murray
In the same way, we do not receive a ground that is only halfway, a ground that stops in the middle, and does not fully arrive at Jerusalem
Not only do we reject the ground of organized Christianity; we also reject any ground that has not fully come back to the local ground
Even today there is no servant of God whose spiritual level exceeds hers; nevertheless, she was in the Catholic Church
If some want to take the ground of spirituality, they should go to the Catholic Church and fellowship with her
We want the spiritual things from Madame Guyon, but we refuse to take her ground, the ground of the Catholic Church
We accept everything that is right and proper which has been recovered throughout the past two thousand years, regardless from whom it came
Penn-Lewis could measure Andrew Murray, who was before her, in regard to identification with Christ's death, which was recovered through her
Austin-Sparks, who came after her, because the Lord advanced further to recover the matter of resurrection through Brother Sparks
The ground of the church does not determine whether Christ is large or small, nor does it determine whether the church is large or small
The matter at issue is this: If you claim that you are the church, you should return to the ground of the church
We have come into contact with some people in the West who exceed us in regard to their spirituality, gifts, and abilities
Why is it that people drink our 'tea,' appreciate it, and then, when they have the opportunity, attempt to break our 'teapot'?
Of course, their realization is correct, but conversely we also need to tell them that they should never abandon any truth
We have no choice but to disregard the feeling of others, even if it hurts their feelings, in order to speak this truth
The Lord Jesus preached the word whether or not people understood it, listened to it, were happy about it, or accepted it
In the same principle, the more people misunderstand the truth, the more we should speak it clearly and strongly
The truth concerning the ground of the church strongly corrects the various situations within Christianity today
We deeply sense that this truth advances God's work while greatly restricting the move carried out by man's naturalness and flesh
He has carried out a considerable amount of work even in the Catholic Church, whose ground is full of fornication and idolatry
When we read the history of the Catholic Church, we see that a great deal of God's work has been carried out by it
It would not be considered a matter of control for someone to have said Brothers since we are Gods people we should return to Jerusalem
Some people have a conscience enlightened to the extent that they dare not and cannot do a work on a different ground
As an illustration, when a person comes to another's house for a meal, he may not dare to eat the food after seeing the mess in the kitchen
We do not want to control; rather, each one should live before the Lord with a pure conscience according to the light that he has received
If a person has the heart to seek oneness, we should ask him to forsake this kind of rude speaking and arrogant attitude
When some from Jerusalem went to Antioch to teach different things, Paul and Barnabas went up to Jerusalem to solve the problem
After listening to this word of fellowship, the brothers and sisters should realize that this matter is not simple
If a person were to walk into Brother Nee's room, he would see books lying everywhere and not in an orderly manner
Today the great blessing he has left us with is that we accept everything that is proper, regardless of the sect from which it came
Throughout the past two thousand years, only those people under the leading of Brother Nee have accepted everything proper
We are not proud, but it is the fact that all the good matters of the past two thousand years can be found among us
From the human perspective no one can limit others as to how they practice as long as there is a basis for it in the Scriptures
Austin-Sparks can be in the heavens while preaching, but when he hears the saints praying with one voice, he can no longer be in the heavens
As long as he has something of value, we will receive it from him, including from those whom we condemn very much
If we have this kind of attitude, we must ask, 'Did not the Bible become fully recognized through the Catholic Church?
Because of this we are able to select the best things, while making it very difficult for the erroneous things to come in
It seemed that although the teaching in the Bible required 'one meter,' his requirement was 'one meter plus three centimeters'
Brother Sparks claimed that the biblical teaching was for a brother to wear his hat only after he steps outside the meeting hall
If Brother Sparks were objective, he would have confessed, 'Perhaps this is our custom and my personal feeling
On the podium one morning, Brother Sparks said that we have made Christ a small Christ and the church a small church
We questioned him in a serious way, saying, 'The prophet Daniel and Madame Guyon were very spiritual, but where were they'?
In the past thirty years we have learned a serious lesson, that is, to have strict judgment concerning matters
We do not speak about a matter unless we are clear; hence, once we speak about a matter, we must be certain that there is no error
According to the record in the Old Testament, the work that the enemy does, as shown in typology, is to tear down the wall of the holy city
Otherwise, when people are on fire for the Lord, they will love the Lord fervently while at the same time burn down His building
Her friend came back from America, and after some transaction with this sister, she decided to donate the money to a certain denomination
Even though he has been delivered from certain things on the negative side, there has been no building on the positive side
He also indicated that he is not able to have complete and thorough fellowship with us due to the matter of the local ground
Concerning the matter of fulfilling God's purpose, much of what the Catholic Church has done is in the nature of destroying and tearing down
Although the purpose of his work is not to help any Christian organization, there are too many considerations that cause us to hesitate
In the New Testament God set up only one church in each locality as a practical representation and expression of His universal church
On the one hand, he needs to choose the proper group, and on the other hand, he needs to consider whether the work is constructive
It is not only a question of whether or not we should participate, but whether or not the work is constructive or destructive
Not only do we need to see Gods eternal purpose but we also need to see Gods purpose in this age that is what God wants to accomplish today
On the negative side, we need to know the part of Christianity that is constructive and the part that is destructive
Whether or not we should be involved in a certain work depends on our person and then on our burden and attitude
There may be a constructive aspect, but if the destructive aspect is even greater, we must make the choice cautiously
As the brother teaching at the National Taiwan University indicated, he has a problem related to the ground of the church
Practically, God desires to have a group of Christians in every locality as a corporate expression of the Body of Christ and as His house
In this light, are we able to affirm that the many Christian groups in the different localities are such an expression?
Since we cannot affirm that these Christian groups are such an expression, is it possible to have such an expression?
We should not think that this is impossible to achieve, simply because Christianity is in a state of great confusion
These seven 'ones' are one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father
If this person also invited different ones from the Catholic Church to preach at Luther's place, how could they have preached?
If someone on his side had been invited to preach in the Catholic Church, could that person have justified the Catholic Church?
They did not confirm or strengthen the Jewish way of worship; rather, they urged the Jews to come out of the synagogues
The brother claimed that when the apostles went to the Jewish synagogues, they preached only Christ and not the ground of the church
The New Testament tells us clearly that the apostles gathered them together and established them as the church in their locality
We mostly preach the Lord Jesus as Savior, as Christ, as the Head, as the Lord of all, and as the all-inclusive One
The Brethren think that if a person does not leave the denominations and remains connected to them, he is a 'companion of evil'
The Brethren also think that whoever holds a different view in regard to the truth is 'heretical' and cannot be received
We open the Lord's table to all genuine believers; whoever is saved by believing in the Lord can partake of this table
If someone wants to have mutual participation with us in a matter related to the work, we must first consider his person
Since his attitude is such, when we calmly consider the matter, we realize that we cannot participate with him in his work
If this brother feels that he should work in other groups, this is a personal matter, and we leave it to him to decide
If the work of a group of Christians was only constructive and not destructive, we would still encourage them in their work
We do not want to speak of others' faults, but according to what we know, the background of every group can become a problem in the work
If we had wanted to speak of others' faults, we would have told him a long time ago about the mistakes of that group
He cooperated with the Japanese military police to form a Christian organization that demanded that all Christian groups join it
Many of the terms they adopt at present have been used by us in the recent years, and they were not formerly found in the Chinese language
Today it may seem that we always speak concerning the ground, and it may also seem that we are speaking of something abstract
Some people may agree with us on many matters and want to labor with us; however, they may not want the ground
Austin-Sparks wrote us a letter of praise, saying that we have a condition and situation that cannot be found even in Honor Oak
We fight for the ground so that the church of God as the Body of Christ and the house of God can be expressed practically
If the saints come to the prayer meeting and sense that it is plain and boring, this kind of situation is not acceptable
As to its nature, the Body is universal, but as to its expression in definite places on the earth, it is local
According to the New Testament, there is only one church in the universe, yet it is expressed on earth in different localities
The church cannot have more than one expression in a big locality, or less than one expression in a small locality
In Acts 21:20 James and all the elders told Paul, 'You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed'
Although the believers met in many different homes, they were not divided into many churches; rather, they were still one church
Although the Bible says that they met in many homes, it does not say that these homes were different churches within Jerusalem
In this way, Christ will be able to express Himself in their locality, and they will become a miniature expression of Christ
Much more, Romans speaks concerning how we sinners are constituted into the Body of Christ, which is expressed as local churches
Chapter 8 speaks of believers having the law of the Spirit of life, which enables them to live not by their self and flesh but by the spirit
Chapter 12 says that once a believer has been saved, he becomes a member of the Body of Christ and should practice the Body life
At the same time, we need to avoid developing any troubling hindrances but should learn to coordinate and function together with the saints
The entire Christian living is a living in the Body, and the entire Christian service is a service carried out in the Body
In a larger local church, however, it is more difficult to provide brothers and sisters with the opportunity and environment
In a large local church, such as the church in Taipei, there are so many brothers and sisters who love and pursue the Lord
Generally speaking however only a few brothers and sisters fulfill their functions because the administration of the church has fallen short
Without proper administration, the church in a big locality will lose the Lord's presence and enter into confusion
In order to maintain a local church in proper order and keep it on the right course, there is an undeniable need for proper administration
The Bible shows that there must be elders and deacons in a church in order for it to have an orderly and systematic administration
All of them love the Lord and carry out the administration of the church in fear and trembling according to the Lord's Word
We have been considering this matter for a period of four to five years, and we dare not make a decision quickly
Only recently have we begun to realize where the problem lies; that is, the size of the district meetings is too big
According to spiritual principle, the administration should also give the brothers and sisters some guidelines
In the Bible large local churches, such as the church in Jerusalem, met in different homes, which served as district meetings
Our problem is not that we fail to practice according to the biblical principle but that our district meetings have become too large
We need to see that the church of God on the earth is a matter of expression and that it cannot be separated from human community
It is impossible for all the saints of God to be one church in respect to time, space, and church administration
Every city forms a place where people gather and reside, and it is the boundary of the local church, as ordained in the Bible
The principle of the district meetings is according to the truth; nevertheless, we must have the Spirit while carrying out the truth
As a result they will rise up to follow the way of the truth by meeting together and raising up a local church in that place
For this, we need to go before the Lord to pray and ask the Lord to put such a fervent burden in every brother and sister
Not every home needs to be opened to become the base of a smaller meeting nor is every saint able to be a responsible one in a small meeting
In this way we can arrive at the point where at least seventy to eighty percent of the saints attend the meetings
We do not want a great deal of administration; rather, we would like to give the brothers and sisters more freedom
The church must be one universally, and the church must also be one within a given locality, however small it may be
On the one hand, He wants every member to function, and on the other hand, He wants the church to maintain its oneness and not be divided
If God's Word were to say that it was right to divide the church into many, it would not be difficult for everyone to function
If he moves to a big city, a place as populated as Taipei, it is not as easy to keep the oneness and not divide
We are heavy in heart these days because even though the church is large, it cannot be divided and everyone needs to function
In the church there are seven to eight thousand brothers and sisters, among whom one thousand five hundred to two thousand meet regularly
It is truly difficult for every one of these two thousand saints to function and maintain the church's nature of oneness
The more district meetings there are, the more difficult it is for the elders and those responsible for the districts
Let us suppose that a certain brother who is responsible for a district meeting used to be an elder in a small local church
There is a great difference between being a responsible one in a district meeting in a large church and being an elder in a small church
Those in the state churches believed that there should be only one church and that the church should have organization and various ranks
Since they considered each congregation as an independent unit, they naturally believed that there could be many churches in one locality
Regardless of the size of a locality, according to the revelation in the Bible, there can be only one church within a locality
Two families may love one another, and if there is no relationship in organization or responsibility between them, they will live peacefully
If, however, they both live in a big house with all kinds of relatives, there will be many troubles due to their living together
For the elders of the church in Taipei to be in so many different districts in a large church, they absolutely need to be spiritual
They may want people to obey their arrangement in everything; thus, they will need to manage and direct everything
If the elders are not spiritual and focus only on arrangement and management, a hierarchy will surely be produced
If they have not learned the lessons well or adequately, the result will be either confusion or rigidity in the church
In the same principle, the more that district meetings are produced, the more the responsible ones need to be spiritual
If they are not spiritual, the following will result: First, the responsible ones may not fulfill their duty and function
In other words, whether or not there are problems depends entirely upon whether the responsible ones are spiritual
The elders will not have problems if they are spiritual, nor will the responsible ones in the districts have problems if they are spiritual
The condition of Christianity today is that there is no oneness and that the members do not have the opportunity to function
Although they contact one another, they do not interfere with others' administration, and they even boast that they never have disputes
Most people in Christianity do not need to serve because they have turned the service over to a small number of people
Consequently, most people have stopped fulfilling their obligations and charge a few to bear all the responsibilities
Although there is a need to break up into smaller district meetings, there is also the need to keep the oneness
If either the oneness or the functioning is damaged, the church will suffer loss, and God will not be able to obtain what He desires
Once we are short of the Spirit and life, even if a system, arrangement, or method is good, the result is still a corpse, not a living body
In regard to responsibility, we should pay much attention to procedure, but in another sense, we should focus altogether on the Spirit
If you pray to the Lord and sense a burden to preach the gospel to your friends and relatives, who will prohibit you?
If you contact the Lord in the morning and sense that you should go to visit some newly saved brothers and sisters, who will condemn you?
If you pray something in the prayer meeting from your spirit that touches everyone's spirit, will they not say Amen?
If you are led in the fellowship meeting to rise up and give a testimony, and the brothers and sisters are all supplied, who will oppose?
Once we have preached the gospel and saved a number of people, there should be a procedure for handing them over to the church
If we have not been asked to bear responsibility in a district meeting, we should not appoint ourselves as a responsible one
We should not consider that everything is a matter of procedure and that whatever the arrangement is, we should simply follow
The bigger a local church is the more difficult the lessons are however the more difficult the lessons the more valuable they are to learn
One day there will be a testimony in the universe of several thousand people functioning yet still maintaining the oneness of the church
There is no problem on God's side; rather, our future testimony depends entirely upon how many of us are determined to learn
We should all be willing to rise up to learn so that we can carry out our function while maintaining the oneness of the church
Most people, especially medical doctors, readily admit the fact that the best example of oneness is our physical body
If there is something lacking in the oneness of our body, we sense it immediately and are hindered in our movement
Similarly, if something is wrong with the oneness in the Body of Christ, the whole Body is hindered in its movement
When we serve together on the ground of oneness, not only do we need to be one in our condition, but even more we need to express the Body
When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, only twelve disciples were with Him, and they had quite a number of arguments and disputes
If we desire not to fight but to become one in the Body one basic issue needs to be resolved that is every one of us needs the Lords dealing
Being dealt with in this regard is not to be dealt with in regard to defects or mistakes but in regard to our person
One day we may need to go to the place where we meet, and one brother may suggest that in order to save time we should hire a taxi
He said to me, 'Brother, we have risen up to serve the Lord because we have seen the light concerning the church
At that time we were willing to serve the Lord on a pure and clean ground; thus, we found a small place and began to meet there
Later, a senior co-worker rendered help to me; he said, 'Not only is that brother who closed the door fleshly; you too are fleshly
Surely such speaking will satisfy our self and vindicate that our view is higher and our suggestions are better
Regardless of whether we preach the gospel first or endeavor to edify the saints first, He will continue to be our Savior
If we preach the gospel now, He is the Savior, and if we preach the gospel two weeks later, He will still be the Savior
Please remember that it is only when we coordinate together to serve, not when we merely unite together, that we are the Body
If 'I' is here, there is no way to have the Body, and if the life of 'I' is here, the life of the Body is absent
Besides this, we are all brothers and sisters, and there is nothing worth arguing about in regard to our service
In order for a locality to experience the Lord's presence and God's blessing, it must manifest the Body in that locality
If Christians gather together and do not receive the dealing of the cross, there cannot be the reality of the church among them
We should not listen to or speak about this matter as a doctrine; rather, we should experience it day by day in our living
They may have an opinion concerning the way we should read the Bible or concerning how we pray, whether we should pray loudly or quietly
It is a pity that whenever we touch the things of the Lord, we tend to insist that others be the same as we are
If this is the case, we might condemn them for being mystics and say that they are taking the way of Madame Guyon
Often when we are serving with others, we may observe them in order to see what kind of temperament and personality they have
If we serve together in this way, our problems will cease to exist, and in all our serving we will be filled with the Lord's presence
Such considerations are important in the political arena and in secular society, but there is no such thing in the church of God
Every one of us-whether we are an elder, a deacon, or a brother or sister in a district meeting-should take the cross
We need only to share with them that the secret of the church life is to have no I no self that is to live under the killing of the cross
The basic matters that they encountered and the things that happened to them are very similar to what we face in serving the Lord today
The children of Israel did not arrive at their destination immediately after leaving Egypt; rather, to leave Egypt was only the beginning
To carry out the practice of meeting in the districts, the basic requirement is the presence of the Holy Spirit
Although there is a basis for meeting in this way, we should not have merely an outward practice without having the Holy Spirit within
Because the church in Jerusalem had the Holy Spirit inwardly, they could practice meeting from house to house outwardly
It would be dangerous and worrisome to have only an outward practice of meeting from house to house and not have the Holy Spirit inwardly
All the principles and examples given to us in the Bible must be coordinated with the inward leading of the Holy Spirit
The brothers and sisters love the Lord, are willing to receive the Lord's commission, and have a heart to serve the Lord
With regard to this, we need to see clearly that the sufficient power or supply does not come from us; rather, we need the Holy Spirit
The grace that we have received in the past is not sufficient for us to continue to lead the saints in the service
At this juncture all the saints responsible for the districts must have specific prayers asking the Lord to quench their thirst
If a person has a spirit and a soul, his body can be useful; however, without a spirit and a soul, his body would become a terrible thing
Similarly, when we serve in the coordination of the Body, we must have the Spirit and be strengthened in our spirit
If there is no Spirit but only arrangements for the elders and responsible ones, these arrangements will be similar to a corpse
We do not agree with those who are super spiritual, neither do we agree with those who emphasize only outward methods
Moses had to strike the rock in order for the rock to be cleft and for the living water to flow out to quench the people's thirst
Rather, we should pray that the Lord would enable us to see the part of our being that is the rock and the part that is the living water
In our prayer we must see one way and one goal; the one way is the way of striking the rock, and the one goal is to be broken
It is wonderful that immediately after the children of Israel drank the living water, they fought against Amalek
Joshua fought the battle with a group of chosen men, who were under his command; this was one part of the coordination
Without the support of the brothers and sisters, the responsible ones in a district will not be able to do a good job
Often they may pray for the church to the extent that their hands become heavy, and they become exhausted and are unable to stand in prayer
On the one hand, those responsible in the districts need the support of those responsible in the smaller groups
If those responsible in the groups merely look on as disinterested bystanders, it will be as if they are Amalek
We must see that serving in the Lord's presence is altogether a matter of coordination; it is not a worldly movement
In our serving, it is not proper for us to do absolutely nothing until the responsible ones make a decision or give instructions
In my experience of learning to serve during the past twenty to thirty years, there have never been any problems among the co-workers
In regard to our practice, some of us may be part of a group of responsible ones, who meet in a certain district
When everything is made clear after passing through multiple layers of instructions, he can then break bread with us
We need to have a life of testimony and a life in resurrection; such a testimony will cause us to have sweet fellowship with others
It does not matter whether or not we are called a 'responsible one'; we still need to live in the spiritual reality
If a brother feels that he has full authority to make decisions without caring for the elders, he is being fleshly
If the elders' attitude is, 'How could you receive people and let them take the Lord's table without our approval'?
Concerning the receiving of new ones, the elders should be full of joy and lay their hands on them to bless them in spirit
When we introduce new ones, we should not follow the way of business corporations that have a set of outward procedures but no Spirit within
Bringing the new ones to know the elders and asking them to fill out an information card is not a dead method or regulation
We must find a suitable time to introduce the new ones to the elders so that the elders can introduce them to all the brothers and sisters
We must always have a view that regulations should be hated but that doing things without restraint should also be condemned
We should know that when Moses lifted up his hands in prayer, it was Aaron's support that enabled Moses' hands to be steady
In this way we will experience the Lord's overwhelming blessing, and every meeting will be full of His presence
We are not building up the church for ourselves, and we should not feel that this church or that church is ours
Meeting in the districts has a very important purpose; that is, it enables the saints to take part in the service
From our experience we know that if a person lives in the presence of God, his condition in the meetings will be living
Even though this is not the only indication of a person's condition before the Lord, a living Christian will be active in the meetings
The record in Acts reveals the initial condition of the church and from it we have gained much light concerning the activities of the saints
Because of the desolation of the church the activities of the church fell into the hands of a small number who were given clerical authority
Not only the Catholic mass but also Protestant worship services are conducted by clergy, such as priests, pastors, and ministers
These ones do everything, whereas the majority of the saints do not have any responsibility or function in the meetings
In other words, the saints attend services, listen to sermons, and watch others and thus become completely passive
The larger a meeting is, the more afraid the saints are to release their spirit because their spirit is more likely to be suppressed
If the saints are divided into smaller meetings in the districts, they will be able to release their spirit easily
They formerly did not have the opportunity, but after becoming responsible ones, they seize every opportunity to be active in the meetings
The normal condition is for us to come to the meetings to pray, fellowship, read the Bible, use our gifts, and break bread
The responsible ones should not do everything for the saints; rather, every brother and sister should be active
When we help the saints in the meetings, we should not correct or criticize too much; rather, we should lead, instruct, and explain
After a period of time has passed, we can again remind and encourage the brothers and sisters to exercise their spirit in the meetings
They should function but not in the place of others, and whenever they function, they should incite others to also function
Another situation involves the responsible ones assuming that they have to be active because the saints are not active
The responsible ones should be wise in a meeting, knowing when and how to act appropriately, even kindling the fire in others
When some people pray, they open up the prayer for others to follow, whereas when other people pray, they close the door to others
We saw that in order to have a gift-exercising meeting, we must pay attention to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
When a meeting has fallen into a deadened and downward situation, it means that there are no gifts and no way to use the gifts
When the saints come together, they need to exercise according to the grace and the gifts that they have received
The responsible brothers should take the lead to exercise and bring such an atmosphere of exercise to the meetings
When a brother stands up and reads a portion from the Bible, there will be much light and people will feel happy
The meetings in the homes are entirely according to the nature of the church and not according the nature of a ministry meeting
If we feel that we have a message to release to God's children, it is right to release it in a ministry meeting
An entire district meeting should be used to help the brothers and sisters serve together according to the five points mentioned above
We should never think that the saints do not know how to function and that we should take their place and do everything for them
Right now the need is for the responsible ones to take the lead to practice perfecting the saints, watering them, and helping them to grow
All the responsible brothers and sisters should help the saints practically rather than merely giving them messages
Whenever the Bible speaks of the four living creatures, it is to show the kind of condition we should have before God in our service
The four living creatures are transparent on all sides and that they are able to see within, without, and all around
The picture of the four living creatures is similar to an impressionistic painting; it illustrates the kind of service that God desires
The rims are on the outer part of the wheel and are full of eyes; therefore, when the wheels turn, the eyes also turn
A person who serves God cannot live in a foolish, confused, and blind way; instead, he should be bright, alert, and sharp
As such, he could see the condition of the church in Antioch, the church in Corinth, the church in Ephesus, and the church in Colossae
The letter he wrote to the church in Ephesus fit their situation, and the letter he wrote to the church in Colossae fit their situation
According to my observation, those of us who serve full time do not have the condition of the four living creatures
Many serving ones still do things step by step, sticking to old routines while being faithful in their service
Some farmers may think that they can wait a few days once the wheat has ripened; however, much wheat will be lost
We cannot take care of these three needs in a routine way, because there is nothing routine in regard to these needs
Whenever life is gone, death will surface, and the most serious death comes from human opinions and human views
The brothers and sisters who came to those meetings must have felt hungry, because they came to the meeting but were not supplied
Presently we are not lacking in serving ones, but even though we have so many serving ones, the supply is obviously short
As full-time serving ones, we have more time, and we have received more perfecting in life and truth than most saints
If we cannot supply the ministry of the word, how can we expect other brothers and sisters to rise up and function?
Among all the full-time serving ones in Taipei, not many have received the burden to minister the word to the saints
Most of the serving ones are doing their jobs in a regular way and feel that it is good enough to be faithful to what they do
Even though it is painful to be a person with eyes, feelings, and a keen sense, we cannot be without these items in our service
According to the statistics of the last several weeks, there were approximately sixty saints coming to each of the district meetings
If over the next few weeks, the numbers begin to gradually drop, this will indicate that the saints are not receiving the supply
Such a problem is not the business of only a small number of elders or co-workers; it is the business of all of us
Even if we must set aside our other responsibilities and deal only with the present famine, it is necessary to do this
As serving ones, we should consider what we are offering on the table and whether the food is sufficiently nutritious
If we do not know how to seize this opportunity, even if we had more time, we would not be able to meet the need of this famine
In regard to the building up of the saints, the ministry of the word, visitation, and spiritual supply, we are in the midst of a famine
They are not without a definite direction; rather, they go straight ahead, yet they are able to move in every direction
Perhaps we work with young people and students; nevertheless, we should also be able to speak with older saints and render help to them
If we are persons who pay attention to the inner life, we should also be able to encourage others to preach the gospel
Although we should have a direction for our service and should not turn at will, we must also be multidirectional
In the same way, if we always give gospel messages, yet there is a need for edification, will we be willing to meet the need?
All four sides of the living creatures have wheels, but the movement of the wheels is not decided by the wheels themselves
The Spirit worked with him, and in him we can see many examples of moving in multiple directions and having eyes all around
Every brother and sister should have eyes all around and be able to move in four directions so that wherever the Spirit moves, we can follow
If our service is like this, the church will be living, and there will be rich food with which we can supply others
Finally, all those serving in the ministry of the word must prepare living material that can meet people's needs
Such words will be living; hence, we do not need to search reference materials in order to find content for a message
If we see a need, we should not feel at peace; rather, we must pick up the responsibility for the meetings in our district
According to my observation of the church life, although there may be some visitation, no one is taking care of the work
Our condition can be compared to someone who has a business but has no feeling after losing money for six months
They do not spend time in the Lord's presence seeking concerning people's situations, neither do they have a genuine concern for them
Not only will they touch our love in the Lord, but they will also receive supply from our inner being and be built up
As a result of receiving such help over a period of three to five months, these ones will never forget the leading that was rendered to them
We must be alert, having many eyes, and we must have multidirectional wheels, waiting for the command of the Spirit
