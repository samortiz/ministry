   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PARTAKING OF RICH FOOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us take some examples from 1 Corinthians to illustrate what we mean by the feathers, skin, and meat in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 1:12 says, Now I mean this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This verse speaks of divisiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Regarding division, some of the Brethren teachers said something like this: In 1 Corinthians 1:12 Paul rebukes those who say that they are of Cephas, of Apollos, of Paul, and of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why, then, do you take such names as Lutheran, Baptist, Presbyterian, or Wesleyan?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To say that you are a Lutheran means that you are of Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Does not Paul s word apply to the matter of assuming denominational names?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This practice must be rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is sound, fundamental teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nevertheless, this teaching is skins and feathers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not the meat of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we would learn to eat in a healthy way, we should not eat the feathers and the skins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, we should eat the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When I eat chicken, I eat only the meat, not the feathers, the skin, or the bone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the same principle, when we come to 1 Corinthians 1, we should pay attention not merely to the feathers in verse 12, but to the meat in verse 9.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Does 1 Corinthians primarily reveal the matter of division?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No, the basic revelation here concerns the fellowship of God s Son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, this chapter teaches that Christ, the crucified One, is God s wisdom and power to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This Christ is now our daily righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the basic revelation in chapter one of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we would eat the meat of a chicken, we need to pluck out the feathers and peel off the skin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In like manner, if we would find the meat in 1 Corinthians 1, we must go deeper than the feathers and the skin in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then we shall see past the divisions and the divisive spirit and see that Christ, the Son of God, is our portion and that He, God s wisdom and power, may be enjoyed as our daily righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all need to see Christ in this way and partake of such rich food.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we remain in verse 12, concentrating on the matter of division, we shall have only the feathers and the skins.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We shall not enjoy the healthy meat Christ as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I can testify that when I read 1 Corinthians 1, I do not pay attention only to the skin of divisiveness; much more, I enjoy the crucified Christ as my portion and as my righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many Christians have not seen the meat in chapter one of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some see only the feathers; others, going somewhat deeper, see the skin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But when I tell the believers that they must go beyond the skin and the feathers and touch the meat, some are offended and even oppose me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are like my grandchildren who complain when I tell them to eat the meat of the chicken and not to eat the skin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In my ministry I am doing my best to show the Lord s people the meat that lies beneath the feathers and the skin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>MINISTERING THE MEAT OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Recently I read an article in which I was accused of destroying the practice of Christmas.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually I do not have any intention to attack the practice of Christmas.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>My time is fully occupied with ministering Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But while I am ministering Christ, Christmas is spontaneously exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yes, I have said that we should care fully for Christ and forget about the so-called Christ-mass or Christmas.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have also said that we should be Christians, but not care for the -anity of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I certainly do not have the intention of opposing either Christmas or Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nevertheless, in my ministry I have said that we should care for Christ and be real Christians, but have nothing to do with the -mass or -anity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When certain ones hear such a word, they accuse me of opposing Christianity and ruining the practice of Christmas.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Actually, Christmas and the system of Christianity include many things that are not even the genuine feathers and skins in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is a fact that Christ was born in a manger and raised in Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These definitely are truths in the Bible; however they are feather-truths or skin-truths, not meat-truths.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>An example of a meat-truth is John 1:1 and 14.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These verses declare that the Word, which is God, became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>John 1:16 goes on to say, For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verse 4 of the same chapter says this: In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In these verses we have meat, not feathers or skin.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>More meat is found in chapters fourteen and fifteen of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>John 14:23 says, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My Word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This verse says nothing about Christmas, Easter, or the system of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Neither do any other verses in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This verse declares that the Son and the Father will make an abode with the one who loves the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Furthermore, in John 15:4 the Lord says, Abide in Me and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this chapter He also says, I am the vine, you are the branches v. 5 . Verses such as these do not have any feathers or skin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Rather, they are full of nourishing meat.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When you eat a chicken dinner, do you pay attention mainly to the skin or to the meat?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Certainly we would all concentrate on the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If my wife were to serve me a meal of chicken skin, I would be very unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, my wife would never do such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Instead, she would serve the nourishing meat of the chicken.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I enjoy this kind of meat, and I am strengthened and supplied by it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What kind of Bible do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Is your Bible a book only of feathers or of skins, or is your Bible more a book of meat?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should be careful about the way we answer this question.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The best answer is to say, My Bible is not only a book of feathers and skins, but also a book of rich meat.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A chicken needs feathers and skin as well as meat.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Without feathers and skin, a chicken would not be able to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In like manner, in the Bible we have the skin, the feathers, and the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But the tragedy among Christians today is that they care for the feathers and the skin, but they do not care much for the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, my burden is to minister the meat of the Word to the Lord s people.</S>
