   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX THE ESSENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW COVENANT MINISTRY 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:3, 6-9, 18; 4:1a MINISTRY AND MINISTRIES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today many Christians talk about different ministries and speak of receiving all kinds of ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The matter of the ministry or of the ministries is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to 2 Corinthians, there is just one ministry, the unique ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 4:1 Paul says, Therefore, having this ministry, as we have received mercy we do not lose heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the one hand, here Paul says we ; on the other hand, he speaks of this ministry, not these ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to this verse, there are many who have the one ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, in 1 Corinthians 12:5 Paul says, There are distributions of ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How can it be that the ministry is unique and yet at the same time there are many ministries?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The answer is that in the New Testament God has only one operation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, He has just one ministry to carry out His unique operation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the apostles Peter, James, John, Paul, Timothy carried on the same ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Peter did not carry on one ministry, Paul another ministry, and Timothy yet another ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the situation among preachers, teachers, and ministers today, who carry on different kinds of ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because there are different kinds of ministries, there are many different denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Baptists carry on the Baptist ministry to accomplish the Baptist operation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Presbyterians carry on another kind of ministry to accomplish the Presbyterian operation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The same is true of the Episcopalians, Lutherans, and Methodists.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All these denominations carry on different kinds of ministries for the sake of their own operations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the New Testament, this practice is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The New Testament reveals that there is a unique ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today the local churches are not carrying out different kinds of ministries to accomplish many operations.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God has one operation to be carried out by the unique ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now we must see what this unique ministry does.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The unique ministry in the New Testament serves Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It inscribes Christ into people as the Spirit within them and as righteousness outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the function of the unique ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we preach the gospel, we should preach in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Likewise, when we teach the Bible, edify the saints, or build up the churches, we should do these things in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everything we do in the church life should be to inscribe Christ into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Regarding this, we do not have many different ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although the New Testament clearly indicates that the ministry is one and unique, it also speaks of different ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These ministries refer to various services in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When 1 Corinthians 12:5 speaks of ministries, it means the different services.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the church life the saints are involved in different services.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, some take care of the children.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is one kind of service.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some shepherd the younger ones or the weaker ones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is another kind of service.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These different services, however, all carry out the unique ministry, the unique service.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As we have seen, the function of the unique service is to minister Christ into God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In what way should we take care of the children?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should do so in the way of ministering Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Likewise, how should we shepherd the younger ones or the weaker ones?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In shepherding we should minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even when the sisters meet together to pray, they all should minister Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The many services are for the unique service; the many ministries are for the one ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We accept all ministries that are accomplishing the unique ministry for God s operation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But we cannot accept a ministry that is seeking to establish or accomplish something different from God s unique operation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For example, we cannot accept a ministry which has as its goal the establishing of the Presbyterian denomination; neither can we accept a ministry that seeks to carry out the Baptist, Lutheran, or Episcopalian operations.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These ministries are divisive; therefore, we cannot accept them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The ministries we accept are those that are for the unique New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you take note of this understanding of the ministry and the ministries and read through the New Testament again, especially the Epistles, you will see that this understanding is accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I would encourage you to study the Epistles along this line, paying special attention to the words ministry and ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you make such a study, you will see that the different ministries, services, are all for the carrying out of the one new covenant ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For the carrying out of God s New Testament economy, the ministry is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But for the accomplishing of this unique ministry, especially in the church life, there is the need of many services, the need of diverse ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But again I would emphasize the fact that these different ministries and services are all for the carrying out of the unique ministry, which is the ministry of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This ministry inscribes the saints with the all-inclusive God, who is the Spirit within us and righteousness as our expression outwardly.</S>
