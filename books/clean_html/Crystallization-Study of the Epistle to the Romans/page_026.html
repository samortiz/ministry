<h2 class="head2">G. The Effect of Faith&mdash;<br />
Nothing Being Impossible to Faith</h2>
<p>In Matthew 17:20b the Lord spoke concerning the effect of faith: &ldquo;If you have faith like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.&rdquo; Nothing is impossible to faith. <em>Hymns,</em> #535, written by Charles Wesley, expresses this effect of faith:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>All things are possible to him<br />
That can in Jesus&rsquo; name believe;<br />
Lord, I no more Thy name blaspheme,<br />
Thy truth I lovingly receive.<br />
I can, I do believe in Thee;<br />
All things are possible to me.<br /><br /></li>
<li>&rsquo;Twas most impossible of all<br />
That here sin&rsquo;s reign in me should cease;<br />
Yet shall it be, I know it shall;<br />
Jesus, I trust Thy faithfulness.<br />
If nothing is too hard for Thee,<br />
All things are possible to me.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Though earth and hell the Word gainsay,<br />
The Word of God shall never fail;<br />
The Lord can break sin&rsquo;s iron sway;<br />
&rsquo;Tis certain, though impossible.<br />
The thing impossible shall be,<br />
All things are possible to me.<br /><br />
<li>All things are possible to God;<br />
To Christ, the power of God in man;<br />
To me when I am all renewed,<br />
In Christ am fully formed again,<br />
And from the reign of sin set free,<br />
All things are possible to me.<br /><br /></li>
<li>All things are possible to God;<br />
To Christ, the power of God in me;<br />
Now shed Thy mighty Self abroad,<br />
Let me no longer live, but Thee;<br />
Give me this hour in Thee to prove<br />
The sweet omnipotence of love.</li>

<p>Only God is all-able, omnipotent; nothing is impossible to Him (Matt. 19:26). But the Lord also indicates that nothing is impossible to faith. So this indicates faith and God, God and faith, are one. If you do not have God, God remains apart from you. If you have God in you, this God becomes faith. Faith is the subjective God applied to your being. Thus, just as nothing is impossible to God, nothing is impossible to faith.</p>
