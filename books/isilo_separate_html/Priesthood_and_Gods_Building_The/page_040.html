THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</h2>
<p>When the children of Israel left Egypt, God&rsquo;s desire for the priesthood was fully revealed. In the living of Abel, Enoch, Noah, and Abraham, we can see the principles of a priestly living, but the priesthood was not fully revealed or developed. After the children of Israel left Egypt, however, God clearly spoke of His desire for them to be a kingdom of priests (Exo. 19:6). Even when the children of Israel fell, God still chose the house of Aaron out of the tribe of Levi to be priests (32:25-29). The priests of Aaron&rsquo;s house had the presence of God, a living before God that was based on redemption, fellowship with God, and even God as their blessing. The priests of the house of Aaron had everything that Adam, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob enjoyed, and they enjoyed even more aspects of the priesthood.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Enjoying Christ Fully</h2>
<p>First, the Aaronic priests drew near to God and lived before God. They did not draw near to God occasionally; they lived before God continually, and in type they were able to enjoy Christ fully. Those who served as priests enjoyed Christ richly and fully. Whereas the children of Israel ate Christ as the Lamb prior to their exodus from Egypt and ate Christ as their daily manna in the wilderness, the priests enjoyed Christ in a rich and multifaceted way as the sacrifices.</p>
<p>With the exception of the burnt offering, the priests enjoyed all the sacrificial offerings together with God. The priests enjoyed the meal offering of fine flour and oil (Num. 18:9; Lev. 2:1-2, 14); the priests enjoyed the breast and the right thigh of the wave offering (Num. 18:18); and the priests enjoyed a portion of the firstfruits that the Israelites offered to God, such as the new wine and the grain (v. 12). All these offerings are types of Christ. These examples show that a priest fully enjoys Christ.</p>
<p>Today many Christians pay attention to enjoying Christ as manna. However, in typology, Christ was manna to those who were wandering in the wilderness. In contrast, the priests were those who enjoyed Christ fully in the Holy Place. In the wilderness Christ was manna to the people; in the Holy Place Christ was the offerings enjoyed by God. These offerings to God were also food to the priests. In order to enjoy Christ fully, richly, and abundantly, we must be priests. Priests not only draw near to God and live before God; they also enjoy Christ fully.</p>
<p>We often speak of enjoying Christ, but I am afraid that most of the saints are not able to speak of many instances of their practical enjoyment of Christ. When we see how the priests enjoyed the offerings, we should realize that there are many rich items of Christ for us to enjoy. I hope that we will spend some time considering the offerings. We need to study the different offerings and the details of each offering in order to understand their spiritual significance. This will help us greatly.</p>
<p>Only priests can enjoy the offerings. We do not have to be priests in order to enjoy Christ as our redemptive Lamb or as our daily manna. However, in order to enjoy Christ as the offerings to God and as our rich food, we must be priests. Priests draw near to God and live before God, and they enjoy Christ in many aspects. In fact, priests live before God because they enjoy Christ in such a multifaceted way. Drawing near to God and enjoying the rich Christ are matters related to the priesthood.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Putting On Christ Completely</h2>
<p>According to the types in the Bible, the priests also put on Christ, just as we put on Christ as our righteousness (Jer. 23:6; 33:16; 1 Cor. 1:30; Gal. 3:27). In typology the priests put on Christ completely. The priestly garments were unique among God&rsquo;s children. All the items of the priestly garments are types of Christ. Christ was the inward content of the priests, that is, their food and inward life supply, and Christ was the glory and beauty of the priests, that is, their outward expression (Exo. 28:2).</p>
<p>Many of the materials used in the tabernacle were also used in the garments of the priests. For example, the fine twined linen, the gold thread, and the blue, purple, and scarlet strands used in the tabernacle were also used in the garments worn by the priests (v. 6). The priests not only put on Christ, but they also put on the tabernacle. From the viewpoint of the New Testament, the priests are the tabernacle. In principle and in nature, the priests are the tabernacle because the priests and the tabernacle are one. God&rsquo;s thought in this regard is very rich, and we should spend time to consider these matters. Christ is the inward supply of the priesthood, and Christ is the outward expression of the priesthood.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> </body></html>
