[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE PURSUIT OF A CHRISTIAN THE GOAL OF A CHRISTIAN DETERMINING THE MODEL OF A CHRISTIAN
[3]  It is of great importance for Christians to know their inclination.
[4]  This is because they are convinced that those who do not believe in Jesus do not have God and that those who do not have God have no one to whom they can commit themselves.
[5]  They consider that those who are without God have neither peace nor blessings; those who have God, however, will obtain peace and enjoy the God-given blessings if they pray to God whenever they face some difficulties.
[6]  Whenever we ask others to provide us a little pleasure or sympathy, this proves that we do not have God we have lost God.
[7]  Man's heart ought to be occupied and filled with God.
[8]  If a person allows God to occupy his heart, other things will not come in. Let me use an illustration: While I am staying in my room, if a cat comes, I will chase it away.
[9]  If I do not stay in my room, however, then the cat, the dog, and even the pig will come in. Therefore, man's heart ought to be occupied by God; otherwise, many things will come in. If we examine the hearts of men, we will find out that no human heart is empty.
[10]  After a Christian has been saved, he should at least have some knowledge concerning several fundamental matters: first, Christ; second, the Bible; third, the church; and fourth, Christians.
[11]  Besides knowing Christ, the Bible, and the church, a good Christian should also have a clear understanding of what a Christian is, how to be a Christian, and what kind of living a Christian should have.
[12]  Therefore, we may say that Christ, the Bible, the church, and fellow Christians are four things in a Christian's possession.
[13]  A Christian possesses these things not just in his mind; rather, he has these four things because he has the Lord Jesus living in him.
[14]  First, a person who is a Christian must have Christ.
[15]  After having Christ, we must always inquire of the Lord, seeking His approval in whatever we do in our daily living.
[16]  This is because when we have Christ, we represent Him in everything we do.
[17]  Real Christians can all testify that many times while they are inquiring of the Lord, they have the inner wisdom, inner enlightenment, and inner presence of the Lord.
[18]  This refers to the church which has been recovered back to the beginning, back to the condition of the early churches where things were not done according to man's methods but only according to the Bible.
[19]  A Christian cannot be a Christian by himself alone; he must be in the church and have the church life.
[20]  Hence, when we have problems, we should inquire not only of the Lord and of the Bible, but we should also inquire of the saints.
[21]  If we were put in a place without a church, after one month of not having Christ and two months of not having our fellow Christians, we would eventually have a sense that it is the most miserable place.
[22]  As saved ones, we should at least have a basic knowledge concerning certain matters, such as, there is God, Jesus is our Savior, we are sinners, our sins have been forgiven, and we have the Lord's life in us.
[23]  In addition, we should further know how the Bible came into existence, how it was handed down, how it was translated, and what its functions are.
[24]  Perhaps some may ask, How can the Bible be the word of God?
[25]  Throughout the generations Christians have had many ways of reading the Bible.
[26]  We also need to receive revelation from the Word of God to see what the church is that God desires.
[27]  THE CHURCH NOT BEING A PHYSICAL BUILDING FOR WORSHIP
[28]  According to the principle of simplicity, when the early church was raised up, she did not have many of the things that we see in Christianity today, not even a physical place for worship, such as a cathedral something so greatly valued today.
[29]  THE SERVICE OF GOD BEING A MATTER FOR ALL BELIEVERS
[30]  In the Lord's recovery there are no pastors; instead, we are all brothers Matt 23:8-11 .
[31]  If a brother among us is serving God, then we should all be serving God.
[32]  CHAPTER FIVE THE PECULIAR LIFE OF A CHRISTIAN FOUR CHARACTERISTICS OF A CHRISTIAN
[33]  A Christian has four distinctive possessions: Christ, the Bible, the church, and fellow Christians.
[34]  In addition, a Christian has four distinct characteristics: before men, he is peculiar; within himself, he is contradictory; before God, he takes his innermost part as the starting point; and in all things, he is led by God.
[35]  Before a person is saved, he is always happy whenever he receives something, regardless of whether he has received it as a gift, he has earned it, or he has obtained it by some unrighteous means.
[36]  Christians possess a life that is not only willing to give but also reluctant to make a show.
[37]  If we ignore the feeling we have from Christ and go along with the tide just like ordinary people, we have lost our way before God because we have lost the peculiar nature within us.
[38]  CHAPTER SIX THE CONTRADICTION IN A CHRISTIAN A CHRISTIAN HAVING CHRIST WITHIN
[39]  We all know that our sins have been forgiven and that when we die we will be with God, but we may have never heard about Christ living in us.
[40]  THE SAVED ONES' HOPE BEING TO BE ABLE TO IMPROVE THEMSELVES
[41]  God's hope is that the more Christ lives in us, the more He will be able to gain ground in us and be expressed through us.
[42]  However, our hope is that the more Christ lives in us, the more we will be improved in ourselves.
[43]  Every saved one hopes that God will grant him more strength to help him reform himself so that he can do good deeds.
[44]  This is where the problem lies: God hopes that the more Christ lives in us, the more He will be able to gain ground, but our hope is that the more He lives in us, the more we will be able to improve ourselves.
[45]  God hopes that Christ can have more ground in us, while we hope that we can improve ourselves; these two hopes are totally different.
[46]  Using myself as an example, I can say that my experience of contradictions during the early years of my salvation was unbearable.
[47]  At the moment I finished dressing and was prepared to go out, there came an inner sense that I should not go, and then when I returned to my study room to read, there came another sense that I should not read.
[48]  ARRIVING AT AN ABSOLUTE ONENESS WITH THE LORD IN THE MIDST OF CONTRADICTIONS
[49]  Any Christian who has not lived a life of contradictions is not a genuine Christian.
[50]  However, after going through many struggles, one day we will realize that we have decreased while the Lord has increased, that we have lost more ground while the Lord has gained more ground in us, and that we have become less and less while the Lord has become more and more manifest through us.
[51]  CHAPTER SEVEN TAKING OUR INNERMOST PART AS THE STARTING POINT TWO ASPECTS OF A CHRISTIAN Peculiar before Men
[52]  When a Christian lives a normal life before God, he will display certain characteristics that will distinguish him from other people.
[53]  Titus 2:14 says that God redeemed us from all lawlessness and purified to Himself a particular, or peculiar, people.
[54]  As Christians, we have the Spirit of God dwelling in us Rom 8:11 , and we also have God in us Phil 2:13; Heb 13:20-21 .
[55]  Many newly saved ones, due to the freshness of life, are quite accurate in their consciousness about sin.
[56]  Some long-time Christians apparently have no big mistakes in their life, but because their fellowship with the Lord has been broken, they do not care about God at all.
[57]  As a rule, a Christian must use his inner sense as the starting point.
[58]  Since we are saved, we need to bring every matter before the Lord and pray, "Lord, since You live in me, what would You like to do?"
[59]  First, he has Christ; a person is not a Christian if he does not have Christ.
[60]  BEING LED TO BE CONSTITUTED WITH THE NATURE OF GOD
[61]  In reality, what we consider great things are small things before God.
[62]  For example, before you set out to go to Kaoshiung, you have to ask God, "O God, I want to go to Kaoshiung; what do You think about this?"
[63]  In this way, not only are we blessed in the matter for which we inquire, but through our seeking we also have more fellowship with God and, consequently, we are filled with God's nature.
[64]  After we are saved in the Lord, God desires that we would be filled by Him and be like Him, so that His nature, life, and elements will be constituted into us.
[65]  About a hundred years ago there was a spiritual man in England named George M ller, who founded an orphanage.
[66]  When he was led by God to establish an orphanage, he did not do any fundraising; he only prayed.
[67]  When M ller was clear that God wanted him to do it, the third thing he would do was to ask God when He wanted him to do it.
[68]  The Bible tells us that the Lord is the Potter, and we are the clay Rom 9:21 .
[69]  If we would follow the Lord, walk in His path, and commit ourselves to God, discussing all matters, big or small, with Him, and clearly receiving His leading before we take action, then we are truly walking in and with the Lord.
[70]  Conversely, if we live before God and maintain fellowship with Him, we are definitely peculiar before men, we are full of contradictions within ourselves being always against ourselves, and we conduct ourselves as Christians from within our innermost part.
