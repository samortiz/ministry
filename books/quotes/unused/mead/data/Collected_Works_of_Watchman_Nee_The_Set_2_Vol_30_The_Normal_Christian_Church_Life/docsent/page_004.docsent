   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INTRODUCTION IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING OF THE BOOK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The content of the following pages is the substance of a number of talks to my younger fellow workers during conferences held recently in Shanghai and Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the addresses were given, the present book was not in view, but only my immediate audience; and the fact that the messages were intended for the instruction of my young colleagues accounts for their intensely practical nature, and for the simplicity of the style adopted.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At these two conferences we sought in the first place to examine the teaching of God's Word concerning His churches and His work, and in the second place to review our past missions in the light of our findings.1</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The talks proved of value to my younger brethren, and, as longhand notes were taken, the messages were shared with others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This resulted in many requests that the addresses be put into book form.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As the conferences were attended chiefly by my younger fellow workers, I felt at liberty to instruct and counsel them, and to discuss quite freely a number of intimate and rather delicate matters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Had the addresses been intended for a wider audience, or for publication, I should have felt obliged to omit many matters that were mentioned, and to speak in an altogether different strain.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I naturally hesitated when the suggestion was made to publish them, but the Lord made it clear that that was His mind, so I have no option but to acquiesce.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I questioned the wisdom of preserving the original style of the addresses, with their bits of "elder-brotherly" counsel and their distinct personal strain; but as a number of friends testified to special help received through the more personal parts, I realized that the book would lose its greatest value if those were eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, though I send the addresses forth somewhat revised, they still remain, both in matter and style, very much as they were when originally delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We trust the readers of this book will bear in mind that its messages, as originally given, were never meant for them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They were intended exclusively for the inner circle of my most intimate associates in the work, but by request we share our findings with the wider circle of all our brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The book is something private made public; something originally intended for the few now extended to the many; so we trust our readers will pardon anything that seems unsuited to the wider public.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should like to point out here the place of the teachings of this book in the great body of divine truth, for the former have spiritual value only as they are held in relation to the latter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>During the past eighteen years, the Lord has led us through different experiences in order that we might learn a little of the principle as well as the fact of the cross and resurrection, and learn something of the Christ-life, the lordship of Jesus, the corporate life of the Body, the ground of the kingdom of God, and His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is natural, therefore, that these things have been the burden of our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But God's wine must have a wineskin to contain it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the divine pattern, nothing is left for man to decide.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God Himself has provided the best wineskin for His wine, which will contain and preserve it without loss, hindrance, or misrepresentation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He has shown us His wine, but He has shown us His wineskin also.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our work, throughout the past years, has been according to certain definite principles; but never until now have we tried to define or teach them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have sought rather, in the power of the Spirit, to stress those truths which are so dear to our hearts and which, we believe, have more direct bearing on the spiritual life of the believer and the eternal purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the practical outworking of those truths in the Lord's service is by no means unimportant.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without that, everything is in the realm of theory, and spiritual development is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>So we would seek, by the grace of God, not only to pass on His good wine, but also the wineskin He has provided for its preservation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The truths set forth in this book must therefore be regarded in relation to those taught throughout the eighteen years of our ministry, and as the sequence, not the introduction, to them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Within the scope of these pages, it has been impossible to deal with all the questions relating to the subject of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some I have already dealt with elsewhere, and others I hope to deal with at a later date.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The title of the book explains its nature.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not a treatise on missionary methods, but a review of our past work in the light of God's will as we have discovered it in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord had most graciously led us by His Spirit in our past service for Him, but we wanted to be clear as to the foundations upon which all divine work should rest.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I realized that the primary need of my younger brethren was to be led of the Spirit and to receive revelation from Him, but I could not ignore their need of a solid scriptural basis for all their ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, together we talked freely of what we had been doing and how we had been doing it, and sought to compare our work and methods with what God had set before us in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We examined the scriptural reasons for the means we employed, and the scriptural justification for the end we pursued; and we made a note of various lessons we had learned by observation as well as by experience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There was no thought of criticizing the labors of others, or even of making any suggestion to them how the work of God ought to be conducted; we were merely seeking to learn from God's Word, from experience, and from observation, how to conduct the work in the days to come, so that we might be workmen "approved to God."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The book is written from the standpoint of a servant looking from the work towards the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It does not deal with the specific ministry to which we believe the Lord has called us, but only with the general principles of the work; nor does it deal with "the church, which is His Body," but with the local churches and their relation to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The book does not touch the principles of the work, or the life of the churches; it is only a review of our missions, as the title suggests.</S>
