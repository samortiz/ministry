<h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Greetings to Sister X in Christ:</p><p>I am sure that the loving, merciful Father has given you and all the brothers His rich, unsearchable, marvelous, indescribable grace through the Spirit of Christ. May He abundantly give you even more in the future so that all the glory might be to Him! Amen. After meeting in Han-Jiang for a few days, I moved to another house. God had prepared a comfortable place for me to give hospitality to a few sisters so they could get to know the life of prayer and fellowship. Sister Chen Wan-ching wants to come to western Fukien. May God fulfill her desire according to His best choice. Everything goes on as usual with me. Thank the Father God for His abounding grace. May God quickly accomplish His purpose through the work of faithful workers and the hastening of the saints' prayer. Amen! May the Father's kingdom come! Amen. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your little sister in the Lord,<br />Bao Hsu-min<br />February 22</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Dear Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I received your letter. Thank you! I will go to Sien-You County with Sister Wang Yu-ju on the eighteenth of this month. On the twenty-first, the Lord willing, we will begin a sisters' conference that will last a few days. Afterward, Sister Wang will go someplace else, and I will be able to stay there for a time. According to my recent observation and the condition of the need, it seems that only a few days of meetings would short-change the sisters too much. If there were more time, it might give God the opportunity to move His arm in this kind of work. I was in Han-Jiang for more than a month and met with the sisters before God many times. There was much blessing on this work. If possible, I would like to do the same thing in Sien-You. Personally, I have had a particular experience recently: I can work, but I cannot rest. If I stop working, it seems that some weakness or illness will come! When I force myself to go on as usual, even if it seems painful, there is no problem. I personally feel that (1) the days are short, and the Lord's coming is near, so we must hurry to repay our debt every day. When we are finished, we can go. (2) Since life overcomes death, and there is Romans 8:11, we would offend our gracious Lord if we did not try to experience it. (3) Since the past is gone, the future will soon be gone too. I do not know whether or not this is right. Is there any danger? Please pray for this and give me some instructions. Peace and health in the Lord!</p><p>Your sister in the Lord,<br />Bao Hsu-min<br />March 13<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Four</h2><p>Greetings to Brother X who is greatly cared for by the Lord:</p><p>Since we parted, I have been remembering you in prayer, hoping to receive instructions from you soon. May the Lord be glorified in you and may He manifest His greater power through you. Amen. I went with Brother Chai to the conference in Sien-You, and we were blessed by the Lord. There is already the testimony of a local church in Sien-You with more than fifty brothers and sisters serving the Lord in one accord. They have all grown. I really thank and praise the Lord! Glory to Him forever and ever! Amen. Over the Chinese New Year, the brothers in Han-Jiang rented another hall on Lin Street to preach the gospel. I was there helping them. We were led by the Lord to do this for a month. The Holy Spirit worked among us, and sinners bent their knees and called on the Lord's name daily. Thank and praise the Lord! Glory to Him forever and ever! Amen. Brother Ke-san is in Changchow, and Brother Tse-chung is in Chuenchow. The meeting hall in Fu-Ching has moved out of Luke Hospital and back to its old address (65 Shan-Chiao Street, Fu-Ching). The coastal region of Fukien has been preserved in peace by the Lord. Please do not worry. May the Lord cause me to live a godly, proper life during these times of peace so that I do not make allowance for the lusts of the flesh. Amen. I will tell you the rest later. I hope you help us with your prayer. May the Lord grant you overcoming power (2 Cor. 12:9)!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Jai-seng<br />Twenty-third day of the first month<br />[Address omitted]</p>
