   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Having to Suffer for This Name</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the Apostles were persecuted, they rejoiced that they were worthy to suffer for the name of Jesus Acts 5:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Is this not wonderful?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They even hazarded their lives for this name Acts 15:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because Satan attacks the name of Jesus with all his evil power, we must learn to suffer for this name.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not Denying This Name</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Revelation 3:8 the Lord Jesus praised the church in Philadelphia because they did not deny His name.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should never deny the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should deny every other name, but keep the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must testify that we do not belong to any person or to any sect, but that we simply belong to Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The name of Jesus is the only name we own.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>K. Emmanuel, the Name Called by People 1.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jesus as Emmanuel Experienced by Us</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we come to the second name, Emmanuel 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The angels did not speak to Joseph or Mary of this name.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, Emmanuel is the name called by people who have had a certain amount of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever you have some experience of Jesus, you will be able to say that He is God with you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jesus is nothing less than God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God told us that His name is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But as we receive Him and experience Him, we say that Jesus is God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Often we turn to our mind and ask the question, Is this Jesus the very God?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may be confident that He is the Son of God, but we may not yet be assured that He is actually God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When I was young, I was taught by some fundamental Christian teachers to be careful of saying directly that Jesus was God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I was taught that the Son of God was different from God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, I was told not to say directly that Jesus was God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I was told that I must pray through Jesus to God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I received a teaching that suited the human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, after much practice, the more I prayed, the more I realized that this Jesus was simply God with me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To argue by theory is one thing; to experience the fact is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Quite often, Christians do not agree with their experience; instead, they agree with their concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I believe that all Christians have this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Deep within, do you not have the sense that, according to your experience, Jesus is God?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You do, but you dare not say this in doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, you should not consider Jesus as someone other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Jesus is nothing less than God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is not only the Son of God, but also God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some good writers have said that apart from Jesus we can never find God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God is with Jesus, and God is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was not only with God, but the Word was God John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This Word became flesh and was called Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we experience Jesus, He is Emmanuel, God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have heard that Jesus is our comfort, our rest, our peace, and our life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Jesus is so much to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we would experience Him, we would immediately say, This is God!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is not God far away from me, or God in the heavens, but God with me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever we experience Jesus in a certain way, we realize that Jesus is God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Jesus is our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After we experience this salvation, we say, This is God with us to be our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Jesus is our patience.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But when we experience Him as our patience, we say, This patience is God with me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Jesus is the way and the truth, but when we experience Him as the way and the truth we say, This way and this truth are just God with me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hallelujah, Jesus is God with us!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In our experience, He is Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>With Us in Our Gatherings</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whenever we are gathered together into the name of Jesus, He is with us 18:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Once again, this is Emmanuel, God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The presence of Jesus in our meetings is actually God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>With Us All the Days</S>

   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Do not forget about today.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many Christians think that Jesus is present all the days, except today.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But Jesus is with us now, today!</S>

   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>His Presence Being the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We can never separate the Spirit from the presence of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Spirit is simply the reality of Jesus presence John 14:16-20 .</S>

   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Whenever we say Lord Jesus, we are in the Spirit and we receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We have all been under the influence of tradition, thinking that we must fast and pray before we can receive the Spirit.</S>
