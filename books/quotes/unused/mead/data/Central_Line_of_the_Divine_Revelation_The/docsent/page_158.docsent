   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>H. The Spirit's Dispensing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Newness of Christ's Resurrection Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>into the Believers' Inward Being</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit renews the believers by dispensing the newness of Christ's resurrection life into the believers' inward being Rom 6:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit's dispensing imparts the life element of Christ's resurrection into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is our need every day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The reason that we pray, read the Word, and pray-read the Word is that we need the continuous dispensing of the Spirit with the resurrection life element of Christ into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we have this dispensing, our need is met in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through the Consuming</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>of the Believers' Environment</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Spirit dispenses the element of Christ's resurrection life into the believers' inward being through the consuming of the believers' environment 2 Cor 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our outer man is decaying, that is, being consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The environment around us works to consume us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The husband consumes the wife, the wife consumes the husband, the parents consume the children, and the children consume the parents.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The roommates also consume one another.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A new pair of shoes, a haircut, or good health also may consume us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everything in our environment consumes us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord is sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not need to worry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should simply continue to contact Him and open ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is within us to dispense God, Christ, life, and the consummated God as the Spirit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this way we are renewed, and we become a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am glad that I have been under the consuming of my environment for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This consuming has caused me to be renewed very much.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through the consuming of our environment, the outer man is decaying, but the inner man is being renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Making the Believers Practically</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God's New Creation</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This renewing makes the believers practically God's new creation 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Second Corinthians 5:17 says, "If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a declaration, but it is not very practical until we have been consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After being consumed to some extent, we become, at least in part, a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more we remain in the Lord, the more we will be consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This consuming helps to make us a new creation in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Consummating in the New Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The renewing of the believers by the Holy Spirit will consummate in the New Jerusalem Rev 21:2, 9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the holy city, New Jerusalem, there will be no clay and no dust.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The New Jerusalem will be a composition of gold, pearls, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These three precious materials are not clay; thus, they do not produce any dust.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But today all human beings, including Christians, are still very "dusty."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As long as our body has not been transfigured, we are still dusty.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because we are still clay, the longer we remain with one another, the more dust we produce.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But when we enter into the New Jerusalem, we will be pearls and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This will be the result of the renewing of the consummated Spirit of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today our God is a consummated God, a processed God, as the very Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This Spirit indwells us to dispense God into our being throughout the day.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The element that He dispenses into our being replaces our old element and discharges all the old element.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this way we are not only changed but renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are not simply washed and purged; we are renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The old things are carried away, and the new element comes in to replace the old element.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is renewing.</S>
