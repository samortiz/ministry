   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>First John 5:2-3 says, "In this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and do His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why is it that we can keep God's commandments when we love Him?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us look at John 14:21: "He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This says that if we love the Lord, we will keep His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brothers and sisters, who among us dares to say that he has kept all the commandments that God has given us?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Never mind the unknown commandments, were all the known ones kept?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Having God's commandments means to find them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How many believers plug their ears for fear that God may speak a commandment to them?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We not only ought to obey when God commands us, we ought to find His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, we must keep them once they are found.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Seeking God's commandments is our care for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is loving God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"He who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him" John 14:21b .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This speaks of the benefit of loving God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Though I have met many well-known children of God, I have yet to see but a few who know God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many can read the Bible, but they do not know God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They may understand the Bible, but they do not know the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Others preach without knowing what they are preaching because the Lord has not manifested Himself to them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even if the Lord were to stand before them, they still could not know Him without His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many have not experienced the Lord's manifestation because they do not love the Lord; neither do they keep the commandments of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only one kind of people love the Lord on this earth the faithful ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Never go to big and popular places to look for those who know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Oftentimes you will find one serving God in a secluded place or in a simple house.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When you see such a one, you meet God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some people always stir my respect.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Others may be zealous, capable, kind, humble, and gentle, but one does not necessarily see God through them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A certain one asked me once, "What were the strong points of this missionary?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I said, "There was always the sensation of God every time I saw her."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You should remember the great woman of Shunem who said to her husband, "I perceive that this is a holy man of God, which passeth by us continually" 2 Kings 4:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What had Elisha shown this woman?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He did not perform any miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, every time he came, he gave the woman the sensation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brothers and sisters, do we love God's manifestation?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do, we should employ every means to find God's commandments and keep them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him" John 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God and Christ are present with all who believe in Him; however, God and Christ only make an abode with those who love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is not just a matter of presence, but of an abode.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A presence at times cannot be felt.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But when one faithfully seeks God's commandments at all costs, he will experience the Lord making an abode with him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>John 15:9-10 says, "As the Father has loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love; even as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What does abiding in the Lord's love mean?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all sensed how much the Lord loved us when we were first saved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But today we do not sense His love that much.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Though we can still speak of the depth of the Lord's love, we do not feel it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we abide in the Lord's love, we should always sense such a love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Abiding in the Lord's love is just affording Him the opportunity to love.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In other words, it is to be enveloped in His love.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When others oppose and forsake us, we will really know how the Lord loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we always find God's commandments and obey them, we will abide in His love.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Did the Lord not sense the Father's love for even a single moment?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was constantly in the Father's love because He kept God's commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In order to abide in the Lord's love, we must always keep His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If the love of God is in us, we can keep even the most difficult of His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some forsook their parents, some their wives, others their positions, and still others their fame, all because they loved God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They were enabled by the very love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Romans 8:28 says, "And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many know this verse well.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only one kind of people enjoy the good: those who love God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you do not love God, perhaps not even one thing is working for you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God does not alter things; He changes your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you love God, then all things, though unaltered, will work for your good.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sometimes you complain about everything that comes your way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You complain concerning this and concerning that.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Yet if love is there, all these will mean nothing to you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Loving God will make an unsatisfactory environment a profitable one.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>First Corinthians 2:9-10 says, "But as it is written, Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard and which have not come up in man's heart; things which God has prepared for those who love Him.'</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What do we see in these two verses?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What God has prepared for those who believe is eternal life, yet the thing which God has prepared for those who love Him is in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Only those who love God can know of this coming blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If someone tells you about a marvelous thing he saw, it surely will not be comparable because the coming blessing has not yet been seen by eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If someone tells you about a wonderful thing he heard, it also must be a lesser thing than the coming blessing because no ears have heard it.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If someone can indeed imagine the unsurpassable best, it still cannot compare to the coming blessing because it has not yet entered into the heart of man.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Nevertheless, God has revealed to us by His Spirit this thing which no eyes have seen, no ears have heard, and what has not entered into man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In other words, a lover of the Lord may enjoy what men have not seen, heard, nor dreamed of in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When God discloses His glory to you, you will exclaim, "Oh, what joy!"</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This heavenly glory is so much that you will find it hardly bearable.</S>
