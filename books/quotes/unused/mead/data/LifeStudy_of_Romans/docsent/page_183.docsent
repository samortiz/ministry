   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FIFTY-FOUR DESIGNATION BY RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that in 1:1 Paul said that he was separated to the gospel of God, and then he goes on to say that the gospel of God concerns God s Son, Jesus Christ our Lord 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This indicates that the gospel of God is a gospel of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The goal of this gospel is to transform sinners into sons of God for the formation of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE PROCESS OF RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we consider this matter of sonship, certain important words command our attention: designation, resurrection, sanctification, transformation, conformation, glorification, and manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are being designated sons of God through the process of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this process a number of steps are involved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These steps include sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This glorification will also be the manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today people may not realize that we are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But on the day of our glorification, no one will need to ask us whether or not we are Christians, for we shall be manifested as sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That manifestation will be the consummation of the process of designation by resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification are not four altogether separate steps.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, as sanctification is going on, we are also being transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, as we are being transformed, the process of conformation begins to take place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually, as the spontaneous continuation and consummation of these processes, we shall reach the stage of glorification or manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When sanctification, transformation, and conformation reach their peak, that will be the time of our glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This glorification will be our manifestation as sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are presently undergoing the process of designation by resurrection, a process which will ultimately bring us to the point of manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The key to this process is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we speak of designation by resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE EXPERIENCE OF RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this message we need to consider the matter of resurrection in some detail.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We shall not look at it objectively, from the standpoint of doctrine, but subjectively, from the standpoint of the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Romans 6:5 speaks of the experience of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This verse says that we share in the likeness of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some students of the Word have said that the resurrection mentioned here is the first resurrection spoken of in Revelation 20:4 and 5.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But I do not believe that this is Paul s understanding of resurrection here.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul is not saying that we must wait until the millennium to participate in the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 6:5 Paul says that we have grown together with Christ in the likeness of His death and that we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This does not refer to a future, objective resurrection, but it refers to our present experience of Christ s resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not regard the resurrection merely as a future event, as Martha did in John 11.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord Jesus told her that He was the resurrection and the life v. 25 . His word indicates that there is no need for us to wait until a future day to have Him as resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Resurrection is not a matter of time or place; it is a matter of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we have Him, we have resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But if we do not have Him, we do not have resurrection life, neither now nor in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hallelujah, resurrection is Jesus, the Son of God!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As long as we have Jesus Christ, we have resurrection, no matter where we may be.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What a difference there is between the doctrinal teaching regarding resurrection and the subjective revelation of Christ as resurrection!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What we need today is not the objective teaching about resurrection, but the subjective, living, up-to-date experience of Christ as resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>CHRIST AS LIFE-POWER</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To say that Christ is resurrection means that Christ is the life-power.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Resurrection is life-power.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>With life there are the life-essence, the life-shape, and the life-power.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Firstly we have the life-essence and then we have the life-power.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Following this, we have the life-shape, the life-form.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Resurrection is Christ being the life-power to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is a very significant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In 1936 I paid a visit to one of the leading universities in China.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One of the students spoke to me about his difficulty in believing in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He told me that due to his modern scientific knowledge he could not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To him, resurrection was against scientific truth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Outside of the room where we were meeting there was a wheat field.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Drawing his attention to the wheat growing in the field, I pointed out that the wheat was produced by some grains of seed that were buried in the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I told him that, in a sense, those seeds died, but that now they had come forth in resurrection as wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Through that illustration of death and resurrection, this young man was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now he is one of the leading co-workers in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This illustration shows that resurrection is a matter of life-power.</S>
