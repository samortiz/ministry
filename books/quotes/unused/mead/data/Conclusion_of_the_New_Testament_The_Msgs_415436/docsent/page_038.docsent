   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Holy City, Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Aggregate of All the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Being the Bride, the Wife of the Lamb</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Revelation 21:9-10 says, One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ will be the Husband, and the holy city, Jerusalem the aggregate of all the saints will be the bride, the wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This will be the universal couple living a universal married life for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1 The Holy City</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The New Jerusalem is the holy city vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>2, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the holy city of God, the New Jerusalem is sanctified, fully separated unto God, and thoroughly saturated with God s holy nature to be His habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, the holy city is a constitution in life of the processed Triune God mingled with His regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite elect.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Holiness is the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Love reveals God s heart, righteousness is God s way, and holiness is God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only God Himself is holy 15:4 , for only God is separated and uniquely different from everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The New Jerusalem is a city that is absolutely saturated and mingled with God; therefore, it is absolutely holy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is entirely different from all other things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever we experience the mingling of God with us today, there is a real separation, a real holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In anything we do, if we have some experience of God in Christ being mingled with us, we experience holiness in that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Holiness signifies a separation from common things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more we are mingled with God in Christ, the more we will be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We will be different and separated from all things common.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be holy means to have something of God mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Holiness is not a matter of action but a matter of nature; it is not a matter of what we do but of how much we have been mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>An aloofness from everything is not holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Holiness is determined by how much we have experienced being mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hebrews 12 says that God disciplines us that we might partake of His holiness v. 10 . This means that He disciplines us that we may partake of His nature by being mingled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The New Jerusalem is absolutely and thoroughly mingled with God; therefore, it is the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the New Testament the word holy does not only mean separated unto God but also saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Old Testament to be made holy is to be separated unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no saturation of God in the Old Testament, and the holiness, or sanctification, there is only positional, not dispositional.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the New Testament, though, we see both the objective, positional holiness and sanctification and the subjective, dispositional holiness and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Romans 6:19 and 22 indicate that sanctification is something subjective and dispositional.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Old Testament a piece of gold could be made holy and sanctified by changing its position, by placing it in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet the church today is made holy not only positionally but also dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, both the positional sanctification in the judicial aspect and the dispositional sanctification in the organic aspect of God s complete salvation will ultimately be manifested in the New Jerusalem as the holy city Rev 21:2, 10; 22:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 1 Thessalonians 5:23 Paul prays that our whole being, spirit and soul and body, may be sanctified wholly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is dispositional sanctification in which the holy God is saturating us with His holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In positional sanctification there is only a change of position, but in dispositional sanctification there is the transformation in nature and in element.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, the New Jerusalem is holy not merely in the sense of the Old Testament but also in the sense of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Based upon this principle, we can see that the holy city, the New Jerusalem, could never be a physical city since a physical city could never be saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This city is composed with living persons who can be and who are saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the old Jerusalem and in the old temple we can see the separation but not the saturation with God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the New Testament, however, the church is God s temple 1 Cor 3:16 , and this temple is not only separated unto God but also saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The New Jerusalem is not the Old Testament city but the New Testament city a city saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The New Jerusalem is called the holy city because gold, which signifies God s holy nature, is the site of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the whole universe, only God is holy in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The New Jerusalem is built on gold.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The city proper of the New Jerusalem is gold, and its street is gold Rev 21:18, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On this gold the foundations are laid and the gates and wall are built.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God sanctifies us so that we may be established in His holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God s sanctifying us is a very important and particular item in God s organic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Not only is God Himself holy, but He also wants to make us holy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Eventually, He wants to make us the holy city, New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the universe God is holiness; whenever people touch God, they touch holiness cf.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Isa 6:2-3; Rev 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, in His organic salvation God s intention is to constitute us with His holy nature so that we may become the Body of Christ and ultimately be manifested as an established holy city, New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since all the believers will be the components of the holy city, all of them should be sanctified to be as holy as the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Unless we are made holy, we will not be qualified to be a part of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As the holy city, the New Jerusalem is composed of holy believers.</S>
