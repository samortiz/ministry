   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE REVELATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that a minister of God s word must have God s Word as the basis of his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He must also have the Holy Spirit to interpret God s word for him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we have to go on to consider another, even more important, matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A minister of God s word must know God s past speaking and have the interpretation of this speaking, but he must have another basic qualification: He must be a man of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If he does not have a spirit of revelation, he cannot serve as a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He must have revelation concerning God s Word and must possess the anointing of the Spirit concerning this Word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without revelation and without the anointing of the Spirit, he cannot serve as a minister of God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>ONE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Bible is an amazing book.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One outstanding characteristic of this book is that it is made up of words spoken by men, yet it is God s word in every sense.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was written by men, yet it was written by God s own hand in every sense.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It contains many expressions, sentences, and words, and God s breath is upon all of these words.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word used in 2 Timothy 3:16, which is translated as inspiration by some versions, is breath according to the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible is God s breath.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is written by holy men of God under the leading of the Holy Spirit 2 Pet 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When God created the world, He created man out of the dust of the earth, but the created man was not alive.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man became a living soul after God breathed His living breath into him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible is a book written by men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is composed of words spoken by men, but God s breath is upon it in addition to this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, it is a living book.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is the living word of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the meaning of all Scripture being God s inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This book, the Bible, contains human elements and human words.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When many people read this book, they touch only the human elements and words; they do not sense God s speaking in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What makes the Bible so unique is its dual character.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the one hand, there is the outward, physical dimension of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As far as man s physical dimension is concerned, he is made of the dust of the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But on the other hand, there is a spiritual dimension of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible is related to the Holy Spirit; it is God s speaking and God s breath.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As far as its outward shell is concerned, it was written from man s memory and can be retained in man s memory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It issued from man s mouth and is heard by man s ears.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is written in human language and understood by human understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man can preach the truths contained in this book, and these truths can be retained in man s memory, understood by man s mind, and passed on from one man to another.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All of these things go on when one deals with the outward shell of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the physical aspect of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Doctrines and teachings can be included in this category, because these are things that man s mind can grasp, things that can be understood and comprehended by his intellect.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the physical dimension of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, there is another dimension to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus said, The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life John 6:63b .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The other aspect of the Bible involves spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this dimension, God speaks His word within man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is not something that a clever man can understand or a man with a good memory can grasp.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nor is it something that an intelligent man can fathom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This requires another organ for understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The ears, the eyes, and the mind cannot see or understand this dimension of things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A minister of God s word serves the church not by touching the physical dimension of the Bible but by touching the spiritual dimension of it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who serve the church by touching only the physical dimension are not ministers of God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the Bible did not have a physical side, a man would either be a minister of God s word or not; there could be no mistake about it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But the Bible has physical and human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this aspect, it can readily be understood and accepted by man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is where the danger and problem lie.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Man can preach the human elements in the Bible by the power of his own human faculties, and he can presume that he is a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He can present all the human elements in the Bible to the church, and he can presume that he is serving the church with God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He can presume that the truths he preaches are scriptural truths and that they are teachings that conform to the orthodox and pure faith.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He can deceive himself by thinking that his teachings are orthodox teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But we have to realize that these teachings have nothing to do with the spiritual aspect of the Bible; they are of another realm.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some young people think that as long as they can understand Greek, they can understand God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Little do they realize that many people who understand Greek know very little of God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In fact, they may not know anything at all.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A man who understands Hebrew does not necessarily understand the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A man who understands Hebrew and Chaldean does not necessarily understand the book of Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A man who understands Chinese does not necessarily understand the Chinese Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Bible contains words which are beyond the Chinese language and the Greek language.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It contains words which the Hebrews or Chaldeans may not have understood.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The words that a minister of the word has to strive to understand are God s own words.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Not everyone who understands Chinese can understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Similarly, not everyone who understands Greek can understand God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is one thing to understand a language, and it is another thing to know God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In fact, it is an entirely different thing to know His word.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should never have the misconception that the more we study God s word, the more we can be a minister of His word.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is not a matter of whether or not we study the Bible, but how we study it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God has to speak His word into man before it can become God s word to him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Man has to know God s voice.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Only God can speak God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Man has to know God s voice, and God has to speak to him before he can become a minister of God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In preaching the gospel, we preach the gospel itself; we do not preach the basis of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We serve others with the gospel, not with the basis of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Bible is the basis of the gospel; it is the basis of God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, we cannot say in a general way that this is what God is speaking to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>God has spoken through this book.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Without a doubt, God spoke these words at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But God must breathe His breath through this book again today before it will become living to us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God s Spirit has to breathe into His word before it will become living to us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Today we still need God s revelation in His word so that this word can come alive to us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The difference between the word being living and dead is very great.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We must see what God s word is.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>God s word is His speaking today.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>God s word is not just His speaking in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>His past speaking was His word, but today He must breathe His breath once again upon this word.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>God s word is not just His speaking at some point in the past; it is His speaking today.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We have to realize that there are two realms to God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>One is the realm of the written Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The written word, including all the biblical doctrines, knowledge, teachings, prophecies, and truths, is in this realm.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>But this is only the visible realm of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We may have heard that Abraham believed in God and that God reckoned him to be righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>God s justification of those who believe may be nothing more than an outward teaching to us.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>A man with a good memory and strong intellect can preach this; he may think that he is preaching God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>But actually he is merely preaching the superficial aspect of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is not the ministry of God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We have to pay attention to what the Bible is.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The Bible is God s speaking in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>At one time God spoke, and the Spirit s breath was upon His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>When that word was released, some touched God s word, but some did not.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>When Paul wrote to the Romans, two things happened.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>First he wrote his letter utilizing some physical things.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>He might have written it on a lamb s skin and might have used some kind of tree sap for ink.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The words were recorded in some form of written language.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>This is the physical side of the Epistle, and this is the realm we are in when we read it in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>When Paul delivered this Epistle to the Romans, they might have been impressed with only the letter of the Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If this were the case, it would only be a letter and nothing else; there would not be God s word in it for them.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>But if while the Romans were reading it, God breathed His breath upon every single word, and every word was filled with God s breath, they would realize that they were sinners and that justification would come by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>They would believe in God s word and receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>This is the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>While they were reading, studying, and trying to understand God s word, they would touch the word that Paul was speaking through the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Another person who was clever, intelligent, and born with a good memory might be able to read Paul s Epistle with ease and might even be able to memorize it with little effort.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Yet he would not know the meaning of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>He could understand the doctrine of justification by faith, but he could not touch justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>He could touch the things that belong to the physical dimension of the Bible but not its spiritual dimension.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>He could only touch the doctrine of the Bible, the content of the Bible, and the surface of God s word; he could not touch the life in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>We have to realize what the Bible is.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>The Bible is God s past speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>It is the ministry of God s word by His servants in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>The book of Romans was Paul s past ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>At one time God spoke these words.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>But today when we read the book of Romans, we may only touch the surface of the Bible, the physical and outward side of it.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Today God has to breathe His breath upon this word once again before we can know God s word and before we can be a minister to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>It is not enough for God to breathe His breath just once.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>He has to breathe again before we can touch His word.</S>
