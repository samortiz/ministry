<h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S TESTIMONY</h2><p>You may find this hard to understand. Let me try to state it another way. Matthew 5 contains many precious teachings, but how many Christians in the church are practicing them? When I was young, I was once a class-leader at school. I was good at my studies, and none of my classmates were my equal. After I became a Christian, six classmates came to test me. They wanted to find out whether I practiced the teaching of Matthew 5. It was relatively easy not to retaliate when I was slapped. But it was difficult to turn my left cheek after the right cheek was slapped. When I was slapped that day, I could not maintain my Christian composure any longer. I wished in my heart that the great white throne would come quickly. After they left, I was happy that I had not hit back. But when I went to the Lord in my prayer, I could only confess my sins. I realized that there was bitterness within me. The outward suffering may be the same, but whether or not there is bitterness within makes a big difference.</p><h2 class="head1">THE STORY OF GOILS</h2><p>There once was a brother in the Middle Ages by the name of Goils. He was a good brother, and he worked as a cook in a monastery. Every time there was a conference in the monastery, men would come from many places, and he would prepare beef, lamb, chicken, duck, and vegetables for them for ten days. The monastery was situated on a mountain, and it was not an easy task to prepare so much food and carry all the foodstuffs to the monastery. He wanted to listen in on the conference, and he was unwilling to lose the opportunity to listen to the sermons and just cook for the others. The more he considered, the more he could not sleep at night. Eventually, the Lord shone His light on him and showed him that the cross is a matter of giving and not receiving and that everything was under God's sovereign arrangement. He realized his own mistake and repented. After he repented, he realized that the abbott's voice had become hoarse. He felt sorry for the abbott and prepared some special porridge for him when he came back from his work at midnight. Here is a man who was bearing the cross. He turned his left cheek to the others. Eventually, he became a blessing to many people through his knowledge of God.</p><h2 class="head1">THERE BEING NO HATRED, MURMURING,<br />AND SELF-PITYING WITH THE CROSS</h2><p>If turning the left cheek to others was merely a matter of performance, even unbelievers could do it. The issue is not about being slapped on the cheek, going the extra mile, or yielding the cloak; rather, it is about the ability to love from within and to be free from hatred.</p><p>What is the cross? The cross is the place where hatred disappears. There can only be love, not hatred. This is why there is no murmuring with the cross. Christ prayed for those who persecuted Him because there was no hatred in Him; there was only love. This is why He refused the wine mingled with gall.</p><p>Do we see many Christians suffering today? Surely we do. I have seen many suffering wives, suffering fathers, suffering sons, etc. But I have also noticed the difference in their expressions. Some do not say anything at the time of suffering (this is the most common case), yet behind one's back they murmur a great deal. If we find ourselves murmuring after something is over, it means that there is a feeling of suffering. The only reason we would need wine mingled with gall would be because we do not know what the cross is. Another group of people do not murmur or make any noise, yet they weep. There may be blood on the cross, but there should be no tears on the cross. A person weeps because he pities himself. There was no self-pitying on the Lord's cross; there was only pity toward others. Francis Havergal was a person plagued with sickness, but he often said, "Everyone pities me because of my sicknesses. Yet I never pity myself, because Christ has borne all my sicknesses."</p><h2 class="head1">ON THE CROSS AND BENEATH THE CROSS</h2><p>Only those who are beneath the cross weep. Those who are on the cross do not weep. If a man feels that he is wounded, he is not on the cross. As soon as some people suffer a little, they feel that they are being martyred. But this is not the cross. What is the cross? The Lord said, "If I be lifted up from the earth..." (John 12:32). Every one who is crucified is one who is lifted up. A crucified person is one who is on top. If you feel that you have been taken advantage of, that you have been slighted, you are a downtrodden one. If you are truly crucified on the cross, you will not feel wounded. The minute you feel wounded, you are not on the cross. The genuine cross only leads to silent prayers in the heart; there is no murmuring and no self-pitying. As long as there is the feeling of suffering, there is the need of wine mingled with gall.</p><p>The first thing we notice about Christ on the cross is that there was no murmuring. If one encounters certain circumstances and feels pain, it proves that he does not have the cross. Wherever there is the feeling of pain, there is wine mingled with gall. Do not think that a smiling face indicates that people are bearing the cross. Of course, neither does this mean that a weeping face indicates that people are not bearing the cross. A person who is genuinely bearing the cross has no feeling of suffering whatsoever.</p>
