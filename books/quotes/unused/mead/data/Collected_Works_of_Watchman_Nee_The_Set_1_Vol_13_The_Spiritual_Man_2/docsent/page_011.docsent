   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The flesh is forever condemned before God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God wants it to die.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A believer may not want the flesh to die, but may instead want to receive the Holy Spirit to adorn it and provide more power to work for God of course, this is absolutely impossible .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is our motive in all this?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Is our motive personal attraction, reputation, being welcomed by people, being admired by spiritual believers, success, acceptance by man, building up our own self?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those with unclean motives "double-minded" motives cannot receive the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may think that our motives are very clean, but our great High Priest will let us know through the environment whether or not our motives are really clean.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without coming to the point where our present work completely fails and people despise and reject us, considering our name to be evil, it will be very difficult to know whether or not our motive is completely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everyone who has really been used by the Lord has walked this path.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever the cross has accomplished its work, at that moment we receive the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Are there not many believers who do not have deep experiences of the cross, yet they have the power to witness for the Lord and have been greatly used by the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible tells us that in addition to the holy anointing oil, there is an anointing oil that is "like" it Exo 30:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is similarly compounded, but it is not the holy anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not desire success and greatness; we should only observe whether or not our old creation everything we have by birth has passed through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without the flesh passing through death, the power which we have is surely not the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All believers with spiritual insight, who have arrived at the other side of the veil, know that such successes have no spiritual value.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When a believer has condemned his flesh and walks according to the spirit, he can truly receive the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Otherwise, he wants his flesh to receive spiritual power.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the flesh does not pass through death, the spirit has no possibility of receiving power, because when the power of the flesh remains, the flesh still reigns and the spirit is oppressed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The power of the Holy Spirit only descends upon a spirit which is full of the Holy Spirit, because only then is there a possibility for the power of the Holy Spirit to flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the spirit is full, the power that comes in will overflow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, on the one hand, the believer must die to the old creation, and on the other hand, he must learn how to walk together with the Holy Spirit in his living.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then he can receive power.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every believer must seek for the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Understanding in the mind is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Holy Spirit must surround his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whether his work is effective depends on whether or not the believer has the experience of being baptized in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Holy Spirit needs an outlet.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What a pity that He cannot find an outlet in many believers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some are hindered by sin, some are proud, some are cold, some are filled with their own opinion, and some trust in the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The power of the Holy Spirit has no place to exude!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Besides the Holy Spirit, we still have too many sources!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the matter of seeking the power of the Holy Spirit, we must keep our mind clear and our will active.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This guards against the counterfeit of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moreover, we must let God remove from our lives, one by one, everything that belongs to sin and everything that is unrighteous and doubtful.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must consecrate our whole being to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"Receive the promise of the Spirit through faith" Gal 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rest in God and consider that God will do according to His Word in His own time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not forget this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If God delays, we must allow His light to examine our own living even more.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If God allows us to have some feeling when we receive the power, we may rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If He does not, we still should believe that He has done it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Just by looking at a believer's experience, we can tell whether or not he has received power.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whoever has received power will develop a very keen awareness of the senses of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He will receive eloquence albeit not worldly to witness for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His work will be effective and bear everlasting fruits.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Power is the basic condition for spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After a believer receives the power of the Holy Spirit, he will have a clear feeling concerning the senses of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the work of God, a believer must keep his spirit free to allow the Holy Spirit to flow out His life after he receives power.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To keep the spirit free is to keep the spirit always in the condition wherein the Holy Spirit can work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For example, God may command a believer to lead a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The spirit of this believer needs to be free.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He should not come into the meeting with many burdens or loads still in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This will cause the whole meeting to have a burden and become "hardened" and unbreakable.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The one who leads the meeting must not come to the meeting with his own burden, hoping that the congregation will function or assist him to be free of his burden.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Depending on the response of the congregation to free the leader of the meeting from his spiritual burden will result in failure.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A believer's own spirit must be buoyant and without entanglement when he arrives at the meeting place.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many at the meeting are full of burdens when they come.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The leader of the meeting must first release them by means of prayers, hymns, or the truth before he gives the message of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If the leader of the meeting has a burden from which he cannot be freed, how can he hope that others would be free?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must know that spiritual meetings are a fellowship between spirit and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A speaker releases a message from his spirit, and the listeners receive the words of God with their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Whether a believer is a leader or a listener, when his spirit has a burden and is not free, it is not able to open toward God and respond to God's words; therefore, a believer's own spirit must be free.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Furthermore, the leader must first endeavor to free the spirits of the congregation before delivering a message of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have to obtain the power of the Holy Spirit before we can do a powerful work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have to keep our spirit free for the power to flow out from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The expression of the power upon a believer is in different measures.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How much he experiences Golgotha will determine how much he will also experience Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If the spirit of the believer is really buoyant, the Holy Spirit will be able to work.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, in working, especially with regard to an individual, there is sometimes the experience of the spirit's being closed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This may be caused by the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Perhaps the person you are meeting has a particular condition which makes your spirit feel closed.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He may not have an open spirit and mind or the capability to receive the truth; he may have an improper thought in his mind that blocks the flowing out of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If others have these kinds of conditions, this will cause the spirit of the worker to feel closed.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In many instances, we only need to look at the attitude of the one who comes to us to know whether or not we can do a spiritual work toward him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we feel that our spirit has been closed because of him, we cannot spread the truth to him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If our spirit feels closed and we force ourselves to work, the work will probably not be from the spirit but rather just a product of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Only work done from the spirit has lasting and effective fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What is produced from the mind will always lack spiritual power.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we do not first remove a person's hindrances by prayers and preparative labor so that our spirit will be free to spread the Word of God, our work will lose its effectiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Believers must learn to walk according to the spirit so that they can work in the spirit.</S>
