<h1 class="title">THE DECLARATION<br />
OF THE ONLY BEGOTTEN SON</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:18; 5:19-20; 6:38; 7:16-18, 28-29; 8:13-16; 10:30, 37-38; 14:7-11; 17:21-22</h1>
<p>John 1:1-18 is an introduction to the Gospel of John. In this chapter, we will cover the last item in this introduction: &ldquo;The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&rdquo; (v. 18). This statement points out that God the Father is declared only through the Son; there is no declaration of God other than the declaration of the only begotten Son.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING TRIUNE&mdash;THREE YET ONE</h2>
<p>Verse 18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; This verse says that no one has ever seen God, but then it speaks of &ldquo;the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father,&rdquo; not &ldquo;the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of God.&rdquo; We must pay attention to the fact that John changes the term from <em>God</em> to <em>Father.</em> This points to the mystery of the Triune God. Whenever we speak of the Lord declaring the Father and expressing God, we must realize that this is a matter related to God being triune&mdash;three yet one.</p>
<p><em>Him</em> in verse 18 refers to God, not to the Father. We need to understand that <em>God</em> at the beginning of the verse includes both the Father and the Son; it does not refer only to the Father. The Father is God, and the Son is also God. We may use a hand as an analogy, although this illustration is not fully adequate. A hand has a palm and five fingers; that is, a hand includes a palm as well as five fingers. Similarly, God involves the Father as well as the Son. The Father is God, and the Son is also God. The Son is not apart from God. The Bible does not reveal two Gods; it reveals only one God.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John contains two sections. The first thirteen chapters speak of the Lord&rsquo;s coming, and the last eight chapters speak of the Lord&rsquo;s going. The entire Gospel of John speaks of the Lord&rsquo;s coming and going. In the Lord&rsquo;s coming, the Father is in the Son; in the Lord&rsquo;s going, the Son became the Spirit. In the Lord&rsquo;s coming, the Father came among men in the Son; in the Lord&rsquo;s going, the Son became the Spirit to enter into men (10:30, 37-38; 14:16-18). The Lord&rsquo;s coming was His incarnation, and His going was His death and resurrection. When the Word became flesh, the Son came with the Father among men. When the Lord went through death and resurrection, He became the Spirit to enter into the disciples. Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s coming and going are a story of the Word&rsquo;s incarnation and of the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection; it is a story of the Son coming from the Father and with the Father and of the Son becoming the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Father is in the Son, and the Son has become the Spirit; this is the story of the Triune God. God is one, but in person He is three. Although there are three persons&mdash;Father, Son, and Spirit&mdash;they are not three separate Gods. We can use another inadequate illustration. Ice, water, and vapor are actually the same thing in three different forms. Ice, when heated, becomes water; water, when heated, becomes vapor. The opposite is also true. When vapor meets cold air, it becomes water, and if the water is cooled down further, it becomes ice. Hence, ice becomes water, and water becomes vapor. Vapor turns into water, and water again turns into ice. Ice, water, and vapor are three forms of one substance.</p>
<p>There is only one God, but this one God is revealed in three persons. John 1:18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; Here we see that God incorporates both the Father and the Son. In chapter 14 we see that God also incorporates the Spirit. God is not only the Father and the Son, but the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</p>
<p>God the Father, who dwells in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16), was hidden in eternity. God the Son came forth from eternity and entered into time. He came from the heavens to the earth, from a realm of unapproachable light to a place where He could be contacted. He came forth in this way and was manifested among men and contacted by man as the Son. However, if He were only the Son, He could be contacted by man but He could not enter into man. When the Lord Jesus was on earth prior to His death and resurrection, He walked with Peter, James, John, and the other disciples, but He could not enter into them. For this reason, He had to change in form. Through death and resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit, and He came to the disciples to enter into them as the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; John 20:22). As the Spirit, He is able to enter into man. This is the Triune God.</p>
<p>The Father is the source, and the Son is the manifestation, the declaration. As the source, God dwells in unapproachable light in eternity in heaven as the Father. As the declaration, God is manifested to man as the Son. It is not necessary to ask whether or not a person has a father, because everyone has a father. Whenever we see a person, we see a son. Every son has a father. However, we cannot say that every man is a father because in order to be a father, a person must have at least one child. Although a son certainly represents his father, he may not be a father. Thus, the function of declaration belongs to a son, because not all men are fathers. A son always declares his father, because the declaration of a father depends on a son. Everyone who sees us knows that we have a father because we are a son.</p>
<p>It is also possible to have some understanding of a father by looking at his son. A son always expresses his father. A son resembles his father, not only in facial features but often in disposition and temperament. From the father&rsquo;s perspective, the father is the source of the son. From the son&rsquo;s perspective, the son is the declaration of the father, the expression of the father. The father is the source, and the son is the expression.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the Son; hence, He expresses the Father. However, if the Lord Jesus were merely the Son, He could not enter into us. Prior to His death, the Lord Jesus said to His disciples, &ldquo;Where I am going, you cannot come&rdquo; (13:33). <em>Going</em> is not a pleasant word. When someone we love tells us that he is going, we are not happy. Hence, when the Lord said that He was going, the disciples were sorrowful. Consequently, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Do not let your heart be troubled&rdquo; (14:1). Later, He said, &ldquo;It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you&rdquo; (16:7). He said that He would ask the Father to give them another Comforter, the Spirit of reality, to be with them always (14:16-17). The Spirit of reality is the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus. If He did not go, that is, if He did not pass through death and resurrection, He would not have been able to enter into the disciples as the Spirit. Because He went, the Spirit of reality was able to enter into the disciples to be with them always (vv. 16-20).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit comes in order to enter into man. The Father is the source, the Son is the manifestation, and the Spirit is the entering in. God is one in three persons. In His being hidden, unfathomable, and unapproachable, He is the source, the Father. In His being manifested for men to see, contact, touch, and know, He is revealed as the Son. In His entering into man to live in man, touch and operate in man, He is experienced as the Spirit.</p>
<p>Our relationship with God and our knowledge and experience of God must reflect these three stages. We need to acknowledge that God is both hidden and unfathomable (Rom. 11:33). We need to further acknowledge that God has been manifested among us and to us in the person of the Son of God, the Lord Jesus (1 Tim. 3:16; 2 Tim. 1:9-10; 1 Pet. 1:20; 1 John 4:2). We must acknowledge the Father and acknowledge the Son. As those who are saved, we must also acknowledge the glorious fact that the Spirit has entered into us to speak in us and operate in us (Rom. 8:11; 1 Cor. 3:16; 2 Tim. 1:14). When we have the Spirit, we have the Son, and when we have the Son, we have the Father.</p>
<p>A person who only acknowledges God as the source may not have the Son, the God who has been revealed and manifested. If he only acknowledges the existence of God, he cannot receive the Son, and in order to receive the Son, he must receive the Spirit. When the Holy Spirit touches a person and knocks on the door of his heart, he must open his heart and receive the Lord Jesus as his Savior. Then the Holy Spirit will enter into him. When a person has the Spirit, he has the Son, and when he has the Son, he has the Father.</p>
<p>In our salvation we experience the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. However, our experience does not begin with the Father but with the Spirit. Once we receive the Spirit, we give ground in our being to the Son, and when we have the Son, we have the Father. When we were first saved, we did not know how to explain this, but we experienced it. We all can recall the Holy Spirit knocking on the door of our heart and moving us to open our heart and confess that we were sinners in order to receive the Lord Jesus as our Savior. At that moment the Holy Spirit entered into us. As soon as we experienced this, we had a sense that the Lord was in us, and we also had a deep sense that God was our Father.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> </body></html>
