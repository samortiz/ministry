[1]  Nearly everything found in Genesis 1 through 3 is a seed that grows throughout the following books of the Bible, appearing as a crop in the Epistles of the New Testament and ripening into a harvest in the book of Revelation.
[2]  In this booklet I want to point out this principle once again as we consider the three main items found in Genesis 3:15: the serpent, the woman, and the seed of the woman.
[3]  In Genesis 3:15 the serpent is a little seed, in the Gospel of John this seed grows, and in the book of Revelation this seed becomes a harvest.
[4]  One day the Lord Jesus asked His disciples, "Who do you say that I am?" and Peter immediately responded, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" Matt 16:15-16 .
[5]  Secondly, as all the fundamental teachers agree, this woman also refers to Mary, the mother of Jesus, because the seed of the woman was the Lord Jesus.
[6]  Throughout the generations the woman, signifying the people of God, has been attacked by the serpent.
[7]  However, once this seed reaches the development of the manchild unveiled in Revelation 12, it is no longer only the Lord Jesus Himself, but the Lord and the overcoming part of His Body.
[8]  When the Lord Jesus was born in the manger, He was the individual seed of the woman, and when He was crucified on the cross to be our Redeemer, He was still this individual seed.
[9]  We have seen that the seed of the woman is Christ.
[10]  This Christ was born of a woman, even of a virgin Isa 7:14; Matt 1:23; Gal 4:4 .
[11]  When this seed of the woman was on earth, Satan, the serpent, was the strong man, and the Lord exercised His authority to bind him Matt 12:29 .
[12]  We are the co-overcomers with Christ because we have the overcoming seed within us.
[13]  The serpent has grown into a dragon Rev 12:9; 20:2 , the individual woman has grown into a corporate woman Rev 12:1 , and the individual seed of the woman has grown into a corporate manchild Rev 12:5 .
[14]  I believe that the Lord has shown us clearly the serpent, the woman, and the seed of the woman The seed of these three items is in Genesis 3:15, and the harvest of them all is in Revelation 20 through 22.
