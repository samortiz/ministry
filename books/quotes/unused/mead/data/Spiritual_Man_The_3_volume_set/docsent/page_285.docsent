   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A restless mind is a mind that is frequently disturbed.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The mind should not be dominated by the emotional life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should work by faith, understanding its principle, and be quiet and restful in God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is what "sobermindedness" means 2 Tim 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Believers should no longer depend on "voices," "visions," or "lights" as the base of their guidance.</S>
