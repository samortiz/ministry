   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sixth, Christ is the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is no argument about this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As the Son, Christ is the image of the invisible God Col 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moreover, all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the Son, He is the embodiment and expression of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Seventh, Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First Corinthians 15:45 says, The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>. No creed is large enough to contain Isaiah 9:6 and 1 Corinthians 15:45.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Who is the life-giving Spirit spoken of in 1 Corinthians 15:45?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without doubt, it is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ, the last Adam, became this life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Is this life-giving Spirit different from the Spirit in the Godhead?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Certainly not.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you say that this life-giving Spirit is different from the Spirit in the Godhead, then you are heretical, because you have two life-giving Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, Now the Lord is that Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord here is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, Jesus is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some Christians may say, If the Son is the Father and the Lord is the Spirit, then are They one or three?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The answer is that They are both one and three.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although I cannot explain this, I do know that They are both one and three because the Bible tells us so.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this matter, we should all adopt the attitude taken by Martin Luther, who said:</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who neglect the Scripture and approach such questions as the Trinity with confidence in their own mental power are the teachers of God, not His pupils....If reason disturbs you here and questions arise like those of the Turks: Are there, then, two gods?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Answer: There is only one God, and still there is the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How is this possible?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Respond with humility: I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Trinity is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are both one and three.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do not know how this can be, and we should not try to know.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To do so means that you intend to be God s teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because the Trinity is a mystery, no one can understand it adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All we can do is simply believe it according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Bible says that there is one God, and we say, Hallelujah, there is one God!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible says that this God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and we say, Hallelujah, our God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, the Bible also says that the Son is called the Father and that the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To this, we should also say, Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this message we have seen seven matters relating to Christ s divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have seen that Christ is God, the Creator, the Lord, Jehovah, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now I would ask you this question: How many do you have in your experience?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you first have God and then the Creator, the Lord, Jehovah, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No, in experience we do not have seven; we have one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In our experience God is the Creator, the Creator is the Lord, the Lord is Jehovah, Jehovah is the Father, the Son is called the Father, and the Son is also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hallelujah, we have such an all-inclusive One!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you exercise your mentality over this matter, you will say that you have seven, because your mentality has been saturated and permeated with the traditional teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to this mentality, you first have God the Father, then you have the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To you, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You dare not say this, but deep within, unconsciously or subconsciously, you hold such a concept.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The reason many hold this concept is that they have taken in too much of the garlic of traditional doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They do not have the fresh air of the pure Word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to the pure Word of the Bible, our God is Triune: the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Moreover, the pure Word reveals that the Son is called the Father and that the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thus, we do not have three Gods; we have just one God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our Christ is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we have Him, we have God, the Creator, the Lord, Jehovah, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All that the divine Being is, we have in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This Christ has become our Savior, our life, and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By eating this Christ and enjoying Him, we become the material for the building of God s house.</S>
