The matters of behavior and the building up of character have been the subjects of teaching ever since humankind came into being
The law is the portrait of God, demanding God's people to keep it that they might be made copies of God for His expression and glorification
For God to create man in His own image means that God created man according to what He is, that is, according to His attributes
The law, which was written according to God's attributes, demands that man behave and build himself up according to God
Proverbs stresses wisdom that man receives of God through his contacting of God and that teaches man how to behave in his human life
Ecclesiastes stresses the vanity of vanities of all the things under the sun, which is realized by man through the wisdom received from God
If you have contacted God and have received wisdom of God, you will see that everything under the sun is a vanity, a chasing of the wind
A lover of Christ should be one who is attracted by His love and drawn by Him in His sweetness to pursue after Him for full satisfaction
God's purpose in creating man is to have man be filled with Him to be His expression, not an expression of human perfection
God does not want us just to seek the knowledge, doctrine, truth, theology, and so-called revelation in letters
God wants us to seek after Him that we may gain Him and that He may fill us up with Himself for His expression
By this we have to realize that what the book of Proverbs would be to us depends upon what kind of persons we are and by what way we take it
The next matter that we need to see is the sound attitude the New Testament believers should have toward Proverbs
As New Testament believers, we should believe that Proverbs is a part of the holy word in God's holy Scriptures
We should realize that Proverbs is the breath of God for us to breathe in that we may receive the life supply from God
Proverbs has four sections: the collection of Solomon , the collection of Hezekiah , the word of Agur , and the word of King Lemuel
They may be very interested in what Ephesians 5 says about husbands loving their wives and about wives submitting to their husbands
Each of these principles revering God, needing wisdom, honoring one's parents, and holding marriage in honor is a nugget
To revere God is to consider and regard Him in everything, never forgetting that He is the wonderful God who has created us
Revering God also causes us to be touched by the sufferings of others and to show mercy and compassion to them
The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge and wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding
Proverbs 3:9-10 says that we must honor Jehovah with our substance and with the firstfruits of all our produce
Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, for her profit is better than the profit of silver, and her income is better than gold
In 8:22-31 personified wisdom says that Jehovah possessed her in the beginning of His way, before His works of old
Wisdom was daily His delight, rejoicing always before Him, rejoicing in His habitable earth; and wisdom's delight was in the sons of men
Corinthians 1:24 says, 'To those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God'
Verse 30 continues, 'Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption'
In the Ten Commandments the first four, concerning God, and the fifth, concerning honoring our parents, are on the first of the two tablets
Verse 4 goes on to speak of our finding favor and a reputation for fine understanding in the sight of God and man
We should not despise the chastening of Jehovah, nor be weary of His discipline; for whom Jehovah loves He disciplines
The writer says in 4:3 that he was a son to his father, tender and the only beloved in the sight of his mother
The eye that mocks at his father and despises to obey his mother the ravens of the valley will pick it out and the young eagles will eat it
That man can exist on earth to continue God's economy, honoring parents and holding marriage in honor are necessary
Regarding this, Proverbs 5:5-19 gives us a warning about the 'strange woman,' whose feet go down to death and whose steps hold fast to Sheol
Verses 15 through 19 conclude with a charge to married men to drink waters out of their own cistern and running water out of their own well
Their springs should not be shed forth like streams of water in the streets but should be theirs alone and not for strangers
Verses 18 and 19 say, 'Let your fountain be blessed,/And rejoice in the wife of your youth,/A lovely hind and a graceful doe
We should live such a person by the power of resurrection and by the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ
When we are such persons, we can come to the Bible not merely by exercising our mentality but mainly by exercising our spirit
In our spirit there is the marvelous, wonderful, processed, all-inclusive, sevenfold-intensified, life-giving Spirit
In chapters ten through nineteen many proverbs show us a contrast between doing righteousness in wisdom and doing wickedness in folly
Those who are perverse in heart are an abomination to Jehovah, but those who are perfect in their way are His delight
There is one who scatters and increases yet more, and there is one who withholds what is appropriate but ends up only in want
As for him who withholds grain, the people will curse him; but blessing will be upon the head of him who sells it
There is one who pretends to be rich yet has nothing; there is one who pretends to be poor yet has great wealth
The fear of Jehovah leads to life, and he who has it will lodge in contentment; he will not be visited with evil
Many saints have practiced the pray-reading of the Word without using this expression to describe what they were doing
My burden in these messages on Proverbs is to help you touch the Word of God by your new man, by exercising your spirit to pray-read
Ephesians 6:17-18 unveils the matter of pray-reading, and our invention of the term pray-reading was based on these verses
When we pray-read the Word by exercising our spirit, the word in black and white immediately becomes the Spirit
If this is not our situation, then even in our reading of the Bible we are not in the new man but are still in the old man
We have pointed out that in Proverbs there are many detailed precepts for man to live a proper human life and that every precept is a gem
A certain teaching in the Bible may be very good, but we should not take it as something to cultivate our self and build up our natural man
If we come to the Bible in this way, we will be touching the Word by the new man and it will become to us a book of Spirit and life
When you sit to eat with a ruler, consider carefully who is before you; and put a knife to your throat if you are a man of great appetite
Do not eat the bread of one who is envious, and do not desire his delicacies; for as he thinks within himself, so he is
Proverbs 20:16 says, 'Take his garment when he becomes a surety for a stranger, and hold the pledge when he becomes surety for foreigners'
Take the garment of him who is surety for a stranger, and hold one in pledge who is surety for a foreign woman
When you set your eyes upon it, it is gone;/For wealth certainly makes itself wings, /Like an eagle that flies toward heaven'
The ruler who lacks understanding is also a great oppressor, but he who hates unjust gain will prolong his days
Proverbs 23:23 charges us, saying, 'Buy truth, and do not sell it;/Buy wisdom and instruction and understanding'
Proverbs 23:13-14 says, 'Do not withhold correction from a child;/If you beat him with the rod, he will not die
Proverbs 22:6 charges us to train up a child according to the way he should go; even when he is old, he will not depart from it
Finally, 29:17 admonishes us, saying, 'Correct your son, and he will give you rest;/He will also give delight to your soul'
Without these five things as the factors we cannot have the Godmen the new man the new creation the Body of Christ and the New Jerusalem
Although Proverbs is a book in the Bible, when we contact it by our natural man, it is not the word of God to us
These words are the word of God because they are in the Bible, and the Bible is God's breathing , God's exhaling of Himself
When we come to contact the word in the Bible by our natural man, by our mind, it is not the word of God to us
Christ crucified, terminated, the fallen old man, but He regenerated, germinated, our God-created humanity with God's life
What Christ terminated on the cross was the fallen humanity, the fallen old man, yet the God-created humanity remained to be resurrected
Now after we have been regenerated to be a new man, we still have our humanity, but it is a resurrected, regenerated humanity
Because this is a difficult matter for believers to understand, we need to have a clear vision concerning the old man and the new man
The humanity which we have today is not the old, terminated, fallen humanity but the new, germinated, uplifted humanity
The word in Proverbs will become spirit and life to us, not to cultivate our natural man but to cultivate our regenerated new man
In this message we will continue to consider the admonitions and teachings found in chapters twenty through twenty-nine
In 23:22 the writer says, 'Listen to your father who begot you,/And do not despise your mother when she is old'
Whoever robs his father or his mother and says, 'It is no transgression,' is the companion of a man who destroys
Proverbs 25:17 says, 'Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor's house, otherwise he will become weary of you and hate you'
Concerning dealing with enemies we should not say, 'I will recompense evil'; we should wait for Jehovah, and He will save us
Verses 11 through 14 speak of four detestable generations: 'There is a generation that curse their father,/And do not bless their mother
The eye that mocks at his father and despises to obey his mother the ravens of the valley will pick it out and the young eagles will eat it
Verse 32 says, 'If you have been foolish in exalting yourself,/Or if you have thought an evil scheme,/Put your hand upon your mouth'
The churning of milk produces butter, and the wringing of the nose brings forth blood, so the pressing of wrath brings forth strife
According to this sequence, God put Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs together and placed them immediately before the prophets
Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs are placed at the end of the section of the law, just before the prophets
We may know the position of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs in the Bible, but we may not know the way to take the book of Proverbs
In His redemption, God, on the one hand, destroys what is fallen and, on the other hand, rescues what was created by Him
At this juncture we need to point out that, according to the Bible, God's redemption includes not only death but also resurrection
In resurrection God used His own life, nature, and element as the substance to uplift the redeemed created man
In one sense Gods redemption has already been accomplished but the application or the practice of Gods redemption requires a long process
We were sealed by the Spirit when we were saved initially, and this sealing will proceed until the day of redemption
Redemption in its entirety was accomplished by God in an instant, but in practice and application redemption is still not finished
Romans 8:23 says that we who have the firstfruits of the Spirit groan in ourselves, eagerly awaiting sonship, the redemption of our body
The big proverbs like nuggets and the small ones like gems are not for us to build up our old man to cultivate our self and our natural man
In this message we will give an introductory word to the life-study of Ecclesiastes and then begin to consider the book itself
Ecclesiastes in Hebrew is Qohelet, meaning 'preacher' , one who gathered and spoke to an assembly of the children of Israel
In his conclusion, this is all vanity of vanities and a chasing after wind to the human life of fallen mankind
Because creation has been made subject to vanity and to the slavery of corruption, everything under the sun is vanity
According to our own experience we know that whenever we have a success in our human life, we also have an empty feeling
On the other hand, certain things in human life, such as education, work, and marriage, are still very appealing
If mankind had been terminated, Christ could not have come, for there would have been no lineage for His incarnation
In this way mankind is preserved for God to fulfill His purpose in choosing us before the foundation of the earth
There is nothing better than that a man take his portion to rejoice in his works, for who will bring him to see what will be after him?
Solomon praised the dead more than the living and even the more the one who has not yet been and has not seen the evil work under the sun
In this message we will continue to consider the writer's experiments and then go on to see his searching and testing
Verse 1b charges us to draw near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools, who do not know that they are doing evil
We should not be rash with our mouth and not let our heart hastily utter anything before God, for God is in heaven and we are on the earth
The ones who love silver and love abundance with income will not be satisfied, and the fullness of the rich will not let him sleep
The rich man keeps his riches to his own hurt, and his riches are lost in a bad venture and nothing is left for his son
A man begets a hundred children and lives many years, but his soul is not filled with good and he even does not get a proper burial
In verse 12 the writer asks Who knows what is good for a man in life during the few days of his vain life which he will spend as a shadow
We are living in the world and passing through the 'vanity fair,' but we should not linger in it for its vainglory
Man should fear God that he may gain the wisdom from God to know how to live the human life and to know God further
They are the conclusion of the writer's research in his experiments of the fallen men's human life under the sun
A lover of Christ should be one who is attracted by His love and drawn by Him in His sweetness to pursue after Him for full satisfaction
A lover of Christ should be one who is called by Him to be delivered from the self through his oneness with the cross of Christ
A lover of Christ should be one who is called by Him to live in ascension as the new creation of God in the resurrection of Christ
In the fourth stage the lover of Christ lives within the veil, in the inner chamber of the whole universe, the Holy of Holies
After ascension there is still the need of another following stage living within the veil through further experience of the cross
Song of Songs is a particular book in the holy Scriptures, for it is not a book of history, law, prophecy, or gospel
Song of Songs is a history of the wise King Solomon, the writer of this book, with the Shulammite, a girl of the countryside
Since God is great and wise and we are small and unwise, we may find it hard to believe that God could fall in love with us
As the record of a divine romance, the Bible first shows us that God loves His elect Israel as a Husband who loves His wife
The contents of Song of Songs are the progressive experience of an individual believer's loving fellowship with Christ
Your anointing oils have a pleasant fragrance;/Your name is like ointment poured forth;/Therefore the virgins love you'
The church life is indicated by another figure the flock , which signifies the church as a collection of many believers
In fellowship with Christ, the lover and her companions extol His love with joy and rejoicing, for rightly do they love Him
She was persecuted by her denominational brothers , and she was turned away from the church by the flocks of His companions
Christ answered, 'If you yourself do not know,/You fairest among women,/Go forth on the footsteps of the flock'
The Beloved appreciates her loveliness in submission to Him and her beauty in obedience to the transforming Spirit
The transforming Spirit and the lover's companions will adorn her with the constitution of the life of God by the redeeming work of Christ
If we realize this, we will praise the Lord Spirit that He has given us many companions to be His helpers in transforming us
In the built-up vital groups, the lovers of Christ spontaneously spread their pleasant fragrance toward Christ
He appreciates her as His love among the worldloving adulteresses who lives a pure and trusting life among the filthy and unbelieving people
They care about the things of others and not about their own need to love the Lord and to grow in the divine life
In her Christian life she has reached the goal of resting in and experiencing Christ and being satisfied in the church life
As we will see when we come to the next section, Christ does not intend that His lover stay in this first stage
In Song of Songs 2:8 3:5 the lover of Christ is called by Him to be delivered from the self through her oneness with the cross
The clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice surely signify the cross as the place of safety for fallen man
Although the self has no figure in Song of Songs, according to Christian experience it is manifested in the second stage
As we will see when we come to the end of Song of Songs, the lover of Christ eventually sighs because she is still in the old creation
She has been remade by God to be a new creation yet according to Gods economy God has allowed a part of the old creation to remain with her
In helping others who are seeking to be spiritual, we may encourage them to pray and to confess their shortcomings to the Lord
Many 'hills' and 'mountains' frustrate us from coming to Him, but He is never frustrated, for He can 'leap' and 'skip'
The word hind in the title of Psalm 22, which is concerned with resurrection, signifies Christ in resurrection
His standing behind 'our wall' signifies that the lover's introspection as the problem in her self is a separation between her and Him
My beloved responds and says to me' in verse 10a indicates that the lover of Christ failed to respond to Him in His fellowship
Flowers appear on the earth;/The time of singing has come,/And the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land
flowers,' 'singing,' 'voice of the turtledove,' 'blossom,' and 'fragrance' indicate the flourishing riches of Christ's resurrection
Sometimes it takes a year or more before such a one can be helped to get away from the introspection of the self
Whereas in the New Testament we have a clear word concerning the cross, in Song of Songs the cross is signified by figures of speech
Here Christ was indicating to His lover that she could enter into the experience of the cross by the power of His resurrection
Christ charges His lover to be aware of her peculiarities, habits, and introspections which ruin the resurrection for His lover
Until the day dawns and the shadows flee away,/Turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young hart/On the mountains of Bether'
She will rise up from her introspection to seek her Beloved in the ways and in the methods of the heavenly Jerusalem
The mother's house was the place where she was born, and the mother's chamber was the place where she was conceived
Although the lover of Christ fell into introspection, one day she woke up and realized that she was a sinner saved by grace
She brought Christ to her mother's house, where she was born by grace, and to the chamber, where she was conceived in love
The power of Christ's resurrection is signified by Christ as a gazelle and a hart leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills
The riches of Christ's resurrection are signified by the plants, the voice of the turtledove, and the various fragrances in the spring
Although we are on earth, as believers in Christ our regenerated spirit is joined to God the Spirit in the heavens
After calling us to the cross, Christ calls us further to live in ascension as the new creation in resurrection
All of them wield the sword and are expert in war; / Each man has his sword at his thigh / Because of the night alarms'
Its posts he made of silver Its bottom of gold Its seat of purple Its midst was inlaid with love From the daughters of Jerusalem
Your eyes are like doves behind your veil; / Your hair is like a flock of goats / That repose on Mount Gilead'
Your lips are like a scarlet thread, / And your mouth is lovely; / Your cheeks are like a piece of pomegranate / Behind your veil'
Your neck is like the tower of David, / Built for an armory: / A thousand bucklers hang on it, / All the shields of the mighty men'
Look from the top of Amana, / From the top of Senir and Hermon, / From the lions' dens, / From the leopards' mountains'
Your lips drip fresh honey my bride Honey and milk are under your tongue And the fragrance of your garments Is like the fragrance of Lebanon
He considers her not as something open and public but as an enclosed garden, a shut up spring, and a sealed fountain
Blow upon my garden: / Let its spices flow forth; / Let my beloved come into his garden / And eat his choicest fruit'
She wants the difficult environment and the pleasant environment to work on her as a garden that its fragrance may be spread
The Beloved answers, inviting His beloved 'friends,' the Triune God, to eat, drink, and drink deeply, to enjoy her with Him
Look from the top of Amana, / From the top of Senir and Hermon, / From the lions' dens, / From the leopards' mountains'
The truth refers to the reality of the Triune God-all that God is, all that Christ is, and all that the Spirit is
The victory has been gained, but the lions and the leopards, which signify Satan and his evil forces, are still there
God's economy in saving us is first to regenerate our dead spirit by imparting Himself into it as the divine element, making our spirit new
Regardless of whether it is good or bad, right or wrong, whatever we do, if we do it in our soul, we are living by the old man
If we do not know our spirit, if we do not know how to discern our spirit from our soul, we cannot be a spiritual person
We should not think that discerning the spirit from the soul is something that is too difficult for us to learn
In 5:2-6:3 the lover of Christ is called more strongly to live within the veil through the cross after resurrection
After God gave Paul high revelations, there was given to him 'a thorn in the flesh' to warn him that he still had the flesh
Paul did not consider it suitable to take with them this one who withdrew from them in Pamphylia and did not go with them to the work
There was a sharp contention, so that they separated from each other; and Barnabas, taking Mark along, sailed away to Cyprus'
We need a stronger call, not merely to remain in ascension but to learn the lessons of the cross and live within the veil
In our experience the veil, the flesh, must be riven, and then we need to pass the riven veil to live in the Holy of Holies
Let us now begin to consider the stronger calling of the cross after resurrection and after the lover's failure
My beloved is knocking Open to me my sister my love My dove my perfect one For my head is full of dew My locks with the drops of night
The lover realized that her old man, the outward man, was crucified and her new man, the inward man, is living
She heard her Beloved knocking and asking her to open to Him reminding her of His suffering as He suffered at Gethsemane for His crucifixion
His head being 'full of dew' and His locks with 'the drops of night' refers to Christ's suffering at night in Gethsemane before His death
Her Beloved showed His pierced hand through her narrow opening so that her inner parts were moved to yearn for Him
From experience we know that, on the one hand, we may reject the Lord, but, on the other hand, we may not close the door entirely
The ones who watch over God's people , not knowing her problem, struck and wounded her, thinking that she would be helped by their striking
She charged them to tell her Beloved that she is sick with love, considering that her Beloved may have some concern about her love for Him
In verses 10 through 16 she answered by giving her impression of her Beloved, appraising Him with many excellent and detailed expressions
His expression of sentiment is single and pure, flowing like the river of life, distinct and clear and in proper order
His cheeks are like a bed of spices, / Mounds of sweetly fragrant herbs; / His lips are lilies, / Dripping with liquid myrrh'
His inward parts are full of deep, tender feelings wrought through His sufferings under a clear heavenly vision
His legs are pillars of white marble, / Set upon bases of gold; / His appearance is like Lebanon, / As excellent as the cedars'
My beloved has gone down to his garden, / To the beds of spices, / To feed in the gardens / And gather lilies'
The Lord is feeding, shepherding, and pasturing us that we may grow all kinds of spices and fragrances to satisfy Him
She tells them, according to her faith, that she belongs to her Beloved and He to her and that He is now feeding His pure and trusting ones
In our spiritual experiences we were attracted by the Lord's love and drawn by the Lord Himself in His sweetness
In this fellowship we were instructed concerning how to enter into the church life, and in the church life we are being transformed
God's economy is to keep us living in ascension as a new creation in resurrection, no matter how spiritual we may be
We might think that in resurrection there should no longer be the flesh, but God still needs it in order to work something in us
Romans 5 says that those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life
Even though we may be royal and live in ascension as God's new creation in resurrection, there is still a veil in the heavenly sanctuary
To build up the church in a general way requires only the capacity to manage, arrange, and take care of things
Timothy 3 speaks of the arrangement of elders and deacons in their service, but Ephesians does not speak of elders and deacons
It is the organic Body of Christ, which will consummate the organic New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth
When the Lord says, 'Turn your eyes away from Me,' He is really saying that we should put our eyes on Him all the time
My dove, my perfect one, is but one; / She is the only one of her mother; / She is the choice one of her who bore her
Her Beloved praises her as the dawn, being beautiful as the moon and clear as the sun, bringing and shining the light on others
By the end of chapter six the lover, having passed through various stages of transformation, has become Solomon's duplication
She is now called Shulammite , for she has become the same as Solomon in life, nature, and image to match him for their marriage
The New Jerusalem is a mingling of divinity and humanity to express the processed, consummated Triune God in human virtues
Song of Songs indicates that a lover of Christ should reach the maturity in His royal life to reign as a king with Christ
The Spirit reviews her beauty in the gospel preaching and in her standing power through the skillful transforming work of God the Spirit
Song of Songs 72 goes on to say Your navel is a round goblet That never lacks mixed wine Your belly is a heap of wheat Fenced in by lilies
We must learn to keep the work open, so that others can come to sojourn there and we can go to sojourn elsewhere
The Pentecostal movement has stressed power and miracles, yet little attention has been paid to the matter of life
The Assembly of God has given more emphasis to the teaching of the truth, but it also has neglected the matter of life
Andrew Murray was helped by him and was among the first to see that the New Testament Spirit of God has an element of humanity
He said that the Spirit of the glorified Jesus, the resurrected Christ who is the Spirit, contains His glorified humanity
Nee received much help in the early days from the writings of these teachers and from other good writings from the second century forward
Through our experience we have learned that to work together with the Lord we must be mature in life and we must teach the high truths
Christ answers that she is a sinner who has repented and has been saved by grace through regeneration in Him as the Provider of life
We have a little sister, / And she has no breasts: / What shall we do for our sister / On the day when she is spoken for'?
If she is a wall, / We will build on her a battlement of silver; / And if she is a door, / We will enclose her with boards of cedar'
Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon: / He let out the vineyard to keepers; / Each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit
We as His lovers still should give Him as our Beloved what we should give, not as a duty but as a matter of love
Christ as our Beloved, joining Himself to us as one, still likes to give us, as His lovers joined to Him as one, a reward of righteousness
According to the Lord's requirement, we should pay Him the one thousand shekels, that is, pay Him what He requires
According to Matthew 25 the Lord requires not only what He has delivered to us but what He has given to us with interest
May such a progress with its stages be a landmark to us in the course of our pursuing of Christ for His and our mutual satisfaction!
Through the writings of those who have gone before us especially through Brother Nees study of this book Song of Songs has been opened to us
Christ wants to see His lover's lovely countenance and hear her sweet voice in her oneness, union, with the cross
The third stage is to be called by Christ to live in ascension as the new creation of God in the resurrection of Christ
Look from the top of Amana, / From the top of Senir and Hermon, / From the lions' dens, / From the leopards' mountains'
When we live in ascension, we realize that the war is over, that the victory has been gained, and that the enemy has been destroyed
We may think that the third stage is the highest stage, but according to Song of Songs there is yet another stage
The fourth stage is to be called by Christ more strongly to live within the veil through His cross after the experience of His resurrection
We should not think that once we have arrived at the heavenly sanctuary, we have already attained the highest point of spiritual experience
Even after we have experienced resurrection and ascension, we still need the cross in order to live in the Holy of Holies within the veil
We experience the cross in the second stage, but we need to have the deeper experience of the cross in the fourth stage
