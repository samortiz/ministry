   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the joyous occasions only produce the thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The more you pursue the fashion of this age, the more fashion you have to pursue; the more you desire beauty, the more beauty there is for you to go after.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the end only makes you more thirsty and dissatisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord has the living water The Lord cried out and said, If anyone thirst, because He wanted man to realize what man s real need is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His crying was not only to make man realize he is thirsty, but also to show that He has the living water to quench man s thirst.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The living water of the Lord is the Lord s life and the Lord s Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How the living water flows out from the Lord The Lord s life-giving water came out of His broken body through the death on the cross, just like the living water which came out of the smitten rock.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why the Lord said here, If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To drink is to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After saying, Come to Me and drink, the Lord continued, He who believes in Me. So to believe is to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Believe in what?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord said, Believe in Me. To believe is to receive the Lord into you, that is, to believe that the Lord died for you on the cross and released His life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When you thus believe in Him, you are receiving Him in, and His Spirit and His life will flow into you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such a believing not only results in the living water flowing into you, but also causes the living water to become rivers of living water flowing out of you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Give examples to illustrate how a person is satisfied and happy when he drinks of the living water, the life-giving water.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As a result of drinking, rivers of living water just flow out of him to meet others needs and to quench others thirst.</S>
