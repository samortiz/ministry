   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HEALING OF THE SOIL Chosen by God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that in Mark the Lord Jesus gathered the soil and put it into His pocket in order to sow Himself into it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But according to the cases recorded in the Gospel of Mark, this soil was in a pitiful condition.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How could the Lord use soil that is sick, contaminated, and corrupt?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some may think that He should cast such useless soil away.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the Lord cannot cast away those who were chosen by God and predestinated before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In a very real sense, the Lord Jesus did not have a choice.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The disciples had been marked out, predestinated.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How could He reject them?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Father had chosen them before the foundation of the world, and the Lord had come to do the will of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, He could not cast aside the disciples, even though as soil they were in such a pitiful condition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What, then, could the Lord do about the soil?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the Gospel of Mark indicates, it was necessary for Him to heal this soil and turn it into good soil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through Death and Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have seen that, according to the Gospel of Mark, the soil was in a pitiful condition.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How could it be healed?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The proper way to heal the soil is for it to pass through a process of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In principle, this is the way healing takes place in our physical bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We thank the Lord that in His creation of man s body He ordained such a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Otherwise, once a person became ill, he would not be able to recover.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, in our bodies there is the principle of death and resurrection, the principle of the dying out of what is old and the rising up of something new.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Diseases are healed in man s body through this basic life principle in which old things die out and new things are produced.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we understand this principle, we shall see how the Lord Jesus heals the soil into which He sows Himself as the seed of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The human soil that had been chosen by God became contaminated and useless.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But because God the Father had chosen this soil, the Lord Jesus could not cast it away.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This soil had even been predestinated, marked out, by the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord must have some way to heal this soil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we have seen, to follow the Lord Jesus is to be put in His pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But how does the Lord heal the soil that is in His pocket?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He heals the soil by bringing it to the cross and causing it to die out and then bringing it into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Lord s death we died out; that is, in His death we were made dead.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then in His resurrection we were resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, we died in the Lord s death and rose in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this way the soil is healed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In chapter one of Mark, the Lord Jesus called Peter, Andrew, James, and John, and they began to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually, they followed the Lord blindly, not knowing where they were going or what they were doing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fact that Peter made many blunders indicates that he did not know what was happening.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus, however, knew what He intended to do with the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After gathering the disciples as the soil, the Lord presented Himself to them as a pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For more than three years, Peter and the other disciples observed what the Lord said and did.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually, the Lord Jesus brought the disciples, and all those chosen by God, to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After He brought them through death and resurrection, they were healed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the reason we say that in Christ s death and resurrection His followers, as the soil chosen by God, were healed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All the healings in the Gospel of Mark are signs pointing to this real healing, the healing that takes place through Christ s death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Disciples Becoming Good Earth</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we come to chapter one of Acts, we see that Peter, Andrew, John, and James, with the remainder of the one hundred twenty, were no longer sick.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They were no longer sick with a fever, contaminated, paralyzed, withered, blind, deaf, or dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They all had been healed through the Lord s death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the foregoing message and in this message we have covered four matters: the background of the Lord s ministry, the Lord as the Sower sowing Himself as the seed, the disciples as the soil chosen by God, and the healing of the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As a result of being healed through Christ s death and resurrection, the chosen people of God were recovered and became good soil.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They became the good earth spoken of in Mark 4:8 and 20.</S>
