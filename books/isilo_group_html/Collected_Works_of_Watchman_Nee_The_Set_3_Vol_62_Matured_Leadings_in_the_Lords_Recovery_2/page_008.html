For example, the matter of hospitality is the most troublesome work, especially when it comes to taking care of troublesome guests. The elders must not be afraid of such troubles. In fact, they have to love such troubles. The book of 1 Timothy speaks of the qualifications of an elder, one of which is to be the husband of one woman (3:2a). This means not marrying more than one woman, which implies temperance and self-control. Another qualification of an elder is to be hospitable (v. 2b). Being single in marriage is being restricted in oneself, and being hospitable is being happy to take up others' troubles. On the one hand, the elders have to restrict themselves. On the other hand, they have to love to take up others' troubles. Receiving guests is a test from God. It shows whether or not we are afraid of troubles. We must not be afraid of troubles but must welcome them instead. We must continually ask ourselves, "Why has no one troubled me today?" We have to rejoice when troubles come. If we raise even an eyebrow, we are posting a "No Visitors" sign before the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Coordination is a kind of blending, like the blending of mortar with water for plastering walls. The more the brothers and sisters are blended together, the better it is. It is a rare thing for two brothers to coordinate together without arguing with each other. Once there is a relationship, there is an argument. However, the argument affords a chance for the two to be blended together. It is a matter of whether or not the elders can harmonize in the midst of an argument. A good elder can turn an argument into a wonderful harmony. Therefore, an elder must have piles and piles of things to do every day. He must love to have people come to him, ask him questions, and give him troubles.</p><p>In Shanghai there is a Shin-Tah-Shiang fabric store on Nanking Road. When you walk in, everything seems to be in a mess. Other stores are neat and tidy, but they are good only for the window-shoppers. Actually, that fabric store is not messy at all. It is too busy making money. It has too many things to do and does not have the time to put everything in order. Its business is so good that it has opened up a branch in Nanking. Success is often judged by the small things, not the big things. A place like Hong Kong should find its elders extremely busy.</p><h2 class="head2">Knowing God's Will</h2><p>The elders should go to God on behalf of the church and inquire of His will. By definition, a business is an endeavor that is busy with ideas. In order for a business to prosper, a manager has to be very busy in his thoughts; he has to know the market and the needs of his customers clearly. The elders have to be rich enough in their mind to receive guidance from God. If they cannot receive guidance from God, how can the many brothers and sisters under them prosper in the work? The elders have to find a way before God when no way seems to be in sight. In order for the elders to know God's will and receive leadings, they have to bring the affairs of the church to the Lord all the time. They have to bear the brothers and sisters before the Lord and look to Him for light. This is not a matter of man waiting for God, but of God waiting for man. As long as a man's heart is open, God will show him "the pattern on the mountain."</p><p>In order to be a good Christian, we must be able to read three things. We must be able to read the operation of the Holy Spirit within the saints, we must be able to read the Bible, and we must be able to read the environment, including people, affairs, and things. In addition to reading the above three things, a good elder must be able to read the condition of the brothers and sisters, in particular their inward condition. In the Old Testament the high priest had authority to put on the ephod. Two shoulder straps and a breastplate were attached to the ephod. On the two shoulder straps, there were two sapphires engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. The breastplate rested in the middle of the ephod and contained twelve stones containing the engraved names of the twelve tribes of Israel. The names of the twelve tribes of Israel represented the whole people of God. Whenever the high priest went to God, he bore upon his shoulders and embraced in his bosom the whole people of God. He inquired of God and sought His counsel. God revealed His will according to the Urim and Thummin in the breastplate. Urim in Hebrew means "light"; it is a kind of illuminator. It was placed under the twelve stones. Thummin in Hebrew means "perfection." The names of the twelve tribes of Israel contain eighteen of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The remaining four letters are contained in the Thummin. In this way, the breastplate had all twenty-two letters of the Hebrew language. Through the shining of the Urim, God's will was spelled out.</p><p>The elders have to carry the condition of the brothers and sisters to God all the time and inquire of Him. They have to receive clear judgments and instructions concerning them. We cannot expect to receive any revelation from God if we do not know anything about the condition of the brothers and sisters. The elders must see "the pattern on the mountain" on the one hand and consider the condition of the saints through the shining in God's dwelling&mdash;the Holy of Holies&mdash;on the other hand. All the elders have to know God's will for the church in Hong Kong today, the way He wants the church to take, the things He wants the church to do, and what He requires of the brothers and sisters.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 62: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (2) &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
