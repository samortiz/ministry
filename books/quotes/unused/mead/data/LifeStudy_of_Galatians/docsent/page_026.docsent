   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE NINE DEAD TO LAW BUT LIVING TO GOD Scripture Reading: Gal 2:19-20; 3:3; 5:16, 25; Rom 7:4, 6; 6:4, 8, 10</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This message is a continuation of the foregoing message on the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The crucial point in that message was the organic union with Christ which takes place spontaneously when we believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we shall go on to see that we have died to law so that we might live to God 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>ORGANIC UNION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How can we die to law in order to live to God?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Galatians 2:19 indicates that we have already died to law.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to your experience, have you actually died to law, or is this simply a matter of doctrine to you?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, how can we live to God?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we would answer these questions, we must know the truth, the reality, of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are not actually organically united with Christ but are in ourselves, then we are neither dead to law nor are we living to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Apart from the organic union with Christ, we cannot live to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the contrary, we shall be alive to many things other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The concept of organic union is implied in Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this chapter Paul uses the illustration of married life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Marriage is a union of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this union the wife is one with the husband, and the husband is one with the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Romans 7:4 Paul speaks of our being married to Christ: So that, my brothers, you also have been made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you might marry another, even Him Who has been raised from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to this verse, we have been married to the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Between Him as the Bridegroom and us as the Bride, there is a wonderful union.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are one with Him in person, name, life, and existence.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This shows that our Christian life is a life of organic oneness with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Romans 11 Paul goes on to use another illustration the grafting of a branch from one tree into another tree.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Romans 11:17-24 Paul uses the illustration of branches from a wild olive tree being grafted into a cultivated olive tree.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a result of grafting, the branches from the wild olive tree and the cultivated olive tree grow together organically.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We, branches of the wild olive tree, have been grafted into Christ, the cultivated olive tree.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some may say that the cultivated olive tree in Romans 11 refers to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although this is correct, it is also true that in the Bible the real Israel is always identified with Christ, and Christ with the real Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the eyes of God, there are not two trees on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is just one tree, the olive tree which includes Christ and God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once we were wild olive branches, but now we have been grafted into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This illustration indicates that the Christian life is not an exchanged life, the exchange of a lower life for a higher one, but a grafted life, the grafting of the human life into the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After a branch has been grafted into another tree, it no longer lives by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the contrary, it lives by the tree into which it has been grafted.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>CUTTING AND JOINING</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the matter of grafting, there are two main aspects: cutting and joining or uniting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Without the cutting, there cannot be any grafting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the branch from one tree is to be grafted into another tree, the branch must firstly be cut.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After the cutting occurs, the joining or union takes place.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This union is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, in grafting we have the cutting, the joining, and the organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The cutting corresponds to the death of Christ, and the uniting, to the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the death of Christ our old life was cut off, and in Christ s resurrection we were united to Him for further growth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The experience of the death of Christ causes us to die to the law, whereas resurrection enables us to live to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, to be dead to the law and alive to God implies the death and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only by being grafted into Christ can we be one with Him in His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In ourselves it is not possible for us to die to law or live to God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, when the preciousness of the Lord Jesus was infused into us and we began to appreciate Him, we were grafted into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the one hand, we were cut; on the other hand, we were joined to Christ in His resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After this union took place, we were organically united with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now we should simply live in this organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the negative side, we have been cut in Christ s death; on the positive side, we have been united to Christ in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this cutting we died not only to the law, but to everything other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to Galatians 6, we are dead to the world, particularly to the religious world, through the crucifixion of Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By the all-inclusive cutting of Christ s all-inclusive death on the cross, we are dead to everything other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because we have been grafted into Christ, His experience has become our history.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When He died on the cross, we died in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When He was crucified, we were cut off from the wild olive tree.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This means that we were cut off from the self, the flesh, the world, religion, and the law with its ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Furthermore, because we have been grafted into Christ, His resurrection has also become our history.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, we can strongly declare that with Christ we have been crucified, buried, and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What a wonderful history we have!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Having been cut off from everything other than God, we are dead to religion, including Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One aspect of our history includes the crucifixion by which we have been cut off from everything other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But the other aspect of this history includes the resurrection in which we have been united to the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this union, we are absolutely one with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is crucial that we all see this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, few Christians have seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we see the vision of this organic union, our living will be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We shall realize that we have been cut off from the old source and united to the living One.</S>
