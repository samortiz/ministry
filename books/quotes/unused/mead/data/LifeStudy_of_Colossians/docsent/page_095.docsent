   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROBLEM OF CULTURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The problem in Colosse was not sinfulness, as in Corinth; it was culture.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Asceticism and philosophy are two of the leading products of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Uncultured people are wild, altogether without any form of asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, those of a low culture do not have philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more cultured people are, the more highly developed their philosophy is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Greeks are strong in philosophy, whereas the Jews are known for their religious observances.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Most religious observances are related to the putting down of the flesh and to the suppression of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church in Colosse was composed of both Greeks and Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With the Greeks the problem was philosophy, but with the Jews the problem was religious practices.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that various cultural practices had invaded the church life and pervaded it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 3:10 and 11 Paul says that in the new man there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To say that there is no room for Greek and Jew means that there is no room for philosophy and for religious observances.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you compare Colossians 3:11 with parallel passages such as 1 Corinthians 12:13 and Galatians 3:28, you will find that only in Colossians does Paul mention barbarian and Scythian.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Colossian believers devoted much attention to matters of culture and did not want to be like barbarians or Scythians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, Paul pointed out that in the church as the new man, there is no room for either the cultured or the uncultured.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is no place for philosophy, asceticism, or observances.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the new man Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The new man is constituted of Christ, not with any element of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Colossians were not sinful like some of those in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, the believers in Colosse replaced Christ, the constituent of the new man, with various aspects of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some treasured philosophy, whereas others treasured religious observances.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These things were allowed to come into the church life as substitutes for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But in the new man there is room for nothing other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>LIVING BY CHRIST, NOT BY ASCETICISM</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This understanding of the constituent of the new man should not be mere doctrine to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to realize that every one of us has his own type of philosophy and asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The fact that we are critical of others proves that we hold on to our own philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moreover, humanly speaking, it is better to have philosophy and asceticism than to be uncultured.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At Corinth there was fornication, but in Colosse the people were cultured and self-controlled.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, their culture and their refinement had become a substitute for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No matter how high their culture was, it was not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not regard your asceticism as something of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You may beautify your asceticism by claiming that it is the bearing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But even what is termed bearing the cross or denying the self may actually be subtle forms of asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, when a brother s wife gives him a difficult time, he may suppress his anger.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is neither the bearing of the cross nor the denial of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As the brother is suppressing himself, he may say inwardly, I will not lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I will not fight with my wife or argue with her.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This brother may seem to be victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the praise for this so-called victory should not be given to Christ; instead, it should go to this brother s asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In that particular situation he used his philosophy and asceticism in place of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In my experience I have learned the difference between the suppressing of the self and living by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now, instead of trying to suppress myself, I turn to the Lord and say, Lord Jesus, You are here.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I need You to live in me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then I am not living by my philosophy or asceticism, but by Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Christian life is not a life of isms or practices.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is a life of Christ as a living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Galatians 2:20 Paul said, I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The actual living of Christ in us is very different from asceticism, suppressing the self, denying the self, and the so-called bearing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What a tremendous difference there is between God s salvation and religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God s salvation is a matter of Christ living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In God s salvation there is no room for our efforts and practices.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God s salvation is a matter of Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Instead of trying to deny the self and bear the cross in a religious way, we should simply allow the living Person of Christ to live in us moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If your wife gives you a difficult time, do not try to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Simply allow Christ to live in you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Christian life is absolutely a matter of a living Person living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the Gospels we are told to deny the self and to take up the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, it is easy for us to apply these words according to our natural understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But to live Christ is not according to the natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the natural concept there is the thought of denying the self and of suppressing the indulgence of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But there is no thought of Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit being the living Person in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Having been processed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, Christ is now the Spirit in our spirit to be our life in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is possible to have a doctrinal knowledge that the Christian life is Christ living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But in our daily living we may actually live according to certain practices.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Instead of living Christ, we may endeavor to deny the self or to bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Hence, we may actually live according to our philosophy and asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This means that in our practical daily life Christ is replaced by our own personal philosophy and asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>CHRIST ALL AND IN ALL</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the book of Colossians Paul points out that Christ must be all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the new man there is no room for culture or personal practices.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God s intention in His economy is for Christ to be everything.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Christ should be our life, our living, our patience, our holiness, our kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Christ should be the way we deal with our wife or husband.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Moment by moment in our daily living, Christ should be everything we need.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Instead of living by certain practices, we should simply live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is significant that after covering so many important matters in Colossians, Paul speaks of the peace of Christ arbitrating in our hearts and the word of Christ inhabiting us richly.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Whenever we think that our philosophy is better than that of others, we become critical.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This was the situation among the Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There was rivalry and criticism between those with a Greek background and those with a Jewish background.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This was the reason Paul told them to let the peace of Christ arbitrate in them.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He was encouraging the saints to forget their philosophy and culture.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Culture and philosophy are not to be the standard or the referee.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The referee is the peace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We need to drop our cultural practices and allow the peace of Christ to arbitrate in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It seems as if Paul was saying to the saints in Colosse, Let the peace of Christ preside in you.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You believers in Colosse have been taking philosophy as the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>You must let the peace of Christ be your standard.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>You need to drop your culture and your philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In 3:16 Paul goes on to charge the saints, Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Negatively, we must set aside our cultural standards, and positively, we need to be filled with the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This means that we must allow the word of Christ to fill our mind, emotion, will, thought, and consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Every fiber of our being needs to be occupied by the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>God s desire is that we live Christ moment by moment and leave no room for culture and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Our only practice should be the living Person of Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Second, we should lay aside our cultural standards.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Our standard should not be any form of culture; it should be the indwelling peace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Third, we need to allow the word of Christ to fill our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We need to let our whole being be permeated and saturated with the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If we do these three things, we shall experience Christ spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Not only shall we have a lofty revelation of Christ, but we shall also experience Him in a practical way in our daily life.</S>
