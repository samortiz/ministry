   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fifth thing that the New Testament shows us is the living of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since the beginning of human history, there has never been such a living as the one lived out by this bountiful One, the living of the divine life through a human with the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The daily living, the daily walk, of Jesus was wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the one hand, such a living conquers all the enemies of God, and on the other hand, it expresses God, manifesting Him in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, this living is the very reality of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we read the four Gospels, we should have a deep impression of the living of this Man, a living of the divine life through a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was a genuine man, yet He lived not by Himself but by God as life John 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, He possessed the power and authority to conquer and subdue all of God's enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the same time He was able to express God, manifesting Him in His full glory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such a living of the bountiful One was the reality of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE IMPARTATION OF GOD'S DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The sixth main item revealed in the New Testament is the impartation of God's life by the Lord's death and resurrection John 19:34; 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By Christ's living of the divine life through the human nature, He conquered the enemies of God and expressed God in full glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order for such a life and living to be ours, He had to pass through death and enter into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By His death and resurrection He imparted Himself into us as life in order to meet all our needs and fulfill the requirements of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The requirements of the kingdom can be fulfilled only by Christ Himself as life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first three Gospels Matthew, Mark, and Luke give us the requirements of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Gospel of John supplies us with the life which fulfills the kingdom's requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The kingdom is a matter of requirements, while life is the fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first three Gospels show us what the kingdom requires, while the last Gospel tells us how life fulfills the requirements of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This life can be ours only through Christ's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>MAN BEING BROUGHT INTO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After the Lord's resurrection, the disciples were filled with the Spirit as breath within John 20:22 , and after His ascension, they were filled with the Spirit as power, as the rushing violent wind without Acts 2:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The breath is for life, and the rushing wind is for power.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At this point, man was brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By incarnation God was brought into man, and by resurrection and ascension man was brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord's coming in incarnation brought God into man, and His going through death, resurrection, and ascension brought man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the seventh main item revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By His incarnation, Christ brought God from heaven into man on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At that time, there was a man on the earth with God in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, man was not yet in God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not until Christ died, resurrected, and ascended did Christ bring man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, today in heaven there is a man in God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In incarnation Christ brought God into man on the earth; in His resurrection and ascension He brought man into God in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What God desired to have was accomplished, for there was then a real mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is in man and man is in God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God came into man by incarnation, and man is brought into God by Christ's resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On this earth there was a man with God in Him, but there had never been a man in the heavens in God until Christ died, resurrected, and ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By His incarnation He brought His divine nature into man, and by His resurrection and ascension He brought the human nature into God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now, God is in man and man is in God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God is in us on the earth, and we are in God in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are hidden with Christ in God Col 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through the Son of God, the Father is in us on the earth, and through Christ, we are in God in the heavens.</S>
