   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brother X:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I left Tsinan the day you came to Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I did not receive this news until I arrived in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I had to go to Canton for my passport, and after I returned from Canton to Hong Kong, I was sick for over ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the reason I did not write to you to relate everything to you sooner.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I apologize and regret this very much!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After we left Hong Kong, we had a peaceful journey and did not suffer any loss at Haiphong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>My whole family, together with Sister Chen Hwei-sien and Brother Ma Mu, waited for our visas for five or six days in Ho-Kou.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>My family and Sister Chen arrived safely in K'un-ming on November 4.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Chou brothers are British subjects and were able to arrive a few days earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brother Ma is still in Ho-Kou.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A letter of certification has been sent, and perhaps he will be in K'un-ming by the ninth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brother Hu Yi-min is still here.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He does not want to remain here any longer; he will return home soon.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>My family wants to go with Brother Hu.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I hope that I will see you so that I can be instructed concerning my future and the way I should carry out the work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I wonder when you will come?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I hope very much that you will inform me soon.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I came to Yunnan this time because I need the help from Brother Hu.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Moreover, I see clearly that my family should reside at Yeh-Ji where Brother Hu's family is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brother Hu and I can then go ahead into Sikang and work there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Presently, I think we should establish a base at Yeh-Ji and move out from there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Later, if brothers and sisters come to work at Sikang or Tibet, they will find it less unpleasant, and they can work with peace of heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, I shall go into Sikang from Yunnan.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Going from Szechuan would mean greater hardship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Going from Ch'eng-tu to Ba-Tang would take more than a month.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The trip would be inconvenient, and the expense would be more than what is required to go from Yunnan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, both the people and the geography of Sikang are unfamiliar to me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verbal communication will be difficult, and it will take a while to actually enter in. Therefore, I have to travel with Brother Hu so that I can learn Tibetan before I labor in Sikang.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It has been very clear to me that the Lord has given me a great burden to work in Sikang and Tibet.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But I am very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I feel incapable of bearing so great a burden and am not worthy of such a task.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the Lord has been dealing with me for a year and caused me to count the cost.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am truly a slow obeyer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>May the Lord enable me to be more obedient to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now I only know that as He calls, I will go.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do not know anything else and continue to look unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you come to Yunnan, Brother Hu Yi-min has requested that you purchase and bring two irons for ironing clothes .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everything is fine here, even though the catastrophe inflicted upon the nation has sent many people here.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The cost of living has risen three or fourfold, and it is not easy to rent a dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord's more abundant grace is indeed needed so that He may receive the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The brothers and sisters and Brother Weigh's whole household are fine.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Please do not worry.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Please greet Sister Lee and Sister Chang.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I shall stop my pen here.</S>
