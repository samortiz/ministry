<h2 class=head2>Creating a Spirit for Man with His Breath of Life</h2><p>In Genesis 2:7, we are shown that God used the dust of the ground to make man and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. The breath of life out of God, after being breathed into man, became the spirit within man. The word for “breath” here in Hebrew is the same as the word for “spirit” in Proverbs 20:27, which says, “The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord” (lit.). This implies that the spirit of man is the breath of life. According to essence, that was a breath of life; according to function, this breath of life is the spirit within us.<p>The Old Testament clearly says that there is a spirit within man, and this spirit was created by Jehovah for man. Also, Zechariah 12:1 says, “The Lord, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.” This indicates that the spirit within man is listed alongside the heavens and the earth. The people in the world talk about the heavens, the earth, and man; but the Bible talks about the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man. There are the heavens, the earth, and also the spirit within man. The heavens are for the earth, and the earth is for man. If there were no heavens, then this earth would be short of sunlight, rain, and air. Hence the heavens are for the earth. Because there are sunlight, rain, and air, the earth can produce different kinds of animals and plants, so that we can live on it. Apart from this, we would not be able to live. So the heavens are for the earth, and the earth is for man. Then what are we for? We are for God.<p>Concerning God, we may ask, “What is God?” In simple words, God is Spirit (John 4:24). Because God is Spirit, He can be enjoyed by us. In the Bible, the word for spirit is the same as the word for breath; spirit is breath, and breath is spirit. God is Spirit, like air, that we may breathe Him in. For this reason, God who is Spirit created a spirit for us so that we may use the spirit to worship Him and to gain Him. God used His breath of life to create a spirit for man as the organ for man to contact and receive God. This can be likened to eating. If a man wants to eat, he needs an organ which can receive food. Hence, God created a stomach for man to receive food. When we eat, we receive food into our stomach. This stomach has its special functions of digesting and assimilating the food taken in for our nourishment, and then transporting it to the whole body. These are the functions of the stomach. Similarly, God created for us a spirit in order for us to receive Him. By this spirit, we can contact and receive Him. I have always told people that the more they use their mind to consider whether there is a God, the more they will feel there is no God. But if you would simply return to the depths of your being and exercise your spirit to call on the Lord’s name, you will touch God, and you will believe and receive Him. Therefore what you think in your mind is one thing, and the fact is another. God truly exists; as long as we exercise our spirit, we can receive Him.<p>Acts 17:28 says, “For in Him [God] we live and move and are.” This is an extraordinary matter. If there were no God, we would not be able to live. God is the source of life; all that we have comes from Him. This God who is life has created the heavens, the earth, and all things, and us, that is, mankind, as well. Also, He created us according to Himself to be the same as He is. He created us in this way in order that we can be vessels to contain Him so that one day He can enter into us to be our life and content. In this way, God and we, we and God, are joined as one. Not only so, God is Spirit. In order for us to contain Him, He created for us a spirit to be the organ for receiving and enjoying Him.
