<H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION FORTY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING THE THREE PARABLES<br>IN LUKE 15</H1><P>Why does Luke 15 use three parables? Is not one adequate?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>There are three parables in Luke 15 that speak of something being "lost." The first parable concerns a lost sheep; the second, a lost coin; and the third, a lost son. After reading this chapter, many wonder why three parables are used to typify a sinner when only one should be sufficient. We must realize, however, that the Lord's intention in speaking these parables was not to talk about the lost ones; rather, His emphasis was on God's treatment of a lost one. If the Lord was only concerned about man's lost condition, one parable would have been sufficient. However, His focus was on how God treats a lost one; therefore, all three parables were necessary. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—the Triune God—each have a specific work on the lost one. These three parables clearly portray to us the three aspects of God's work.</P><P>Can the sequence of these three parables be rearranged? No. If they were randomly rearranged, the gospel would not be in the proper order, because these three parables speak about the sequence of God's plan of redemption. The first parable concerns the Lord Jesus coming to do the good Shepherd's work. John 10 tells us that a good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep (v. 11). Following this, the Lord told the parable of a woman seeking for the lost coin. There is a difference between the good shepherd looking for the sheep and the woman seeking for the coin. The good shepherd looked for the sheep outside the house, and the Lord Jesus left the Father's house to come to the world to look for us. The woman sought for the lost coin within her house. She lit her lamp, swept the house, and sought diligently. The woman typifies the Holy Spirit. First, the Lord Jesus came to accomplish redemption; then the Holy Spirit came into us to enlighten us so that we might receive the Lord Jesus' accomplished redemption. The Bible reveals that God has two gifts for us, not just one. God gave us His Son, and He also gave us the Holy Spirit. Some preachers make the mistake of preaching only half of the truth. They only tell people, "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life" (John 3:16) and neglect the words spoken by the Lord Jesus: "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever" (14:16). God not only sent the Lord Jesus as a good Shepherd to seek for us, but He also sent the Holy Spirit to enlighten us. The first parable does not mention the lamp. The second parable mentions the lamp. The first parable speaks of searching outside the house. The second parable speaks of searching within the house. The Lord Jesus went outside the house; that is, He went to the world to find the lost sheep. The Holy Spirit is in the house—within us—enlightening us with the lamp to seek diligently for the lost coin. The last parable is of a father waiting at home for the return of his son. The Savior has come, and the Holy Spirit has come to seek so that the Lord's accomplished redemption will not be in vain. God is waiting at home for the son to return so that the Holy Spirit's accomplishment will not be in vain.</P><P>Taking away the first or second parable would make the other parables inadequate. If the good Shepherd did not come to lay down His life for the sheep, redemption would not have been accomplished. If the Holy Spirit did not enlighten men, none would be convicted concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment (John 16:8). Although some may be partially convicted concerning their sins, without the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit, they would not be thoroughly convicted concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment.</P><P>Without the good Shepherd laying down His life for the sheep, it would not have been possible for the Father to take in the prodigal son when he returned home. The enlightening work of the Holy Spirit is based on the Lord's death. If the Lord had not died, the heavenly Father could not have forgiven man's sins. Otherwise, God would be unrighteous. We must lay hold of this fact: God's forgiveness of sins is His righteousness. God loves us. Nevertheless, God's love comes through His righteousness. If this were not so, God would be unrighteous, act contrary to His righteous nature, and be only tolerant of us. Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins. If forgiveness could be obtained without the Lord's blood, there would be no need of a Savior. Then how are we saved? Even though we have sins, the Savior has truly borne our sins. Therefore, we can boldly come before the presence of God and please Him. If we did not have a Savior, we would never have peace in our conscience. Since the Lord Jesus has died and accomplished redemption, the heavenly Father is waiting to receive us. When the prodigal son returned home, his father did not have a rebuking word or a word exhorting him to repent, because the Savior had accomplished redemption for him, and the Holy Spirit had enlightened him. As a result, his sins were forgiven and washed by the blood.</P><P>Even though the Lord Jesus has died and the heavenly Father is waiting at home, no prodigal son would be able to return home without the enlightening of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit convicts man of sin, causing him to regret his unbelief. The Holy Spirit convicts man of righteousness, causing him to question why he has not received the Lord who is resurrected, ascended, and well-accepted by God. The Holy Spirit convicts man of judgment, causing him to question why he follows Satan who has been judged and is no longer his master. This is all done by the Holy Spirit. Therefore, we should believe in what the Lord has accomplished and also pay attention to what the Holy Spirit will accomplish.</P><P>One group of people only stresses what the Holy Spirit will accomplish, neglecting what Christ has already accomplished. Another group emphasizes what Christ has already accomplished, neglecting what the Holy Spirit will accomplish. Those who emphasize what Christ has accomplished say that Christ has died, resurrected, and accomplished everything and that the work of the Holy Spirit is merely to guide us to the truth, meaning that He only informs men that Christ has died, resurrected, and entered into glory. Those who emphasize what the Holy Spirit will accomplish say that the Holy Spirit must specifically work within us so that we will have a special experience. Each of these two views is biased. A bird has two wings. If we clip off one wing, it cannot fly. Each of these two views clip off one of the bird's wings. If a person only focuses on what Christ has accomplished, he will not have any experience. On the other hand, if a person only focuses on the work of the Holy Spirit, he will lack a proper foundation because the work of the Holy Spirit is based on what Christ has accomplished.</P><P>In 2 Corinthians 13:14 Paul says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all." God's heart is love. God purposed to save man. Love is something within. When it is expressed, it is grace. The outward expression of love is grace, and the inward reality of grace is love. Therefore, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is spoken of first because redemption was accomplished by Christ. God loves, and the love of God in the person of Christ results in grace. The Holy Spirit conveys Christ's accomplishments into us. This is the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit does not impart anything of Himself; rather, He flows what Christ has accomplished into us. It is impossible to receive the Lord's grace without the Holy Spirit. And if we only want the Holy Spirit without receiving what Christ has accomplished, it is also impossible to receive the Holy Spirit. A water pipe allows water to flow. Neither a pipe without water nor water without a pipe is effective. Therefore, the three parables in Luke 15 are not repetitious; they are a portrait of the sequence in God's way of redemption. Christ accomplished redemption, the Holy Spirit enlightens man, and God the Father receives us by His love. A proper understanding of these three parables will give us a balanced life, and we will not be biased in any way.</P>
