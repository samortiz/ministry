<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of eleven messages given by Brother Witness Lee in different places concerning the experience of life. The messages were published in Chinese in various issues of <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> magazine, from 1951 to 1965. They are published here as a single volume.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BLESSINGS AND GRACE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:8-9; Eccl. 1:2; Matt. 6:31-32; Luke 14:33; 1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 4:7; 12:9; Phil. 3:8; 4:11-13</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE GRACE OF GOD HAVING TWO ASPECTS</h2>
<p>The relationship between man and the grace that God bestows on man has two aspects. One aspect involves the procedure, and the other aspect involves the goal. God has a goal concerning man, and He must have a procedure in order to reach this goal. Hence, His relationship with man involves a procedure. In regard to His procedure, God bestows outward blessings, and in regard to His goal, He supplies inward grace. Both aspects are indispensable.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S GOAL</h2>
<p>In eternity past God had a good pleasure, which was to enter into man and be joined to man so that man would have His life and nature. According to this good pleasure, God made a plan with the goal of entering into man to be man&rsquo;s life and element. God had this unique goal in eternity past before time began, that is, before He created the heavens and the earth. From eternity past to eternity future God is working to accomplish His goal of entering into man so that man may be joined to Him. God&rsquo;s relationship with man, the grace He gives man, and the things He does in relation to man are for Him to accomplish His glorious goal. He will achieve His goal when He is fully mingled with and joined to man in eternity future.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PROCEDURE</h2>
<p>In order to accomplish His desire and goal, God created man. Before creating man, He created everything in the universe and thus prepared everything that man would need in order to live. He created the earth for man to have a dwelling place, and He also created air, the sun, and food for man&rsquo;s existence. After creating everything that man would need for his existence, God created man. Hence, immediately after man was created, he was able to enjoy everything that God had prepared: there was the earth to dwell on, air to breathe, light from the sun, and food to eat. Man had all that he needed for his existence.</p>
<p>Although God had prepared everything that man needed, this preparation did not accomplish God&rsquo;s goal in man. Rather, these things were but a procedure for God to reach His goal. In order for this goal to be accomplished, man must have a way to exist, and in order for man to exist, God had to prepare everything that man needed for his existence. Hence, the things that God created were not His goal; they were His procedure. In view of God&rsquo;s relationship with man, the things that were created were part of His procedure; they were not His goal. Hence, the things that God gives to man do not convey grace; they are outward blessings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUTWARD BLESSINGS</h2>
<p>Outward blessings refer to the material things that God bestows on man and to the physical environment that God prepares for man&rsquo;s existence. Whether it be people, matters, things, or environments, everything that man enjoys for his existence is an outward blessing given by God. What Adam enjoyed in the garden of Eden was outward blessings. Although those things were prepared for him by God, they were outward things, material in nature, and related to the environment.</p>
<p>Outward blessings are material and are related to man&rsquo;s existence. They are God&rsquo;s procedure, not His goal. Those who live only according to outward blessings are living in God&rsquo;s procedure; they are not in God&rsquo;s goal. Although they may enjoy many material things, their heart is still empty because they are only in God&rsquo;s procedure. This is revealed in Solomon&rsquo;s experience. Solomon did not lack outward material things; he even had a surpassing abundance of material things. He had all the possible enjoyment that a man can have in the material realm. Nevertheless, he said, &ldquo;Vanity of vanities; all is vanity&rdquo; (Eccl. 1:2), because material things are not the goal of God in man and thus cannot satisfy man&rsquo;s inner need.</p>
<p>Material things are for man&rsquo;s existence so that man may reach God&rsquo;s goal. However, after man&rsquo;s fall the enjoyment of material things usurped man, causing man to want material things instead of God&rsquo;s goal. Man enjoys the things that God created without caring for the goal of creation. Hence, when the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He wanted man to forsake all things. He said, &ldquo;Everyone of you who does not forsake all his own possessions cannot be My disciple&rdquo; (Luke 14:33). The expression <em>all his own possessions</em> refers to the outward material blessings prepared by God for man&rsquo;s existence. If man highly regards such things, he will neglect God&rsquo;s goal. If we want to receive only the outward things that God prepared as the procedure, it will be difficult for us to receive the grace that God prepares for us to reach His goal. In other words, if we enjoy outward blessings but disregard God&rsquo;s goal, it will be difficult for us to receive the grace that God has prepared for us.</p><h2 class="head1">GRACE</h2>
<p>Grace is God entering into man and being joined to man so that man may have His life and nature. Grace is God being enjoyed by man to be man&rsquo;s inner blessing. Grace is God entering into man to be man&rsquo;s life and everything so that God can accomplish His goal in man.</p>
<p>It is possible for man to receive many outward blessings from God without receiving grace. It is also possible for man to enjoy many outward things without receiving God&rsquo;s life. Adam enjoyed everything that God created, but he did not have the life of God. Although he did not lack any material thing, he lacked the life of God. Although he received many items from God, he did not receive the life of God. Adam&rsquo;s relationship with God was based on his being created; he did not have a life relationship with God. Therefore, after God created him, God placed him in front of the tree of life (Gen. 2:8-9) so that he might receive the divine life, that is, receive God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>What Adam enjoyed in the garden of Eden was in his environment and was outward. Those blessings enabled him to exist and afforded him an opportunity to receive the life of God. Grace, which is related to life, is spiritual and inward. If a man enjoys only outward blessings without receiving God as grace, he will feel unsatisfied and empty. This is the reason that people sense the vanity of human life. Even if a person were to enjoy material blessings as Solomon did, as long as he does not have God, his human life will be empty. For this reason, Solomon exhorted people to remember their Creator in the days of their youth, before the evil days come (Eccl. 12:1). Enjoying material blessings cannot satisfy man&rsquo;s inner need. The only thing that can satisfy man&rsquo;s inner need is the Lord Jesus. A man who enjoys outward blessings without enjoying the Lord will feel empty.</p>
<p>A person who enjoys outward things but does not receive God as life is a pitiful human being. Although he may be able to enjoy everything God created, this does not mean that he enjoys the Lord who is the Creator of all things. He has received outward blessings, not grace. Only when God enters into him to be his life can he receive grace. Grace is God as life entering into man; that is, grace is God Himself. We often focus on outward things but neglect grace; we receive the outward things but lose grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN IMPROPER FOCUS</h2>
<p>It is worrisome that many believers focus on outward blessings. They ask to be healed of sickness, for a lack to be supplied, for a place to live, for food and clothing, for their home to be in a convenient location, and for safe and peaceful travel. These are matters related to the environment. Believers often focus on obtaining these outward blessings rather than obtaining God.</p>
<p>After the fall, man was far away from God and separated from God&rsquo;s care. As a result, man fell into various hardships. Some hardships are material, such as a lack of food or clothing, whereas other hardships are psychological, such as sorrows and sufferings. Man faces such hardships because he has lost God and His care. When man repents, he seeks God for solutions to these problems. Hence, saints often testify of how God cares for them, answers their prayers, solves their problems, meets their need, or comforts them. These testimonies are in the realm of outward blessings. It seems as though the grace that God gives us is related to outward things, such as solving problems, alleviating sufferings, supplying a lack, and answering prayers for material things.</p>
<p>Believers regard God&rsquo;s grace in this way because they are influenced by their background. If we are willing to come out of our background, forget about our hardships and sufferings, and stand in an objective position, we will see that God&rsquo;s desire is not related to outward physical things or peace. God does not merely desire to give us outward physical things; He desires to give us spiritual grace. Outward things are but a procedure; spiritual grace is the goal. The procedure is for the goal. God desires to put His life in us so that we can receive and enjoy Him.</p>
<p>A brother who was sick prayed and was healed. Another brother who lost his job prayed and found another job. A sister who had a problem with her housing prayed, and the problem was resolved. A brother who lacked a means of livelihood prayed, and he received provision. Although these are examples of God&rsquo;s care, they are outward. Only God and His life are grace.</p>
<p>The provisions that God gives us are related to things and matters, which enable us to exist so that we may achieve His goal, that is, so that we may receive Him and His life. God&rsquo;s provisions are to achieve His goal. The outward things that we receive from God enable us to receive grace.</p><h2 class="head1">A PROPER FOCUS</h2>
<p>A believer should focus on grace, not on things. Matthew 6:31-32 says, &ldquo;Do not to be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed? For all these things the Gentiles are anxiously seeking. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.&rdquo; The Gentiles seek only to exist on the earth; they do not know the purpose of their existence. They think that by solving the problems related to their basic necessities&mdash;such as food, clothing, dwelling, and transportation&mdash;they have solved the problems of human life. They do not understand that even when their need for basic necessities is met, one problem will remain unsolved, which is that they have not received God as their life. The provisions of food and clothing are God&rsquo;s care related to His procedure for their existence so that they can obtain God Himself as grace. This is His purpose. People who receive these provisions but do not receive God are merely in His procedure; they are not in His goal. Gentiles do not know God&rsquo;s goal; hence, they seek only outward blessings. As God&rsquo;s children, we should not seek merely outward blessings; we should seek grace. We should seek to gain God more than we seek things and matters outside of God. We should enjoy being filled with God more than we enjoy outward material things.</p>
<p>We need to seek grace, but this does not mean that we do not need God&rsquo;s outward care. We cannot exist without the outward care. For the sake of our existence, God measures out to us necessary things for our existence so that we may receive Him and be filled with Him. We must know, gain, experience, and be filled with God. Otherwise, everything that we know and pursue will be outward.</p>
<p>In Philippians 3:8 Paul says that he suffered the loss of all things and counted them as refuse that he might gain Christ. The expression <em>all things</em> refers to the outward things that are treasured by many. To Paul such things were dung; hence, he forsook and despised them so that he might gain Christ. To gain Christ is to gain the manifested God. This is also to receive grace.</p>
<p>Outward things and matters are a procedure to enable us to gain God. Whenever outward things and matters become the goal of our human life, they hinder and usurp us from gaining God. We should count such things as dung and put them aside. Regardless of how good or valuable a thing may be, if it hinders us from gaining God and from being filled with Him, we should despise it, condemn it, and forsake it. The life of God is a treasure in us (2 Cor. 4:7), and God is our excellency (Phil. 3:8). In order to pursue and gain this treasure, this excellency, it is worthwhile to despise and forsake outward things. We should pursue the treasure, the excellency, more than we pursue outward things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING GRACE</h2>
<p>Blessings refer to matters, things, and environments, which are a procedure that enables us to receive grace. Grace is God in us to be our life and power. Hence, no matter what environment, matter, or thing that we encounter, we should know, experience, and gain more of God.</p>
<p>In Philippians Paul says that he had learned, in whatever circumstances he was, to be content. He knew how to be abased and how to abound. In everything and in all things he had learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to lack. He was able to do all things in Christ who empowered him (4:11-13). Paul&rsquo;s circumstances and situations caused him to depend on the Lord, experience Him, and gain Him more, that is, to gain more of God. In every situation Paul grasped one thing: he depended on the Lord, experienced Him, and gained Him. This was Paul&rsquo;s secret.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul says that he labored more abundantly than the rest of the apostles, but it was not him who labored but the grace of God which was with him. Paul knew that God was grace in him, and he depended on this grace and experienced this grace. He knew that the grace of God in him was sufficient and was his power (2 Cor. 12:9). For this reason, he depended on this grace and experienced this grace in every environment. Some believers are good Christians when they do not have any lack, but they are defeated when they experience a lack or a trial. This shows that they do not adequately know grace. When other believers experience a lack, they receive grace. Some may think that it is impossible to bear such a lack, but there is grace, power, in these believers that causes them not only to endure the lack but even to love their condition. This power is the grace of God in them and with them, enabling them to know, enjoy, experience, and gain God in the midst of their lack.</p>
<p>There are still other believers who are strong and maintain their fellowship with the Lord when there is a lack, but when the situation turns for the better, they fail the test of abundance. God does not only place us in situations of lack. He will also place us in situations of abundance. Some people are able to withstand the trial of lack but cannot withstand the test of abundance. They are defeated by abundance. They are short of the grace to deal with the test of abundance. Abundance is not only a test; it can also become a temptation. Many people cannot withstand the temptation of abundance. Paul received grace, was filled with God, and depended on the Lord; hence, he could be abased, and he could abound. Neither lack nor abundance could drag him down; instead, they gave him the opportunity to experience and gain God. Having a lack caused Paul to experience and gain God, and being in abundance also caused him to experience and gain God. There was not one circumstance that could prevent him from experiencing and gaining God. All his outward circumstances caused him to experience grace and to obtain grace.</p>
<p>If we have God&rsquo;s grace and His presence as our power, every circumstance will become an opportunity for us to receive more grace. If we know the grace of God, we will say, &ldquo;I want to lose all the outward things and matters so that I may receive grace. O Lord, if poverty can cause me to gain more of You, I would rather choose poverty. If being abased and despised can cause me to gain You more, let me be abased and despised. If sickness can cause me to gain You, I would rather have sickness than be healthy.&rdquo; To gain God is higher than to gain outward blessings.</p>
<p>May all God&rsquo;s children see what grace is and what it means to receive grace. We do not want to lose grace, nor do we want to lose any opportunity to receive grace. May we be those who testify in the meetings of touching God, experiencing God, and receiving grace.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE OPERATION OF GOD IN MAN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; 14:9-10, 16-18; Eph. 3:17a, 19b; Phil. 2:13; 1 John 3:24</h1>
<p>Christians should seek to gain God more than any other matter or thing. In this chapter we will consider the meaning of gaining God and how God enters into man and operates in man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEANING OF GAINING GOD</h2>
<p>To gain God is deeper and more subjective than merely to believe in His existence or to fear Him. Many thoughtful people believe that God exists and even fear Him, but God is not in them. To believe in God is not merely to believe that He exists, nor is it merely to fear Him. To believe in God is to gain Him subjectively in one&rsquo;s spirit. When a person believes in God, he opens his heart to receive God and to let God enter into him and dwell in his spirit. Hence, he can be joined and mingled with God, and God can become his element. When we let God enter into us to be our life and nature and even our being, we are joined to Him as one. This is the meaning of being a Christian. Every Christian should know that God desires man to gain Him.</p>
<p>Let us use a glass of water as an example. Merely believing that this glass contains water cannot quench your thirst, nor can you receive the water merely by holding the glass in your hand. The water must enter into you and become a part of you. The way to receive, to gain, the water is to drink it, that is, to let the water enter into you, mingle with you, and become a part of you. This principle also applies to food. We must take food in by eating it so that it can become a part of us. The food that we eat is not separate from us. This is the way to receive food.</p>
<p>Similarly, to gain God does not refer merely to believing in Him or fearing Him objectively. To gain God is to receive Him into us subjectively, that is, to let Him be our life and nature and to let Him mingle with us until He becomes our element. Then His thoughts will be our thoughts, His emotions will be our emotions, His preferences will be our preferences, and His inclinations will be our inclinations. This is what it means to gain God.</p>
<p>Some people say that Christianity is elusive and impractical because it speaks only of heaven and hell, which are in the future. My response to these people is that most preachers are inaccurate in their preaching of the gospel because they do not tell people that the gospel is for people to gain God. God came out of eternity and entered into time to be our life so that He and we can live together as one in reality. Religion is not more practical than the Christian faith, nor is philosophy more real than God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>If we know God and His salvation, we will know that He wants to enter into us so that He can supply us as our life and power. We do not have the power to resist sins, to do good deeds, to honor our parents, or to love our spouse. He is in us to be our power to resist sins, to do good deeds, to honor our parents, and to love our spouse. He is the power that bears us, not merely for us to be excellent persons but to be persons who are filled with God, that is, to be God-men. Then the people whom we contact will sense not only goodness; they will sense God. When they contact us, they will have an indescribable feeling of comfort and sweetness, which is God as our element. This is what it means for a Christian to gain God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY FOR GOD TO ENTER INTO MAN</h2>
<p>How does man gain God, and how does God enter into man? How can the noble, great, glorious, and holy God enter into a lowly, small, and filthy man?</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Word Becoming Flesh</h2>
<p>In order for God to enter into man, the Word became flesh. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,&rdquo; and verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; The Word is God. At a certain point in time the Word, who is God, became flesh and tabernacled among men. The person who was incarnated is the Lord. He is the Word who became flesh. He became a man with the purpose of bringing God to man.</p>
<p>Not only did God dwell in Jesus Christ; Jesus Christ was God. The people who touched, contacted, and received the Lord Jesus touched, contacted, and received God, because Jesus Christ is God. God became a man and tabernacled in this man. Hence, those who believe in Jesus Christ and receive Him also receive God. God gives Himself to men in the person of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>If I want to give a brother some water to drink, I cannot carry the water in my two palms to him. I must use a glass as a means to contain the water. When the brother receives the glass, he receives the water. God cannot enter into us directly. In order for us to receive Him, He must give Himself to us in and through Christ. Hence, God became flesh and is embodied in Christ. When we receive Christ, we gain Him, and at the same time we also gain God, because Christ is God. This is what it means to believe in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Believing in the Lord Jesus Christ is to receive Him and to obtain God. When we receive Christ, we gain God because God is in Christ. God can enter into us, and we can gain Him through Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">By the Spirit</h2>
<p>Some people say that it is not possible for us to touch the incarnated God, because He became flesh two thousand years ago in the land of Judah. His incarnation is far away from us in both time and space.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation is wonderful because it includes not only God, who is the Word becoming flesh, but also Christ, the incarnated God, who passed through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). God is in Christ, and Christ is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). This Spirit is omnipresent, just as electromagnetic waves are everywhere. Regardless of his location, a person who receives Christ will contact the Spirit. For example, there are electromagnetic waves in the air; hence, any radio that is turned on, regardless of when or where, will receive electromagnetic waves. Likewise, the life-giving Spirit is omnipresent and will enter into any person who believes in the Lord Jesus and receives Him. When the Spirit enters into a person, Christ enters into that person because the Lord is the Spirit. That person also receives God, because God is in Christ.</p>
<p>We need to remember these three <em>in</em>s: God is in Christ, Christ is in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in us. The center and the secret of our Christian faith depend on these three <em>in</em>s. God is in Christ, Christ is in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in us. This is our Christian faith.</p>
<p>The life-giving Spirit being in us is Christ being in us, and Christ being in us is God being in us. A believer who has the Spirit abiding in him also has Christ and God abiding in him. Hence, the Bible says, &ldquo;In this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us&rdquo; (1 John 3:24). Some people say that the Bible does not have much content, because it only says, &ldquo;And you in Me,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I in you&rdquo; (John 14:20). However, we must realize that the secret of our salvation lies in these <em>in</em>s.</p>
<p>God was incarnated and is embodied in Jesus Christ, who died and resurrected from the dead to become the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit now abides in all those who believe in the Lord. The Spirit&rsquo;s abiding in the believers means that Christ and God abide in the believers. The Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;abides in every believer. God the Father abides in every believer, because He is embodied in Christ who is now the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OPERATION OF GOD IN MAN</h2>
<p>It is not enough for God to enter into us. He wants to operate in us so that He can daily gain more ground in our being. This means that we should gain more of God daily. Formerly, we were human beings without God; our thoughts, concepts, preferences, and inclinations were merely human. However, even though God has entered into us, we still may not have the element of God in our thoughts, concepts, preferences, and inclinations. We have received the Triune God into us, but it is possible that we have not allowed Him to enter into our thoughts, concepts, preferences, and inclinations. This means that we have not allowed Him into our being. As a result, our considerations and our views are still the same as they were before we were saved; they do not have the element of God. Hence, our emotions have not changed.</p>
<p>Some believers do not change much after their salvation. Some are a little different, because they no longer engage in the sinful activities of their past. Nevertheless, their thoughts, concepts, preferences, and inclinations have not changed. Before they were saved, their thoughts, concepts, preferences, and inclinations did not have the element of God, but they still do not have the element of God, even after they are saved. God is in these believers, but He has not entered into every part of their thoughts, concepts, preferences, or inclinations. Such believers can be likened to a person who eats a meal, but the food stays in his stomach and is not digested or absorbed into his body. Although that person may eat a good meal, he is emaciated and malnourished.</p>
<p>This is the situation of many brothers and sisters. They are saved and God is in them, but He is restricted in them and does not have the freedom or the way to spread. They do not let Him enter into their thoughts, concepts, preferences, or inclinations; that is, they do not let God enter into their whole being. As a result, although they are saved, they have not changed. God is in them, but He cannot become their supply or power. Merely eating food does not benefit a person. The food that we eat needs to be digested and absorbed into our body in order for it to become our supply and power.</p>
<p>Believing in the Lord and receiving Him can be likened to eating a meal. We still need to give God the opportunity to be digested into our being. If the food we eat is not digested, we will have a big problem. Similarly, if we receive God but do not let Him operate in us, it is a big problem. After we receive God, we must give Him the opportunity to operate in us so that He can enter into every part of our being to become our element.</p>
<p>The word <em>operate</em> is in the Bible. Philippians 2:13 says, &ldquo;It is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.&rdquo; When God operates within us, we are &ldquo;digesting&rdquo; Him. Hence, we must always let Him operate in us and gain more ground in us. If He cannot operate in us, we cannot gain more of Him, nor can we be filled with Him.</p><h2 class="head2">The Way God Operates in Us</h2>
<p>God has entered into us, and He dwells in us, but how does He operate in us? A brother may argue with his wife in the morning. While he is arguing with her, does he have any feeling within? The more he argues, the more he wants to argue. If the wife raises her voice slightly, the brother will raise his voice even higher. Some couples can argue from eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning until eight o&rsquo;clock at night. However, a genuine Christian will have a feeling within if he argues with his wife. If he does not have any feeling, I doubt that he is saved or is a genuine Christian. If he is a genuine Christian, as soon as he raises his voice, he will have a feeling within. He will have a sense that God is not pleased with him.</p>
<p>Not only so, when he prays after the argument, he will sense that there is a problem and that he should not have argued. Even the next day he will still sense that there is a problem; there will be an inexplicable feeling within him. This feeling can be compared to having indigestion after a meal. He wants to pray, but he cannot pray. He may want to fellowship with a brother, but he does not have anything to say. He does not want to miss a meeting, but he cannot sit still when he is in the meeting, nor can he receive the message. He feels miserable within because he knows that he should reconcile with his wife, but he cannot bring himself to do it. Hence, he is unable to pray or read the Bible. This feeling of discomfort is not related to being angry with his wife. This is the feeling of a genuine Christian. Such feelings are God&rsquo;s operation within us. When God cannot get through in us, we will feel as if we have &ldquo;indigestion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This feeling of struggle proves that we have the divine life and that we also have a problem within. If we did not have any feeling, it would indicate that we do not have the divine life, that we are dead. A person who is not saved may not be bothered when he argues with his wife, even if the argument continues for a whole day. He may stomp his feet in anger but not feel condemned. However, a person who is saved is alive within. Hence, as soon as he begins to argue with his wife, God will operate within him, causing him to feel bothered. If he does not allow God to operate, there will be a barrier between him and God, and he will feel uncomfortable and bothered.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Responding to God&rsquo;s Operation</h2>
<p>A proper Christian responds to God&rsquo;s operation. When he is about to argue with his wife and senses God&rsquo;s operation, he should obey and stop the argument. There is a brother who was about to argue with his wife, but he had a sense not to argue with her. He immediately stopped, went into the bedroom, shut the door, and prayed. Although he had tears, he felt joy within and began to praise God. Later, when his wife was angry and careless with her words, he was not provoked. At such a time he was not merely human; he was one with God. He let God reign within him so that even when his wife yelled at him and scolded him, he was able to rejoice and praise God. This brother expressed the God who filled him.</p>
<p>If this brother learns this lesson well, he will begin to check with God before he does something. Every time he considers a matter, he will ask, &ldquo;Lord, what do You think about this?&rdquo; He will also ask the Lord concerning his decisions. This shows that he has learned the lesson not to take his own thoughts, views, ways, or decisions. Instead, he will put himself aside and let God have the ground in him. Then God&rsquo;s thoughts, views, ways, and decisions will become his. As a result, his thoughts will be God&rsquo;s thoughts, his views will be God&rsquo;s views, his actions will be God&rsquo;s actions, and his decisions will be God&rsquo;s decisions. His speech, attitude, behavior, and actions will be out of God and will express God. Such a brother has &ldquo;digested&rdquo; God. Hence, his thoughts, emotions, preferences, opinions, and decisions are filled with God. God is not only in him; God is operating in him and being expressed through him.</p>
<p>If we want to gain God, we must let Him operate in us. To gain God does not depend on how zealous we are for Him, nor does it depend on how many things we have done for Him. To gain God depends on our letting Him operate in us and on our being willing to respond to His operation within us. We often are willing to be zealous for God, but we are not willing to respond to God&rsquo;s operation in us. We often are willing to do a great work for Him, but we are not willing to respond to His operation within us by confessing our mistakes. Our zeal and our work are often filled with our own element: our preferences, our interests, our opinions, and our inclinations. We are willing to be zealous for God, but we are not willing to let Him deal with our preferences and interests. We are willing to work for Him, but we are not willing to let Him deal with our opinions and inclinations. Our preferences and opinions in our zeal and work usurp not only the ground that God should have but also His rule in us; hence, He cannot get through in us. We follow our preferences and opinions instead of responding to His operation in us. Our preferences and opinions are our self. Hence, it is the self who rules and reigns in our zeal and our work. We are not willing to put aside the self and let God have the ground in us so that He can be expressed. Only when we are willing to drop everything else and care for God&rsquo;s operation in us, can we gain Him and be filled with Him. When we are willing to live, act, and work according to His operation, He will gain more ground in us, spread in us, and be expressed through us.</p>
<p>If we are willing to put ourselves aside and let God spread and operate freely in us, we will be filled with the riches of God unto the fullness of God (Eph. 3:19b). This is the way to gain God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE MYSTERY OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:4-5, 9; Col. 1:25-27; 2:2</h1>
<h2 class="head1">A HIDDEN MYSTERY</h2>
<p>The purpose of the universe and the purpose for which all things were created are indeed a mystery, which mankind cannot understand. The purpose of man&rsquo;s existence and the meaning of human life are also a mystery, which philosophers have failed to understand.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that all things were created by God. He created all things with a purpose and intention. However, this purpose and intention have been hidden in Him (Eph. 3:9) and were not made known to man. Hence, the purpose and intention of God in His creating the universe are a mystery that is hidden in Him.</p>
<p>Although man can perceive the existence and the power of the Creator by the things that He made (Rom. 1:20), man cannot understand the purpose and intention of the Creator. By studying the structure of his physical body, man can realize how wonderfully God created man, but man cannot understand the meaning of his existence. Ungodly people, who are far away from God, cannot understand the purpose of God&rsquo;s creation, and even those who fear Him and are close to Him are not clear concerning the purpose of creation. This is a mystery that has been hidden in God and was not made known to men in other generations (Eph. 3:5).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION OF THE MYSTERY</h2>
<p>However, in the New Testament age God has revealed this mystery to us in spirit (v. 5). This mystery is no longer hidden; it has been manifested. The purpose of creation and the meaning of human life are no longer a hidden mystery; they are a revelation that has been manifested. The heavenly veil has been opened. God has opened Himself to us; He has shown us the mystery that was hidden in Him so that we may know the purpose of His creation and understand the meaning of human life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MYSTERY OF GOD BEING CHRIST</h2>
<p>Christ is the mystery that has been hidden in God. Christ is also the purpose that has been hidden in God. God created the universe for Christ, and He created mankind for Christ. Christ is the purpose of creation and also the meaning of human life. Without Christ, creation has no purpose, and human life has no meaning. Without Christ, creation is without a center, and human life is vanity. Hence, in order to know the purpose of creation and to understand the meaning of human life, we must know Christ, and in order to apprehend the center of creation and to have reality in our human life, we must obtain Christ. When we know and obtain Christ, we will understand and obtain human life and all things, because &ldquo;Christ is all and in all&rdquo; (Col. 3:11). Christ is the content of all things, the reality in all things, and the answer to all things. Without Christ all is vanity and problematic. Christ is the mystery of God. God is a mystery, and the revelation of this mystery is Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST IN US</h2>
<p>Christ, the mystery of God, is now in us, the believers. He is God&rsquo;s purpose and intention. God caused Christ to enter into us so that Christ can be our life, the purpose of our human existence, and the meaning of our human life. Christ is not merely in God; He is also in us. He is not merely God&rsquo;s life and purpose; He is also our life and our purpose. Christ is the mystery hidden in God, and He is also the mystery hidden in us.</p>
<p>God created the universe and all things, including mankind, so that Christ could enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life and so that Christ would be the center of the universe and of all things. Before Christ came, God did not reveal His intention to man. However, now that Christ has become the Spirit to enter into us and to dwell in us, we not only know God&rsquo;s purpose in creating all things; we can also live in this purpose. By entering into us, Christ causes us to be people who are in God&rsquo;s purpose, and by living in us, He enables us to live in God&rsquo;s purpose. Christ is God&rsquo;s mystery, purpose, and center; hence, when He enters into us, God&rsquo;s mystery, purpose, and center also enter into us. As a result, we are no longer people without a purpose in our human life or without a center in our living. Christ is in us to be not only our life but also our purpose and our center. When we let Christ live in us and when we live by Him, we become people in God&rsquo;s purpose. This is glorious!</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST IN US BEING A MYSTERY</h2>
<p>Although Christ as God&rsquo;s mystery has been revealed to us, Christ in us is still a mystery to the people in the world. Our holiness, patience, and love are Christ in us. He is also the power that enables us to live out these virtues. This has been revealed to us, but it is mysterious to those in the world. The Christ who dwells in the believers is the power that enables the church to testify for the Lord and the courage that enables the church to suffer persecution. This is clear to the believers but a mystery to the world. The Christ who lives in us makes us glorious before God but mysterious before men. Christ in us is now a glorious mystery, but He will be a glorious manifestation in the future.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CENTRALITY OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:22-23, 9-10; Phil. 1:20; Col. 1:15-19; 2:9; 3:11</h1>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE CENTRALITY OF GOD</h2>
<p>In the Bible God reveals that His person and His work are centered on Christ. Christ is God&rsquo;s center, and He is also God&rsquo;s thought and purpose. God&rsquo;s thoughts and plans depend on Christ and are for Christ. God is pleased for Christ to be all and in all (Col. 3:11). God desires that all things be in Christ and be filled with Christ. All God&rsquo;s work is to express and glorify Christ so that Christ may have the first place in everything and in all things (1:18).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN THE GODHEAD</h2>
<p>Christ is &ldquo;the image of the invisible God&rdquo; and &ldquo;the effulgence of His glory and the impress of His substance&rdquo; (v. 15; Heb. 1:3). God is embodied in Christ; hence, all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily (Col. 2:9). Apart from Christ, man cannot see or know God, nor can man touch and obtain God. In order to communicate with God, to contact Him, man must go through Christ (John 14:6). Only in Christ can we partake of God and enjoy the fullness of God. Hence, it is by God&rsquo;s person and by His fullness that Christ can have the first place in all things and be glorified in God&rsquo;s relationship with man and man&rsquo;s contact with God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN CREATION</h2>
<p>Christ is the Creator; all things are out from Him (Heb. 1:10). All things were created through Him, and &ldquo;apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being&rdquo; (John 1:3). He is the source of all things, and all things were created by Him. Christ is not only the Creator of all things; He is also the Firstborn of all creation, and He is before all things (Col. 1:15, 17). Although Christ is the Creator, He became flesh; that is, He became a creature. Hence, He is not only the Creator but also a creature. From God&rsquo;s viewpoint, prior to the creation of all things, Christ was already a creature. For this reason, the Bible says that Christ is &ldquo;the Firstborn of all creation&rdquo; (v. 15) and that He is &ldquo;the beginning of the creation of God&rdquo; (Rev. 3:14). Hence, Christ represents not only the Creator but also the creature; He is the Lord of all creation, and He is also the Firstborn of all creation. He can be seen in every aspect of creation, and He is everything in creation. Hence, both the Creator and the creature can be seen in Him.</p>
<p>Christ is also the Upholder of all things. After creating all things, He is now &ldquo;upholding and bearing all things by the word of His power&rdquo; (Heb. 1:3). All things not only were created by Him but also cohere in Him (Col. 1:17). He is the source of all things, and He is also the course of all things. The process of creation occurred in Him; He is the active instrument through which creation occurred.</p>
<p>Furthermore, God appointed Christ &ldquo;Heir of all things&rdquo; (Heb. 1:2). &ldquo;All things have been created through Him and unto Him&rdquo; (Col. 1:16), all things cohere in Him, and all things will be inherited by Him. Hence, Romans 11:36 says, &ldquo;Out from Him and through Him and to Him are all things.&rdquo; Christ is the source of all things and the course of all things, and He is also the destination of all things. He is the beginning, the course, and the consummation of all things. Christ is everything.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>Christ is &ldquo;the Firstborn from the dead&rdquo; (Col. 1:18); that is, He is the first to resurrect from the dead. In relation to creation, He created all things, and He is the Firstborn of all creation. In relation to redemption, He produced the church, and He is the Firstborn from the dead. In regard to all things, He is the Firstborn of all creation, but in regard to the church, He is the Firstborn in resurrection. All things were made through His work of creation, but the church was born through His work of redemption. He created all things, and He is the Firstborn of all creation. He also produced the church, and He resurrected first. The things that were created do not have God&rsquo;s resurrection life. The church, however, is not only created; the church is in resurrection and has the resurrection life of God. Christ is the first to have God&rsquo;s resurrection life. In creation, that is, in regard to all things, Christ is the Firstborn of creation; however, in redemption, that is, in regard to the church, He is the Firstborn in resurrection. Hence, whether in creation or in redemption, God desires that Christ &ldquo;might have the first place in all things&rdquo; (v. 18).</p>
<p>Christ is not only the first to resurrect; He is also the Head of the church (v. 18). The church is God&rsquo;s new creation in resurrection, has the life and image of God, and will enter into God&rsquo;s glory. Christ has the first place in the new creation, and He is also the Head of the new creation. As the new creation, the church is &ldquo;His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all&rdquo; (Eph. 1:23); the church is the extension of His days and His expression (Isa. 53:10).</p>
<p>Christ is the Head of the church, and He is also &ldquo;Head over all things to the church&rdquo; (Eph. 1:22). Christ was incarnated, and He accomplished redemption. This redemption is not only for the church but also for all things; therefore, God appointed Him to be Head over all things to the church. In redemption Christ is the Head of the church, and He is the Head of all things. He is over all things, He is the Head of all things, and the church is His Body, His fullness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN ETERNITY</h2>
<p>In the future, at the fullness of the times, God will &ldquo;head up all things in Christ&rdquo; (v. 10) according to the arrangement of His mysterious plan. The purpose of God&rsquo;s plan, of creation, and of redemption is to express Christ, to glorify Christ, and to give Him the first place in all things. Therefore, at the fullness of the times, when God has accomplished all things, that is, in eternity future, God will head up all things in Christ. Christ will be the Head and the center of all things, and He will be glorified in all things and expressed through all things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s purpose is for Christ to be expressed in all things; therefore, He does not have another intention with regard to the believers. As believers, we are the firstfruits of God&rsquo;s creatures (James 1:18); hence, we should take the lead among all the creatures to make Christ our center, to glorify Him, and to express Him. Regardless of the circumstances, we should always magnify Christ in our body (Phil. 1:20).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FLESH AND THE LAW</h1>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s intention, man should live by his spirit, which is to live by God. However, by exercising his will to receive Satan&rsquo;s suggestion, man became fallen, began to live by his soul, and became independent of God. As a result, man fell further to live by the flesh; and he came under its bondage and thus became flesh (Gen. 6:3, 12). Man&rsquo;s self and natural life reside in the flesh and are expressed through the flesh. Hence, to live by the flesh is to live by the self and by the natural life. Our flesh cannot be separated from the self or from our natural life. Our flesh expresses our self and our natural life.</p>
<p>The nature of the flesh is not only evil but also independent of God. Whatever the flesh does, whether evil or good, is independent of God. Even in serving God, the flesh is independent of God. The Bible reveals that the flesh likes to do not only evil but also good, and it even likes to serve God (Rom. 7:18-19). Although the flesh likes to serve God, it is independent of God, because it cannot depend on God. The greatest evil of the flesh is that it causes man to be independent of God, that is, to not rely on God. Hence, God hates the flesh that does evil, and He rejects the flesh that does good in order to serve Him. God rejects whatever the flesh does.</p>
<p>The flesh is evil, yet it delights in doing good. The flesh is independent of God, yet it delights in serving God. Hence, the flesh causes man to do evil and to do good; it causes man to oppose God and to serve God. A person who lives by the flesh wants to do evil and to do good. A person who lives by the flesh can oppose God, or he can serve God. However, regardless of whether the flesh does evil or good and whether it opposes God or serves God, the flesh is at enmity with God and cannot please Him (vv. 7-8).</p>
<p>Actually, the flesh can neither do good nor serve God. However, man does not know the flesh; that is, he does not know the self, because the flesh and the self are one. Since man does not know that he is unable to do good or to serve God, he wants to do good and to serve God. For this reason, God gave the law. The law exposes and proves the impotence of man&rsquo;s self, the flesh, in doing good and in serving God. When God gave the law, He did not expect man to keep the law. God was prepared for man to break the law so that man&rsquo;s self, his flesh, would be exposed in its weakness and impotence in doing good and in serving God (7:7-24; 3:20; 8:3). However, because man does not know himself, he endeavors to keep the law and to fulfill the requirements of God&rsquo;s law. Man does not expect his efforts to be a failure. The more man fails at keeping the law, the more he struggles to keep it, and the more he struggles, the more he fails. This cycle continues until man realizes what he is and sees the impotence of his flesh.</p>
<p>The law was given because of man&rsquo;s flesh and is related to man&rsquo;s flesh. Man&rsquo;s desire to keep the law is according to the flesh. When man lives by the flesh, he wants to keep the law. The law requires that the flesh do good, and the flesh wants to fulfill this requirement of the law. The flesh always responds to the law. However, although the flesh wants to fulfill the requirement of the law, it is unable to do so. In requiring the flesh to do certain things, the law exposes the inability of the flesh to fulfill its requirement (3:20). The more the flesh tries to fulfill the requirement of the law, the more it breaks the commandments of the law. The more a man tries to keep the law by his flesh, the more he breaks the law. God&rsquo;s way of salvation is that man die to the law (7:4; Gal. 2:19). In order to die to the law, we must put the flesh to death. When we are delivered from the flesh, we will be delivered from the law (Rom. 7:4-6), because the flesh is related to the law.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">ABIDING IN THE LORD</h1>
<p>To abide in the Lord is to live a life in union with the Lord, that is, to live in the Lord. Branches that abide in the vine live in the vine and have a life in union with the vine. In like manner, when we abide in the Lord, we live in the Lord, and we have a life in union with the Lord. Furthermore, branches that abide in the vine take the life of the vine as their life, live in the life of the vine, and thereby live out the life of the vine. In like manner, when we abide in the Lord, we take His life as our life, we live in His life, and we thereby live out His life. Such an abiding requires that we deny and reject the self and the life of the self; that is, we need to reject the soul-life, the natural life.</p>
<p>The self and the life of the self are our greatest hindrances to abiding in the Lord. Sins and the world are also obstacles to our abiding in the Lord, but since they are obvious, they can be easily detected and condemned. The self and the life of the self, however, are hidden and latent; hence, they often cause us to live apart from the Lord without our being conscious of it. When we live by the self, we cannot live in the Lord. The self cannot co-exist with the Lord, nor can the life of the self co-exist with His life. If we live in the self, we cannot live in the Lord, and if we live by the life of the self, we cannot live by the Lord&rsquo;s life. Hence, in order to abide in the Lord, we must deny and reject the self and its life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to abide in the Lord, we must see that we are in the Lord. This is the basis of our abiding in Him. Being in the Lord is a spiritual fact, and abiding in the Lord is a spiritual living. Our spiritual living is based on this spiritual fact. Hence, we must see the fact that we are in the Lord before we can have a living of abiding in Him.</p>
<p>The fact of our being in the Lord is accomplished by God, but to abide in the Lord is our responsibility. Just as we cannot do anything to be in the Lord, so God cannot bear the responsibility for our abiding in the Lord. First Corinthians 1:30 says, &ldquo;Of Him you are in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; It is of God that we are in the Lord. God has put us into the Lord and put His life into us so that we may be joined to the Lord as one spirit (Rom. 8:9-10; 1 Cor. 6:17). God has accomplished this for us. This is not something that we can do. We need only to see this accomplished fact.</p>
<p>After we are saved, every one of us needs to see this glorious fact. God has put us in the Lord; we are in Him. Therefore, we can abide in the Lord. No one can do anything to put himself in the Lord. Our being in the Lord is accomplished by God, not by us. When we see that we are in the Lord, we will be able to abide in Him (John 15:4-5).</p>
<p>The branches of the vine can abide in the vine because they are branches in the vine. Their abiding is based on what they are. If they were not branches of the vine, they could not abide in the vine. Similarly, if we are not in the Lord, we cannot abide in Him. We can abide in the Lord because we are in Him. Our abiding is based on what we are. We are branches of the Lord, the true vine; hence, we can abide in Him. We are responsible for our abiding in the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">TOUCHING THE LORD IN FELLOWSHIP</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider how to touch the Lord in fellowship. This matter seems common, because we talk about it often. However, this is an important issue. All our spiritual experiences depend on fellowshipping with the Lord.</p>
<p>On one hand, we can say that it is rather easy to fellowship with the Lord, because God is Spirit (John 4:24). He is omnipresent, and we can touch Him in every place and at any time. On the other hand, fellowship is not simple. It is not a simple thing to enter into the Lord&rsquo;s presence, that is, to touch Him, or to have continual fellowship with Him. Here are a few basic points for the saints who desire to touch the Lord in fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GIVING GOD A CHANNEL THROUGH FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>In order to touch the Lord in fellowship, we must first see that the Lord created us and redeemed us so that we would fellowship with Him. All His work in us and all the grace He gives to us are for us to fellowship with Him, to be joined to Him, and to be mingled with Him. This is His only goal for us.</p>
<p>If we have any knowledge concerning spiritual things, we will realize that apart from mingling with God, we have no purpose in the universe. Our only purpose in this universe is to fellowship with God, to be His partner in fellowship. Hence, a person who does not fellowship with God is empty. Sooner or later, every believer will realize that his unique purpose is to fellowship with God. This is what God desires.</p>
<p>Some people regard fellowship as something for their personal enjoyment, something that gives them inner peace and happiness. To them fellowship is a blessing prepared by God solely for man&rsquo;s enjoyment. They think that if they fellowship with God when they are weak, He will strengthen them, and if they fellowship with Him when they are confused, He will guide them and bring them through the situation. This is a mistaken concept, because fellowship is not for our enjoyment. Fellowship is to give God an outlet, a channel.</p>
<p>God needs a channel, an outlet, just as electricity needs light bulbs. God needs man to be His channel. Hence, fellowship is not for our enjoyment; it is to make us God&rsquo;s outlet. The concept of enjoyment is a childish concept from the initial stage of a Christian&rsquo;s living. We must ask the Lord to show us that fellowship is not for our enjoyment; rather, it is for Him to have an outlet. He wants us to fellowship with Him so that we can be His channels.</p>
<p>May the Lord be gracious and enlighten us to see that it is not enough to be Christians who pray, read the Bible, serve, and preach the gospel. It is not enough to do these outward things. The purpose of a Christian is to fellowship with God and become His outlet. If we, as Christians, do not have such a purpose, we have not arrived at God&rsquo;s goal. Regrettably, very few Christians have reached this goal, because not many understand the meaning of fellowship, and fewer live in fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DEMAND IN FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>The problems related to our fellowship with God are on our side, not on God&rsquo;s side. God yearns for man to fellowship with Him. When we sense that we have lost our fellowship with God, we must understand that there is a problem on our side. This is confirmed in our experience.</p>
<p>The most serious problem that causes us to lose our fellowship with God is to not comply with the demands He makes during fellowship. God always wants to fellowship with us, but that is when He is most demanding. These demands are the most severe. As soon as we enter into fellowship with Him, He will demand something of us. If we comply with His demand, our fellowship will continue and will become sweeter and more intimate. However, if we do not submit to His demand, we will immediately lose our fellowship. Hence, whenever we lose our fellowship with God, we must immediately acknowledge that there is a problem on our side, which is that we did not respond to His demand. Whenever we fail to comply with God&rsquo;s demands, we will lose our fellowship with Him.</p>
<p>Although God&rsquo;s demands are more severe than any other demands, He does not make His demands all at once but one at a time. In every fellowship there is a demand. Whenever God stops demanding something of us, we are no longer in the fellowship. To remain in fellowship means that there are demands; when there are no demands, the fellowship has been lost. In other words, the extent of the fellowship is the extent of the demands, and the extent of our complying with the demands is the extent of our fellowship with God. The demands in fellowship will continue until we are mature in life, that is, until we are raptured to see the Lord.</p>
<p>Those who seek fellowship should be willing to pay any price in order to submit to the Lord&rsquo;s demands. This requires our absolute consecration. If we care for ourselves or seek our personal enjoyment, we will not meet the requirement for fellowship and will eventually run into problems. Often we cannot enter into fellowship, because we are unwilling to drop everything. When we are unwilling to pay the price, we will lose the fellowship.</p><h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP AND<br />
 THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH MAN</h2>
<p>Although fellowship involves two parties, God and man, fellowship is God&rsquo;s demand, not man&rsquo;s. During fellowship our sentiments should be mingled with God&rsquo;s sentiments, and our preferences should be mingled with His preferences. During fellowship our mind, emotion, and will should be mingled with God. If we want to fellowship with God, we must be prepared to lose ourselves in Him. Otherwise, our preferences and desires will remain separate from His preferences and desires. Even though our preferences and desires may not be bad, we and God will still be two separate entities, and we will not have fellowship.</p>
<p>The principle of fellowship is that man and God become one, are mingled as one. This mingling is not a matter of God being lost in man but of man being lost in God. Man cannot ask God to change, because fellowship is not man&rsquo;s requirement; it is God&rsquo;s demand, His seeking an outlet. Hence, fellowship requires that man be lost in God. The highest price of consecration is for man to be fully lost in God during fellowship. In genuine fellowship man&rsquo;s mind, emotion, and will are fully surrendered to God and completely lost in Him. Fellowship is a severe demand. If we do not surrender, we will not have fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE OF FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>The three points mentioned above are the basic conditions for fellowship. If we know these conditions, it will be easy for us to fellowship. In addition, we also need to practice.</p>
<p>First, we cannot fellowship with God and touch Him in the physical realm or in our mind, because He dwells in our spirit. We must learn to turn to our spirit and fellowship with God according to the sense in the depths of our being.</p>
<p>Second, we must set aside time. During this time we need to drop outward affairs and put aside our thoughts so that we can fellowship with God.</p>
<p>Third, when we fellowship, we should set aside our demands. We should even stop our prayer, because fellowship is for God&rsquo;s demands, not ours. During fellowship we can respond only to God&rsquo;s demand.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>In conclusion, fellowship is God&rsquo;s demand, and it is a severe demand. Fellowship requires that our mind, emotion, and will be fully surrendered to God, and it requires that we pay the price. This price is not according to what we want to pay, for such a price is worthless to God. Our paying the price is precious and valuable to God when it is according to what He requires of us. We often feel that it is difficult to pay a price and that we cannot do it. However, it is not that we cannot pay the price but that we are unwilling to pay the price. When we respond to God&rsquo;s demand, we will have fellowship, but if we are unwilling to submit to His demand, we will be unable to touch Him.</p>
<p>After Abraham took Hagar as his wife, he did not have God&rsquo;s appearing or God&rsquo;s revelation for thirteen years (Gen. 16:16&mdash;17:1). Abraham was in darkness because he did not have fellowship with God. In Song of Songs 5 the beloved asked his lover for fellowship, but she ignored him and would not answer his request for fellowship. Later when she rose up to seek her beloved, she searched for him and could not find him, because he had hidden himself (vv. 2-6). This was her beloved&rsquo;s disciplining her.</p>
<p>For those who love the Lord and pursue Him, being unable to touch the Lord or to have His presence is a painful experience. The Lord uses this experience to discipline those who love Him but are unwilling to pay the price so that later they dare not refuse His demand. This discipline is temporary; it is not permanent. After thirteen years God appeared to Abraham again and fellowshipped with him. God disciplines us in order to restore our fellowship with Him. May the Lord have mercy upon us so that we would be those who respond to His demands and live in fellowship and thus be totally lost in Him. The future of the church depends on our being this kind of people.</p>
<p>In Christianity there are messages about fearing God and worshipping Him, but seldom is there a message on surrendering to God and being lost in Him. For this reason, God cannot find an outlet. The situation in Christianity can be compared to respecting one&rsquo;s father yet being unwilling to submit to him in a certain matter. Madame Guyon once said that the greatest miracle in the universe is a person who is willing to offer himself unreservedly to God. This also applies to a Christian who is willing to live in fellowship and to surrender himself to God. God&rsquo;s outlet on the earth depends on such ones.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">FOUR LIFE EXERCISES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 1:8-9, 12; 3:17-18; 4:6-11; 5:9, 14-15; 6:4-10; 12:7-10; 13:3, 5</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning spiritual pursuit and life exercises. Although we have spoken much concerning this in the past, the saints still do not have a strong desire for the Lord. They have heard many messages, but they are still veiled, and there is still not much growth in life among us. Hence, we need further fellowship concerning the way of life. May the Lord have mercy on us and cause us to have a heart for Him so that we would be unveiled to receive light and to walk on this way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEING THAT CHRIST IS OUR LIFE</h2>
<p>Every form of life in the universe has its law, and God&rsquo;s life is not an exception. God&rsquo;s life will operate in us the same way that it operated in Paul two thousand years ago. In the Scripture Reading we listed many verses in which Paul speaks of himself. We hope to receive light from these verses and to see from his experience the basis for spiritual pursuit and life exercises. First, Paul&rsquo;s experience shows that a person who pursues life must know that Christ is in him as life. In 2 Corinthians 4:6 and 7 Paul says, &ldquo;The God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts...But we have this treasure in earthen vessels.&rdquo; According to these verses, the God who shined in Paul&rsquo;s heart became the treasure in him. This treasure is Christ, who became flesh and has entered into His believers as the life-giving Spirit. This is the first basic knowledge that we must have in the exercise of life. Unless we have been enlightened by the Holy Spirit to see that Christ has shined Himself into us to be our life and our treasure, we cannot pursue life.</p>
<p>In order to pursue life, we must first know that Christ is life in us (Col. 3:4). Paul&rsquo;s word to the Corinthians confirms this: &ldquo;Test yourselves whether you are in the faith; prove yourselves. Or do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?&rdquo; (2 Cor. 13:5). The first item in the exercise of spiritual life is to see that Christ is in us to be our life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing High and Profound Revelations<br />
as Well as Small and Simple Experiences</h2>
<p>The truth and light in the Bible concerning being in Christ and concerning the cross are always high and profound, but what the Bible says concerning the experiences of being in Christ and of the cross is not so high or profound. In Ephesians Paul says that Christ is far above all, that He has been given to be Head over all things to the church, and that the church is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (1:21-23). In Colossians he says that Christ is all things and that Christ is in all things (1:15-19). However, in 2 Corinthians the apostle Paul does not speak of his experience as being high or profound. Second Corinthians speaks of being in Christ and of the cross. In comparison to Ephesians and Colossians, however, 2 Corinthians appears to be rather simple and plain. In 2 Corinthians we do not see the Christ who is all in all filling us, nor do we see Christ being all things and being in all things. On the contrary, here Paul says that Christ is the treasure in earthen vessels so that the power of God can be manifested in the weak (4:7).</p>
<p>According to church history, there was a group of people who focused on experience. Their writings do not contain high revelations or profound light but seem simple and insignificant. We must not treasure only the messages on the all-inclusiveness of Christ or His all-inclusive death on the cross. The death of Christ is indeed all-inclusive, but it is of little value if we do not die. Christ is all-inclusive, but what does this mean if we do not experience His all-inclusiveness? Paul did not write only Ephesians and Colossians; he also wrote 2 Corinthians. In Ephesians he writes that Christ fills all things and that the church is His fullness (1:23). In Colossians Paul says that all things cohere in Christ and that He is in all things (1:15-19). In 2 Corinthians Paul says, &ldquo;We have this treasure in earthen vessels&rdquo; (4:7). In this verse Paul applies Jesus Christ to himself. Paul was a vessel, but the treasure in him was universal. These verses show that when speaking of revelation and light, the Bible presents something high and profound, but what it says concerning experience is not so high or profound.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we need to see something high and profound, but on the other hand, we need experiences that are simple and small. Otherwise, our experiences can be false. If you leap and praise every day and proclaim, &ldquo;Hallelujah! Christ is the One who fills all,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The death of the cross is all-inclusive,&rdquo; I would question whether this is real. In Ephesians and Colossians Paul saw the Christ who is in the universe and in all things. This light is very high. However, in 2 Corinthians Paul experienced the Christ who is in an earthen vessel. He had small and simple experiences of Christ. His living in poverty was in Christ, his fasting was in Christ, his suffering of reproach was in Christ, his being praised was in Christ, and his being in want was in Christ; whether through evil report or through good report, he experienced Christ (6:4-10). This is Christ in our experience.</p>
<p>Some have asked me how God can care about so many trivial things: He cares about the shoes and clothes we wear, whether we watch movies, and how we socialize. The general concept about God is that He is too great to be involved in the trivial and petty matters of our living. We must be clear that the revelation of Christ is high and profound, but our experience is often simple and small. If we cannot experience Christ in small things, the light we have seen is questionable.</p>
<p>This is true not only of our experience of Christ but also of our enjoyment of the things in the universe. For example, the ocean is filled with water, but we would drown if all the water in the ocean were poured on us. We can receive water only one sip at a time.</p><h2 class="head2">Emphasizing Both Light and Experience</h2>
<p>In the late 1820s the Lord raised up the British Brethren and gave them substantial spiritual light. In the early twentieth century He raised up Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis. She knew the cross and knew the truth concerning the believers&rsquo; co-crucifixion with Christ. She was helped by the mystics, just as Brother Andrew Murray was also helped. Mrs. Penn-Lewis read almost all the writings of Madame Guyon. She even wrote a summary of one of Madame Guyon&rsquo;s well-known books, <em>Spiritual Torrents;</em> this summary was published as <em>Life out of Death</em>. The writings of Mrs. Penn-Lewis are rather weighty, and those with spiritual experience acknowledge that Mrs. Penn-Lewis was spiritual. However, believers in the Brethren Assembly oppose Mrs. Penn-Lewis. These believers have seen the light of the cross but neglect the experience of the cross. They do not understand that light is comparable to theory and that experience is comparable to practice. Hence, we must not focus merely on objective truth while neglecting subjective experience.</p>
<p>The mystics, however, were too much in experience. For example, Brother Lawrence knew more about God from seeing a leaf fall. In principle this is right, but focusing on experience can become a problem. Those who read the writings of only the mystics can become narrow. The Bible says that everyone who believes into the Lord will have eternal life (John 3:15; 6:40) and that whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved (Rom. 10:13). However, the mystics say that a person must answer the Lord&rsquo;s solemn call before he can be regenerated. Their so-called answering the Lord&rsquo;s solemn call refers to overcoming. It is a mistake for them to regard regeneration as being related to the growth of spiritual life. As soon as a person calls on the Lord&rsquo;s name, he receives the Lord&rsquo;s life. This is regeneration. The mystics, however, say that regeneration is not complete until Christ lives and reigns in a person. This overemphasis of experience is in conflict with the light. This is one of the reasons that there have been disputes among believers in church history.</p>
<p>The Lord has shown us the light seen by the Brethren, and He has also shown us the experience of the mystics. The universe is filled with air, but we receive air one breath at a time. Similarly, the universe is filled with Christ, but in order to experience Him, we need to receive Him as our life in our being and in the small things of our living. I am concerned that many of the Lord&rsquo;s seekers in the churches still focus either on light or on experience. If they would accept both light and experience, there will not be a problem. Light is profound and revelation is high, but we experience them in simple and small ways.</p>
<p>Based on the light that we have seen, we will consider our experience. Second Corinthians 4:7 says, &ldquo;We have this treasure in earthen vessels.&rdquo; This means that the One who fills all things has come into our earthen vessel. Hence, we should not thank and praise the Lord by saying merely, &ldquo;You are the universe. You are all things.&rdquo; We should praise Him further by saying, &ldquo;Lord, You are in me, an earthen vessel.&rdquo; This is according to experience. In order to experience the divine life, we must first see that the Christ who fills all things is in us. For this reason, Paul says, &ldquo;Do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you?&rdquo; (13:5). Not only so, the treasure in us manifests the excellency of the power of God (4:7). We must know this if we want to pursue and experience life. The Gentiles do not know that there is a treasure in us, but we must know this.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONSECRATION AND LOVING THE LORD</h2>
<p>Like Paul, those who know the treasure and pursue to live out the life of this treasure should be determined to gain the honor of being well pleasing to the Lord (5:9). They should also be constrained by the Lord&rsquo;s love to no longer live to themselves but to the Lord who died for them and has been raised (vv. 14-15). This is to love the Lord and to consecrate ourselves to Him. We need to see the Lord&rsquo;s love and consecrate ourselves. We can pray, &ldquo;Lord, I am determined to stop living to myself but to live to You. You died for me, and You have been raised.&rdquo; This is the second life exercise.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIPPING WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>Third, we must see that the Holy Spirit lives in us and that we must use our spirit to fellowship with the Lord by beholding His beauty and by letting His image become our image through transformation. Second Corinthians 3:17-18 says, &ldquo;Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; This is fellowship. After consecration, there should be fellowship. Hence, when we consecrate ourselves to the Lord, we must fellowship with Him so that He can live in us and live out of us. Fellowship causes us to grow in the spiritual life.</p>
<p>The fellowship in 2 Corinthians 3:17-18 includes the teaching of the anointing in 1 John 2:27 and the operation of God in Philippians 2:13. We must put these three passages together. The Lord Spirit is in us; hence, we need to open to Him and fellowship with Him so that He can have the opportunity to anoint us and to operate within us. When we receive the teaching of the anointing and follow His operation in us, we will be transformed into the Lord&rsquo;s image. This is to have Christ formed in us (Gal. 4:19) and to let Him grow in us (Col. 2:19). Hence, as those who love the Lord, we must consecrate ourselves to Him and fellowship with Him. Fellowship brings in the growth of life, which leads to our being transformed into the Lord&rsquo;s image.</p><h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE DISCIPLINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>When we know that Christ dwells in us, we should consecrate ourselves to Him so that He can live in us and so that we will be well pleasing to Him. We also need to fellowship with Him so that He can operate in us. Then we will grow in life and be transformed into His image. In addition to these matters, which are within us, we need something from the environment, which is the discipline of the Holy Spirit. The anointing is one aspect of our spiritual life, and the discipline of the Holy Spirit is another aspect.</p>
<p>The discipline of the Holy Spirit does not refer to the Spirit&rsquo;s ruling within us but to His disciplining us through the people, things, and matters that He arranges in our environment. Everything that we encounter in our environment has an element of the discipline of the Holy Spirit. There was a sister who was so particular about her clothes that she spent a long time getting dressed. One day while she was ironing a pretty dress, she had a sense to stop, but she ignored the sense and continued ironing. After ironing, she put the dress on and went out. As soon as she stepped out the door, a little dog jumped on her with its dirty paws, leaving a mark on her dress. This was the discipline of the Holy Spirit. While she was ironing, the Spirit operated within her, but she would not obey. Hence, there was a dog waiting for her at the door. This dog not only soiled her dress but also tore it. This sister was at a loss, not knowing whether to laugh or to cry. This was the discipline of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit often uses sickness, disobedient children, a complaining wife, a demanding husband, or even a cunning maid to discipline us. For example, through the operation of the Holy Spirit, a brother might realize that he should not serve the Lord in his own way, but he disobeys this sense. One day, however, the Holy Spirit might cause a maid to disobey him, and then he will realize that he also disobeys the Lord.</p>
<p>As one who served the Lord, Paul had many outward situations that caused him to mature in life. Paul was obedient to God; he did not need a &ldquo;little dog&rdquo; to deal with him. The dealing of the Holy Spirit with the sister mentioned above was negative, but the dealing of the Holy Spirit with Paul was positive. What befell Paul in Asia was beyond his power (2 Cor. 1:8). What he encountered in his environment was for him to experience the resurrection life within him. Hence, God did not deal with Paul merely for the sake of discipline; rather, God was providing an excellent opportunity for the divine life to mature in him. In order for wheat to ripen, it needs to be exposed to heat from the sun. Such exposure to heat is a dealing in the outward environment.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 12:2-7 Paul says that he was caught away to the third heaven and also into Paradise where he heard unspeakable words, which are not allowed for a man to speak. Because of the transcendence of the revelations, he was given a thorn in the flesh so that he would not be exceedingly lifted up. We do not know what this thorn was, but some people say that it refers to the weakness of his eyes (cf. Gal. 4:15). Whatever the thorn was, it caused him to suffer. Paul, however, says that there were two benefits from the thorn. One benefit was that it subdued him so that he would not be proud but would experience the Lord&rsquo;s sufficient grace, and the other was that it manifested his weaknesses so that he could experience the Lord&rsquo;s power (2 Cor. 12:7-9). Although he beheld the Lord and fellowshipped with Him with an unveiled face, Paul needed this thorn in order to mature in life. The thorn was an outward environment.</p>
<p>Paul was both defamed and praised; he received both evil reports and good reports (6:8). This means that while some people spoke well of him, others spoke ill of him. The more useful a person is in the Lord, the more he will be criticized. Mrs. Penn-Lewis, whom we mentioned earlier, is an example. Some people slandered her by saying that she was a witch. Those who are used by the Lord will be praised, criticized, despised, highly regarded, and reviled. They will receive both evil reports and good reports.</p>
<p>Paul had times of poverty and times of abundance. Because he experienced poverty, hunger, and abundance, he was able to enrich many, and he possessed all things (vv. 4-5, 10). These were adjustments from his environment. The life within him coordinated with his environment.</p>
<p>We should not think that we have no need of outward environments in order for us to mature in life. Even Paul needed his environment for the divine life to mature. He testified that his conduct in the world was &ldquo;not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God&rdquo; (1:12). This means that it was not easy for Paul to deal with the environment he encountered. Many people may use skillful maneuvering or play tricks in order to cope with their environment. Paul, however, was not like that; he relied on the grace of God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although Paul&rsquo;s outer man was persecuted, cast down, and afflicted, he was not abandoned or destroyed (4:9). We should not think that a life of following the Lord is one of ease and comfort, nor should we think that as long as we love the Lord, we will always receive material blessings. Because we have God&rsquo;s life, the world is an oven, a furnace, to burn us so that our vessels will be fit for His use. There is not one spiritual person whose biography portrays a life that was without any suffering from his environment. Such suffering is not only inevitable but also necessary. The world is a place of suffering. However, to the believers, suffering has a positive meaning. Some Gentiles might be spared from suffering, but for seekers of the Lord, suffering comes by the arrangement of the Holy Spirit for their discipline. For example, we might want to make much money, but the Holy Spirit prevents us from making money; we might want to be poor, but the Holy Spirit sends money our way. Do not think that being poor is a dealing but that being wealthy is not a dealing. Being wealthy can be a dealing.</p>
<p>Hence, on the one hand, our outward environment is in coordination with the divine life, but on the other hand, our outward environment is also a reflection of the divine life, showing the extent of our maturity. Having tears or complaints when we suffer is an indication that we are not yet mature. If we cannot tolerate being poor or being rich, we are not sufficiently mature. When we can bow our head and worship God in the face of suffering, poverty, or abundance, then we are maturing in life.</p>
<p>In order to pursue growth in life, we must know that Christ is our life, we must consecrate ourselves and love the Lord, we must fellowship with the Lord and be transformed into His image, and we must receive the discipline of the Holy Spirit in our environment. This is the way for the divine life to gradually reach maturity.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TEACHING OF THE ANOINTING<br />
AND THE DISCIPLINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h1>
<p>There are two aspects of our experience of life. The first aspect is the inner operation of the Holy Spirit, that is, the teaching of the anointing (1 John 2:27). The second aspect is the outward discipline of the Holy Spirit through our environment. We need to obey the operation of the Holy Spirit within us and accept the outward discipline in our environment. A believer&rsquo;s growth in life involves developing his inner sense and accepting his environment. The more a saint grows in the divine life, the more he will grow in knowing God through fellowship in obeying the teaching of the anointing. He will also grow in accepting the discipline of the Holy Spirit that he encounters in his environment. The more spiritual a person is, the more he will surrender to the anointing and to the discipline in his environment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING SPIRITUAL LESSONS</h2>
<p>The spiritual lessons we learn every day are related both to the anointing within and to what we encounter in our environment. Thus, the spiritual lessons that we need to learn include accepting what we encounter in our environment in coordination with the inner anointing. Many Christians do not seem to experience the inner anointing, nor are they subject to what they encounter in their environment. For this reason, they have not learned any lessons related to the anointing, and although they suffer much pain and affliction, they have not learned any lessons from their environment. They listen to messages, read spiritual books, pray often, and fellowship with the Lord, but they have not learned to live in the anointing, they do not know God&rsquo;s leading, nor do they accept the lessons that God has given them through their environment. Such saints have not grown in the divine life.</p>
<p>In contrast, a person who is growing in life has the inner anointing and lives in the Lord&rsquo;s operation daily. His experience of the anointing is not limited to once or twice a day; rather, he lives in the anointing and follows the inner operation of God throughout the day. Furthermore, he is constantly learning lessons from what he encounters in his environment and is submissive to his circumstances. He learns spiritual lessons whether he is praised or mocked and whether his environment is calm or turbulent. Furthermore, the lessons he learns are not a matter of doctrine or theory; they are experiences of life. He sees how a situation deals with a problem within him and how it causes him to experience the indwelling Christ and to live in the resurrection life so that he may be conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death (Phil. 3:10).</p>
<p>The anointing and the environment are two different dealings and two kinds of leading, but they have the same result. The inner operation of the Holy Spirit is for us to experience resurrection life and be conformed to the Lord&rsquo;s death. The discipline of the Holy Spirit in our environment is also for us to experience resurrection life and be conformed to the Lord&rsquo;s death. What we encounter in our environment coordinates with the anointing within us; our environment and the anointing have only one goal. Hence, when we obey the anointing, what we often encounter in our environment is not severe. If we closely follow the inner anointing, a coordinating discipline in our environment will not be necessary. Then instead of our environment being a matter of discipline, it will be an opportunity for the divine life to mature in us. In many cases the coordination of discipline from our environment is an indication that we have not followed the inner sense of life. God often arranges an outward environment for us when we do not diligently follow the operation of the Spirit through the inner anointing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing to Love the Lord</h2>
<p>We can examine our condition by asking, &ldquo;What is the condition of our love for the Lord?&rdquo; Although our love for the Lord cannot be considered a spiritual experience, we must love the Lord in order to have spiritual experiences. No one can have an abundance of the divine life if his love toward the Lord is weak.</p>
<p>Several verses in Ephesians mention love, such as: &ldquo;holding to truth in love&rdquo; (4:15), &ldquo;the building up of itself in love&rdquo; (v. 16), and &ldquo;being rooted and grounded in love&rdquo; (3:17). Love is often more important than faith. The subject of Song of Songs concerns a believer&rsquo;s fellowship with the Lord. No other book in the Bible thoroughly describes the personal fellowship of a believer with the Lord or the growth that results from a believer&rsquo;s union with the Lord in fellowship as much as this book does. Song of Songs rarely mentions faith, but it shows that the condition for fellowship is love (1:2-4; 2:4-5; 3:1-4, 10; 4:10; 5:8; 6:2-3; 7:10-12; 8:6-7). We fellowship with the Lord in love, we are joined to the Lord in love, and we also grow in life in love.</p>
<p>The principle revealed in the Bible is that we receive the divine life by faith, and we grow in the divine life by love. A person who does not believe in the Lord cannot receive the divine life, nor can he grow in the divine life. In order to receive this life, one must receive the Lord, and in order to grow in life, one must also love the Lord. Hence, the Gospel of John says that man receives the divine life by faith&mdash;those who believe will have life (1:12); concerning growing in life, John says, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word&rdquo; (14:23). Here love is mentioned. The last chapter says even more concerning love. The Lord asked Peter, &ldquo;Do you love Me more than these?...Do you love Me?&rdquo; (21:15-17). The first chapter of John speaks of faith, but the last chapter speaks of love. Faith is the means for man to receive life, and love is the means for man to grow in life.</p>
<p>At issue here is whether we love the Lord. We should not think that to serve in the church is the same as to love the Lord. This is not necessarily true. While we are serving in the church, our heart toward the Lord is often cold, and there is often a problem with our love. Every section in Song of Songs is related to love, because every spiritual experience is in the context of love. In the original Hebrew language the words for <em>my beloved</em> (1:13, 16; 2:3, 8-10) and <em>my love</em> (1:9; 2:2, 10) indicate love. The word translated as &ldquo;my beloved&rdquo; is masculine, and the word translated as &ldquo;my love&rdquo; is feminine. Solomon addresses the seeker as &ldquo;My love,&rdquo; and the seeker addresses him also as &ldquo;my love.&rdquo; This shows that spiritual progress is a union in love and fellowship.</p>
<p>Love cannot be stirred up. It would be of little avail for me to call a brother every day from morning until evening, saying, &ldquo;Brother, you should love the Lord! Love the Lord!&rdquo; I cannot cause him to have an ounce of love. I can give messages on loving the Lord and even exhaust my vocabulary, but I cannot make him love the Lord. The Bible does not show us how to love the Lord. In the Epistles Paul says, &ldquo;The love of Christ constrains us&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:14), but he does not say how to stir up a person&rsquo;s love for the Lord.</p>
<p>People love things or persons without reason. For example, if you go to a jewelry store and see an item, you may fall in love with it as soon as you see it. You may be able to describe the beauty of the item, but you cannot explain why you fell in love with it at first sight. The beginning of Song of Songs speaks of this: &ldquo;Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! / For your love is better than wine... / Your name is like ointment poured forth&rdquo; (1:2-3). Some people say that if we see the Lord, we will love Him. However, many people saw the Lord when He was on earth, but not all of them loved Him. For example, both Martha and Mary saw the Lord, but their love for Him varied in strength. Genuine love has the element of &ldquo;love at first sight&rdquo;; that is, a person falls in love the first time he sees an object. Not even death can stop such love. Genuine love for the Lord is without reason.</p>
<p>Those who believe in the Lord do so without reason. No one believes in the Lord because he has weighed all the reasons. If there is such a person, he is not yet saved. Those who believe and are saved do so without reason; they believed even though it did not make sense. If a person believes only after everything makes sense, there is a problem with his faith. This is a mystery. Hence, when we preach the gospel, we should not try to reason with others, because reasoning helps people to understand but not to believe. We need only to say that the Lord Jesus is man&rsquo;s Savior and that He was incarnated, lived on the earth, died, and resurrected. When some people hear this, they believe even though they do not understand everything that they have heard. They do not know who the Lord Jesus is, but they nevertheless believe in Him. This kind of faith is right.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus lived on the earth, not every disciple who followed Him knew who He was. They were not clearer than we are and may even have been more confused. When Peter followed the Lord Jesus, he had no idea where the Lord came from (Matt. 4:18-20), but he saw that Jesus was wonderful (Luke 5:8-9). Peter could not comprehend the work of the Holy Spirit; he simply felt that the Lord Jesus was wonderful. He admired the Lord Jesus so much that he believed in Him.</p>
<p>Faith is inexplicable, and love is also inexplicable. This is the story of Song of Songs. For this reason, Song of Songs begins by saying, &ldquo;Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!&rdquo; (1:2). Some people are like this; they cannot help but love the Lord, and they do not know the source of their love. Martha and Mary were two sisters who lived in the same home, had the same opportunities, and were in the same environment, but they had two different kinds of love toward the Lord Jesus. What was the source of this difference in their love? Did the Lord Jesus do something for Mary that He did not do for Martha? We cannot find such a distinction in the Bible. The Lord treated them the same, but one was more earnest in her love for Him than the other.</p>
<p>We must ask ourselves whether we love the Lord. I cannot tell you how to love the Lord, but I must ask whether you love Him. Love is the unique condition for us to experience the Lord&rsquo;s life. There is no other condition; we must love the Lord. Some may say that in order to experience the Lord&rsquo;s life, we must have spiritual understanding and receive revelation. Spiritual understanding and revelation are based on love. Song of Songs speaks solely concerning the growth and maturity of our spiritual life. This book begins with love, continues with love, and ends with love. Hence, Ephesians speaks of &ldquo;being rooted and grounded in love,&rdquo; of &ldquo;holding to truth in love,&rdquo; and of the Body &ldquo;building up...itself in love&rdquo; (3:17; 4:15-16). Without love it is useless to speak of growth in life. Growth in life is not a matter of knowledge but of love. It is possible to understand messages, to read spiritual books, and to study the Bible thoroughly and still not grow in the divine life. Growth in life depends on our love for the Lord.</p>
<p>According to Song of Songs, even if we have only a little love for the Lord, we should seek Him on the basis of this love. Verse 2 of chapter 1 says, &ldquo;Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!&rdquo; The more we contact the Lord, the more we will feel that He is lovely. We cannot find a verse in the Bible that tells us how to love the Lord, but the record in the Bible shows that our love for the Lord grows by our seeking Him with what little love that we have. The more we seek Him, the more we will contact Him in fellowship; and the more we fellowship with Him, the more we will feel that He is lovely. Every believer has some love for the Lord, but the question is how to cause our love to increase. If we seek the Lord a little more, admire Him a little more, and fellowship with Him a little more, our love for Him will grow spontaneously.</p>
<p>Song of Songs describes a progressing life and a developing love, both of which grow so strong that it is difficult to determine whether the love in chapter 8 represents the Lord&rsquo;s love or the love of His seeker. Some say that it is the love of the Shulammite for her beloved, but others say it is the love of the beloved for the Shulammite. It is rather difficult to determine who is speaking in chapter 8. As far as the beloved is concerned, his love is stronger than death, but as far as the Shulammite is concerned, she has grown and is rooted and grounded in the love of her beloved. Hence, verses 6 and 7 simply say &ldquo;love,&rdquo; not &ldquo;your love&rdquo; or &ldquo;my love.&rdquo; This love is as strong as death, and floods cannot drown it. At this point, the seeker&rsquo;s union with the Lord in fellowship has reached its peak.</p>
<p>Although we do not have much love for the Lord, if we spend a little more time to long for Him, to seek Him, to consider Him, to fellowship with Him, and to contact Him, our love for Him will increase. The more we seek Him and fellowship with Him, the more we will love Him.</p><h2 class="head2">Living in the Anointing</h2>
<p>We can also examine our condition by asking, &ldquo;Are we learning to live in the anointing every day; have we surrendered to the inner anointing?&rdquo; This is not a matter of listening to messages. If we love the Lord, we will give ourselves over to the inner anointing and live in the anointing all day long. This is the way to have genuine growth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Learning Lessons through Our Circumstances</h2>
<p>Finally, we can examine our condition by asking, &ldquo;Are we learning spiritual lessons through the circumstances in our daily living?&rdquo; We must learn lessons from the circumstances that we encounter in our environment. This is the way to have genuine growth in life. I hope that we would answer these three questions before God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Heart<br />
Not Being the Same as Having Love</h2>
<p><em>Question: Is having a heart for the Lord equivalent to loving Him?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Having a heart is not equivalent to having love. We often say, &ldquo;So-and-so still has a heart for the Lord.&rdquo; This is not clear. Let me ask, &ldquo;Do you have the heart to eat every day?&rdquo; This is a strange question, because if we needed to have a heart in order to eat, we would starve to death. We eat whether or not we have the heart to eat. Suppose I ask, &ldquo;Is So-and-so attending a university?&rdquo; You should tell me whether or not he is attending a university. There is no need to say that he has the heart to attend a university. If he has the heart to attend a university, he should be at a university. Or I may ask, &ldquo;Are those two people engaged?&rdquo; If you reply, &ldquo;They have the heart to be engaged,&rdquo; then I would ask, &ldquo;Why are they not engaged if they have the heart to be engaged?&rdquo; Likewise, with regard to a person&rsquo;s condition before the Lord, when we are reluctant to say whether or not a person loves the Lord, we speak of him as having a heart for the Lord. This indicates that having the heart is not equivalent to having love.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Acknowledging and Confessing</h2>
<p><em>Question: In the past I sensed the presence of my flesh and the mixture within me, and I often confessed my sins, asking the Lord to deliver me. Later I heard that we are already dead and do not need to confess our sins. Is this correct?</em></p>
<p>Answer: To confess our sins is to deal with the sins that we have committed. If a sin has been committed, it needs to be confessed. If we have not committed a sin, yet we see our corruption, then we need acknowledgment, not confession. If in the light we see that our corrupted flesh has already been nailed to the cross, we need only to praise the Lord. In contrast, if we commit a definite sin, it is not sufficient merely to say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord.&rdquo; We must confess our sin before God and before man; we must confess the actual sins that we have committed. However, regarding our corrupt nature, we need only to acknowledge it and receive the work of the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living, Not Leading,<br />
Being the Emphasis of the Anointing</h2>
<p><em>Question: When we have doubts about whether something is of the Lord, should we stop or continue?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The things that are necessary in our daily living should be taken care of according to common sense; as long as we lack a sense of prohibition, we may do them. We need the inner leading for special matters. However, the teaching of the anointing does not emphasize leading. Many people incorrectly understand the teaching of the anointing merely as leading. The anointing is not merely a matter of whether or not we should do a certain thing; rather, it is for us to live in the anointing and to do everything according to the anointing.</p>
<p>As soon as the anointing is mentioned, people understand it as leading. This is the influence of Christianity. For example, if I want to write a letter, I ask the anointing to teach me whether or not I should write the letter. This is an erroneous concept. The anointing is not a fortuneteller, who previously had nothing to do with us but now tells us whether what we are about to do is good or bad. The proper situation is to live in the anointing so that the anointing becomes our life, just like the feelings of our body. For example, when we taste sugar, we immediately sense sweetness, and when we taste vinegar, we sense sourness. We do not need to ask the anointing to be our fortuneteller and tell us whether what we are about to do is right or wrong. We must live in the anointing so that when we &ldquo;taste something,&rdquo; we will immediately sense whether it is sweet or sour.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing to Exercise</h2>
<p><em>Question: What should we do in order to live in the anointing practically?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We need to exercise. For example, we may say that we want to consecrate ourselves to the Lord because we love Him. However, to say that we want to consecrate ourselves to the Lord is vague; we need to know where the Lord is. The expression <em>give ourselves to the Lord</em> is doctrine. In our experience, it means to give ourselves to the inner anointing and to the discipline in our environment. How should I respond when a brother gives me a long face? Can I give thanks and praise the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, this long face is from You. I give myself to You&rdquo;?</p>
<p>In terms of experience, to love the Lord and to give ourselves to Him mean to submit to the inner anointing and to our outward circumstances. We live in the anointing, and we also accept our circumstances. We know the Lord in the anointing, and we also know Him in our circumstances. Then in our experience the Lord will lead us to know when we are in the self, when we are natural, and when we are living in the old creation. He will lead us to know the meaning of resurrection and the cross. Furthermore, He will lead us to know the power of resurrection and to be conformed to His death (Phil. 3:10). When we do not care for the inner anointing, the discipline of the Holy Spirit may become necessary. The circumstances in our environment are coordinated with the anointing in order to break us and to expose us so that we know how much we are still in the self. If we desire to grow in life, this must be a daily exercise.</p><h2 class="head2">Giving Ourselves to the Lord</h2>
<p><em>Question: If we want to live in the anointing and be subject to the discipline of the Holy Spirit, does our will need to cooperate?</em></p>
<p>Answer: There is no need to analyze whether or not our will is cooperating. We should simply surrender to the anointing. We can say that this is the cooperation of the will. We need to give ourselves to the Lord. We need to learn to be genuine and to give ourselves to the Lord because we love Him. We give ourselves practically according to the anointing and our environment. Hence, we must learn to receive the teaching of the anointing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Discerning the Intention<br />
of the Teaching of the Anointing</h2>
<p><em>Question: How can we discern the teaching of the anointing?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The teaching of the anointing is manifest in our daily living, letting us know whether we are in ourselves or in Christ. The anointing Spirit does not teach us whether or not we should do something. Rather, He asks, &ldquo;Is this Christ, or is it you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do not think that the teaching of the anointing is to lead us concerning what to do and what not to do. The teaching of the anointing lets us know whether or not we are in Christ. As human beings, we are concerned with whether or not we should do a certain thing and whether or not we are doing it correctly. The leading of the Holy Spirit is for us to be delivered from the self so that we live in Christ. Hence, the teaching of the Holy Spirit asks, &ldquo;Is this Christ, or is it you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For example, when I am about to lose my temper, I might ask, &ldquo;Lord, do You want me to lose my temper?&rdquo; The real question, however, should be, &ldquo;Am I losing my temper, or is Christ losing His temper?&rdquo; As long as it is Christ who is losing His temper, the inner anointing will say, &ldquo;It is right to lose your temper.&rdquo; If I am the one who wants to lose my temper, the anointing will say, &ldquo;No, it is not okay.&rdquo; Similarly, when we are not sure whether our love for a person corresponds to the Lord&rsquo;s will, we often ask, &ldquo;Lord, is it right to love this brother?&rdquo; In contrast, the teaching of the anointing will ask whether or not Christ is loving the brother. If we say that it is Christ, the Holy Spirit will say Amen. But if we answer that we are the one loving him, the Holy Spirit will say, &ldquo;It is not okay.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living in the Anointing</h2>
<p><em>Question: What should I do if it is difficult for me to discern whether or not it is Christ who is doing something?</em></p>
<p>Answer: First John 2:27 does not say that when we have a need, we should ask the anointing to make us clear. The anointing Spirit is for our living and our life; we should live in the anointing. However, instead of giving ourselves to Him, we often check with Him only when we have a need. We have received mercy to love the Lord and give ourselves to Him; hence, we should give ourselves to the anointing inwardly and learn to live in Him. Instead of asking whether or not we should do something, we should exercise to live in Christ, not in ourselves. If we would practice this, spontaneously the anointing will show us whether or not Christ is living. This requires practice. It is ineffective to seek the leading of the anointing only when we have a need.</p>
<p>Believers often wait until they encounter a situation before they seek the Lord&rsquo;s will. The Lord reveals His will to those who give themselves to the anointing and live in the anointing. He does not reveal His will to those who do not give themselves to the anointing. The apostles did not make an effort to know the Lord&rsquo;s will. They gave themselves to the anointing and lived in the anointing; thus, they could know God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Anointing and the Discipline<br />
of the Holy Spirit Putting Us to Death<br />
So That Christ May Be Our Life</h2>
<p><em>Question: When I learn a lesson from my environment, should I confess to God, or should I thank Him?</em></p>
<p>Answer: On the one hand, we should confess the sin of disobedience, and on the other hand, we should thank the Lord for showing us that we are wrong. However, such an experience is not precious, nor is it a genuine lesson. According to our concept, the teaching of the anointing is for us to know what is right and what is wrong, but the Lord does not lead us to know what is right and what is wrong. The teaching of the anointing shows us whether something is of the self or of Christ.</p>
<p>The Bible does not teach us concerning right and wrong. The concept of right and wrong is related to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The teaching of the Bible is centered on whether the self is living or Christ is living. This is the goal. However, it is difficult for us to drop our concept of right or wrong; thus, we expect the Holy Spirit to teach us what is right and what is wrong. This is not the work of the Holy Spirit. The work of the Holy Spirit is to teach us what is of ourselves and what is of Christ. As long as we are focused on what is right and wrong, we can only say that what is out of ourselves is wrong and what is out of Christ is right. However, when we focus on the leading, we will say that the Holy Spirit is leading us to live by Christ, not by the self.</p>
<p>May God have mercy on us so that our eyes would be opened to see that He does not want us to do &ldquo;right things&rdquo; but to live Christ. When we see this, we will ask, &ldquo;Am I living out myself, or is Christ being lived out?&rdquo; As long as Christ is being lived out, it will be right to love, and it will be right to hate; nothing will be wrong. But when Christ is not being lived out, both loving and hating are wrong.</p>
<p>The situations in our environment are for our breaking so that we may experience the resurrection life of Christ. The discipline in our environment does not teach us to discern right from wrong. When our concept is changed, we will know what it is to be led by the Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s leading is not for us to know what is right and what is wrong but for us to see what is according to the self and what is according to Christ.</p>
<p>For example, suppose a brother who has the gift of preaching the gospel is invited by a locality to preach the gospel. Because it is his habit, the brother may kneel down and pray, &ldquo;Lord, please tell me whether You want me to go and preach the gospel.&rdquo; However, we cannot find many examples of such a prayer in the Bible. This kind of prayer is not very spiritual. If this brother has the experience of living in the anointing and has learned the lesson, he would say, &ldquo;Lord, let me know whether going to this place is of me or of You. Am I the one who wants to preach the gospel, or is it You?&rdquo; If he receives the teaching of the anointing to see that Christ is asking him to go, then he should go. But if the anointing shows him that his desire to go is from himself, he should not go. There is a great difference between the two prayers. Almost every believer seeks the Lord&rsquo;s will according to the first prayer, not according to the second. Those who have the experience of living in the anointing will not ask the Lord, &ldquo;Do You want me to do this?&rdquo; Rather, they would ask, &ldquo;Is this matter of me, or is it of You?&rdquo; This is what the Holy Spirit is teaching us. The extent to which we give ourselves to the anointing determines our growth in life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a person who knows the Lord will not only accept every circumstance in his environment; he will also ask what lesson he has learned. To learn to be patient is Buddhism, and to learn to endure sufferings is Hinduism. We must be able to say that our environment has caused us to know the flesh, that we have received the breaking of the cross, and that we have experienced Christ abiding in us. These are genuine lessons, and this is the genuine Christian living. We must know the self through the revelation gained from our environment. At the same time, we must receive the arrangement of the Holy Spirit in our environment to put the self to death by the cross. Through such experiences we will know that Christ is real in us; we will have genuine fellowship with Him and know Him more. This is the way to have genuine growth in life.</p>
<p>We must learn to surrender to the anointing within us and to the discipline of the Holy Spirit in our environment. The goal of these lessons is for us to be delivered from the self and to live Christ. This is the way to grow in life.</p><h2 class="head2">Needing to Accept God&rsquo;s Concept</h2>
<p><em>Question: In the past whenever I suffered or was sick, I would ask the Lord whether I had offended Him or what lesson did He want me to learn. When I received the anointing, it was easy for me to obey and to deal with the mistake. Can this be regarded as living in the anointing?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Although this can be regarded as living in the anointing, I do not wish to answer this question from this angle. I would rather say that our concept of the anointing is different from God&rsquo;s concept. We think that the function of the anointing is to teach us what is right and what is wrong. However, according to God&rsquo;s concept, the anointing is to show us what is of Christ and what is of ourselves. We pay attention to doing things, but the Holy Spirit pays attention to the life that is operating. We ask, &ldquo;What should we do?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How should we do this?&rdquo; The Holy Spirit asks, &ldquo;Who is doing this?&rdquo; There is a big difference between God&rsquo;s concept and ours.</p>
<p>This question is still concerning right and wrong. You check with God whether you have done something wrong when you suffer or get sick, and you are willing to deal with your mistake if you are enlightened. This concept is still related to right or wrong. You do not have the concept of discerning whether it is Christ or yourself.</p>
<p>It is difficult to find a verse in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles that says, &ldquo;You should not do anything wrong,&rdquo; or &ldquo;You must do the right thing.&rdquo; However, numerous portions in the New Testament show that Christ lives in us. In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; In Philippians 1:20 he says, &ldquo;As always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.&rdquo; In Romans 8:11 he says, &ldquo;If the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&rdquo; This teaching is prevalent in the New Testament, but we do not pay attention to it. The New Testament does not say, &ldquo;You should follow the Holy Spirit to do the right thing and not the wrong thing.&rdquo; However, after we read the Bible, we always ask, &ldquo;Is it right for me to do this? Is it wrong for me to do that?&rdquo; The fellowship in this chapter is clear, but your question is, &ldquo;When I get sick, I pray and God enlightens me as to what I did wrong, so I deal with it. Is this living in the anointing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man has not been able to leave the things related to that tree. We even view messages that we hear concerning the Holy Spirit according to right and wrong. Ninety percent of the teaching of the apostles concerns the Holy Spirit. When we read these portions, we cannot find a place where the Holy Spirit is teaching us what is right and what is wrong, nor is He teaching us to do the right thing rather than the wrong thing. On the contrary, the Bible says, &ldquo;If by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live&rdquo; (Rom. 8:13), and &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). This is the teaching of the apostles.</p>
<p>God does not intend to correct our mistakes, and being right does not increase our standing before the Lord. Instead of correcting our mistakes, the Lord puts us on the cross. Christ is revealed in us through the Spirit so that Christ can grow, live, and be formed in us (1:16; 2:20; 4:19). The Lord also uses the cross to do a killing work in us through the Spirit. This is the teaching of the anointing, the work of the anointing. The teaching of the anointing is not for correcting our mistakes. The anointing is to bring us into the death of the cross so that Christ may have all the ground in us.</p>
<p>In terms of being a human being, it is right to correct our mistakes and wrongdoings, just as parents correct their children. However, as far as being a Christian is concerned, correcting a mistake does not have much value. Being a Christian is a matter of changing our person. In educating our children, it is right to correct their mistakes, but in leading the saints in the churches, we should help change their person. The teaching of the anointing Spirit differs from the teaching that parents give their children at home. We should not think that we are good Christians because we have good conduct. Many saints with good conduct do not understand spiritual matters. They are spiritual novices. The church has only Christ. The Holy Spirit and the cross must put us to death and add Christ to us. This is the purpose of the anointing.</p>
<p>We need revelation. We should not think that we understand the anointing. Tomorrow some saints might still pray, &ldquo;O Lord, please tell me what is right and what is wrong. Tell me what I should do and what I should not do.&rdquo; Such prayers prove that we do not have light. When we are enlightened, we will no longer ask whether a certain thing is right or wrong. Instead, we will ask, &ldquo;Is it Christ or myself who is living?&rdquo; We will hate and detest the self that does wrong and also the self that does right.</p>
<p>We pay attention to things, but the Holy Spirit pays attention to our person. We pay attention to right and wrong, but the Holy Spirit pays attention to Christ. Of course, sometimes the Spirit will correct our mistakes. However, He corrects us with the purpose of changing our person. For example, suppose a sister has a bad temper when dealing with her husband. She may seek the Lord, hoping that He will take away her temper. The Holy Spirit may also show her that her temper is not good. However, the Holy Spirit does not intend to change her temper but to change her person. If her person is not changed, her temper will remain. To soften her temper without changing her person is the practice of Hinduism, Buddhism, or Confucianism. The Holy Spirit does not want to correct our mistakes; He wants to change our person. In the initial stage of being a Christian, we are inevitably concerned about matters of right or wrong. However, gradually the Spirit will open our eyes so that instead of asking whether a matter is right or wrong, we would ask, &ldquo;Lord, are You doing this, or am I?&rdquo; Concerning our temper and our meekness, we would ask, &ldquo;Lord, is this You, or is it me?&rdquo; We must learn to say, &ldquo;If it is of me, I will not do it. If it is the Lord, I will do it.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">The Discipline of the Holy Spirit<br />
Not Being to Subdue Us but to Break Us</h2>
<p><em>Question: I am a talkative person. When the Holy Spirit does not allow me to talk, I submit. Can this be regarded as accepting the discipline of the Holy Spirit?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The discipline of the Holy Spirit that we are speaking of does not refer to the Holy Spirit restricting us within but to the circumstances that we encounter in our environment. It is not that the Holy Spirit restricts you from within, prohibiting you from talking. Rather, He will arrange an environment in which you will be in trouble because you talk too much. Without the enlightening of the Holy Spirit, we cannot understand a message, even if we exercise our mind. The basic purpose of the discipline of the Holy Spirit is to break us; it is not a matter of our being in subjection. For example, the Lord arranges for a brother to have a difficult wife. This is the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Because of his personality, temperament, and disposition, this brother needs this kind of wife in order to deal with him every day. If this brother thinks that he understands a message concerning the discipline of the Holy Spirit, he may bow his head in subjection and say, &ldquo;I am willing to be subject to the discipline of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This kind of subjection is wrong. God gave this brother a precious wife so that he would be broken, not for him to be submissive.</p>
<p>I know a brother who has &ldquo;subjected&rdquo; himself to the discipline of the Holy Spirit, but his self has only become stronger. He said that when he first got married, his wife was good, but she gradually became worse. The more he tried to reason with her, the more unreasonable she became. Eventually, he said, &ldquo;Now I understand that this is the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, I am willing to submit. I will no longer argue with her. God has ordained this.&rdquo; At the beginning of his marriage he could be likened to an unfurled steel sheet. When he began to &ldquo;submit,&rdquo; he rolled himself up like an iron ball. Instead of fighting with his wife, he prayed, &ldquo;O God, vindicate me at the judgment seat.&rdquo; His self became stronger because of his wrong understanding concerning the discipline of the Holy Spirit. It was possible for him to receive the breaking when he was not willing to submit; however, he cannot receive the breaking when he merely submits.</p>
<p>The discipline of the Holy Spirit is not for man to be subdued but to be broken. The discipline of the Holy Spirit is not to ask us to be silent but to break our talkative nature. This question shows that we receive the discipline of the Holy Spirit according to our natural man, not according to the intention of the Holy Spirit. The understanding that the discipline of the Holy Spirit is to subdue us is in the principle of correcting our mistakes. Formerly, you liked to talk, and you argued with your spouse. Later, you decided to submit and would stop arguing. This is a correction. Similar to the teaching of the anointing, the purpose of the discipline of the Holy Spirit is to change our person. The Holy Spirit disciplines us in order to break our talkative nature.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing to See the Light</h2>
<p><em>Question: Will a person who receives the teaching of the anointing and the discipline of the Holy Spirit still make mistakes?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This question shows that we still have not been delivered from our concept of right and wrong. Let me say again: God does not care about right or wrong, nor does He care about sinning or not sinning. He cares about Christ. Even if we did not commit any sins, we would not be valuable. If we could live to be ninety years old without sinning, God would still not want us. If an ordinary stone did not have any dirt on it, I would not consider it to be a treasure. A stone cannot become a pearl. Our heart is filled with the thought of sinning or not sinning. We think that we are precious and spiritual if we do not sin. This is a human concept. God&rsquo;s concept is not related to sin but to whether we are men of clay or men of gold who contain the element of Christ.</p>
<p>These questions concerning being right or wrong are from the mind; they lack light. We cannot do anything if the Holy Spirit does not enlighten us. God&rsquo;s goal is to deliver us from the self so that we can live Christ. We must be delivered from the concept of good or evil and right or wrong in order to see that the goal of the Holy Spirit is to use all kinds of environments to put us to death so that Christ can be lived out from us. This is the goal of the work of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit wants to put us to death. This is what we must see and consider. It is best for us to say, &ldquo;Lord, I thank and praise You because You are the anointing. I know only Christ and Him crucified; I know only the killing work of the cross. I do not care about being right or wrong, or about sinning or not sinning.&rdquo; Then we can receive salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Analyzing the Circumstances<br />
in Our Environment</h2>
<p><em>Question: Because some circumstances are from Satan and others are natural, I am afraid that I would confuse his attack with the discipline of the Holy Spirit and that my suffering will be in vain. What can prevent me from receiving my circumstances foolishly?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This kind of analysis is unnecessary. When we ate breakfast this morning, we did not consider whether the food came naturally or was sent by Satan, or whether it was prepared by God or by the self. Do we consider how we came here? Were we sent naturally, or were we sent by the devil? Does God want us to be here, or were we brought by the self? Why were we born as Chinese and not as Americans? The more spiritual a person is, the less he will consider such things, because these things are not in our hands. Some people have attempted to commit suicide five times, and they are still alive. There are others who took every precaution against tuberculosis but still contracted it. We need to see that we are in the Lord&rsquo;s hand, not in our own. Everything that comes upon us has an element of the discipline of the Holy Spirit, and we should accept it. Without our heavenly Father&rsquo;s permission, nothing will come upon us; it does not matter whether it is a natural law, our own doing, Satan&rsquo;s attack, or the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>It is rare for a suffering situation not to be from Satan. Job&rsquo;s afflictions came from Satan. All the suffering situations are caused by Satan. We might say, &ldquo;I do not accept anything from Satan; I only want things from God,&rdquo; but we should realize that Satan&rsquo;s attacks are permitted by God. One day God had a council in heaven to discuss how to deal with Job, and Satan came too (Job 1:6-7). God said to Satan, &ldquo;Have you considered My servant Job? For there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil&rdquo; (v. 8). Satan answered, &ldquo;Does Job fear God without cause? Have You not set a hedge around him and his household and all that he has?...Stretch forth Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face&rdquo; (vv. 9-11). God replied, &ldquo;Here is all that he has, in your hand; only do not stretch forth your hand against him&rdquo; (v. 12). God let Satan attack Job. This was the stripping that God wanted for Job.</p>
<p>We should not try to avoid our environment. Some people try to avoid the natural man and the self, but eventually they are the ones who suffer the most. Because we are in God&rsquo;s hand, we will suffer if we try to rely upon our own intelligence and wisdom. If we try to dodge different situations, we will end up in a place where we will really suffer. Hence, we must give up and admit that we are in the Father&rsquo;s hand and that there are no mistakes associated with the discipline of the Holy Spirit. We make mistakes, but He never does.</p>
<p>We must remember that the discipline of the Holy Spirit is not to correct our wrongdoings or to subdue us. The book of Job concerns discipline. Initially, Job could not submit, much less be broken, but in the end he abhorred himself and repented in dust and ashes (42:6). Without the attacks from Satan, Job would have been a good man but not a broken man. He was a perfect man as well as a whole person. God does not want us to be perfect and whole. Hence, He raises up situations in our environment to discipline us. The Holy Spirit did not want Job to submit. The discipline of the Holy Spirit had the unique goal of breaking him. The purpose of the breaking was for Job to know God. Hence, Job was able to say, &ldquo;I had heard of You by the hearing of the ear, / But now my eye has seen You&rdquo; (v. 5).</p>
<p>We do not need to analyze whether the discipline of the Holy Spirit has a natural source, is of our own doing, is sent by the devil, or is permitted by God. We may be able to avoid some difficult situations, but we cannot avoid every situation. There is no need to analyze the situations that we cannot avoid. We can fire a maid who does not listen to our instructions, but we cannot dismiss our precious wife when she is unbearable. This is the discipline of the Holy Spirit. If an employee does not listen to us, we can fire him according to the terms of his contract. However, if a brother with whom we labor causes us hardships, we cannot avoid him. We must coordinate with him and receive what the Holy Spirit has arranged. We can avoid only the difficulties that God allows us to avoid. We must believe that we are in His hand.</p>
<p>Let me repeat: The more spiritual a person is, the more he believes that he is in God&rsquo;s hand, and the less he fears adverse environments or circumstances. Those who try to run away from discipline are not spiritual and are not willing to receive discipline. We do not need to analyze the circumstances in our environment.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>

<p>In Luke 24:13-35 the Lord Jesus appeared to two disciples after His resurrection. Verses 25 through 32 are a record of part of the conversation that the Lord had with the two disciples. The Lord Jesus &ldquo;said to them, O foolish and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into His glory? And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, He explained to them clearly in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself. And they drew near to the village where they were going, and He acted as though He would go farther. And they constrained Him, saying, Stay with us, because it is near evening and the day is already gone by. And He went in to stay with them. And as He reclined at table with them, He took the loaf and blessed it, and having broken it, He began handing it to them. And their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him; and He disappeared from them. And they said to one another, Was not our heart burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was opening to us the Scriptures?&rdquo; The disciples did not recognize the Lord until their eyes were opened when He broke the bread. Later the Lord spoke with all the disciples. He &ldquo;said to them, These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all the things written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me must be fulfilled. Then He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures; and He said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise up from the dead on the third day&rdquo; (vv. 44-46). At this time the mind of the disciples was opened to understand the Scriptures.</p>
<p>We will consider how our mind can be opened to grasp crucial spiritual matters related to life. Many saints do not know crucial spiritual matters, because their mind has not been opened. Although we have listened to messages for many years and have learned something concerning life, we have not entered into the experience of life. It seems as though we have not entered into the reality of the messages. It is doubtful whether many of us experience the divine life.</p>
<p>Some saints have spiritual experiences, but their experiences are fragmentary. For example, people who have not received formal education learn in fragments; they learn one word one day, another word another day, and another word after three or five days. This illustrates the spiritual experience of some saints. In order to receive a proper education, a person must attend school and progress step by step, beginning with elementary school. Similarly, spiritual lessons have a proper progression, but not many of us have progressed. Most saints love the Lord, but their knowledge and experience of spiritual matters are fragmentary. Few saints have crossed the threshold to properly learn spiritual lessons daily.</p>
<p>Certain events can be described as epoch-making. In our Christian life we need to have an &ldquo;epoch-making&rdquo; experience, a turning point. Before such an experience, we lived haphazardly in the Lord, but after such an experience, our life in the Lord will become regular, and we will learn spiritual lessons daily. We may have been zealous and loved the Lord in the past, but our spiritual experiences were fragmentary. Now we can be compared to those who are enrolled in school and are receiving a formal education. We need a turning point in our knowledge of spiritual things and in our experience of the Lord.</p>
<p>When my family first arrived in Taiwan, my youngest child did not understand what we were doing. When we got on the boat, she got on the boat. When we took a pedicab, she took a pedicab, but she did not understand anything. Now, however, she is very clear. She knows that she was born in Shanghai and that she resides in Taiwan. Formerly, she was in the dark, but now she is clear. How many among us can say, &ldquo;Lord, I praise You that I have crossed a threshold in my experience. I am now learning to live in You and to know You daily, not haphazardly but systematically.&rdquo; Such a turning point does not happen by exhortation or encouragement from others; rather, it requires our spiritual mind to be opened.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DISCIPLES FOLLOWING THE LORD ZEALOUSLY,<br />
BUT THEIR MIND NOT BEING OPENED</h2>
<p>According to the record in Luke 24, the Lord appeared to the disciples in order to open their spiritual mind. Although the disciples followed the Lord Jesus before His resurrection, their spiritual mind was not opened. They were with the Lord daily; they lived with Him and went to different places with Him. We can say that they lived and walked together with the Lord. They also believed in the Lord and wanted the Lord, but their spiritual mind was not opened. The situation of many saints today is similar to that of the early disciples. Peter gave up being a fisherman in order to follow the Lord Jesus. It would be unfair to say that he was not saved or that he did not love the Lord. Nevertheless, his spiritual mind was not opened.</p>
<p>In chapter 24 when the Lord and the two disciples drew near to Emmaus, the two disciples constrained Him to stay with them. As the Lord reclined at table with them, He took the loaf, blessed it, broke it, and handed it to them. Then &ldquo;their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him; and He disappeared from them. And they said to one another, Was not our heart burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was opening to us the Scriptures?&rdquo; (vv. 31-32). The disciples&rsquo; words indicate that while the Lord was opening the Scriptures to them, their heart was burning within them, but their eyes were not opened. Hence, our heart being burning is one thing, but having our eyes enlightened is another thing.</p>
<p>Chapter 24 speaks of two openings. The first opening enabled the disciples to recognize Christ (v. 31), and the second opening enabled them to understand the Bible (v. 45). These two openings are actually one, because the Bible is a portrait of Christ. When our mind is opened to know the Bible, our eyes will be opened to know Christ. In verse 27 the Lord Jesus helped the disciples by explaining to them &ldquo;clearly in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.&rdquo; The Bible and Christ are one; the Bible is a record of Christ, and Christ is the living Word. Before the spiritual mind of the disciples was opened, their eyes did not recognize Christ, nor did they know the Scriptures. When their spiritual mind was opened, they had a turning point.</p><h2 class="head1">AN UNOPENED MIND BEING THE RESULT<br />
OF SEEKING THINGS OTHER THAN THE LORD</h2>
<p>When the Lord was ministering on the earth, the minds of the disciples who were with Him were not opened. Some people may think that the minds of the disciples were not opened because the Holy Spirit had not yet been given. The disciples received the Holy Spirit on the evening of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection (John 20:22), but their minds were not opened immediately. They saw the Lord outwardly, but they did not see Him inwardly. Luke 24:45 indicates that He opened the minds of the disciples to understand the Scriptures when He stood in their midst on the evening of His resurrection. Why did the Lord wait until after His resurrection, not before, to open their minds? The Lord could not open their minds before His resurrection, because their hearts were zealous in a natural way. Moreover, they were veiled because of their impure intentions.</p>
<p>Various situations in the four Gospels indicate that while the disciples were following the Lord, the Lord was not their aim. For example, on the way to Jerusalem the Lord Jesus told the disciples that He was about to be crucified and that on the third day He would be raised (Matt. 20:18-19). After He finished speaking, the mother of the two sons of Zebedee said to Him, &ldquo;Say that these two sons of mine will sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your kingdom&rdquo; (v. 21; Mark 10:37). Not only so, the disciples argued with one another concerning who was greater (9:33-34; Luke 22:24). This shows that although they followed the Lord, they pursued things other than the Lord and desired to gain something for themselves.</p>
<p>After the Lord resurrected, the disciples who had followed Him did not gain anything earthly. They did not have earthly enjoyment or blessings, nor did they receive the things they requested. In the Gospels the disciples had sought to gain something for themselves when they followed the Lord. In Acts, however, the disciples followed the Lord not for their own gain but for the Lord Himself. The turning point was in Luke 24. The first thing the Lord Jesus did when He appeared to the two disciples was to unveil Himself to them. When the Lord expounded the Scriptures to them, He revealed Himself, the resurrected and ascended Christ, to them. His words showed them that they should pursue only Christ, who had passed through sufferings and entered into glory; they should no longer seek to gain something for themselves. Hence, when they sat down in the house, their eyes were opened (v. 31).</p>
<p>The record in the Bible is very meaningful. In Luke 24 the Lord Jesus did not bring any bread, but in John 21 He prepared bread for the disciples (vv. 12-13). In John it seems that the disciples felt hopeless when the Lord Jesus left after His resurrection. Because they were without faith, Peter took the lead to go fishing, and the other disciples followed (v. 3). This was the situation when the Lord appeared to them and asked, &ldquo;Little children, you do not have any fish to eat, do you?&rdquo; (v. 5). When the disciples got out of the boat and onto the land, &ldquo;they saw a fire of coals laid there, and fish lying on it and bread&rdquo; (v. 9). The Lord did this to show the disciples that He could support them without their relying on the sea. The disciples caught nothing the whole night (v. 3), but at the Lord&rsquo;s word, they cast their net and caught a hundred and fifty-three large fish (vv. 6, 11). The Lord did not use any of the hundred fifty-three fish; rather, He brought the bread and the fish (v. 13). The Lord wanted them to learn the lesson of living by faith instead of relying on the world. After the disciples ate and were satisfied, the Lord asked Peter, &ldquo;Do you love Me more than these?&rdquo; (v. 15). Here the Lord&rsquo;s intention was not to open their eyes but to touch their heart.</p>
<p>The situation in Luke 24 is different from the situation in John 21. In Luke the Lord did not bring bread to the disciples; the disciples prepared the bread. This situation is a great turning point and shows how a person&rsquo;s mind can be opened. Those who are content with receiving bread from the Lord cannot have their eyes opened. Only those who offer the bread in their hands to the Lord and let Him break it can have their eyes opened. If we are willing to put the things that we cling to and depend upon for our livelihood into the Lord&rsquo;s hand and let Him break them, our eyes will be opened.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, the eyes of the disciples were not opened, because they sought things other than the Lord. On the way to Emmaus the Lord showed the two disciples that those who follow Him should seek only Him. In order to follow the Lord, a person needs to hand himself over to the Lord unreservedly. In John 21 the Lord brought bread in order to touch the heart of the disciples, but in Luke 24 when the disciples committed their livelihood into the Lord&rsquo;s hand and let the Lord break it, their eyes were opened.</p>
<p>When we follow the Lord zealously, we often seek other things. We may be zealous and pursue the Lord, but our motives and intentions are questionable, for we often seek things other than the Lord. This will continue until the day that we receive mercy from the Lord to see that we are following Him for our own gain and benefit. Such a seeing will cause us to place our &ldquo;bread&rdquo; into His hand. Our situation is not like Peter&rsquo;s, who in John 21 received bread from the Lord&rsquo;s hand. Rather, our situation is like that of the disciples, who in Luke 24 handed bread to the Lord and let Him break it. This is the way for our eyes to be opened so that we may see the Lord and know Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HANDING OURSELVES TO THE LORD UNRESERVEDLY</h2>
<p>Many saints have not had their mind opened, because they are still seeking something for themselves. This situation will continue until by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy they see that He is the Lord, He is Christ, He is appointed by God, and He is also the goal in God&rsquo;s plan. When we pursue Him and are for Him one hundred percent, not wanting anything for ourselves, our consecration will be genuine. The bread placed in the Lord&rsquo;s hand represented the genuine consecration of the disciples. It was also the means for the disciples&rsquo; minds to be opened. We must be led by the Lord to see that God visits us and gives grace to us, not for ourselves but for Christ.</p>
<p>We often give thanks and praise because we have received a blessing from the Lord. This proves that we have not been delivered from our sphere, our preference, and our requests. A brother may drop his job and forsake the world in order to serve the Lord. However, it is possible for his service to the Lord to be for himself. Such a brother may have a personal seeking. We are the same as the disciples in the Gospels; they were full of mixture in their zeal for the Lord because they sought their personal gain and had their own goals. It was not until after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection that they pursued the Lord for Himself. The bread that the Lord broke signified their consecration, which was not for themselves; hence, their eyes could be opened. It was then that the disciples handed themselves over to the Lord and learned to follow the anointing and receive the discipline of the Holy Spirit in their environment. Otherwise, they might have remained in their former condition.</p>
<p>Before the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, the disciples lived in themselves; after His resurrection, they lived in the Lord and did not seek anything in the world or in the Lord for themselves. When the disciples did not seek worldly things or spiritual things for themselves, the Lord broke the bread they consecrated and caused their eyes to be opened. It was also at this point that He opened their minds and caused them to understand the Scriptures. Their minds could not be opened until this time.</p>
<p>It is possible for a person whose eyes are not opened to zealously and earnestly seek the Lord. Our basic problem is the self. The greatest problem in our pursuing of the Lord is our self-seeking. This serious, subjective, and hidden veil will prevent us from seeing light. When we receive mercy to see that everything God has is for Christ, not for ourselves, and that the blessings we receive are for Christ, we will surrender ourselves to Him, hand ourselves over to Him, and stop our self-seeking. Then our minds will be opened.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">KNOWING THE NATURAL MAN<br />
AND THE SELF</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 3:2-3; 4:6-7; Matt. 16:21-24</h1>
<p>In order to be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand and to function in the church, we need to see not only the things of God but also the things of man. In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the natural man and the self.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S WORK DEPENDING ON THE PERSON,<br />
NOT ON METHODS</h2>
<p>God never depends on methods to carry out His work; He depends on the person He uses. He does not need a good and effective method. Rather, His work can be accomplished effectively only when the person in His hand is right.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, God does not often tell His servants how to work; He seldom tells them what should be done first, second, and so forth. Rather, in relation to His servants, God focuses on the kind of person they are. He does not deal with the method used in the work but with the person who does the work. This is because in His eyes the method is a trivial matter, but the person who does the work is a crucial matter. God always deals with the person involved in the work. He deals with those who serve Him.</p>
<p>The method by which God works is the person in His hand. This is an important principle revealed in the Bible. The best methods are of no value to God. He wants to deal with the person of His servants. Neither in the Old Testament nor in the New Testament can we find a case where God called someone and gave instructions concerning how to serve Him. God never gave anyone a list of methods. On the contrary, God always spent time to work on the person whom He called. Some examples of those who were called and sent by God according to this principle include Moses and Isaiah in the Old Testament and Peter, James, John, Paul, and Timothy in the New Testament.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s Word reveals that a person who has been dealt with by God and who has become useful to Him is God&rsquo;s method and His way. God can accomplish what He wants with such a person.</p>
<p>Please forgive me for saying this, but the more I observe the serving ones, the heavier my heart becomes. I think that this feeling is from God. You have given your time to serve, but your concept is that you are here to learn methods. If our person is not right, messages and methods cannot help us. A message that would have been useful to Moses will not be useful to us, and a method that would have been effective with Paul will not be effective with us, because our person is not the same as Moses&rsquo; or Paul&rsquo;s person. Our person is what matters. We cannot do a successful work merely by understanding and remembering every point in a message. A successful work does not depend on our ability to understand messages or to learn methods. Rather, it depends on our person being useful in God&rsquo;s hand, not on the messages we give or the methods we use. The kind of person we are determines the kind of work we can do. Even if we could give the messages that Paul gave and apply the methods that he used, our work would not compare with his work. Our person is God&rsquo;s method; God focuses on our person. Our work is measured not by our messages or by our methods but by our person.</p>
<p>The kind of person that we are determines the condition of our work. Our ability to give a certain message or to use a certain method does not determine the condition of our work. Rather, the kind of work we can do is determined by the kind of person we are. Our person is what matters.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will focus on our person. This is not as high or profound as the matters covered in the previous chapters, because it will direct our attention toward ourselves. Although this matter is neither high nor profound, it is personal and practical. Please allow me to speak freely before the Lord concerning our condition as serving ones, and please receive these words. Our usefulness in the Lord&rsquo;s hand will depend on how we respond to this message.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THAT THE NATURAL MAN IS A THORNBUSH</h2>
<p>A person who is useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand, or one who desires to be used by God, must know his natural man, his self. God always shows those whom He intends to use a vision of their natural man. Moses was such a servant of God. Because God selected Moses and determined to use him before he was even born, God arranged Moses&rsquo; family environment, giving him pious parents to infuse godly thoughts into him. God also arranged for him to live in an Egyptian palace and to learn the top culture of the time (Exo. 2:1-10; Acts 7:22). These environments were arranged by God.</p>
<p>God also worked on Moses&rsquo; heart, giving him a desire to serve God and a longing to be used by God. When Moses was nearly forty years old, he had the heart to rescue his brothers out of the oppression of the Egyptians (Exo. 2:23-25; Heb. 11:24-25). But because Moses had not seen his natural man at that time, he tried to save the Israelites by his natural man and according to his self. For this reason, God caused him to meet rejection, and Moses fled to the land of Midian, where he shepherded a flock for forty years, until he was eighty years old (Exo. 2:14-15; 3:1; Acts 7:29-30). In Psalm 90:10 Moses said, &ldquo;The days of our years are seventy years, / Or, if because of strength, eighty years.&rdquo; In his eyes, eighty years old was the age at which he should have died. To him, at eighty years of age everything was over, finished.</p>
<p>However, that was when God formally called Moses and began to use him. When Moses was called, He showed him a vision of his natural man. Moses was shepherding a flock in the wilderness of Mount Horeb when he saw a thornbush burning with fire but not being consumed (Exo. 3:2). This was an extraordinary scene. When fire burns on a pile of stones and the stones remain intact, it is nothing special. But for fire to burn within a thornbush without consuming the thornbush is something extraordinary. Moses was amazed at this sight and went to look more closely at the thornbush, and it was then that God called to him out of the midst of the thornbush (vv. 3-4).</p>
<p>There are three points that require our attention. First, fire was burning within the thornbush; second, the thornbush was burning but was not consumed; and third, a voice came out of the flame of fire in the midst of the thornbush. God used this special scene to reveal something to Moses. The thornbush represents Moses. Thorns are a symbol of the fallen natural man because thorns are a part of the curse brought in by the fall. According to Genesis 3:17 and 18, the ground was cursed to bring forth thorns after man&rsquo;s fall. Hence, thorns refer to fallen man. A person who is called to be used by God is not cedar, which is good material, but a thornbush. This means that those who are called by God are descendants of Adam.</p>
<p>We should never think that we are proper persons with an honorable character or that we are of noble descent. These are not the thoughts of a person who is being called. The first vision God wants us to see is that we are but a thornbush. Moses was of nobler descent than we are. He was a bona fide Israelite, his parents feared God, and he received the highest education in Egypt. According to historical records, he was capable and commanded the army in Egypt. From man&rsquo;s point of view, Moses was excellent material. However, when he was called, God showed him that he was nothing but a thornbush.</p>
<p>Every descendant of Adam is a thornbush. We must submit to God and say, &ldquo;I am but a thornbush. If You remove the holy fire from me, there will be nothing left.&rdquo; The fire of glory was burning in an unseemly thornbush. This glorious situation did not depend on the thornbush but on the fire. The thornbush was not valuable, but the flame of fire burning in the thornbush was valuable. Furthermore, a voice came out of the fire burning in the thornbush. This means that God came in the fire to the thornbush. If the fire were removed from the thornbush, nothing but the thornbush would be left. If the fire of the divine life were to be removed from us, we would be nothing but a thornbush. Hence, none of the serving ones can boast, because we are nothing but a thornbush.</p>
<p>The thornbush has a special meaning in the Bible. When the Sadducees were debating with the Lord concerning resurrection, the Lord said, &ldquo;Concerning the dead, that they are raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the section concerning the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, &lsquo;I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob&rsquo;? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living&rdquo; (Mark 12:26-27). The Lord Jesus referred to the thornbush in Exodus 3 when speaking concerning resurrection. As those who have been gained and are being used by God, we are a thornbush according to our old, natural man. However, there is a fire in us; God has come to us in the fire. The God of resurrection, the life of resurrection, and the glory of resurrection have come to the natural man.</p>
<p>In ourselves we are a thornbush; we have nothing to boast of. In terms of character, status, family descent, background, and environment, we cannot be compared to Moses. Hence, if Moses was a thornbush, we also are a thornbush. When we see this vision, we can be used by God. Every person who is called to be used by God must see that he is but a thornbush, having nothing to boast of and nothing to depend on. A thornbush does not have any value. It is a sign of the curse, and it does not have any use. According to our natural man, as descendants of Adam, we are good for nothing other than God&rsquo;s curse.</p>
<p>Hence, we should not bring anything of our self&mdash;whether it be status, family descent, background, or character&mdash;into our service. If we want to be used by God, the first vision we must see is that we are a thornbush. The elders and deacons have answered God&rsquo;s call to do His work; hence, they must also see that they are a thornbush. If we do not see this, our service will have no future. People in the world desire status, qualifications, and experience, but God does not want our qualifications or experience in the service. He wants us only as we are. We are a thornbush that deserves to be cursed. Every servant of God will eventually realize that in God&rsquo;s view, he is a thornbush.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HOLY FIRE BURNING IN THE THORNBUSH</h2>
<p>In Exodus 3 holy fire, not strange fire, was burning in the thornbush. We know the fire was holy because Jehovah spoke from within the fire (vv. 4-6). This holy fire was God expressed. When the Israelites erected the tabernacle in the wilderness, &ldquo;the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle&rdquo; (40:34). This glorious cloud signifies God. At night the cloud became a pillar of fire (13:21). The pillar of fire denotes God&rsquo;s power. Hence, the vision that Moses saw in chapter 3 represents the experience of the Israelites in the wilderness. Because Moses represents the Israelites, they experienced what Moses experienced. The fire first burned in Moses and then in the Israelites. If the holy fire of God had not burned in Moses first, it could not have burned in the Israelites. Just as Moses was a thornbush before God, so the Israelites were a thornbush before God. Just as the holy fire burned in Moses, so the holy fire also burned in the midst of the Israelites.</p>
<p>The holy fire of God coming to the thornbush means that God came forth to be among His chosen people. Exodus 3:2 says that the fire in the thornbush was God: &ldquo;The Angel of Jehovah appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a thornbush.&rdquo; The title <em>the Angel of Jehovah</em> refers to the Lord Jesus as the sent One. Verses 4 and 5 say, &ldquo;Jehovah...God called to him out of the midst of the thornbush and said, Moses...Do not come near here.&rdquo; Verse 2 says that the Angel of Jehovah appeared to Moses, but verse 4 says that Jehovah God spoke with Moses. The Angel who came to the earth was Jesus Christ, the One who was sent by God and is God. Verse 8 says, &ldquo;I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians.&rdquo; Where did He &ldquo;come down&rdquo; to? He came down to the thornbush. When the God of resurrection came forth as the Angel of Jehovah, He came forth in His Son, Christ Jesus, the One whom He sent. He came forth in the form of fire in the thornbush, man.</p>
<p>The fire in Exodus 3 can be linked to the fire in Luke 12 and in Acts 2. Acts 2:3 says, &ldquo;There appeared to them tongues as of fire.&rdquo; In Luke 12:49-50 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I have come to cast fire on the earth, and how I wish that it were already kindled! But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!&rdquo; The Lord Jesus wanted to release His life. When His divine life is released, there is fire. The holy fire of God is kindled with the coming of resurrection life. As the Angel of Jehovah and in His resurrection life, God comes to man, the thornbush, so that He can be kindled and burn in man.</p>
<p>The vision in Exodus 3 shows who we are and what has come into us. We are a thornbush, but the holy fire is in us. This holy fire is God expressed in His Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOLY FIRE NOT USING THE THORNBUSH AS FUEL</h2>
<p>The fire burned in the thornbush but did not consume it. When the Israelites offered a sacrifice, they placed the sacrifice on the altar for it to be consumed by fire. But the thornbush was not consumed. The fire burning in the thornbush did not take the thornbush as fuel, just as the divine fire within us does not use us as fuel. When a house is on fire, it does not take much time for the house to burn down, because the house is the fuel for the fire. When the fire of God was burning in the thornbush, it was God who was burning. Hence, God does not use what is in us. The thornbush was not the fuel for the fire; it was merely a place for the fire to be expressed.</p>
<p>The fire did not depend on the thornbush in order to burn. Moses was used by God according to this principle. God&rsquo;s fire of glory was expressed through Moses, a thornbush, in order for God to deal with the magicians and the officials of Egypt and with Pharaoh. Even though the fire was burning, Moses was not consumed.</p>
<p>We must see that we are but a thornbush and that God has come upon us in resurrection as fire. He will do what He wants to do in us, but we will not be consumed. He will not use our capabilities or our abilities to strengthen the fire or to make it brighter. The strength and the brightness of the fire come from the fire itself; the fire is merely resting on us. Our purpose is merely to express the fire.</p>
<p>When Moses was forty years old, he could not be entrusted with this fire. He could use his fists, his own strength, to kill an Egyptian, and he could use his own method to bury the body (2:12), but he could not be entrusted with the fire of resurrection. His strength and his method did not come to an end until he was eighty years old. That was when he could be entrusted with the fire of God. With the staff in his hand, Moses let the fire burn in him (4:17).</p>
<p>In order for us to let the fire be expressed, we must see that our tactics and our abilities are useless in God&rsquo;s work, just as our insight and our strength do not have any place in His work. We must put these aside. In Exodus 2:12 Moses had natural insight and strength: &ldquo;He looked this way and that, and when he saw that there was no one there, he struck the Egyptian down and hid him in the sand.&rdquo; However, if Moses had continued to use his insight and strength, the fire of God could not have come forth. The fire could burn only in a thornbush, a plant that is dried up. Those who put aside their insight and their strength can be entrusted with the resurrection fire of God; they can be a place for the resurrection fire of God to be expressed.</p>
<p>If we want to be useful in God&rsquo;s hand, we must see that the resurrection life of God coming upon us is the expression of the divine power. He does not use us as fuel. We must put aside our views and our strength. They are useless. If we hold on to them, we will have to wait for forty years. The children of Israel spent forty years in the wilderness. The number forty represents trials. These trials will wear out our abilities and our capabilities. If we feel that we still have the strength to strike others and the insight to consider matters, God will allow many trials to come upon us until, in our estimation, we are old, our eyes are dim, our arms are dropping, and everything is over.</p>
<p>God does not use our activities, insight, or strength. He calls us to be material for Him to rest upon. He wants to use us, but He will not use our insight or our strength. He wants to rest on us. Our strength and insight are a frustration to Him. It is not until we stop exercising our abilities that God can come to us and use us.</p>
<p>God demands that we stop exercising our insight, strength, methods, and capabilities, which are all natural. God cannot use us while our natural being is still active. In order to be useful in His hand, we must stop our natural strength and the activity of our natural man. When our person has stopped, the fire of resurrection will burn in us. To be eighty years old is to be dead. Where there is death, there will be resurrection; without death, there cannot be resurrection. If our natural man is not put to death, the holy fire cannot be kindled or expressed. This is the ultimate meaning of the vision of the thornbush. This vision was first fulfilled in Moses and later in the people of Israel.</p><h2 class="head1">SEEING OUR LEPROSY</h2>
<p>After Moses saw the vision of the fire burning in the thornbush, God sent him to Pharaoh to lead the Israelites out of Egypt (3:10). Moses, however, was not willing to answer God&rsquo;s call; hence, he said, &ldquo;Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?&rdquo; (v. 11). God then showed Moses three consecutive signs: his staff becoming a serpent, his hand becoming leprous, and water becoming blood (4:1-9). The sign of the staff becoming a serpent was for Moses to know Satan, his hand becoming leprous was for him to know himself, and the water becoming blood was for him to know the world. A person who serves God should have a thorough knowledge concerning Satan, himself, and the world so that he can be useful. If we want to be useful, we must know our condition.</p>
<p>God said to Moses, &ldquo;Put your hand into your bosom,&rdquo; and Moses put his hand into his bosom, and when he took it out, there his hand was, leprous, as white as snow (v. 6). This enabled Moses to know that he was filled with corruption. There was nothing good in him; he was leprous, utterly filthy. When God asked Moses to put his hand into his bosom, Moses may have thought that he would find a precious treasure. Probably he did not expect that his hand would be full of leprosy. A person who wants to be useful in God&rsquo;s hand needs to know himself; he must see that his natural man is a thornbush and that his self is full of leprosy. Concerning our being used by God, we are a thornbush, and concerning our person, we are corrupt.</p>
<p>For example, if a brother tells you how bad you are, you will get angry even though you may not say anything. But if you have seen the vision of the hand becoming leprous, instead of getting angry, you will say, &ldquo;All this corruption is in me.&rdquo; Rather than getting angry because you are criticized, you will repent because of your corruption. You will say, &ldquo;What this brother has said about me is not even one percent of what I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We must remember that our natural man is a thornbush and that we are leprous. When Peter saw that the Lord Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord Jesus spoke of the building up of the church and of the cross (Matt. 16:16, 18, 24). This means that every person who knows Christ and the church must also know himself. To know the self is to accept the experience of the cross. When Peter heard that the Lord was going to be crucified, he immediately said, &ldquo;God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!&rdquo; (v. 22). But the Lord Jesus &ldquo;turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men. Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me&rdquo; (vv. 23-24).</p>
<p>We need to know that everything related to us has been terminated on the cross. However, it will be difficult for us to experience the termination and death of the cross if we do not know our natural man. Only when we know our natural man will we experience the cross. I do not believe that a person can accept the cross without seeing that he is corrupt. Only when we esteem ourselves as lepers will we bow our heads and confess, &ldquo;Not only do I deserve to die; I am already dead!&rdquo; Furthermore, we will accept the death of the cross only when we see that our natural man is a thornbush; that is, our natural insight and natural ability cannot be brought before God.</p>
<p>In order for us to be useful in God&rsquo;s hand, He first deals with us so that we see our natural man and the self. After we are gained by God, He will first show us how useless our natural man is and how corrupt we are. Then we can experience Christ.</p></body></html>
