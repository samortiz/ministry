In the King James Version it is translated \u201callow not,\u201d and in Darby\u2019s version and Berry\u2019s Greek-English interlinear version, which is based on Stephen\u2019s Greek text, it is translated \u201cdo not own.\u201d In Romans 7:15 Paul says, \u201cWhat I work out, I do not acknowledge.\u201d According to the context of this verse, what Paul works out is not something that he allows, owns, or approves of, because \u201cwhat I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do\u201d (v. 15). Since he does what he hates, he certainly does not allow, own, or approve of it. Similarly, the Lord considers those who are not working according to God\u2019s will to be lawless, and He does not acknowledge, allow, own, or approve of them. Therefore, they will be refused by the Lord and will not be able to enter the kingdom of [308] the heavens. This will be the end of every worker for the Lord who does not work according to the will of God; it will be the punishment they receive. "}]}
