   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Furthermore, 1 Corinthians 15:45 states, "The last Adam became a life-giving spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The last Adam, of course, is the incarnated Lord Jesus, and the life-giving Spirit, of course, is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There can never be another life-giving Spirit besides the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, this verse also tells us clearly that the Lord Jesus is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord was made flesh and became the last Adam, and later, after death and resurrection, became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The words spoken by the Lord in John 14:16-20 also confirm this point.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here the Lord tells us that He will pass through death and resurrection to become another Comforter, that is, the Spirit of reality, who will come to abide with us and dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 17 the Lord says that the Spirit of reality "abideth with you, and shall be in you."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then in verse 18 He says, "I will not leave you desolate: I come unto you."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Over thirty years ago in Shanghai, when Brother Watchman Nee was explaining this passage to us, he pointed out emphatically that "he" the Holy Spirit in verse 17 is the "I" the Lord in verse 18.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord said in effect, "When He comes I come.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is I; I am He."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Holy Spirit is the Lord Jesus, and the Lord Jesus is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Also, in verse 17 the Lord says, "The Spirit of reality Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>...shall be in you," and then in verse 20 He says, "I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This also proves that the Holy Spirit who is in us is the Lord who died and rose and now lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In addition, Romans 8:9-10 shows us that "the Spirit of God" is "the Spirit of Christ," and the "Spirit of Christ" is simply "Christ" Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, the "Spirit of life" mentioned in Romans 8:2 is the Christ who is in our spirit to become our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the Bible clearly reveals to us that the Son is the Father, and the Son is also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Otherwise, how could these three be one God?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Five years ago I raised this question with one who would not agree that the Son is the Father and also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He answered that the Father is one God, the Son is one God, and the Spirit is also one God; and these three are united together to become a corporate God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Immediately I advised him never to speak in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is really heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He replied, "Do not the Psalms use the term 'gods'?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I answered, "The 'gods' in Psalm 82:1 refer to the angels."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If anyone has the concept that the Father, Son, and Spirit are three Gods, how could he then, based on scriptural revelation, acknowledge that the Son is the Father, and the Son is also the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But we must wholly accept and acknowledge the revelation in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brother Watchman Nee in Hymns, #490, verse 5, says, "Thou, Lord, the Father once wast called, / But now the Holy Spirit art."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, in his hymn, he called the Lord not only the Holy Spirit, but also the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This, of course, is based on 2 Corinthians 3:17 and Isaiah 9:6.</S>
