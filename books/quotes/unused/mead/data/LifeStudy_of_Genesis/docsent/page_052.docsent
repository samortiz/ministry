   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>f The Case of Joshua and Caleb</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The principle is the same in the case of Joshua and Caleb.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They fully followed the Lord Num 14:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Himself testified that Caleb fully followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, they defeated the enemy Num 14:6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When they followed the Lord, they had the image.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then they were in the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>g The Cases of the Judges</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I like Judges 5:31.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This verse says that during the time of the judges, there were some who loved the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They who loved the Lord shone as the sunshine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So they defeated the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever a certain person shone as the sun, there was victory over the enemy and rest for the entire nation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The whole book of Judges is a book of repetition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever there was one who loved the Lord and shone as the sun, there was victory through him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The whole nation enjoyed rest through him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>h The Case of David</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>David was a man after God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you read 1 Samuel 13:14, you will see that originally Saul was the king.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, Saul did not have a heart after God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He lost the throne, and God found another man who was after His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This one, David, doubtless had the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was he who defeated the enemy 1 Chron 22:8a .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>i The Cases of the Kings</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have seen the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now we come to the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever the kings were one with the Lord, they defeated the enemy 2 Chron 14:2-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whenever they were not one with the Lord, they were defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They lost the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In other words, whenever the kings were in the image of God and expressed God, they had authority to defeat the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have now both the priesthood and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Never forget that the priesthood is for the image and that the kingship is for the dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we are priests to be like God and, at the same time, we are kings to represent God, exercising His authority over the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>j The Case of Daniel</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Daniel was a captive in Babylon, a waiter in the king's palace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet, he lived a holy life, a life that expressed God Dan 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, he came into power.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He had authority over the world at that time Dan 6:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>k The Case of Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When Jesus was on this earth, He expressed God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Wherever He was, He expressed God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was a real man and a typical man, but He continually expressed God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>So, He obtained authority over everything Matt 28:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Zechariah 6:13 tells us that Jesus bears two posts, the priesthood and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was the priest and He was the king.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today, He is still the High Priest and is still the King of kings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is the One who expresses God, the One who represents God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He bears God's image and He holds God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is Jesus.</S>
