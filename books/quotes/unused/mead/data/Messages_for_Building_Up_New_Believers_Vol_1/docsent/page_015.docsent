   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Improper Objects Needing to Be Terminated</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>And a considerable number of those who practiced magic brought their books together and burned them before all; and they counted up the price of them and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver Acts 19:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is another matter which new believers should deal with and terminate.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is not a command or a teaching; it is the result of the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Holy Spirit moved in such a strong way that the Ephesians brought out all the improper books in their possession.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here it says the price was fifty thousand pieces of silver, which is a considerable sum.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They did not sell their books and give the money to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead, the books were burned.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If Judas had been present, he certainly would not have allowed this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was much more than thirty pieces of silver which could have been given to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But the Lord was pleased to have them burned.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Apart from the kind of objects mentioned above, there are many other questionable objects that need to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some of them are clearly related to sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Gambling instruments and improper books and pictures are some examples.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These must be burned or destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There may be many luxury items and objects of indulgence which cannot be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, they still need to be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Burning, however, is the general principle in dealing with these things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After a person believes in the Lord, he should go home and check through his personal belongings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In an unbeliever s home, there is always something related to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He may have things which do not befit the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Things related to sin must be burned or destroyed; they cannot be sold.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Luxury items should be converted and altered if possible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If they cannot be altered, we must sell them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The garments of the lepers in Leviticus 13 and 14 are a good illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Garments which have become leprous and cannot be washed must be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, those which can be washed should be washed for reuse.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the style of our clothes is unbecoming, we can alter them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some garments may be too short, and we can lengthen them; others are odd-looking, and we can make them look more inconspicuous.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some objects cannot be salvaged; they have the element of sin in them, in which case we have to burn them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those that can be sold should be sold, and the money should be given to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There should be a termination of improper things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If every new believer will go through all his belongings thoroughly, he will have a very good start.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Superstitious objects have to be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Others can be altered or sold after being altered.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once we learn this lesson, we will not forget it for the rest of our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must realize that being a Christian is a very practical matter; it is not just a matter of going to church and listening to some sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>C. Repaying Debts</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And Zaccheus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much Luke 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Zaccheus did not do this as a result of doctrinal teaching; he did this as a result of the working of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If it had been the result of doctrinal teaching, only the exact amount would have been repaid, no more and no less.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But since it was the working of the Holy Spirit, the amount could vary; it could be a little more or a little less.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Zaccheus said, If I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Actually, a double compensation would have been more than adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The principle in the book of Leviticus is to add one-fifth to the original amount.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For one thousand dollars, you would have to repay one thousand two hundred dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if one is touched, he can pay as much as the Lord s Spirit directs him to pay.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He can be moved to repay four times or ten times as much.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What is spoken of here is only a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In reading the Bible, we must be clear that what is covered is not a mere teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is the result of the leading of the Holy Spirit when He operates in man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Suppose that before you became a believer, you had extorted or defrauded others, stolen from them, or obtained things by improper means.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now that the Lord is working within, you have to deal with these things in a proper manner.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This has nothing to do with the forgiveness you received from the Lord, but it is very much related to your testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Suppose I stole a thousand dollars from someone before I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If I have not dealt with the matter clearly, how can I preach the gospel to that person after I am saved?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>While I am preaching to him, his heart may still be on the thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No doubt, I have received forgiveness from God, but I do not have a proper testimony before man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I cannot say, Since God has forgiven me, it does not matter whether or not I repay him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No, this matter is related to my testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Please remember that Zaccheus restored four times as much for the sake of his testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At that time everyone was saying, How could the Lord lodge in this sinner s home?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He has extorted and defrauded many people!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They were all indignant.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>While they were saying this, Zaccheus stood up and said, If I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This fourfold restoration was neither a requirement for becoming a son of Abraham nor a requirement for God s salvation coming to Zaccheus s house.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This fourfold restoration was the result of God s salvation coming to Zaccheus s house and of his becoming a son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Due to this act of restoration, Zaccheus had a testimony before man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This was the basis of his testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I knew a brother who was not very upright in financial matters before he believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Many of his classmates were upper middle-class people.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>After he believed in the Lord, he became rather zealous in leading his classmates to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But he did not see much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Although he earnestly preached the gospel to them, they said in their heart, What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>What about all the money?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>His past had not been eradicated from them.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This brother did not follow the example of Zaccheus.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>His sins were forgiven before God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>All his problems were solved.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But the matter concerning his money before his classmates was not resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He had to confess and make recompense for all his past wrongdoings before he could testify to others.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The restoration of his testimony depended on the termination of his past.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>As I have mentioned, Zaccheus did not become a son of Abraham by restoring four times as much.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Neither did he gain salvation by restoring four times as much.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Rather, he restored four times as much because he was a child of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He restored four times as much because he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>By restoring four times as much, he shut the mouths of others.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>They could no longer say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>His fourfold restoration went far beyond what he owed, thus shutting the mouths of others and restoring his testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Brothers and sisters, did you wrong anyone in any way before you became a believer?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Do you owe anyone anything?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Have you taken things home which belong to others?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Have you taken anything by improper means?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If so, you have to deal with all these things properly.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The repentance of a Christian has to do with confessing his past wrongdoings, whereas the repentance of ordinary men only involves a change in his present conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>For example, as a human being, if I have a bad temper, I need only to refrain from my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But as a Christian, in addition to refraining from my temper, I have to apologize for my former temper.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Apart from not losing my temper before God, I must also apologize for my former temper before men.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Only then can this matter be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Suppose you stole from others in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Your problem before God is settled as long as you no longer steal.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Likewise, if you have ever taken things that belonged to others, your problem is settled once you stop doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>However, this is not enough for you to have a testimony before men.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Even if you have not stolen anything in three years, others may still consider you as a thief.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>After believing in the Lord, you must testify before men; you must deal with all your mistakes in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Only then will your position be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>But here is a difficult problem.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Suppose you stole ten thousand dollars from someone.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>What should you do if you do not even have one thousand dollars now?</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>In principle you have to confess to the person from whom you have stolen.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>You should tell him frankly that you cannot repay him at the present time.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Whether or not you can repay him immediately is another matter; you should still confess and testify to him.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>If you do not testify now, you will not be able to testify for the rest of your life.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Please remember that in the course of giving your testimony, you may be affected by personal problems.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>But you cannot avoid dealing with these problems.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>You still must deal with the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>You can have a testimony before men only after you have dealt with your problems.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Some have committed murder in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>What should they do now?</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>This is a part of their past.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>In the Bible there are two murderers who were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>One was involved directly with the act of murder, while the other murdered indirectly.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>The first one was the robber on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>It is clear in the Greek language that the word robber does not just mean an ordinary robber; it means a criminal who engages in such acts as murder and arson.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>He was not just a thief but one who robbed and killed.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>After he believed in the Lord, his sins were forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>The Bible does not tell us how he terminated his past.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>The other person is Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>He was not involved in any direct murder.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>However, he was an accomplice in the murder of Stephen, and he watched over the garments of those who killed Stephen.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>After Paul was saved, nothing was said about how he dealt with this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>In principle I believe that once a murderer has believed in the Lord, his sins are behind him.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>There is no sin which cannot be cleansed by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>The robber did not have to do anything to terminate his past.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>In fact, he had no opportunity to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>The Lord said to him, Today you shall be with Me in Paradise Luke 23:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Therefore, when we encounter such cases, we should not overly burden the conscience of others, unless of course God has first worked in that person s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>This is because in the two New Testament cases that deal with murder one directly and the other indirectly God did not pay attention to the rectification of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>However, I believe that some have no peace in their conscience, not because they are suffering from ordinary accusations, but because God is working in them.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>In such cases, we should not stop them from expressing their regrets to the victim s family.</S>
