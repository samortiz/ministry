   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FUNCTION OF THE GROUP MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is best that a group meeting be started with a small number of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To start with too many persons makes it difficult to get thoroughly, intimately, and lovingly acquainted.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, with only two to five members it will be difficult to practice the proper function of the group, which needs to visit sinners and gain them for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is better to have seven or eight in a group.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After a period of time everyone will be acquainted with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before this time we should not go out to work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should first form ourselves into an acting, working, moving group by getting acquainted, built up, and trained.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we can begin to function by visiting people for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this way new ones can be gained gradually, one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the group gains people little by little, it will not be difficult to follow up on and care for the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to carry this out, we need to be diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This will involve much work and will require that we all work together.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Seven can gain one more and become eight.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then eight can work together to gain another new one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is easy for eight to care for one new one and thus become nine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Gradually, after working for six months, the group may have fifteen or sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By that time everyone will be acquainted and trained.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The group can then divide into two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After becoming two groups, everyone will be able to work because they have already become acquainted and have had practice and training.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every group will begin not with new beginners but with trained persons.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These will be the foundation for the next generation, and that generation will be ready to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should spend the first five or six months in the groups to get ourselves built up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After this we can double our number in the next half year.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This will double the number in the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After this number doubles two more times, we will have at least a onefold increase of the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Perhaps our progress will be slower than this, but we anticipate that this way will be successful if everyone will labor.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>INTRODUCING THE NEW ONES</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>TO THE CHURCH MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After forming new groups and going to gain new persons, we need to consider when and how to introduce the new ones to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It may be better to wait for a number of weeks before bringing a new one to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, after one is baptized, what will we do with him on the Lord s Day?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we meet with only the new ones, we will neglect the church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we form groups and take care of the new ones without going to the church meetings, the church will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, if we do not bring the new ones to the church meeting on the Lord s Day but go ourselves, we will neglect the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, this problem is difficult to solve.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, for the Caucasian new ones it may be better to have a separate meeting on the Lord s Day besides the regular church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not pay much attention to the former way of meeting, but we must still attend the church meeting on the Lord s Day and the meeting for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Besides these, we still have other week nights and the Lord s Day afternoon and evening for the group way of meeting and serving.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this way the practice of the group meetings will not affect the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should respect the church meetings, and we should continue to attend them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the groups gain a number of new ones, the churches should agree to let the groups meet separately for the Lord s table meeting on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One or two groups can come together on the Lord s Day to have the Lord s table with the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way we can bring the new ones into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After half a year these new ones can spontaneously come with us to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then when they come into the church meetings they will not be surprised, because they will have already come into the proper meeting life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order to have the Lord s table in the group meetings, we need to teach the new ones concerning the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It may be better not to bring the new ones to the church meeting until we have had the Lord s table with them in the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the time a group is ready to divide into two, we may bring the new ones to the church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At that time they will be the same as we are.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They may attend both the church meetings and the group meetings, or they may have the capacity to attend only the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In such cases, we can advise them to sometimes attend the church meetings to get more help.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the flexible way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In addition to having the Lord s table in the group meetings with the new ones, we must also teach the new ones concerning other matters, such as how to function and how to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After they are built up, they can come to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then they will be able to exercise a positive influence in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Since we still need to attend the church meeting on the Lord s Day morning, it is better to arrange to have the Lord s table with the new ones in the afternoon or the evening on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Furthermore, we may baptize the new ones mainly on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For this it may be better to meet with the new ones in the church meeting hall, where there is a baptistry.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, every hall can be used twice on the Lord s Day, once in the morning and again in the afternoon or evening.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To meet and be baptized on the Lord s Day in the meeting hall will be more proper in the eyes of many of the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They may be disappointed if the Lord s Day meeting is not in a proper place or if it is moved from place to place.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need to pray and consider all the points of our fellowship in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What we are practicing may cause us some complications; it will not be simple, because we will have the church meetings and the group meetings going on at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Eventually, we hope that after a few years the entire church will be practicing the group meetings.</S>
