[2]  In the last few messages, we saw that there is a distinction between sin and sins in man.
[3]  We saw how God loves us and gives His grace to us, how His grace is manifested in His righteousness, how the Lord Jesus has accomplished all the work for us, and what His death and resurrection have done.
[4]  God is not like us, wavering and changing frequently.
[5]  He is not one way today and another way the next.
[6]  Once God has given us something, He will never claim it back.
[7]  Thank and praise the Lord that God never borrows and never lends.
[8]  Most have probably read John 3:16 which says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life."
[9]  If while we were yet sinners, God loved us to such an extent that He gave us the life of His Son, is it possible that after we become Christians and are weak and short of God's glory that He would reject us?
[10]  Hence, Romans 8:32 tells us that if God did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not also with Him freely give us all things?
[11]  Second, is our salvation an accident or a purposeful act of God?
[12]  Is God's salvation like giving two pennies to a beggar that one happens to come across in the street?
[13]  Or is God purposefully seeking to find a man to whom He can give money?
[14]  But all those who understand the Bible and who know God realize that His salvation is not an accident.
[15]  Second, since it is God who has started the work, who has foreknown and predestinated us, who has called and justified us, who has saved us, and who will bring us into glory, God's attribute would be put into question if we lost our salvation.
[16]  All those who believe in Him and who receive Him are given the authority to become children of God John 1:12 .
[17]  John 3 says that we are to be born anew; it is the Holy Spirit who has regenerated us v. 6 . The first Epistle of John tells us how man can be regenerated.
[18]  First John 5:1 says that everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten of God.
[19]  God gave us another type in the Bible to show us that we can never lose our salvation once we have received it from God.
[20]  After Adam ate of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, God drove him from the garden of Eden and guarded the way to the tree of life with the cherubim and the flaming sword that turned every way v. 24 . Why did God have to surround the entrance to the tree of life with the flaming sword and the cherubim? Why did He not allow Adam to eat of the fruit of the tree of life? Genesis 3:22 says, "And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever." Here we see a picture.
[21]  When we were saved, not only did God regenerate us and give us eternal life; He made us one spirit with the Lord.
[22]  First Corinthians tells us that we have not only become one spirit with Christ, but we have become members of His Body 12:27 .
[23]  Hence, when an unbeliever is saved, not only has he received regeneration and eternal life from God, but he at the same time is joined to the Body of Christ to become a member of the Body of Christ.
[24]  If God saves us one by one in Christ, and if Christ died for us, washed away our sins, gave us eternal life, and caused us to have a life relationship with Him to become His members, what is our end?
[25]  Every Christian is like a stone, and the church is the spiritual house that God is building.
[26]  Every Christian is a small stone built upon the Lord Jesus to become the temple of God and the habitation of God.
[27]  If there were a possibility for Christians to perish, the temple of God would become more unsightly than our run-down meeting hall; one minute the stones would be taken out, and another minute they would be put back in again, and the walls would be full of holes.
[28]  In John 14 the Lord Jesus said that the Holy Spirit will be with us forever v.
[29]  Once the Holy Spirit of the New Testament comes into us, He will never leave us.
[30]  Last evening we saw a number of things that God has already done.
[31]  It is not that the Holy Spirit seals a seal upon us, but that the Holy Spirit is a seal upon us; the Holy Spirit is the seal of God upon us.
[32]  On the one hand, God puts His Holy Spirit in us as the seal to prove that we belong to God; on the other hand, God puts His Holy Spirit in us as the pledge, that we may know that whatever God will give us is guaranteed.
[33]  When we believed in the Lord Jesus, God promised us that He would give us the incorruptible inheritance in the heavens.
[34]  Seventh, there is another reason why we will not lose our salvation.
[35]  In the Bible we see that a relationship exists between the Lord Jesus and God, and a relationship exists between the Lord and us.
[36]  There is a wonderful word in the Bible that says we Christians, the saved sinners, are the gifts given by God to the Lord Jesus John 17:6 .
[37]  If God has given us as gifts to the Lord Jesus, is there the possibility for us to lose our salvation?
[38]  If we were to perish and lose our salvation, if our salvation were not eternal, God's giving us to the Lord Jesus would become a joke on the Lord.
[39]  If God were not omniscient, it might be possible for us to perish because God would not know whether our salvation would be temporary or permanent.
[40]  If God were not omniscient, it could be possible that He would give us as a soap bubble to the Lord Jesus.
[41]  We cannot blame only God for giving the Lord Jesus a token favor, but we have to also blame the Lord Jesus for not being able to keep those whom God had given Him.
[42]  The only reason that you come to the Lord Jesus, that you receive Him as Lord, that you trust in His redemptive work and in His resurrection as your proof of justification, is that God has given you to the Lord Jesus.
[43]  It is precious to know from the Bible that the Lord Jesus is our offering, but it is more precious to know that He is our High Priest.
[44]  Many times I asked the brothers and sisters in various places what we would do if the Lord Jesus were not our Savior.
[45]  If the Lord Jesus were not our Savior, we would be through; there would be no way for us to be saved.
[46]  We can keep our salvation only because the Lord Jesus is our High Priest before God.
[47]  The Bible clearly tells us that the Lord Jesus is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him.
[48]  It is not our prayer that keeps us saved to the end; it is the prayer of the Lord Jesus that can keep us saved to the end. I do not know how many of us here tonight believe in the power of the prayer of the Lord Jesus.
[49]  I am not saying that we should forget about the difficult passages in the Bible.
[50]  Our salvation does not depend merely on our believing, but it also depends on the keeping power of God.
[51]  It is not we who are keeping ourselves, but the power of God that is keeping us.
[52]  The guarding by the power of God implies that if I were to become lost, the responsibility would not be mine, but God's. I speak reverently, that if we were to be lost, more responsibility would fall on God than on us.
[53]  Besides the nine points covered already, there is still another point.
[54]  Of the nine points that have been covered, none can be overthrown by you, or even by God.
[55]  But the Lord Jesus considered this as not good enough; He was concerned that we would doubt His work.
[56]  Thank God that it is my Father who keeps the salvation for me.
[57]  It is my Lord who keeps my salvation for me.
[58]  If it is through our Lord loving us, then "in all these things we more than conquer...For I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[59]  We have seen on the positive side that all the work that God has done and all the grace that He has given us at the time we were saved cannot be annulled by the passage of time.
[60]  We can boldly say that once we are saved, we are eternally saved.
[61]  Once God has shown mercy to us, we are eternally under His mercy.
[62]  Once we have the eternal life of the Son of God, we will never lose it.
[63]  Since one has seen clearly the sealing and the pledging of the Holy Spirit, eternal life, the hand of the Lord, the Body of Christ, the temple of God, and the promises of the Lord, he cannot overturn what he knows with problems concerning things that he does not know or understand.
[64]  I once heard an evangelist from Shanghai say that the teaching of "once saved, eternally saved" makes a person irresponsible, loose, and not very watchful.
[65]  One can only make such a statement because he does not fully understand the Word of God.
[66]  Only those who do not understand God's salvation can say that a man will be irresponsible and loose because he knows that he is eternally saved.
[67]  In saying this, we are not talking about the way of preservation, but the manner in which God has saved us.
[68]  If a man thinks that he has received a license and a certificate to sin just because he now knows that he is eternally saved, and if such a one does not feel anything when he sins, has no sense of suffering, I doubt that such a one is a true child of God.
[69]  But moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is out of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is out of God and based on faith."
[70]  Thus, the reason a person can say that he can be loose because he knows that he is eternally saved is due to three things: First, he is ignorant of the way, the process, of salvation; second, he does not know the content of salvation; and third, he does not know the issue of salvation, that is, he does not know what salvation can do for man.
[71]  Now let us spend some time to consider some portions of the Scriptures that seem to speak of perdition after salvation.
[72]  Before this, we have to know a few things.
[73]  First, the Word of God has absolutely no conflict with itself.
[74]  On the one hand, God can never say that His sheep will never perish or lose their eternal life, and on the other hand, tell man that he will perish.
[75]  Let us consider Ezekiel 18:24 and 26, which say, "But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live?
[76]  All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die...When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die."
[77]  Galatians 5:4 says, "You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace."
[78]  When many read this verse, they think that, first, one can be separated from Christ, and second, one can fall from grace.
[79]  However, the second half said that before one believes in the Lord Jesus, he cannot have the righteousness from the law; but after one receives the Lord Jesus, he should have the righteousness of the law.
[80]  ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT 2 NO TEACHING CONCERNING ETERNAL DEATH
[81]  All those who study the Old Testament carefully and who understand the Old Testament know that it does not have the teaching of eternal death, nor does it have anything like eternal punishment.
[82]  But in the New Testament, those who are blessed by God can say, "Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I have, this I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene...walk!"
[83]  In this message, we will consider a few more verses.
[84]  First Corinthians 8:11 says in the King James Version, "And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?"
[85]  For even if there are so-called gods, either in heaven or on earth, even as there are many gods and many lords, yet to us there is one God, the Father, out from whom are all things, and we are unto Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we are through Him.
[86]  Paul was saying that here is a weak brother.
[87]  Now he sees others eating, and he wants to join them.
[88]  For you to eat is all right, because you have the discernment and you know that the idols mean nothing.
[89]  James 5:19-20 says, "My brothers, if any one among you is led astray from the truth and someone turns him back, let him know that he who turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save that one's soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins."
[90]  Some people also infer from these two verses that a saved person can perish.
[91]  Before we read verse 4, let me first tell you about this introduction.
[92]  Before the apostle wrote verse 4, he anticipated that these ones would ask, "If you say that we should not lay again the foundation, what then should we do if we sin again?
[93]  If a person has failed, backslidden, and sinned, does he not have to lay again the foundation?"
[94]  If you have a Greek New Testament in your hand, you will see that the word once according to the grammar of the original language does not refer only to the first item of the list, but to every item in the list.
[95]  If there is a man who has once been enlightened, who has once tasted of the heavenly gift, who has once become a partaker of the Holy Spirit, who has once tasted the good word of God and once tasted the powers of the age to come, is it possible that such a one cannot any longer repent once he makes a slip?
[96]  Here we have to consider again the four things mentioned in the Bible.
[97]  They are the four things that must be distinguished one from the other, which we mentioned earlier.
[98]  Fourth, not only does the Bible say that a Christian will suffer discipline today, and not only does it say that some Christians can lose the kingdom, but there are definite punishments for a Christian in the kingdom as well.
[99]  In this message we will continue to look at the verses which seem to argue against salvation being eternal.
[100]  Second Corinthians 2:6-7 says, "Sufficient for such a one is this punishment by the majority, so that on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with excessive sorrow."
[101]  There is another portion of Scripture that we must mention.
[102]  It is also a passage that many do not understand.
[103]  Hebrews 10:26-29 says, "For when we sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins, but a certain fearful expectation of judgment and fervor of fire, which is to consume the adversaries.
[104]  By how much do you think he will be thought worthy of worse punishment who has trampled underfoot the Son of God and has considered the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing and has insulted the Spirit of grace?"
[105]  In Romans 7, Paul says, "For what I work out, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do" v. 15 . By this we know that Paul did not fall into sin accidentally.
[106]  Therefore, when it says that one should not abandon the assembling of oneself together, it does not mean that the assembling of Christians can save them or qualify them to have eternal life.
[107]  The assembling of Christians indicates whether a believer wants Judaism or Christ.
[108]  The assembling of ourselves becomes an expression of our attitude toward Christ.
[109]  Therefore, after reading so many verses, we can know the meaning of the verse, "There no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins."
[110]  The portion of Hebrews from chapters seven through ten, with the exception of chapter eight, says that the work of redemption, once finished, is eternally accomplished.
[111]  If you do not want Christ, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins.
[112]  If you do not want the redemption of Christ, but turn to Judaism, you will no longer find any other sacrifice for sins.
[113]  After receiving the knowledge of the truth, and after having a clear knowledge that the Lord Jesus Christ is the God-ordained sacrifice for sins, if the Jewish believers forsake the assembling of themselves and reject Christ, and if they go back to Judaism to look for other sacrifices for sins, there will no longer remain any sacrifice for sins.
[114]  Hebrews 12:5-6 says, "And you have completely forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with sons, My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor faint when reproved by Him; for whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives.'"
[115]  They committed the sin of lying to the Spirit, and they received a very severe discipline Acts 5:1-10 .
[116]  At one time, I thought that perhaps Ananias and Sapphira were not saved.
[117]  By reading the Bible carefully, one has to acknowledge that they were saved because they were with the disciples at the time of Pentecost.
[118]  Now we want to see the third difference the difference between reward and gift, in other words, the difference between the kingdom and eternal life.
[119]  There are many Christians in the church today who cannot differentiate between the kingdom of the heavens and eternal life.
[120]  They think that the kingdom of the heavens is eternal life and that eternal life is simply the kingdom of the heavens.
[121]  They have mixed up the Word of God, taking the condition for the receiving of the kingdom as the condition for the preservation of eternal life.
[122]  If one believes in the Lord Jesus as Savior, accepting the Lord Jesus as life, this one is saved before God.
[123]  Today's problem is that people will not differentiate between salvation and the kingdom.
[124]  In the Bible, there is a clear distinction between salvation and the kingdom and between the gift and the reward.
[125]  Because people would not differentiate these matters, the question of salvation is mishandled, and the question of reward is also mishandled.
[126]  God has never placed the matter of reward before the unsaved ones.
[127]  However, after salvation, God places the reward before them so that they will endeavor, pursue, and run after the reward.
[128]  Many people know that there is a difference between salvation and reward.
[129]  But there are many people who do not see what the reward is.
[130]  In the Bible, whether with the Lord Jesus, or with the apostles, the words they spoke concerning the reward and the kingdom were not spoken lightly, in the same way the gift and eternal life were not spoken of lightly.
[131]  When the Lord Jesus says in the Gospel of John that He gives eternal life to His sheep, He is speaking reality and not some empty words John 10:28 .
[132]  Romans 6 says that the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord v. 23 . It is so clear that the gift of God is eternal life.
[133]  The time for us to be rewarded is when Christ comes again to execute judgment.
[134]  Peter tells us that judgment begins from the house of God.
[135]  In the future, God will judge the Christians first, before He judges the worldly people.
[136]  We have made it clear that the kingdom is the time when God will reward the Christians according to their works.
[137]  One verse that speaks of this is Matthew 7:21: "Not every one who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens."
[138]  Although some have been saved and have called Him Lord, and although they have also done some works, without doing the will of God they nevertheless cannot enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
[139]  If this were the case, then all the unsaved ones would be those who do not do the will of God, and all the saved ones would be those who do the will of God.
[140]  The Lord Jesus must be warning the saved ones here by speaking about the saved ones.
[141]  Suppose one has a maid and two daughters, and suppose this one were to say to the younger daughter, "Do you see that maid?
[142]  Another passage which some misinterpret as referring to perdition actually refers to the losing of the kingdom and the losing of the reward.
[143]  First Corinthians 9:23-27 says, "And I do all things for the sake of the gospel that I may become a fellow partaker of it.
[144]  Do you not know that those who run on a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize?
[145]  I therefore run in this way, not as though without a clear aim; I box in this way, not as though beating the air; but I buffet my body and make it my slave, lest perhaps having preached to others, I myself may become disapproved."
[146]  Only the ones who are saved, who have believed in the Lord Jesus, who are reborn, and who have become the children of God are qualified to enter the race.
[147]  If a saved one does not hold fast to what he has, if he does not keep the words of endurance of the Lord Jesus, and if he forsakes the name of the Lord Jesus, he will lose his crown some day.
[148]  The clearest passage in the Bible about the reward is 1 Corinthians 3:14-15: "If anyone's work which he has built upon the foundation remains, he will receive a reward; if anyone's work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved."
[149]  This shows us clearly what a Christian cannot lose and what he can lose.
[150]  Once a person is saved, he is surely saved forever.
[151]  If a Christian has such a hope, knowing that the Lord Jesus will come again to set up His kingdom in glory, and knowing that all those faithful ones who do the will of God will reign with the Lord, if such a one holds fast to this, he will be His house.
[152]  The Bible tells us that the Lord disciplines us because He loves us Heb 12:6 .
[153]  If God had not loved us, He would not have sent His Son to die for our sins on the cross.
[154]  Similarly, if God does not love us, He would not discipline us.
[155]  Is this cleansing discipline from God restricted to this age only, or is it found also in the coming age?
[156]  From the Bible we know that death never changes anyone.
[157]  "For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad."
[158]  All Bible readers know that the judgment seat of Christ is in the air.
[159]  If a man is not saved and is not a child of God, he is not even qualified to be judged at this judgment.
[160]  The Word of God shows us clearly that at the judgment seat those who do well will receive a reward and that those who do not do well will lose their reward and will be recompensed according to their evil.
[161]  There is enough light in the Bible to show us that if a saved person is not disciplined for his loose conduct in this age, or if he does not repent after discipline, he will not only lose his reward but will also be chastised in a definite way.
[162]  THE AGE OF THE NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH
[163]  And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
[164]  And I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.
[165]  When we preach the gospel, we tell others that we receive eternal life through believing in Jesus Christ.
[166]  Everyone who understands the Word of God knows that in the church age, as soon as a man believes, he has eternal life.
[167]  After the young man left, the Lord Jesus looked around Him and said to the disciples, "How difficult it will be for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God!" v. 23 . In saying this, the Lord put eternal life and the kingdom together.
[168]  The Lord said that "with men it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God" v. 27 . Peter then asked what he would get for having left all to follow Him, and the Lord told them of the things that are to come.
[169]  The Bible says that many children of God will have specific punishment.
[170]  There are many places in the Bible that mention God's punishment for the defeated Christians in the millennial kingdom.
[171]  Verse 3 says that we must turn and become like children before we can enter the kingdom, and verse 4 says that if we continue to be children and humble ourselves, we will be the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.
[172]  Another thing that we have to realize is that the person spoken of here must be a Christian, for only a Christian is clean in his body as a whole and can thus enter into life after dealing with his lust in a single member of his body.
[173]  It would not be enough for the unbelievers to cut off a hand or a foot.
[174]  Even if they were to cut off both hands and both feet, they would still have to go to hell.
[175]  In order to enter the kingdom of the heavens, it is better for a Christian to have an incomplete body than to go into eternal fire because of incomplete dealing.
[176]  Following this, verse 9 says, "And if your eye stumbles you, pluck it out and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be cast into the Gehenna of fire."
[177]  This shows us that if a saved person does not deal with his lust, he will not be able to enter into life, but will go into eternal fire.
[178]  If I am involved in an argument with a brother, and if the matter is not dealt with in this age, then in the future, either both of us will be barred from the kingdom, or only one of us will get in. It cannot be that both of us will enter in. It is not possible for us to have a problem with each other and yet reign at the same time in the millennium in the future.
[179]  Now let us look at what other places in the Bible say concerning this matter.
[180]  Luke 12:1 says, "Meanwhile, when the myriads of the crowd were gathered together so that they trampled on one another, He began to say to His disciples first."
[181]  If we tolerate sin, if we do not forgive others, if we commit adultery, if we revile the brothers, if we are afraid to suffer, to be ashamed, to be persecuted, and to confess the Lord, we have to be careful, for God will cast us "into Gehenna" so that we may be punished temporarily.
[182]  There are similar passages in the Bible that speak of these matters.
[183]  Revelation 2:11 tells us that those who overcome will not be hurt by the second death, and Revelation 20:6 says that one group of people will not die again and that the second death will not have authority over them.
[184]  How many things are there in us that are still not dealt with?
[185]  How many things have not been cleansed away by the Lord's blood, and how many things are not yet confessed, dealt with, and settled with the brothers and sisters?
[186]  These are the thorns and thistles referred to by the Lord.
[187]  In Matthew 5 the Lord said that one cannot go out from there until every quadrans is paid.
[188]  If the Lord Jesus cannot disassociate us from our sins and if we have not settled everything in our lives, God has no choice but to chastise us in the future.
[189]  If we do not turn today, we will have to wait until we are worthy to enter in. It is true that the Lord Jesus has saved us, but subjectively speaking, if we do not allow the Holy Spirit to work the Lord Jesus into us, God will have to chastise us that we may receive the benefit and be counted worthy to be with Him.
[190]  The greatest difficulty today in studying the Bible lies in the prejudice in the mind of God's children.
[191]  They have what they consider as truth and what they consider as heresy.
[192]  They think that everything that matches them is truth, and everything that does not match them and that differs from them is heresy.
[193]  But if we see the difference between the age of the kingdom and the eternal age and the difference between the temporary punishment of the millennium and eternal punishment, we will be clear that a Christian can receive punishment in the future, but at the same time, God has given His sheep eternal life, and they can never lose it.
[194]  After a man has believed in the Lord Jesus, all his past sins are forgiven by the redemptive work of the Lord.
[195]  But what should he do if he sins again after he has believed and is saved?
[196]  We know that we should not fail and that we should not make mistakes, but we have to admit that we do have times of failure and we do make mistakes.
[197]  For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who are defiled sanctifies to the purity of the flesh, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
[198]  The question now is this: What should we do if we sin again?
[199]  What should we do if we become filthy again?
[200]  All the sins we committed before we were saved have been washed away by His blood.
[201]  The Lord Jesus does not defend us by saying that the temptation was too great and as little children we could not handle it, and that therefore God has to grant us grace.
[202]  The work of the Lord Jesus as Advocate is for Christians.
[203]  As the Savior, the Lord Jesus accomplished the work of the cross.
[204]  It shows God what the Lord Jesus has done, so that God cannot punish man for his sins.
[205]  It is true that the Lord Jesus is presenting His blood and His accomplished work before God continually.
[206]  But if we sin intentionally, continuously, and without repentance, repudiation, or an inclination to deal with our sins, the work of the Lord's blood will lose its effect and efficaciousness for us.
[207]  There is a kind of cleansing in the Old Testament which is a type of the forgiveness of believers in the New Testament.
[208]  Let us read what can be considered as the only portion in the Old Testament dealing with the forgiveness of the Christians' sins.
[209]  Numbers 19:1-13 says, "And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, This is the statute of the law which Jehovah has commanded, saying, Tell the sons of Israel to bring you a red heifer without blemish, in which there is no defect, and upon which a yoke has never come.
[210]  Numbers 19:4 tells us what happens after the heifer is slaughtered.
[211]  "And Eleazar the priest shall take some of her blood with his finger, and shall sprinkle some of her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times."
[212]  He only sprinkled some blood before God in the tabernacle.
[213]  This shows us that the death of the Lord Jesus has satisfied the requirements of God.
[214]  In Numbers 19 God shows us that if a man touches a dead body, he is defiled and must cleanse himself with the ashes of the red heifer.
[215]  John 13:3-10 says, "Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all into His hands and that He had come forth from God and was going to God, rose from supper and laid aside His outer garments; and taking a towel, He girded Himself; then He poured water into the basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded.
[216]  Although we Christians are bathed once only, the Bible shows us that foot-washing happens many times.
[217]  There is only one bathing, but there are many foot-washings.
[218]  It is like the cleansing: There is only one cleansing by the blood, but there are many cleansings by the water of the ashes.
[219]  Foot-washing is a washing that comes about by the Word of God, through the work of the Holy Spirit, and based upon the work of the Lord Jesus.
