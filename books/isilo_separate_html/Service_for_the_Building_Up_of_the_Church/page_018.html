<h1 class="title">GROWTH AND BUILDING UP</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:15-16; Col. 2:19</h1>
<p>We will say more about Ephesians 4:15-16 and Colossians 2:19 in this chapter. Both portions refer to growth when speaking of the building up of the church. The building up of the church depends on the growth of the church. A physical house is not living, and it cannot grow, but the church is a living house built with living stones (1 Pet. 2:5). Hence, it must grow. The growth of the church is actually the building up of the church. If we do not have genuine growth, we cannot expect the church to be built up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GROWING INTO THE HEAD, CHRIST,<br />
IN ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>There are two references to growing in Ephesians 4:15-16 and two in Colossians 2:19. According to Ephesians 4:15, the believers need to &ldquo;grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.&rdquo; In other words, we must let the life of Christ gradually increase in us. When we let the life of Christ increase in us in a specific matter, we will grow up into the Head, Christ, in that matter.</p>
<p>When we received Christ as our Savior, He entered into us as the Spirit to be our life; this is a glorious fact. However, in our actual daily life, we often are not joined to Christ practically, nor is there an element of Christ&rsquo;s life in our walk. For example, we may think that reading a book or a newspaper is a trivial thing, but if we are willing to learn lessons before the Lord, the Spirit within us will speak concerning this matter. He will ask, &ldquo;Are you reading this book in Me?&rdquo; When considering whether or not to read a book, most people would consider only the content of the book, that is, whether the content is good or bad. The Spirit&rsquo;s concern, however, is whether or not the element of Christ is in our reading. When the Spirit asks such a question, we are exposed as being wholly in ourselves, not in Christ. When such a light comes, we need to repent. Even if a book or newspaper is good, we still need to repent. We do not need to repent because the book or newspaper is bad, but because we did not let the Lord into our reading and did not let the Lord add His element into us. Instead, we were wholly for ourselves and in ourselves.</p>
<p>When we repent in this way, we are repenting for the kingdom of the heavens, because we are acknowledging that we have not been under the ruling of the Lord, who is our Head. If we learn this lesson in such a seemingly trivial thing as reading a book or a newspaper, we will learn to deny ourselves and give the Lord the ground to mingle His element in us. Then we will experience a very practical union with Christ in the matter of reading a book or a newspaper.</p>
<p>In deciding whether or not to do something, people usually pay attention to whether it is good or bad. They believe that they can do anything as long as it is not bad. The Spirit, however, does not ask whether something is good or bad but whether there is an element of Christ in it. The Spirit asks, &ldquo;How much of the element of Christ is in this? Are you doing this in Christ?&rdquo; Once the Spirit asks such questions, we often become inwardly clear that there is not much of the element of Christ in it. Thus, we repent, saying, &ldquo;Lord, even though this is a good thing, it does not have Your element in it.&rdquo; Through this we grow more into the Head, Christ. As a further example, in the matter of clothing, the Spirit often asks, &ldquo;Are you wearing these clothes in Christ? Is the element of Christ in the choice of your clothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In matters related to money, the Spirit often asks, &ldquo;Are you spending this money in Christ? Is the element of Christ in your spending?&rdquo; How money is spent is an important matter in a Christian&rsquo;s life. If we can properly handle the matter of spending money, our condition before the Lord will be quite good. If we need to grow up into the Head in what we read and what we wear, how much more we need to grow up into the Head in our spending of money. I know deep within that we often are unwilling to let the Lord &ldquo;count&rdquo; our money.</p>
<p>From my own experience, I know how difficult it is to let the Lord &ldquo;count&rdquo; our money, that is, to let the Lord have control over our money. Often when I considered the money that I had, a voice within would ask, &ldquo;What would you do if the Lord wanted to count your money right now? Would you let Him count it with you?&rdquo; Inwardly, I often would want the Lord to wait until I had &ldquo;counted&rdquo; it. Thus, in my considerations related to money, I did not have the element of Christ in me.</p>
<p>Let me say more about my experience of weakness related to money. Once, when I was &ldquo;counting&rdquo; my money, the Lord inwardly asked, &ldquo;Do you intend to live off this money for the rest of your life, or will you depend on Me when this money runs out?&rdquo; When this question came, I acknowledged the Lord and said, &ldquo;Lord, at best I can live off this money for three months; in three months I will surely need to depend on You.&rdquo; Then the Lord said, &ldquo;If you will depend on Me in three months, why do you not depend on Me today? The money you are counting will not last forever; it will soon run out. Then you will pray, but what will be your attitude in the prayer?&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s speaking to me was so persistent that I eventually had to say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, come and count with me! Take as much as You want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was afraid of letting the Lord Jesus &ldquo;count&rdquo; the money that I had because I was afraid that the Lord would say, &ldquo;Keep seven hundred but give away the rest.&rdquo; I was afraid of letting the Lord &ldquo;count&rdquo; my money because I did not want Him to control or direct my use of the money. I was wholly outside of Christ, not in Him, in the matter of money; I needed to grow. In the matter of spending money, we also need to experience growth and building up.</p>
<p>When I was serving the Lord in northern China almost twenty years ago, a brother came to me and said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, an elder in a certain denomination is criticizing your speaking very strongly.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I am familiar with this elder. Since he has never come to hear me, how can he be critical?&rdquo; The brother responded, &ldquo;His family and friends have heard you, and they told him about it. Then he began to criticize you.&rdquo; I replied to the brother, &ldquo;Please convey in person to this elder what I am about to say. Tell him that if he allows the Lord Jesus to touch all his money, he will know whether or not I have spoken rightly.&rdquo; From that day forward, I have never heard of this elder speaking a critical word. That word sealed his mouth.</p>
<p>It is not easy to grow into the Head, Christ, in the matter of money. Although we are saved and Christ abides in us, we need great mercy from the Lord in order to grow up into the Head in our actual living and to let Christ have His way in everything. This is the point of Ephesians 4:15. This verse is more than just doctrine. If it is only doctrine to us, it is worthless. As God&rsquo;s children, we must see that everything related to the building up of the church depends on how much of the element of Christ is in us and how much Christ is in our actual living. This is the most basic point related to the building up of the church. If we do not grow up into Christ in our daily living, we cannot expect the church to be built up. If we do not grow up into Christ in all things, at best we will be Christians who fear the Lord, pray regularly, attend meetings, and do not have any major faults in our living. However, in order to take part in the building up of the church, we must have some basic growth and learn to grow up into the Head in all things. <em>All things</em> in verse 15 means great things and small things. We must grow up into Christ in all things and let the element of Christ increase within us.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I learned some practical lessons in this regard at the end of 1933. Until then I had been merely zealous in my love for the Lord, but I had not learned many real lessons. In that year, however, the Lord started to touch many practical things in my living. For example, writing letters was an agony to me because the Lord would touch me concerning my words. Often I had to write a letter as many as eight times. Every time I finished writing, I would read the letter, and the Lord would touch me, as if to say, &ldquo;Is this sentence of Me?&rdquo; When I submitted to this sense from the Lord, I would have to tear up the letter and rewrite it. Therefore, I was quite intimidated concerning writing letters because there was always an inner speaking from the Lord.</p>
<p>We should never regard growing up into the Head in all things as a trivial point. If a brother is outside of Christ and sets Him aside in his writing of letters, or if he is outside of Christ and sets Him aside in the matter of his clothing, how can he be built up? If a sister speaks loosely and reads books and newspapers outside Christ, how can she be expected to be built up in the church? This is not possible. In order for a believer to be built up in the church, he must learn spiritual lessons in every matter, deny himself in every matter, and let Christ participate in every matter. Then the element of God will increase within him. Only such a believer can be built up in the church.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
