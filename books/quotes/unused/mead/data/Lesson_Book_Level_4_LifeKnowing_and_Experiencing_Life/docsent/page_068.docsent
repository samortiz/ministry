   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE FRUIT OF SAVED PERSONS REGENERATED WITH THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we are such fruit-bearing believers in the Christian virtues, the second category of fruit will be borne by us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This second category of fruit is mentioned in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord said that He is the vine tree and we are the branches v. 5 . The branches of the vine tree do not merely bear the fruit of the Christian virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fruit borne by the branches in John 15 denotes the saved persons regenerated with the divine life through the dispensing of the branches v. 16b . This is proved by the requirement that the bearer of this fruit should "go forth'' v. 16a . To bear ethical and moral virtues as fruit does not require us to go forth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But to bear the fruit of persons regenerated through our dispensing of the divine life requires us to go forth to contact and reach people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We Christians should bear both the fruit of virtues and the fruit of regenerated persons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a fruit tree in an orchard does not bear any fruit, the farmer will want to cut it down.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is no beauty in a fruit tree that does not bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How would a branch of a vine look without any grapes on it?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A branch with clusters of grapes on it looks beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to bear not only the fruit of virtues as the beauties of the divine life but also the fruit of solid persons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you are not a person that bears the first category of fruit, the fruit of virtues, you will not be prevailing in the gospel regardless of what way you use.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Your preaching can only be prevailing when you bear the fruit of virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You must be a person that lives by the divine power within you, walking by and with a Holy Person, the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You must be a person living by Christ as your life and walking with the Holy Spirit as your companion to bear much fruit of virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then when you speak Christ in the preaching of the gospel, the second category of fruit will be there, the fruit of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you live in the flesh and the natural life during the day, you will be a "flat tire'' in the evening and will not have the standing before God's enemy to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you are a Christian that lives by Christ and walks with the Spirit, you will be full of virtues, full of beauties.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then when you go to touch sinners, all the demons will be afraid of you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is why the gospel in the mouths of the apostles was prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word of the apostles was weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The same word spoken by us may be light and vain.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, we have to be persons bearing the fruit of the Christian virtues, which are the very expression of the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we are qualified and empowered to speak Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word out of our mouths will be a power to save people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The preaching of the gospel depends upon the person rather than the way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you are not the right person, it does not matter what way you take.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That way will be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>BEARING TWO KINDS OF FRUIT FOR A RICH ENTRANCE INTO THE COMING KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all need to rise up to have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to forget the past, look to the Lord, and tell Him, "Lord, I am here.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I want to have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I want to forget about everything in the past, even the past history of my Christian life and church life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Lord, I realize that You are the divine power within me, energizing me all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Lord, as the Spirit You are my companion living with me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I want to live by You and to walk with You.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I want to forget about everything related to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, involving matters of right or wrong and yes or no. I want to have a clean, purified, and absolutely new start with You.'' We need such a divine beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In simplicity we should take Christ as our divine power, energizing within us, and take Him as the life-giving Spirit, the very companion with whom we should walk all day.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then we will bear the fruit of virtues, expressing the divine attributes to be empowered, energized, and qualified to speak Christ as the gospel to others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our speaking will be powerful and weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Week after week we will see the fruit of solid persons added to the fruit of our virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We will bear not only the fruit of the attributes of God as our virtues but also the fruit of saved, solid persons added to our virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We will be full of fruit in two categories: the category of virtues and the category of solid persons.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need the fruit in these two categories to afford us a rich, bountiful entrance into the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many students in a school graduate, but only a few graduate with a prize or a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we are faithful to bear these two kinds of fruit in this age, we will have a new church life, and we will enjoy the Lord as our reward in the coming kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Questions Life is active and living.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When you got saved you received the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Briefly explain what is the first purpose and issue of the life that God has put in you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Write the portions of the Bible that reveal the two kinds of fruit that the divine life produces.</S>

   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Have you recently shared with someone concerning the Lord?</S>

   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Briefly explain why we must bear fruit.</S>
