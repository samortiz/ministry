   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That His Life May Be Imparted through Us into Others</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 2 Corinthians 4:12 Paul says, So then death operates in us, but life in you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we are under the killing of the Lord s death, His resurrection life is imparted through us into others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The impartation of life into others is always the issue of our suffering the killing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>While we are dying, others are being made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our dying infuses life into them and makes them alive.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For us, it is a matter of being put to death; for them, it is a matter of the impartation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The work of the apostles is the work of death operating in them so that life may operate in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It may not sound pleasant to us to hear of death operating in the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the issue, the result, of this operation of death is wonderful it is life in others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the real work of the new covenant ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not a matter of working; it is a matter of dying.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Lord s recovery we need to die so that life may work in others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, our dying is our working.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord does not need us to accomplish a work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He needs us to die.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we die, life will work in others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We will minister life to others by dying.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The apostles were not followers of a great person but of a small man, Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, instead of being exalted, they were always being put to death so that the life of Jesus could be manifested in their mortal flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Death operated in them so that life might operate in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ s death was always killing them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The killing of the cross results in the manifestation of the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This daily killing is for the release of the divine life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>e. As Vessels to Be Broken</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That the Treasure Within May Be Expressed</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In verse 7 the apostle Paul says, We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We know that the expression earthen vessels refers not merely to our body but to us; we are made of clay and are earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This treasure refers to God and His life, that is, Christ and His life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have this treasure in earthen vessels means that we have Christ in us, that is, in our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In fact, our inner man is Christ; our outer man is we ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, verse 16 says, Though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that while we are being broken by God, Christ is being built up in us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the one hand, Christ is the treasure, and we are the earthen vessels to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the other hand, we need to be broken, consumed, and reduced so that Christ as the treasure can be manifested from within us vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>8-12, 16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After we allow Christ to come into us, we as vessels need to be broken in order that Christ as the treasure might be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>1 As Vessels</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God s shining in our hearts brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But we who contain this treasure are earthen vessels, worthless and fragile.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A priceless treasure is contained in worthless vessels!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This has made the worthless vessels ministers of the new covenant with a priceless ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This has been accomplished by the divine power in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The excellency of the power is surely of God and not out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The ministers of the new covenant were earthen vessels to contain the Christ of glory as the excellent treasure v. 7 . These vessels are like today s camera, into which Christ the figure enters through the flash of God s shining vv.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This treasure, the indwelling Christ, in us, the earthen vessels, is the divine source of the supply for the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is by the excellent power of this treasure that the apostles as the ministers of the new covenant were capable of living a crucified life that the resurrection life of Christ, whom they ministered, might be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, they manifested the truth v. 2 for the shining of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Earthen vessels containing a treasure is a metaphor used to describe the ministers of the new covenant and their ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Second Corinthians 4 leads us into the real experience of Christ s death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are the earthen vessels, yet we have a treasure in us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This demonstrates the excellency of the power of the treasure in death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ s power is not only manifested in resurrection but also in death.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The four Gospels show us how Christ passed through a long journey of death while not being put down by death; the many aspects of death could not restrain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He had the power to overcome death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In death the power of Christ was greatly manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In His resurrection His power was also manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There was no way to subdue Paul because as an earthen vessel he had Christ as the treasure within him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this way, the excellent power of the treasure was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This was not of man but of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We also are vessels to contain Christ as the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Day after day we may express the all-inclusive death of Christ and the resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>How much of this treasure we have in us is indicated by how much we express Christ in His all-inclusive death and resurrection.</S>
