   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MINGLED SPIRIT BEING THE INNER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is one thing to enter into the church, but it is another thing to have the living of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not only do we need to enter into the church; we also need to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Knowing the church enables us to enter into the church, but we need to advance to living the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul s prayer in Ephesians 3 is related to our need to be in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul s second prayer is related to having the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God desires to be glorified in the church, and being glorified is a matter of expression.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we all have the living of the church, God will be expressed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is what it means for God to be glorified in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Having the living of the church is higher and deeper than entering into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Paul s first prayer we see our need for a spirit of wisdom and revelation in order to enter into the church and to know the church 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our spirit is the organ for us to know and enter into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the prayer for us to remain in the church and have the living of the church involves a further step in which our spirit becomes our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, our spirit must become our person, rather than just an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must differentiate between an organ and a person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible tells us clearly that man is of three parts: spirit and soul and body 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our body is on the outside, our soul is in between, and our spirit is our innermost part.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our body enables us to contact the physical world, and our soul enables us to contact the psychological world, but our spirit enables us to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God created our spirit as an organ for us to contact Him, but is our person related to our body, our soul, or our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When a person dies, we often say that he has gone, even though his body is still present.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that our person is not defined by our body; our body is but an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In contrast, the Bible speaks of our soul when it speaks of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, Exodus 1:5 says, All the persons who came forth from the loins of Jacob were seventy persons.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Persons in Hebrew literally means souls.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, our soul is equivalent to our person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Genesis 2:7 says, Jehovah God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, every man is a soul with a body and a spirit as organs.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The soul is the person of every man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, when a man believes in the Lord and receives Him, the Lord becomes life to him in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before believing, man s spirit did not have life; it was merely an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, once the Lord Jesus enters into a man s spirit as life, his spirit is no longer merely an organ but also an inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>DENYING THE SOUL-LIFE AND LIVING BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, there are two persons in every believer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before a believer is saved, his person is in his soul, but after being saved, there is another person in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, there are two persons in every believer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to ask if it is good to have two persons in us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we are a guest in someone s home, we all prefer to be in a room alone rather than to share it with another person.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do not like to share a room with another person, because when there are two persons, there will be two opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even in small matters such as opening or closing a window, it is not easy for two people to be in agreement with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we receive the Lord, it is a blessing, but it is also troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, before we received the Lord Jesus, we could go to a movie whenever we wanted; there was no one in us expressing a different opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, now that the Lord Jesus is in us, He does not always agree with our choices.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>While we are watching a movie, He will trouble us inwardly and give us no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to the Bible, one of the persons within us has been crucified and must be denied.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Romans 6:6 says that our old man, that is, the person in our soul, has been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The old man with his life in our soul has been crucified, and we should not allow him to live.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If he lives, he will do great harm to us and be quite troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even though the person of our soul has been crucified and must be denied, the function of our soul has been preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that the life of the soul needs to be killed, but the faculties of our soul the mind, emotion, and will have to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Being crucified with Christ does not mean that we no longer use our mind or that we no longer express any emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, it means that the corrupted life in our soul, our old man, has been crucified in order for the faculties of the soul to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Formerly, our soul was our person, and our spirit was an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now our spirit must become our person, and our soul must become an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we call, O Lord, we can deny our soul-life and utilize it as an organ to express our renewed mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Husbands and wives often argue with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These arguments come from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, we must call, O Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Calling on the name of the Lord keeps our old man in the tomb so that it cannot come out.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we call on the Lord, we do not have to listen to or live by our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Rather, we can live by our spirit through our continual denial of our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Chinese word for soul is composed of two radicals.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The first radical means devil, and the second radical means speak.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thus, the Chinese word for soul literally means devil speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should not listen to the opinions of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As soon as an opinion rises up in our soul, we should say, Devil, stop talking!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is not a laughing matter.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our fallen soul is actually linked to the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we deny our soul, we are denying the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must be clear concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Formerly, our soul was our person, but today our spirit is our person.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Formerly, the spirit was an organ, but now the soul is an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should not let our soul voice its opinions or take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is to deny the expression of our soul as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, when we need to remember certain things, we can utilize the faculty of our mind as an organ related to memory.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Thus, our soul is no longer our person but merely an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Our spirit is our person today.</S>
