In the Bible we see the record of creation and the history of mankind, the Gentile nations, Israel, and the church
The Bible also says that children should honor their parents and that parents should take proper care of their children
Although you would no longer be able to see, you would still have your life because the kernel within you would not have been damaged
Outwardly he would still be complete, having all his limbs and the other members of his body, but the life within him would be gone
By this we see that neither the arms nor the eyes are as crucial as the heart, because the heart is the kernel of our physical body
Many know theology, perhaps even possessing a doctor's degree in theology, but they have never touched the kernel of the Bible
If you major in history in college, but do not read the Bible, then you do not have an adequate knowledge of history
If you say that the Bible is not a book of doctrine, you are heretical, for the Bible itself says that it is profitable for doctrine
They are simply our servants, and they do not know what the will of God is, much less the mystery of God's will
Since the angels do not know what the mystery of God's will is, we must consult Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians
In chapter one of this Epistle Paul indicates that if we would know the mystery of God's will, we need a spirit of revelation
The economy in the Bible is not a matter of finance; it is a matter of God's administration, God's arrangement, and God's dispensation
It is important to know three things: the mystery of God's will, the mystery of God's economy, and God's eternal purpose
The kernel of the Bible is the mystery of God's will, the mystery of God's economy, and the eternal purpose of God
Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is 'the image of the invisible God,' and 2 Corinthians 4:4 speaks of 'Christ, who is the image of God'
Man was made in the image of God, and the fact that the image of God is Christ indicates that man was made according to Christ
In the first three chapters of Genesis, we have Christ as the image of God, as our life, and as the One who destroys Satan
When he realized this, he began to call on the name of the Lord that he might receive help, supply, strength, and nourishment
In Abel we see man coming back to God, and in Enosh we see man realizing his weakness and beginning to call on the Lord for help
Man had not only returned to God, received help from God, and walked with God; he also reigned over the earth for God
Jacob eventually reigned over Egypt through his son, Joseph, who represents the reigning aspect of Jacob's life
In the first three chapters of Genesis we have Christ as the image of God, as our life, and as the One who destroys Satan
In the following forty-seven chapters we see a shadow, a type, of the church, composed of the saints from Abel through Jacob with Joseph
In the first three chapters of this book we see Christ, and in the last forty-seven chapters we see the church
Now we see not only the tree, the fruit, the skin, the meat, and the shell of the book of Genesis; we also see the kernel
We also should be a Noah, not only walking with God and preparing salvation for ourselves and others, but also reigning for God
Perhaps you may say that you do not want to be a Jacob, for Jacob was a supplanter, a heel-holder, one who deceived nearly everybody
Although you may not desire to be such a person, do not forget that Jacob was eventually transformed into Israel, the prince of God
Many can say that they have called on the name of the Lord, but not many can say that they have been transformed
The issue of the process of transformation through which Jacob passed was the twelve tribes that formed the house of Israel
In the Old Testament there was the house of Israel, and in the New Testament there is the church as God's house
One reason for this is that they have not seen that the church is the issue of these significant persons in the book of Genesis
In order to have the proper church life, we need to be an Abel, an Enosh, an Enoch, a Noah, an Abraham, an Isaac, and a Jacob
If we do, the vision will come to us, and we shall see that the Bible is a book of Christ as life and of the church as our living
In the following messages we shall continue with Exodus and other books of the Old Testament and New Testament
Out of this wonderful Christ there comes into being the church, composed of many Abels, Enoshes, Enochs, Noahs, Abrahams, Isaacs, and Jacobs
Darby capitalizes the word Angel to show that this Angel is not a common angel, but an extraordinary Angel, even Christ Himself
According to verse 6, this Angel says, 'I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'
When the Angel of the Lord came with Moses to visit Israel, this indicated that the Lord came as the Angel and as Moses
Today, we know that Christ has come to us as the Angel of the Lord to deliver us from bondage and as Moses to speak to us
When John the Baptist saw Jesus coming to him, he said, 'Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world'!
The children of Israel ate the flesh of the lamb 'roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs'
In the book of Exodus we see Christ as the delivering Angel, as the speaking Moses, and as the redeeming and nourishing lamb
God buried them all under the flood of water, just as soon as the house of Israel walked through the water as on dry land
The Israelites were not only redeemed from God's judgment; they were also delivered from the bondage of the Egyptians
Christ is the delivering Angel, the speaking Moses, and the redeeming Lamb with the cleansing blood and the nourishing, strengthening life
Corinthians 5:7 and 8 say, 'Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened
The time of Abel, the time of Abraham, and even the time of Jacob were not the right time for God to set up His dwelling place on earth
He had to wait until the house of Israel had come into being, had been delivered out of Egypt, and had been brought to Mount Sinai
Exodus 40:34 says, 'Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle'
If there were twenty-four tabernacles, then the people would be divided into twenty-four sections, one section for each tabernacle
Christians today would probably propose that there should be more than a hundred tabernacles to accommodate this number of people
If we had been there, we probably would have proposed that the tabernacle be a great deal larger, perhaps five hundred feet by fifty feet
If you do not, you will not be able to meet God or to hear God's speaking, because God's presence and His oracle are both in the tabernacle
The outstanding point related to the tabernacle is not its greatness-it is the fact that God's presence and glory are there
The content of this church is the presence of God, the glory of God, the speaking of God, the light of God, and the life supply of God
When we visited the great cathedrals with their high towers, we found that there was nothing there except darkness and emptiness
If you compare the first chapter of Exodus with the last chapter, you will see a great difference between them
Before we were saved and built up into the church, we were in Egypt, under bondage, slavery, suffering, and affliction
If we have been built up as God's tabernacle, then whenever we come together in Christ and with Christ, God will be present
Wherever we are, we shall be the unique tabernacle, the dwelling place of God on earth, to express Christ and to satisfy God
At the end of the book of Revelation we see that New Jerusalem, God's eternal habitation, comes down out of heaven to the new earth
God's dwelling place on earth is a corporate man redeemed by God, indwelt by God, saturated with God, and one with God
They needed to be redeemed from God's judgment, delivered from bondage in Egypt, and reconstituted with a pleasant-smelling element
Christ came into their situation as the delivering Angel as the speaking Moses as the redeeming Lamb and as the nourishing unleavened bread
In Exodus 3:6 the Angel said, 'I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'
The God of Abraham refers to the Father; the God of Isaac, to the Son; and the God of Jacob, to the Holy Spirit
His blood redeems us from God's judgment, and His life is the nourishment, giving us the energy to escape from Egypt
When we crossed the Red Sea in baptism, all the worldly forces, the Egyptian armies, were buried in the baptistry
Although the children of Israel had eaten the lamb and the unleavened bread, they still needed to take the heavenly element into them
After the children of Israel were redeemed from Gods judgment and delivered from Egyptian bondage they were transformed by eating the manna
For God's glory to come down means that God Himself comes down to earth to dwell in His habitation for His expression
Out of the enjoyment of Christ, the church comes into being to fulfill God's purpose, that is, to express God and fully satisfy Him
God did not want just a movable tabernacle in the wilderness; He needed an established temple in the good land
Although the tabernacle we see in the last chapter of Exodus was good, it was temporary; it was not established
Because they were so much in themselves, they had to cross the water another time so that their old man could be buried
Both during pleasant times on the mountaintops and during sorrowful times in the valleys, there is an abundance of water
In Christ as our good land there are also many types of food: wheat, barley, figs, vines, olives, and pomegranates
He is also the oil, signifying the fullness of the Holy Spirit, and the pomegranate, signifying the expression of the riches of life
He raised up David, an excellent fighter, to defeat the enemy and gain the ground for the building of the temple
In order to have such an established church, we must take Christ, not only as the manna, but also as the good land
Christ is the Angel, Moses, the Lamb, the unleavened bread, the manna, and the good land, including water, food, cattle, and minerals
Are the saints in your locality stones iron and brass or are they wafers that are sweet delicious tender and kind but not at all solid
If we would have the church as the temple, we need to experience Christ as stone, iron, and brass, not simply as manna
Whether the church is the tabernacle or the temple, the function, the foundation, and the nature are all the same
The first station is at the end of Genesis, the second is at the end of Exodus, and the third is the building of the temple in 1 Kings
They are strong to stand against the enemy, to express God, to be His dwelling place on earth, and to satisfy the desire of His heart
We were under the condemnation of Gods judgment we were under the bondage of the world and we were saturated with the odor of worldly garlic
When we were in Egypt, we had to eat Him as the Lamb because we were under God's judgment and were held in bondage to the world
Before you were saved, you might have enjoyed exchanging words with your husband and boasting to a friend concerning how you subdued him
A few days later, you tried to exchange words with your husband again, but this time you were not able to speak
When he asked you what was wrong, you said that there was nothing wrong and encouraged him simply to go to work
No longer are we in Egypt under God's condemnation and the world's slavery; no longer are we saturated with the odor of garlic
Although we have been redeemed, delivered, cleansed, and purified, all this is negative; we do not yet have anything positive
We need to eat the heavenly manna and drink the living water so that something heavenly and living might be constituted into us
When the heavenly element of manna is constituted into our being, we become qualified to be God's dwelling place on earth
When the saints from Germany came to Los Angeles several years ago, they were not the temple; rather, they were the tabernacle
Some in the church are eating the Lamb, others are eating the manna, and still others are eating the rich produce of the good land
We have been put into the good land of Christ, and now we are the plants growing in this land which is everything to us
Pomegranates signify the expression of the riches of the life of Christ, and the olive oil, the fullness of the Holy Spirit
Deuteronomy 8:9 says the good land is also 'a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass'
When the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they had the tabernacle, but they did not have the kingdom
There was no way the kingdom could be established with the tabernacle because the Israelites did not have the stone, the iron, or the brass
Now is the time to fight the battle against religion and to build up the temple for the establishment of God's kingdom
In your Christian life, the eating of Christ must progress from the Lamb and the manna to the solid food of the good land
Oh, we need stones, iron, and brass to build up the temple, to establish the kingdom, to fight the battle, and to defeat the enemy!
As His people eat the solid food and take in the minerals that make them stones, iron, and brass, God has His kingdom
In order to have all this, we must proceed to the highest eating, the eating of the solid food with the minerals
If you want to know how to eat the solid food, you need to read the whole book of Leviticus, a book that is not easily understood
Sometimes in morning watch we may till the ground and sow the seed; at other times we may water the seed or cultivate the soil
We must till the ground, remove the weeds, cultivate the soil, water the seeds, and even kill the damaging bugs and snails
In His salvation God also charged man to eat, this time to eat the lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs
By eating Christ as the Lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs, we are redeemed, delivered, and purified
After we have been redeemed from God's judgment and delivered from the bondage to the world, we must journey through the wilderness
In order for God's purpose to be accomplished, He charged the children of Israel to eat manna as they were journeying in the wilderness
The children of Israel were told to eat before the Lord in the place which the Lord had chosen out of all their tribes to put His name there
When the children of Israel were about to enter the good land, God commanded them to take care of their eating
The Christ we eat in this last stage must be greater than the Lamb or the manna; He must be the rich produce of the good land
Like a large family, the church should offer three diets: one for the babies, one for the strong, and one for the old ones
The Lord commanded that, after the children of Israel had entered into the land, they worship Him in the place He had chosen
They were to worship Him, not by bowing down before Him, but by eating before Him the choice portion of the produce of the land
If we are filled with the riches of Christ, we shall not be able to wait for the scheduled time of the meeting
When we have these minerals, we are qualified to build the temple, to defeat the enemy, and to bring in the kingdom
In this message we have seen the general matter of laboring on Christ and experiencing Him in our daily living
If we do not know how to allegorize the Bible, it will be a closed book to us, for the Bible is full of allegories
If you want someone to know what you look like, do not write many letters describing yourself-send him a picture
Christ did not have the poisonous nature of the serpent; nevertheless, He was crucified in the form of a serpent
If we did not have these three allegories, it would be very difficult to adequately understand the death of Christ
Although in eternity Christ was the unlimited God, unlimited both in space and in time, one day He was incarnated and became limited
Although the Lord is the eternal, infinite, unlimited God, He lived as a man, limited even in the matter of time
When His brothers in the flesh encouraged Him to go into Judea, Jesus said, 'My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready'
Although the young people may be free as the birds in the air, they experience limitations when they get married
After they get married and experience Christ in their limitations, the limited Jesus will begin to grow in them as wheat
Bread may be the major food on the table, but we still need some marmalade or jam to put on the bread to make it sweet
We have pomegranates, signifying the expression of the riches of life, and olives, signifying the fullness of the Spirit
With the limited Jesus and the unlimited Christ we have joy, satisfaction, the riches of life, and the fullness of the Spirit
When we eat Christ as the solid food, we are no longer wafers; we are stones, iron, and brass for God's temple and for God's kingdom
Although the seed and the land have been given, and although the rain has been promised, there will be no harvest unless we work the land
It is the last stage of eating, the eating of the solid food in the good land, that constitutes the genuine worship of God
According to our natural concept, once we have the harvest, we may eat it in any way, at any place, and at any time we choose
According to the divine revelation in the Bible, there are some restrictions pertaining to the eating of the produce of the good land
Some may say that because these restrictions are an Old Testament matter, they have nothing to do with us, the New Testament believers
According to Paul's allegorization, the crossing of the Red Sea was baptism, and both the manna and the rock were Christ
The falling away of Israel into Babylon was a type, an allegory, of the fallen church, called the great Babylon
If the children of Israel had eaten the top tenth of the harvest in any other place it would have been a serious sin in the eyes of the Lord
No matter in what region an Israelite lived, he had to set aside the top tenth of his harvest and bring it at the set time to Jerusalem
If there had not been this place of unity, those in the north would have said, 'It is too far to go down to Jerusalem to worship
Suppose the tribe of Naphtali said, 'Let us establish our own center,' and the tribe of Dan said, 'We don't like those in Naphtali
Although they might travel to Jerusalem by different routes, they had to approach Mount Zion by the same pathway
As they were ascending Mount Zion they had to sing Psalm 133 Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!
If after a period of time he is no longer happy with those in that group, he will look around for a third group
When after a few years those in that group are no longer happy with one another, some will start a meeting on the next street
Consider again the Lord's regulation regarding coming to His chosen place to worship Him with the top tenth of the harvest
These dear Christians do not like to meet with other Christians who have meetings that do not fit their concept
Whether some saints are noisy or speak in tongues, they are brothers in the Lord, and we must be one with them
Our attitude toward all believers should be that we care only for Christ and that we love them because Christ is in them
Recently, by the Lord's grace, we have put out the life-studies of various books, including Genesis, John, Romans, Hebrews, and Revelation
There is no need to say that most Christians do not have the top portion of the harvest; they do not even have the harvest
We have seen that the top tenth of the harvest had to be kept separate, brought to the unique worship center, and enjoyed there with God
No matter how rich is the enjoyment of the ninety percent, it cannot compare with the enjoyment of the top ten percent
Although the brothers and sisters may have their Bibles and hymnals, they have no harvest of Christ in the spirit
What a wonderful meeting it is when the brothers and sisters stand up one by one to testify of their experience of Christ!
Although each Israelite might not have had very much, there must have been a heap of firstfruits when all the tithes were put together
Long testimonies filled with details about your personal history will simply put the brothers and sisters to sleep
In order to give as many as possible the opportunity to testify, the elders decided to limit each testimony to twenty seconds
Apparently the teaching that we must bear the cross and sacrifice for others is scriptural; actually it is mixed up with a natural concept
In their living rooms they were accustomed to hanging a picture showing the character for patience printed in a hundred different ways
In saying that married life exposes your lack of patience you are not being a Christian you are being a member of the Chinese Chang family
The pastor opens his Bible to Ephesians 525 which says Husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it
When we come to the place of unity with our harvest of Christ, we must function by releasing our spirit to share Christ with others
Ezekiel 8:9-16 reveals that the temple was filled with idols and that the elders even took the lead to worship idols
They changed the name of the sun god to Jesus and claimed that December twenty-fifth was the birthday of the Lord Jesus
Ezekiel 10:18 says, 'Then the glory of the Lord departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim'
The Catholic Church, the mother of the prostitutes, is the great prostitute, and all the other Babylonian groups are her daughters
The temple was destroyed, and all its vessels were carried away to Babylon and placed in the temple of Nebuchadnezzar's idols
At a certain time in church history, Babylonianism came into the church, destroyed it, and carried away its contents
Today there are many who have performed some work for God, but none of them is willing to go back to Jerusalem
As long as we have the Bible, preach the gospel, meet together, help others grow and seek the Lord, everything is all right
It makes no difference whether you are in the Catholic Church, the denominations, the free groups, or in your own home
Forget your troublesome mentality, turn to your spirit, and call upon the name of the Lord Jesus from deep within
They went back bringing with them the vessels of the house of the Lord which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem and had put
When we return to Jerusalem and lay the foundation for the temple, the foundation of the recovery, we have something worth shouting about
In the Bible there are two lines that run parallel to each other: the line of Babylon and the line of Jerusalem
Babylon begins in Genesis 11 and runs throughout the whole Bible until it reaches its consummation in Revelation 17 and 18
In the first mention of Babylon , we see that Babel caused division and that out of this division came confusion
Since the time of Babel, the people created by God for the fulfillment of His purpose have been divided and are in a state of confusion
History records that in Babel, built by Nimrod and his father, names of idols were on the bricks used to build the city
When Nebuchadnezzar carried away the vessels from the temple of God and brought them to Babylon, he put them into the temple of his idols
Many Christians have been in the garlic room so long they can no longer sense the odor of garlic that is all around them
If you apply these two principles to today's Christianity, you will see that the situation of Christianity is exactly Babylonian
Jesus answered, 'An hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father
Satan's strategy in doing this is to draw us out of the spirit and into the mind so that we shall argue with one another
One says, 'I am a Presbyterian,' another says, 'I am a Lutheran,' and yet another says, 'I am an Episcopalian'
The only way to be saved from this kind of Babylonianism is to turn to the spirit, where there is unity, and care only for Christ
We need to learn how to enjoy Christ, how to eat Him, how to offer Him to God, and how to share Him with others
Those who insist on short hair will have a short-hair church, and those who insist on long hair will have a long-hair church
Under the leadership of Antichrist, these ten kings will hate the prostitute, make her naked, eat her flesh, and burn her thoroughly
The words 'and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the power of her luxury' refer to material Babylon, which makes people rich
The Babylon in the Old Testament was the literal Babylon, and the Babylon in the New Testament is the symbolic Babylon
In the eyes of the Lord, the Roman Catholic Church is religious Babylon, and the city of Rome is material Babylon
Although in this family there are the mother and the daughters, there is no husband, because fornicators do not have a proper husband
We have seen that the constitution of the mother is division with confusion and idolatry; the constitution of her daughters is the same
According to Numbers 25, when the Moabites induced the children of Israel to commit fornication, the Israelites fell into idolatry also
When Solomon committed fornication by taking hundreds of wives and concubines, 'his wives turned away his heart after other gods'
The church in Thyatira, a prefigure of the Roman Catholic Church, was involved with both fornication and idolatry
In the eyes of the Lord every denomination commits fornication because it takes a name other than the name of Jesus Christ
Those who are still in division and confusion and who commit fornication are part of the daughters of the prostitute
Because they are in darkness, they can be involved with division, confusion, and fornication without having any consciousness of it
After reading this message, you will not be able to say that you are not clear about division, confusion, fornication, and idolatry
We love all Christian brothers no matter whether they are Presbyterian, Baptist, Lutheran, Methodist, or Episcopalian
We embrace those who speak in tongues and those who do not, those who wear long hair and those who have short hair
Gradually, as we grow in Christ and Christ grows in us, we become more involved with Christ and we become stronger
Eventually, however, in the church life, you become more involved with Christ, and Christ is wrought into your being
When we enter into the New Jerusalem, we shall no longer be balls of cotton or pieces of wood; we all shall be precious stones
We shall certainly keep them, but keep them in the hope that they will daily and gradually change from cotton to wood and from wood to stone
The Lord Himself is the foundation stone, the cornerstone, and the topstone, and we also must be living stones
It is possible to have the foundation stone without the topstone, but not to have the topstone without the foundation stone
In the New Jerusalem not only will there be no wood; all the stones will be precious stones, not ordinary stones
With the first stage of Gods building the tabernacle there were gold and wood but in the consummation there will be gold and precious stone
Formerly, a certain brother was altogether wood, but today he is sixty percent stone and just forty percent wood
When this brother enters the New Jerusalem, he will be one hundred percent stone, and that stone will be precious stone
Revelation 5:6 indicates that Christ is the Lamb with seven eyes, and Zechariah 3:9 indicates that He is the stone with seven eyes
Regarding Christ as the stone, there are three main aspects: the foundation stone, the cornerstone, and the topstone, the capstone
Between the foundation and the capstone there is the cornerstone that joins the wall and supports the topstone
As the stone for Gods building Christ is not only the foundation the corner and the top but also the One who is increasing and producing
In this building Christ is the foundation stone, the cornerstone, the topstone, and the living stone for the increase
Gradually, after the laying of the foundation, you began to experience Christ as the cornerstone, as the One who joins the building together
Although you may have Christ as the foundation stone and the cornerstone, you will eventually realize that you are still in the open air
The saints in the church in Stuttgart should be encouraged, for the church in their locality has a certain amount of beauty
In your dream may you see the foundation stone, the cornerstone, and the topstone with its beautiful engraving
If you go through the Bible this way, it will take a long time to complete even the first several verses of the first chapter of Genesis
The way to know the Bible is to first have a bird's-eye view and see the kernel of the Bible, which is Christ and the church
In the first three chapters of Genesis, we have Christ, and in the remaining forty-seven chapters, we see the church
In Exodus we have the tabernacle; in 1 Kings, the temple; and in Ezra, Haggai, and Zechariah, the rebuilt temple
Throughout the centuries, there have been many debates concerning the Person of Christ, especially concerning His divinity
Although the unbelieving Jews refuse to admit that Christ is God, we believe that He is God because the Bible says so
Hebrews 1:10 says, 'You in the beginning, Lord, have founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands'
As we all know, the child was Jesus born in the manger at Bethlehem, and the Son is the Son of God given to us
Throughout the centuries, the church has always said that the Son is the Son and that the Father is the Father
If your feet are too big for your shoes, you should not cut your feet to match your shoes; you should buy a new pair of shoes
Those who neglect the Scripture and approach such questions with confidence in their own mental power are the teachers of God not His pupils
The Bible says that this God is the Father the Son and the Spirit and we say Hallelujah our God is the Father the Son and the Spirit
Christianity, however, has deviated both from the Lord and from the living Word and has become a religion of doctrine
Most Christians have the Lord Jesus only as their Redeemer and Savior; they do not have Christ as their everything
In the Bible Luther saw the matter of justification by faith, which was absolutely a contrast to the teaching of Catholicism
Luther fought for justification by faith, the battle was won, and justification by faith was firmly established
As we have seen, the tabernacle comes out of the eating of the manna, that is, out of the experience of Christ
If you enjoy and experience Christ in the morning, you will desire to meet with other Christians in the evening
John 2:23 says, 'Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: but he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also'
One day, as the Lord Jesus was speaking about the Father, Philip said to Him, 'Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us'
If He had been born of a human father, He would have had not only the human nature, but also the sinful nature
As the Mediator, Christ is the Executor in resurrection of the new covenant, the new testament, which He bequeathed to us by His death
Christ with all the foregoing qualifications is our Shepherd today, taking care of God's flock, which is the church
How good it is to experience Christ in His divinity as God, the Creator, the Lord, Jehovah, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Due to the different teachings and opinions, the argument regarding the Person of Christ has gone on and on, even until today
If we follow a teaching regarding Christ's Person that is not according to the Bible, we shall be in difficulty
If instead of becoming living, you are deadened, this indicates that you did not receive life; rather, you received death
In chapter one of the Gospel of John we have Christ as the tabernacle; in chapter two we see Him as the temple
In John 3:14 the Lord said to Nicodemus, 'As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up'
After you realize that this temptation is coming from Satan, do not be afraid of your temper, and do not try to overcome it
John 12:24 reveals that Christ fell into the earth as a grain of wheat and died so that He might bring forth many grains
For our past, Christ is our righteousness; for our present, He is our sanctification; and for our future, He is redemption
Because He is the first letter, the Alpha, and the last letter, the Omega, He is certainly all the letters in between
We must learn how to eat all the aspects of Christ revealed in the Gospel of John, 1 Corinthians, and the other books of the Bible
We all must learn to call upon His name, for the riches of Christ are made available for our enjoyment through our calling on Him
We have also seen various aspects of Christ in His humanity, such as the Prophet, the Priest, the King, the Apostle, and the Bridegroom
Although the church life in the Lord's recovery is much better than anything in Christianity, it is still not that high
Although there are thousands of Christians in these cities, there is no church like the one described in Matthew 16
We admit that not even the church in the Lord's recovery is fully built yet; we are still in the initial stage
He will keep on building until the church fully becomes the kingdom of heaven possessing the authority of God to defeat the power of Satan
When that day comes, the churches will be ready for the rapture; they will be ready to be taken by the Lord as His Bride
After they have been discipled, they must be baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
In Christianity a pastor may baptize a new convert either by sprinkling a few drops of water upon him or by immersing him
Offended, he rebuked John, saying, 'John, don't you know that today is Friday and that you are not allowed to eat meat?
Many Christians know what took place on the day of Pentecost, but they do not know what happened on the day of the Lord's resurrection
They do not know that on the day of His resurrection the Lord Jesus breathed Himself as the Spirit of life into His disciples
Fifty days earlier than Pentecost, the Lord breathed the Spirit into the disciples, and they received the Spirit of life
The only way one hundred and twenty believers could pray in one accord for ten days was to have Christ as the life-giving Spirit within them
Although the disciples had the Spirit of life within them, they did not yet have the Spirit of power upon them
On the day of resurrection, the disciples received the life of resurrection, for they received the Spirit of life
On the day of Pentecost the disciples had both the Spirit of life within them and the Spirit of power upon them
It was a matter of a group of believers being filled with the Spirit within and immersed into the Spirit without
That church was the kingdom of heaven; it had the authority of God and was able to overcome the power of Satan
In order for this to take place, we all must be filled with the Spirit of life and immersed into the Spirit of power
These are the people of the church, the people of the kingdom, those who have the power and authority of God to overcome the power of Satan
Although we all need to be strengthened in our spirit, in our inner man, the natural strength of our mind needs to be reduced
If you sense that you have little of Him in your spirit, you should pray that He would strengthen your inner man
The more you say, 'O Lord Jesus,' the more Christ will come into you, spread into your heart, and take it over
We shall not simply have Christ in our spirit, but that He will make His home in our heart and take over our entire being
Whenever we baptize believers into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, we are placing them into the Triune God
After entering the room where the disciples were gathered, He breathed into them and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
The Lord Himself was actually the very breath, the pneuma, that He breathed into His disciples after His resurrection
After the Lord breathes Himself out as the Spirit of life and we breathe Him in as the reality of life, He becomes our content
No matter how pure, valuable, and beautiful it may be, it cannot be constituted into you, because it does not contain your life
We are human beings, but in our humanity we have the constitution of the Triune God, for He has been wrought, constituted, into us
When the Lord breathed Himself into the disciples, they were impregnated with the church, but the church had not yet been delivered
Fifty days later, on the day of Pentecost, the ascended Christ on the throne poured Himself out upon the disciples
Following that, in the book of Acts the Lord gave us a pattern by which we can clearly see how He produces and builds His church
Through the record of the four Gospels, we see how the Lord brought them back to God and also baptized them into God
By the time of the Lord's resurrection, this one hundred twenty had been brought back to God and had been baptized into God
Although all Christians see that Christ in the flesh was the last Adam, not many see that in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit
As those who had been brought back to God and baptized into Him, they were ready to receive the resurrected Christ into them
On the day of His resurrection the resurrected Christ came as the life-giving Spirit and breathed Himself into them
The resurrected Christ as the life-giving pneuma is the building element, the building substance, for God's house
Many Christians have the mistaken concept that before the day of Pentecost the Spirit had not come to the believers
According to Acts chapter one, before the day of Pentecost the one hundred twenty prayed in one accord for ten days
On the day of Pentecost, the ascended Christ on the throne poured Himself out as the Spirit of power upon these one hundred twenty believers
They had the resurrected Christ as their inward content, and they had the ascended Christ as their outward equipment
Neither is it a group of believers sighing and groaning about their condition and trying to make themselves holy and righteous
Are you one who does not pray, sing, or shout, but who constantly sighs, groans, and tries to become holy, clean, and pure?
No matter how large a certain brother may be today, when he was born, he probably weighed less than ten pounds
How did a tall and heavy brother grow from being less than ten pounds at birth to being more than two hundred pounds today?
By eating all these riches over a period of many years, he gradually gained weight and grew to be large in stature
There is hardly any reality of the church in Christianity today because there is very little enjoyment of Christ
They might have had the knowledge of the Bible, but they did not have much of Christ digested and assimilated into their being
Although you may be in the Triune God, may have Christ in you, and may have Christ upon you, you may still be immature
As the Body, the church needs Christ as life; and as the new man, the church needs Christ not only as life, but also as the person
When such difficulties arise, most Christians would say that they need to trust in Christ and look to Him for help
Most Christian teachers say that Christ died on the cross to deal with our sins, the world, the flesh, and the old man
The Jews keep the Sabbath and do not eat swine, but the Gentiles do not keep the Sabbath and they do eat swine
His ordinance concerning quietness in the meetings separates him from those Christians who enjoy praising the Lord and shouting
One group was in favor of the organ, but not the piano, and the other group favored the piano, but not the organ
In 1963 in Los Angeles the leaders of at least three particular groups came together with the desire to practice the church life
When we came together, those from the Pentecostal background still cared only for speaking in tongues and playing the tambourines
Those from the Brethren background looked down upon those who spoke in tongues and did everything possible to control the meeting
Some, turning the question to me, have asked, 'Don't you have pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord'?
Throughout the years, saints from various backgrounds have come to our meetings and tried to convince us to take their way
If you are not happy with the practice of pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord in the meetings, then do not do it
A very clear word is given in Romans 14:2 and 3: 'One believes that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables
Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats, for God has received him'
In this matter our mentality does not work, for the more you think about the mystery, the more you will be in darkness
In other words, it reveals that our natural mind has become a spiritual mind, for in our mind there is the spirit
Whenever you turn to the spirit, you find yourself on the top of a mountain where you hear the singing of birds and see the leaping of hinds
Both the seven lampstands and the New Jerusalem refer to God's building, the church, the eternal habitation of God
If we would see Christ, we must be in the churches and among the churches, because Christ is walking in the midst of the churches
Although you may have read the book of Revelation many times, you may have never seen the churches in this book
We were with other Christians, but deep within we realized that that gathering of Christians was not the church
If you are not in one of the churches, you are not in the church, no matter how much you talk about the church
In the past some dear friends tried their best to argue with me, saying, 'Brother Lee, you claim that you are the church
On the one hand, they said that the name meant nothing; on the other hand, they said that they could not drop their names
The head of the Church of England is the Queen, and every British subject is considered a member of the Church of England
At the end of one of the meetings, my host asked me, 'Brother Lee, why do you call yourselves the church in Los Angeles'?
If we, the small number who want to remain in the church, do not call ourselves the church, then what would you call us?
If even a small number would take the standing of the church in Rome, there would be a genuine local church there
Do you think it is possible to bring all the true believers in the Catholic Church living in Rome back to the church?
Although many Christians are waiting for the Lord to come back, He is waiting for the building up of His churches
Certainly no bridegroom would come, stand, and wait for his bride until he was assured that she was prepared and adorned for him
In order to overcome the present situation of Christianity, we must answer the Lord's call and offer ourselves to Him
In the midst of the degradation of Christianity, we must eat Jesus as the tree of life and as the hidden manna, and enjoy Him as a feast
In Revelation 2:17 not only did the Lord speak of the hidden manna; He also said that He would give the over-comer a white stone
They have been poisoned, deceived, and distracted from the proper church life by the teachings they received in the past
Do not have an appetite for teachings, for you may not have the discernment to determine which are correct and which are false
At the end of the Bible there are two consummations, one represented by a city and the other represented by a lake
Everything that is not of God, that is against God, or that is considered by God as trash will go into the lake of fire
In the first two chapters of the Bible we see the old heaven, the old earth, the old garden, Adam, and the tree of life
In the last two chapters of the Bible we see the new heaven, the new earth, and the city with the tree of life
In Genesis 1:14-18 we see that God created the light-bearers, the sun, the moon, and the stars, on the fourth day
When you came into the church life, did you not have the sense that the environment and the atmosphere were absolutely new?
The day we entered into the church life, the heavens, the earth, the atmosphere, and the environment all became new
The Gospel of John firstly tells us that God was in the beginning, then that this very God became flesh to be the Lamb
In New Jerusalem we have God in the Lamb, and out of this redeeming God flows the river of life, the life-giving Spirit
Oh, our God is in the redeeming Lamb, flowing out as the river of life to dispense His life into every part of the city
When this flow of the life-giving Spirit reaches us and gets into us, we receive the life supply and are nourished
The river of life flows out of the throne and spirals down the mountain, eventually reaching all twelve gates on each of the four sides
Every part of the city receives the life supply, because the tree of life grows in the river and the river reaches every part of the city
The twelve tribes of Israel represent the Old Testament saints, and the twelve Apostles represent the New Testament saints
The fact that the New Jerusalem is a golden city signifies that the entire city is constituted with the nature of God
In John 3:3 and 5 the Lord Jesus told Nicodemus that unless a man was born again he could not enter into the kingdom of God
In New Jerusalem we have regeneration, a holy walk, transformation, building, the appearance of God, and the full manifestation of God
A number of times we have told the Lord that we do not agree with certain events taking place in the political sphere
We have life light regeneration the holy walk transformation building the appearance of God the manifestation of God and the divine reign
The birth of the spirit in John 3:6 is not the first birth, the natural birth; it is the second birth, the spiritual birth
The first birth, from our parents, is the birth in the flesh; the second birth, from God, is the birth in our spirit
Anyone who has not experienced the second birth can be born of the Spirit by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus
Often, after being satisfied with food which fills our physical stomach, we are still hungry in our spirit, our spiritual stomach
Forget about exercising your mind to contact God, and exercise your spirit from deep within, calling, 'O Lord!
We live by the divine Spirit in our spirit by enjoying the divine Spirit through our spirit and by walking in our spirit in our daily living
After completing the work of redemption, in resurrection He took the second step to become the life-giving Spirit
Some may still argue and say, 'Now that we are walking in the presence of God, don't we need to cross out ourselves'?
Some may say, 'In Brother Nee's book, The Normal Christian Life, there is a chapter telling us to reckon ourselves dead
There's a little word the Lord has giv'n For our help in hour of need: Let us reckon ourselves to be dead to sin, To be dead and dead indeed
Let us reckon, reckon, reckon, Let us reckon, rather than feel; Let us be true to the reckoning, And He will make it real
It is not a matter of trying to bear the cross or to reckon ourselves dead; it is a matter of walking in the spirit
The killing element destroys the germs in our blood, and the nourishing element supplies our being with nutrients
In Romans 8:4 Paul said that when we walk according to the spirit, we spontaneously fulfill the righteous requirements of the law
