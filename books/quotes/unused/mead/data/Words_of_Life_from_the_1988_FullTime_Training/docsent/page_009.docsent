   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>HUMAN PHILOSOPHY BEING</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>TO LIVE THROUGH SUFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Human philosophy, including the ancient Greek philosophy and the Chinese Confucian philosophy, are confined to teachings concerning the refining or improving of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, there have been many instances of asceticism and self-infliction.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Similarly, various kinds of religions such as Buddhism and Catholicism also stress this kind of practice.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is because from man s viewpoint, human beings are degraded, having sinful lusts, and the only way of salvation is to live through suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Word of God shows us that the fall of man began with the transgression of Adam and Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They ate the fruit forbidden by God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a result, sin came in and brought the whole human race into degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Through this, Satan s evil nature and corrupted elements entered into man s constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From that time on, there has been an evil constituent or element within man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now there are two kinds of elements within the man God created: one is the good element which came from God s creation and bears God s image; the other is the evil element which came out of the evil one Satan and bears the evil nature of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Within man there is not only the good created by God but also the sin injected by Satan Rom 7:17, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This sin is also called evil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is sin itself and is the transfiguration of Satan within man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are only two sources in the universe; one is God and the other is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is good Matt 19:17 and Satan is evil Rom 7:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Due to the fall of man, the evil nature of Satan was injected into the good man created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, there are two kinds of nature within the fallen man: the good nature and the evil nature.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was why within Chinese Confucianism there were those who advocated man s inherent good nature and those who advocated man s inherent evil nature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, according to the biblical view, there is a basis for both schools because both good and evil are within man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many philosophers throughout the ages came up with the thought of asceticism through their observation and realization of fallen mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They considered that the evil lusts within man could be eliminated only through the exercise of self-suppression.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, in their consideration only suffering could restrain man s evil and cause him to behave, to do good, and to be delivered from the sorrows of life.</S>
