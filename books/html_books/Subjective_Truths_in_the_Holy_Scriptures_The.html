We are all happy because at this time we have representatives from the churches in all the six continents of the world. We all have to praise Him that there are brothers even from Africa. It is not a small thing that we are meeting here together. We are not only joyful in our heart but also leaping in our spirit because the Lord has brought us to be here together from different localities, nations, and tongues all over the earth. This is not merely a doctrine to us; rather, it is a reality. Politicians, educators, and other professionals in the world have tried their best to unite the peoples of the world, yet they have never succeeded. Today in Christ we do not have to do anything, yet people from the six continents are gathered in one place. Hallelujah! The first thing I want to do before the Lord in this meeting is to point out the representatives from each continent.<h2 class=head1>THE ORIGIN OF THE BURDEN OF THESE MESSAGES</h2><p>Since the time the brothers decided to have this conference, I have been seeking the Lord unceasingly as to what He wants to speak at this time. These past few months I have been looking to the Lord with prayers and seeking to know what the Lord wants to say to all of His churches on the earth at this time. However, up to two weeks ago I was still unclear. Then thirteen days ago, on the Lord&#8217;s Day, something happened. Near the place where the church in Anaheim is located, there is a Pentecostal group with a comparatively large congregation. This group, which has been actively opposing the Lord&#8217;s recovery in these few years, may be considered the birthplace, the source, of the opposition to the Lord&#8217;s recovery on the whole earth today. They have tried their best to destroy the Lord&#8217;s recovery by their writings and actions. This is especially because since the Lord&#8217;s church came to the city of Anaheim, our number has grown quite much within merely two to three years, and also because we built a meeting hall that in America can be regarded as noteworthy. Both these factors have virtually become a threat to them; thus, they oppose us actively. Thirteen days ago, on a Lord&#8217;s Day evening, they spent two and a half hours in a conference specifically to propagandize against us. Over five hundred brothers and sisters among us attended that meeting and recorded their words of opposition against us in those two and a half hours. The next morning the co-workers came together and wrote down the opposing words from their tapes and looked at the points that were against us. Immediately ten of the brothers picked up the burden to take the sixteen points opposing us and write a refutation for each one. These were published in a newspaper. I was not among the ten brothers, and there was no need for me to speak anything. Praise the Lord! However, from what the brothers were relating and then writing about, I became clear within as to what to speak in this conference. It was through this opposition that the Lord told me what He wants to speak in this conference.<p>Why? It is because every single point of their opposing words in those two and a half hours concerns our subjective experience. We say, &#8220;God and man are mingled,&#8221; but they say, &#8220;This is heresy. God is God, and man is man. How can you say that God and man are mingled? Man is too small and too low. How can man be mingled with God? By saying this, you are advocating that man can evolve into God.&#8221; They use the term evolution-evolving into God. This is an extremely blasphemous word. They say, &#8220;The local church teaches this heresy, saying that man can be uplifted, can progress, and can even evolve into God.&#8221; Brothers and sisters, do you realize that this is an extremely great opposition and that it is a great contending against the truth? According to the truth, can man be mingled with God? Does the mingling of man with God mean that lowly man evolves and evolves until one day he becomes God? The opposers say, &#8220;This Witness Lee came from China to tell us that we will evolve into God. Isn&#8217;t this heresy?&#8221; They speak in such a seemingly plausible way.<p>Nonetheless, this kind of opposing word is just a &#8220;paper tiger&#8221; that can be flattened by a single strike. We have to say that it is not that we are evolving into God, but it is God who humbled Himself to come into our spirit. John 1:1 and 14 say, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word,...and the Word was God....And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory...), full of grace and reality.&#8221; This is His first step. Then verse 12 says, &#8220;But as many as received Him,...those who believe into His name.&#8221; The receiving here is not like having a very loving heart to receive brothers and sisters hospitably into your home. Do you receive the Lord Jesus like this? No. Here, to receive simply means to take in.<p>What is it to receive? I would like to give you a demonstration. For example, I may give you a glass of water. You do not take this glass of water back to your home to be displayed; rather, you drink the water. This is to receive. When the water in the glass comes into me, then I have received the water. In exactly the same way we receive Jesus. Where do we receive Him? We receive Him into our whole being.<p>The opposers say, &#8220;How can you receive Jesus into you? The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit as the Triune God are clearly three separate Persons. The Father is the Father, the Son is the Son, and the Holy Spirit is just like a dove. Jesus is the Son who is sitting high above on the throne in the third heaven. How can you receive Him into you? It is not Christ who is in you; it is His representative who is in you.&#8221; I have believed in the Lord and have been saved for fifty-two years, and I have also read many Christian books. However, I have yet to read a book which says that Christ&#8217;s representative is in us, that today He is in the heavens and not in us, and that if we say that He is in us, this is a heresy. I know that some of the brothers and sisters here were pastors and theologians. Surely you did not hear this kind of saying either. This is truly a new saying by the opposers.<p>The Bible tells us, &#8220;But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name&#8221; (John 1:12). Does it speak of becoming people of God? No! It says to become children of God. There is too great a difference between becoming God&#8217;s people and becoming God&#8217;s children. We may be the people under a king, but we may not be his children. What does it mean to be children? Children are born of the father; the father&#8217;s life and nature and what the father has and is are all in the children. We are the children of God. We are not only the people of God; that is too outward. We are also the children of God, and we have the divine nature in us.<p>However, the opposing experts say that the statement, &#8220;We have the divine nature in us,&#8221; is heretical. They say, &#8220;We do not have the divine nature in us at all.&#8221; In saying this they completely negate the word in 2 Peter 1:4: &#8220;He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature.&#8221; In other words, they have overthrown all the subjective truths in the holy Scriptures. They think that Christ does not live in us, that we do not have the divine nature, and that it is unimaginable to talk about the mingling of God and man. All that they care for is the outward and objective relationship with God; they have totally annulled and overthrown the inner and subjective relationship with God. The opposers exposed their evil roots in the two and a half hours of opposing.<p>Please consider this. We have received into us this One who is the incarnated God and thus have the authority to become children of God. We have the divine life and divine nature in us. Are we then mingled with God or not? If you say that we are not mingled with God, how can we have the life and nature of God within us? We say that we are the children of God, having the same life and nature as God. But the opposers say, &#8220;By saying this you are making man God. You are deifying man.&#8221; Therefore, when the brothers were writing the rebuttals, the burden came to me, and I felt that this would be a great chance, a golden opportunity, to release all the subjective truths in the holy Scriptures.<p>After that time we had a conference in Anaheim. I did not say much. I gave only a short declaration at the end telling everybody that the opposing speakings were due to man&#8217;s blindness and ignorance. I gave an illustration on the platform: Suppose that a man is here. If you look at him from the front, there are seven openings: two ears, two eyes, two nostrils, and one mouth. However, if you look at him from the back, there is not even one opening. The opposers are like those who look from behind. Because they have no light, after groping for a long time, they cannot find even one opening. Therefore, when I tell people that a man has seven openings, they say that I speak heresy. This is to be blind and ignorant. Would you say that a man has no openings at all or that he has seven openings? You have to say both are true.<p>All the truths in the Scriptures are of two sides. In the universe there is a basic principle in God&#8217;s creation. This principle is that nothing can exist without two sides. A sheet of paper has two sides. One side is full of writing, whereas the other side is blank. Only the blind will say that there is only one side. Those who can see will say that there are two sides. There is heaven, and there is earth. There is above, and there is below. There is inside, and there is outside. There is left, and there is right. There is front, and there is back. These are the two sides. Nothing can exist with only one side; anything that exists has two sides. Every truth is of two aspects. Yes, Romans 8:34 says, &#8220;It is Christ Jesus...who is...at the right hand of God.&#8221; Yet verse 10 of the same chapter says that Christ is in us. There are two sides. You have to see that, on the one hand, Christ is in the heavens, and on the other hand, Christ is in us. When you need to breathe, you do not have to consider whether there is any opening on the back of your head. All you have to do is breathe with your nose. Yes, Christ is in the heavens, but when I enjoy and contact Christ, He is in me.<p>The reason the opposers dare not say that Christ is in them is that according to their traditional concept, the Father is the Father, the Son is the Son, and the Spirit is the Spirit, and these Three are completely separated. Therefore, they cannot say that Christ is in them. If they say that Christ is in them, then that is to admit that Christ is the Spirit because Christ can be in us only by being the Spirit. However, even up to now, they have been opposing the statement, &#8220;The Lord is the Spirit&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:17). They say that this &#8220;Lord&#8221; refers not to Christ but to God. Since they are reluctant to admit that the Lord is the Spirit, they dare not admit that Christ is in us. Nevertheless, whether or not they admit this, we do know that today the Lord is the Spirit and that He is in us. As the Spirit, He is like the air. We just need to say, &#8220;O Lord! O Lord!&#8221;, and we will feel that we are full of fresh air within. This is the Spirit, this is life, this is our enjoyment, and this is our Christ within us. Today Christ is not only in the heavens but also in us. This is subjective, not objective.<p>In the Scriptures there are more subjective doctrines than objective doctrines, and more subjective truths than objective truths. This is why the subject of our conference this time is &#8220;The Subjective Truths in the Holy Scriptures&#8221; or &#8220;The Subjective Viewpoint in the Holy Scriptures.&#8221; For the sake of helping you all understand the subjective viewpoint in the Scriptures, I will point out some items.<h2 class=head1>CONCERNING GOD</h2><p>The first item revealed in the Scriptures is God. Concerning God, there are two sides in the revelation of the Scriptures. There is the objective side, and there is the subjective side. Objectively speaking, first, God is God. He is the God who is high above in the heavens with glory and majesty. As such, He is outside of us and is completely objective to us. Second, He is our Creator. All things in heaven and on earth were created by Him, and we also were created by Him. He is our Creator, and we are His creatures. Third, He is the sovereign Master. There really is a sovereign Master in the universe. Fourth, He has become our Redeemer. We sinned and became fallen, and He came to redeem us; this also is objective. Fifth, He is our good Shepherd, and we are His flock. The shepherd is outside of the flock. The shepherd loves the sheep, and the sheep also love the shepherd. Nevertheless, to the sheep, the shepherd is objective. Sixth, He is our Master. He owns us, and we serve Him. Our relationship with Him is like that of a servant to a master. All these items concern the objective aspect of what God is.<p>However, in the Scriptures there is also the subjective aspect concerning God. First, God is our Father. This is subjective because He has given us His life and nature. Second, He is the life-giving Spirit. As the Spirit, He enters into us just like air. This is also subjective. Third, He is our life. If He were outside of us and merely objective to us, there would be no way for Him to be our life. It is only by coming into us to live in us subjectively and to be mingled with us that He can be our life. Fourth, He is light. In the Scriptures, this light is called the light of life. &#8220;The life was the light of men&#8221; (John 1:4b). This is not an objective light outside but a subjective light inside. Fifth, He is our breath. Sixth, He is our living water and food to be taken into us. All these are subjective.<p>Christianity has fallen very deeply into the tradition of religion. In their concept they think that this God is too great, too majestic, too glorious, and too transcendent. They say that on the one hand, we must honor Him, and on the other hand, we must humble ourselves to prostrate before Him as we worship. When we say that He is our living water and our food to be taken into us, they consider this altogether a blasphemy against God and an insult to God in that we lower God and exalt ourselves. Therefore, the opposers in America say that I came from China to teach heresy there. They say, &#8220;We have a hymn of praise that says, &#8216;How great Thou art.&#8217; However, this certain Mr. Lee comes and changes our hymn to &#8216;How small Thou art.&#8217;&#8221; Yes, God is so small to the extent that we can eat Him. You cannot eat a big cow unless you slaughter it and cut it up into small pieces. After going through a process, the cow can be conveniently eaten. Is the cow big or small? It was a big cow, but now it has become small pieces. The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I am the bread of life...which comes down out of heaven...so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&#8221; (6:48, 50, 57). Is this heresy, or is this the truth? This is the truth. Nevertheless, the opposers grope blindly only from behind and are not willing to take a look at the front. If only they would be willing to come to the front, they could see seven openings with just a glance.<p>I am not merely telling you about fighting the battle for the truth in America. I want to show you that even though you have been saved, edified, and nurtured in a local church, I know for a fact that even up until tonight in your religious concept, you still consider Jesus Christ as the Lord of all, the great Lord, who is high above. Within you there is not much enjoyment of the Lord Jesus. Therefore, I would like to ask you, &#8220;How much of Jesus have you eaten today?&#8221; I am not asking you how many times have you prayed and how many times have you meditated. I know that some of you enjoy meditating, and I also believe that some of you like to listen to messages and dislike the way the church meets today. However, we know that in order to enjoy our food and its flavor we cannot be too concerned about manners. Suppose you are invited to a feast, but you dare not move or make any noise; you just eat slowly. This kind of eating is only a half enjoyment; it is not the full enjoyment. However, if you eat with big mouthfuls, saying, &#8220;It&#8217;s delicious! It&#8217;s delicious!&#8221;, this kind of eating is full of enjoyment. Perhaps you think, &#8220;Brother Lee, this speaking is for a three-year-old child from the countryside.&#8221; I do hope that you would all become three-year-old children from the countryside. Just be simple and come to enjoy Christ. Get rid of your religious concepts. Today the Lord Jesus will say, &#8220;Foolish child, I already humbled Myself through incarnation, I died for you on the cross, I even entered the tomb, and I resurrected from the dead to become the life-giving Spirit. Today I am just like the air to you. Don&#8217;t make Me so great. I have been so great from eternity; I have been in My greatness long enough. I don&#8217;t want to be so great any longer. Today I want to become small to enter into you.&#8221;<p>In Isaiah 66:1-2 the Lord seemed to say, &#8220;Heaven is My throne, and the earth is the footstool for My feet. What else do I desire? I am looking for those who are poor and of a contrite spirit. I want to enter into them. They are the place of My rest. I have been in heaven long enough. I desire to come into man.&#8221; Read the Bible again to see whether our God wants to stay on the throne in heaven or He wants to come into us. If you bow down to Him again, He would say, &#8220;Forget about it! I have had enough of your bowing. Rise up, rise up. How about taking two bites of Me and drinking two mouthfuls of Me?&#8221; If you say, &#8220;Lord, I dare not eat You or drink You,&#8221; the Lord may say, &#8220;You have been poisoned by religion. Satan has poisoned you with the poison of religion in that apparently you are worshipping Me, yet in reality you are far away from Me, and you dare not contact Me. I don&#8217;t want your worship. I want you to eat Me. I desire to come into you and live in you.&#8221;<p>I am here proving that today you and I need to turn from the concept of worshipping a great and high God to the enjoyment of the lowly and small Jesus. Hallelujah! Yes, He is the Lord of all, the most high God, yet today He has become the life-giving Spirit. The Greek word for spirit is pneuma, which also means breath. If your tire has no air, that means it is without pneuma. Our Lord, the dignified and high God, is our breath, our air. Do not try to revere Him by putting Him so high. He is high enough; tens of thousands of angels bowing down to Him are enough for Him. He needs us to eat Him day by day and even moment by moment. This is the subjective experience, the subjective viewpoint, in the Scriptures.<p>From the Scripture verses used in this message we can see that Christ not only gives us authority to become children of God, but He also lives in us. &#8220;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&#8221; (Gal. 2:20). Upon hearing us say that Christ lives in us, the opposers say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know how great Christ is and how small you are? Can such a small person like you contain Christ?&#8221; However, this is what Galatians 2:20 says: &#8220;It is Christ who lives in me.&#8221; Not only so, in chapter four it says, &#8220;I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you&#8221; (v. 19). We have to thank the Lord and say, &#8220;Lord, I am such a small man, yet You live in me wholly, and You will be formed in me.&#8221;<p>Furthermore, Ephesians 3 says, &#8220;That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith&#8221; (v. 17a). The complete Christ is making His home in our hearts. He is not only our life and our food; He also indwells us. Our heart is His home; He lives and moves in us. He has become our person, and we have become His dwelling place. How subjective this is! These are the subjective truths and the subjective viewpoint in the Scriptures.<p>Traditional Christianity does not see this, and some in it even oppose this. However, we do not oppose this; rather, we are enjoying it. &#8220;O Lord! Thank You! Not only are You in me as my life, but You, as a whole entity, live in me. You will be formed in me, and You will make home in my heart. My whole being is Your dwelling place.&#8221; What will be the issue of the Lord&#8217;s living in us in such a way? The issue will be that we are &#8220;filled unto all the fullness of God&#8221; (v. 19b). This is God and we, we and God, completely united and mingled. We are filled with all the fullness of God, and we are the expression of God.<p>The opposers say that this is to create gods and to teach that man can evolve into God. They say this due to their blindness and ignorance. Nevertheless, today we know for a fact that our Lord lives in us. I hope that every one of the saints in the Lord&#8217;s recovery will testify and say, &#8220;I know for a fact that our great and high Lord, the Lord of all, is my life, my breath, my living water, and my food. He lives in me to be my everything.&#8221;<p>There are two sides to the truths in the Scriptures. Yes, on the objective side, He is the Lord in heaven, who is above all and who is dignified and great with majesty and glory. However, on the other side, this Lord is actually in me, speaking to me, fellowshipping with me, walking with me, as well as supplying, supporting, and comforting me all the time. When I am empty within, He fills me there. He is truly my life within, and He is my inward supply.<p>Every one of us has certain religious concepts. Without being taught, we know that God is the greatest and the highest One. Today the most difficult thing is to get rid of the religious concepts. You need revelation to see that this Lord today is also the life-giving Spirit. As the breath of life He is in us to be our life, our supply, our strength, and even our person. Paul said, &#8220;For to me, to live is Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:21); he also said, &#8220;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&#8221; (Gal. 2:20). This is not to evolve into God; rather, this is a glorious transformation. Christ lives in me; hence, to me to live is Christ. Thank the Lord! This is subjective.<h2 class=head1>CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h2><p>I will now give you another example, and it is concerning both the objective and subjective aspects of the church. Objectively speaking, what is the church? As a child, I was born, raised, and educated in Christianity. In Sunday school I heard many lessons which all taught that the church is a hall for worship, having a cross and a steeple on top of the building. I think that even today some of you may still have the concept that the meeting hall is the church, and when it is time for the meeting, you say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go to church.&#8221; When people ask you where your church is, you say, &#8220;It&#8217;s on Such-and-such Road.&#8221; Later in my Christian life I met with the Brethren. They were much improved; they told people that the church is not a chapel with a steeple and that the Greek word for church is ekklesia, which means an out-calling, and that the church refers to the gathering of the called-out ones. Hence, the gathering of the called-out ones is the church. At that time I very much appreciated this kind of utterance and thought that it was very right. However, gradually I realized that these called-out ones quarreled with one another when they met together. Can you say this is the church? This kind of gathering of the called-out ones is the flesh, not the church. This kind of understanding is too objective.<p>Then, what is the church subjectively? The church is the temple of God and the house of God; moreover, it is the household of God. In Greek the word for house refers even more to the household. We are the family, the household, of God. A house is lovely because of the members in the household. The church is not the empty house of God but the household of God. Not only so, the church is the manifestation of God in the flesh. The Lord is in us as our person, and every one of us is filled with Him. Whenever we come together, some may praise the Lord, others may say, &#8220;Amen,&#8221; and still others may call on the Lord. This is God being expressed from within us. This is subjective, not objective.<p>Furthermore, the church is the Body of Christ. He is the Head, and we are the Body. I can say that my head is Witness Lee, and my body is also Witness Lee. Not only is the Head Christ, but the Body, the church, is also Christ. This does not mean that we evolve into God. What this means is that we who were fallen have become children of God and members of Christ through regeneration and transformation. We are not only the gathering of the called-out ones but also the Body of Christ. He is the vine, and we are the branches. Every branch is the same as the vine in substance, life, and nature. The life of the vine is the life of the branches, the substance of the vine is the substance of the branches, and the nature of the vine is the nature of the branches. When we say that the branches and the vine are one, it does not mean that we make the branches the vine. The oneness is something subjective.<p>Moreover, the Bible also says that the church is the bride of Christ. The first bride was Eve, who came from a rib taken out of Adam. Therefore, Eve was bone of Adam&#8217;s bones and flesh of Adam&#8217;s flesh. This typifies the church being produced through the blood and water that flowed out of Christ&#8217;s pierced side. We are a part that came out of Christ; we are bone of His bones and flesh of His flesh. We are members of His Body. Lastly, the New Testament says that the church is the one new man. How subjective these truths are!<p>These are all subjective truths in the Scriptures, which include regeneration, transformation, and the mingling of God and man. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &#8220;But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&#8221; We are not only mingled with the Lord but are also one spirit with Him. God is the Spirit, and today we are one spirit with Him. Is this evolution? Absolutely not! This is the glorious salvation of God. We have been saved to such a high position-we have been put into God to become one spirit with Him. We all have to leap and say, &#8220;Hallelujah! Oh, how glorious! I am one spirit with God!&#8221;<h2 class=head1>CONCERNING THE CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE</h2><p>What we have covered so far concerns God and the church. Now we come to our Christian experience, which also has two aspects: the outward and the inward, the objective and the subjective. The outward, objective aspect includes being redeemed and forgiven. We were sinful and filthy, but God has forgiven us, and the precious blood of the Lord has cleansed us. Thus, we have been justified, reconciled to God, and accepted by God. Furthermore, we have been sanctified positionally, and we are now here being taught. Everything from our being redeemed to our being taught is objective.<p>All these are correct, and we do acknowledge that there is this aspect in the Scriptures. The opposers say that we throw the Bible aside and do away with this aspect, but we can testify that we are being taught the objective aspect every day. Yes, I am here releasing the subjective truths, but I absolutely admit, and you would also agree, that I am also teaching here. If there were no one teaching here, you would not know that there are subjective truths as well as objective doctrines in the Scriptures. We are daily being taught in the meetings. I was saved for twenty years, but I never heard of transformation. You also did not know about the matter of transformation until you came to the meetings in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. Besides, it was also not until you came to the Lord&#8217;s recovery that you found out how we, the regenerated ones, should exercise our spirit and live out our spirit. How can people say that we have no teaching among us? We are full of teaching.<p>However, what is the use of mere teaching? Maybe you understand what transformation is, and you also know about your spirit, yet afterward you go back home to entertain yourself and sleep as usual. You have the doctrine but not the reality. Therefore, there is still another aspect to consider, the subjective aspect. First, we have been regenerated. Second, we have the Lord living in us. Third, not only have we been sanctified positionally, but we are also being sanctified dispositionally. Fourth, we are being transformed. Fifth, we are being conformed to His image. Sixth, we are being built up together. Then one day the body of our humiliation will be transfigured and will be conformed to the body of His glory. All these are not objective knowledge or words; rather, they are subjective experiences.<p>Thank the Lord that today we are here not only being taught but also being transformed and conformed. At this time when I came back, I saw that you all have grown a little. I am so happy that not only those in Taipei are growing, but those in Southeast Asia are also growing. Thank the Lord that all are growing. Among us, not only do we have doctrines, but we also have life; not only do we have knowledge, but we also have growth. We are here being transformed day by day. This is all according to subjective truth.<p>The subjective viewpoint truly exists in the Scriptures. This subjective viewpoint tells us over and over again that God is not only the God who is high above. Rather, He is in us today to be our breath of life, our living water, and our nutritious food. He does not want to be merely high and great. Rather, He desires to come into us to be our enjoyment. The more we enjoy Him, the more joyful He is. He is in us; He is one spirit with us; we have His life, nature, and essence. Our life, nature, and essence are exactly the same as His. This is not our evolution into God. This is His salvation-to work Himself into us and put us into Him so that we can become one spirit with Him. These are the subjective truths and experiences in the holy Scriptures.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SUBJECTIVE TRUTHS IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14, 29, 32, 34; 3:8; 4:24, 16; 6:35, 57b, 63; 7:37-39; 14:16-18, 20; 16:13-15; 20:22; 1 John 2:20, 27; Exo. 30:22-26, 30-31</h1><h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH LIFE ISSUING FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF THE SUBJECTIVE TRUTHS</h2><p>The truths in the holy Scriptures are always of two aspects: the objective aspect and the subjective aspect. We have to be clear that all the objective doctrines are for the subjective experience. If we pay attention only to the objective doctrines and neglect the subjective aspect, we will not be able to fulfill God&#8217;s eternal purpose, which is the church. The objective doctrines are for the subjective truths, and the subjective truths are for the producing of the church. Because today&#8217;s Christianity has neglected the subjective truths, they do not have the practical church life. The practical church life is an issue of our experience of the subjective truths. When we have the experience of the subjective truths, the church is spontaneously produced.<p>Furthermore, all the subjective truths are linked to the Spirit and life. The Spirit and life are the substance of the subjective truths. If you take away the Spirit and life, there will be no subjective truths. Objective doctrines are composed of letters, whereas subjective truths are constituted with the Spirit and life, not with letters. Without the Spirit and life you do not have subjective truths. Therefore, it is by the Spirit and life that the church is produced. Because we live by the Spirit and in life, we have the experience of the subjective truths and therefore have the church life.<h2 class=head1>THE SUBJECTIVE TRUTHS IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2><p>At this time we will look at the subjective truths in the Gospel of John. Actually, the Gospel of John is entirely about subjective truths. I have spoken a little regarding this in the previous message; in this message I would like to speak further to show you the subjectivity of the matters covered in the Gospel of John.<h2 class=head2>Receiving Him by Eating and Drinking Him</h2><p>First, John 1:12 says, &#8220;As many as received Him....&#8221; How do we receive Him? We should not expound the Bible by taking it out of context. We must explain a verse at least in the context of the book to which it belongs. When we ask about how we can receive Him, we must look at chapter four. There we see that we receive by drinking. The Lord said, &#8220;But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever&#8221; (v. 14a). Therefore, to receive the Lord is to drink the Lord as the living water. Then in chapter six the Lord said, &#8220;I am the bread of life....He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&#8221; (vv. 48, 57b). This tells us that the receiving in chapter one is not only the drinking in chapter four but also the eating in chapter six. When we drink the Lord as the living water and eat Him as the bread of life, we receive Him.<p>We all know that eating food and drinking water are definitely not objective but absolutely subjective. When I take in food and drink in water, the food and the water become one with me. Whatever has been taken in will be digested in a few hours to become my living, organic components. In other words, what I eat becomes me. Eating is a very subjective matter. Therefore, the Gospel of John tells us about subjective experience, not objective doctrines. We have to receive Him by eating and drinking Him.<p>Then chapter seven says, &#8220;He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water...the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive&#8221; (vv. 38-39). The Spirit is a particular title. From this portion of the Word we see that what we have received into us becomes rivers of living water flowing out of us.<h2 class=head2>We and the Lord Mutually Abiding and Being Mingled</h2><p>This is even clearer in chapter fourteen: &#8220;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality,...He abides with you and shall be in you....In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&#8221; (vv. 16-17, 20). What is this? This is the subjective mingling. We are in Him, and He is in us.<p>I will never forget how once in a certain place while I was releasing a message, a middle-aged sister stood up and asked, &#8220;Brother Lee, can you tell me how we can abide in the Lord and how the Lord can abide in us? This is confusing to me.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Sister, please be patient. At a certain time you will easily understand.&#8221; So I continued to speak, and then at a certain point I said, &#8220;The Lord today is just like the air that we breathe. When you inhale air, the air comes into you. Thus you abide in the air, and the air abides in you.&#8221; When I said this, she was clear. This morning in this big meeting place we all abide in the air, and the air abides in us. Therefore, we are living. Likewise, our Lord is the spiritual air; we abide in Him, and He abides in us. The Lord said, &#8220;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&#8221; Is this a doctrine? This is not a doctrine; this is a practical and subjective experience.<h2 class=head2>The Lord Being the Word from the Beginning</h2><p>The Lord&#8217;s word is not so simple. Some people who have a smart mind consider the Bible to be too simple to be counted as religious writings. However, I would like to ask you what John 1:1 means. It says, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&#8221; To say that the Word was with God means there are two. To say that the Word was God means there is one. Then is there one or are there two? This is not simple. The book of John is an exceedingly mysterious book. What is the beginning? How early was the beginning? What is the meaning of dao (Word)? Does it denote daoli (doctrine), daolu (way), daode (morality), or daomen (doorway to truth)? The Word was with God. This God is a mystery. So the beginning is a mystery, the Word is also a mystery, and God is still another mystery. There are mysteries upon mysteries; eventually the Word who was in the beginning was God.<p>God is the beginning. The beginning means the starting point. The starting point of the universe is neither space nor time; rather, it is God. If there is God, there is the starting point. If you do not have God, you do not have a starting point. Some say that human life begins at forty, while others say it begins at seventy. However, I would like to tell you that you may live to be four hundred years old, but without God, you have yet to have a start. Only when you have God can you have a beginning. Many of us can testify that we were living in a muddled and befuddled way; we had no beginning of our human life. Then one day we believed in the Lord, and when we called, &#8220;O Lord,&#8221; God came in, and we had a beginning. Therefore, God is the beginning. With God, there is the beginning; without God, there is no beginning.<p>Then who is the Word? Who is daode (morality)? Who is daoli (doctrine)? Who is daolu (way)? Who is daomen (doorway to truth)? All are God. Only God is the Word. This is very good. But, not only so, one day the Word became flesh. Tell me, is the flesh good or bad? The thing I hate most is my flesh, for it has given me a lot of trouble. I hate it, yet hallelujah, the Word became flesh, even though the flesh is not good! &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....The Word became flesh&#8221; (1:1, 14a). What is precious is not the flesh but the Word becoming flesh. Did He become flesh, full of doctrines, knowledge, and theology? No! Instead, &#8220;the Word became flesh...full of grace and reality&#8221; (v. 14). Grace is God Himself. That God came to be our enjoyment is truly grace. Reality is also God Himself. Only God is truthfulness, and only God is reality. Without God, everything is empty; with God, everything is real.<h2 class=head2>The Word Becoming Flesh</h2><p>Therefore, you can see that the beginning is God, the Word is God, God is God, grace is God, and reality is God. This is wonderful! However, no matter how wonderful it is, this wonderful thing cannot be in us. Why then must the Lord become flesh? After He became flesh, while He was walking on earth in His flesh, one day suddenly a voice said, &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221; (v. 29). Therefore, you have to know that the flesh is not good. The Lord became flesh not because the flesh is good; rather, He became flesh that He might become the Lamb to take away our sin. If He did not become flesh, He would not have blood to shed for us. The Bible says, &#8220;Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness&#8221; (Heb. 9:22b). In order to have forgiveness of sins, there must be the shedding of blood, and in order to shed His blood to make redemption for our sins, the Lord had to become flesh. Thank the Lord that He indeed became flesh! He became flesh to become the redeeming Lamb to bear our sins-to have flesh and blood so that He might shed His blood for us to receive forgiveness.<h2 class=head2>The Spirit Being upon the Lord&#8217;s Flesh</h2><p>Not only do we see the Lamb in John 1, but we also see the dove descending on the Lamb (v. 32). The dove is wonderful. The Lord is not only the Lamb, who takes away our sin, but He also has the dove descending on Him. He is the One who was baptized in the Holy Spirit. In other words, this Redeemer will baptize us into the Holy Spirit. This is truly wonderful.<p>The Gospel of John is not simple, but by the Lord&#8217;s grace, we will make it simple. I believe that now you are all absolutely clear. The beginning is God, the Word is God, and God is God. God became flesh, and even though the flesh is not so good, He had to become flesh. Without the flesh, He could not have blood to shed in order to accomplish redemption for our sins, and therefore we could not be forgiven of our sins. Hallelujah! He became flesh, He died, and He shed His blood. Then He had the Spirit upon Him, and He can baptize us, not in water but into the Spirit.<p>In chapter three the Lord told us, &#8220;The wind blows where it wills,...so is everyone who is born of the Spirit&#8221; (v. 8). This tells us that if you receive the Lord, you are regenerated of the Spirit. To be born of the Spirit is not something physical but spiritual; it is just like the wind. In Greek, wind, breath, and spirit are all the same word-pneuma. Therefore, the translators of the Bible had difficulty here since in this one verse the word pneuma is used twice. The first time is that pneuma blows where it wills, and the second time is that one can be of pneuma. How these two instances of pneuma should be translated could not be resolved even after much debate. In any case, what it means is this: One who is born of his parents is a person of the flesh, a physical person, while one who is born of the Spirit is a spiritual person. Although this is invisible and seemingly intangible, there is the blowing. This is just like the wind that cannot be seen or touched, yet you can feel it blowing. Today we have been saved and regenerated; within we have become another person. This other person is not physical but spiritual. How do we know that we have the other person, the spiritual person? It is not by seeing or touching but by sensing.<p>A person might have quarreled with someone last night, yet this morning without knowing why he says, &#8220;Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! Amen!&#8221; The wind has blown upon him, and he no longer has any desire to scold others or do anything bad. Instead, he desires to pray, praise, and meet with the saints. This is &#8220;the wind&#8221; blowing where it wills, and this blowing has made him different. This is not a physical blowing but a spiritual blowing.<h2 class=head2>The True Worship of God Being to Drink of the Spirit</h2><p>In chapter four it says, &#8220;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness&#8221; (v. 24). What is it to worship Him? In this chapter we are told that the real worship of God is not to bow down, to prostrate, before Him but to drink of Him. God is Spirit. If you really want to render true worship to Him, you need to drink Him. To drink Him is to receive Him into you. God is Spirit; to drink Him and receive Him are the real worship of Him.<h2 class=head2>Both the Living Water and the Bread of Life Being the Spirit</h2><p>In chapter six we see that after the Lord Jesus fed five thousand with five loaves and two fish, the people marveled and were trying to &#8220;take Him by force to make Him King.&#8221; The Lord Jesus, knowing their thoughts, &#8220;withdrew again to the mountain, Himself alone&#8221; (v. 15). This is because the Lord Jesus came not to be King but to be food to man. The next day, the Lord came back and told the people, &#8220;I am the bread of life&#8221; (v. 35). The Lord seemed to be saying, &#8220;I am not a king; I am bread. Don&#8217;t make Me a king. It would be better if you eat Me. I am the bread of life, and he who eats Me shall live because of Me.&#8221; At first neither Peter nor John, the Lord&#8217;s disciples, understood this, but gradually they did. I tell you, on the day of Pentecost Peter ate and was truly full. This Galilean fisherman was full of Jesus within him. He ate and drank Jesus to such an extent that he was full of Jesus; all that he had within him was Jesus.<p>We have said that the living water is the Spirit. The bread of life is also the Spirit. The Lord said, &#8220;It is the Spirit who gives life;...the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&#8221; (v. 63). The living water is the Spirit, and the bread of life is also the Spirit. Then chapter seven says, &#8220;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me,...out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet&#8221; (vv. 37-39). This is an extraordinary word. At that time, there was the Holy Spirit, but there was not &#8220;the Spirit.&#8221; Many Bible readers are not clear about this. Gradually we have seen that there is a difference between the Spirit and the Spirit of God. The Spirit was not yet because the Lord Jesus had not yet been glorified, that is, He had not yet resurrected from the dead. Then when did the Spirit come into being? The Spirit came into being when the Lord Jesus was resurrected from the dead.<h2 class=head2>The Spirit of Reality Coming</h2><p>Then in chapter fourteen the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter...even the Spirit of reality&#8221; (vv. 16-17). This Spirit of reality is the Spirit. The Spirit of reality came; now He is not only with us forever but also in us. When He is in us, the Lord is in us because the Lord is He, and He is the Lord. Therefore, the Lord said, &#8220;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&#8221; (v. 20). This is a mysterious thing. The Lord Jesus is in the Father, we are in Him, and He is in us. This is a matter entirely in the Spirit.<p>After His death and resurrection, the Lord was different when He came into the midst of the disciples. According to the record in the Bible, when He came, the doors were shut where the disciples were (20:19). Wondrously and mysteriously, although the door was not open, this physical body entered. He asked the disciples to touch His side, which was physical. As the Spirit He came with a resurrected body. As a matter of fact, He did not enter; rather, when the disciples were meeting there, He stood in their midst, and then He breathed into them and said to them, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; (v. 22). This indicates that when our Lord was breathing into the disciples, He was the Spirit. He entered His disciples through breathing. From that day on, the Lord was with them. Therefore, in John 20 there is no record saying that the Lord left after He breathed into them. Neither is there a record in the Gospel of John of the Lord&#8217;s ascension. This is because from that day onward the Lord was always with them. When the disciples were in the house, so was the Lord; when they were at the seaside, so was the Lord. The Lord was in them.<h2 class=head1>BEGINNING WITH THE GOD WHO WAS IN THE BEGINNING AND ENDING WITH THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Now we understand that the Gospel of John begins with the God who was in the beginning and ends with the Spirit. The God who was in the beginning went through incarnation, the death of the Lamb, and resurrection to become the Spirit. Today the Spirit is just like air. In this Spirit full redemption for sins was made, death was dealt with, and the flesh and the old creation were both nullified. In this Spirit there is God, there is redemption, there is power, there is resurrection, and there is life. In Him is all in all. Today everything has been completed and accomplished. As the Spirit, He is on earth as well as in heaven; He is omnipresent. To Him there is no limitation of time or separation of space; He is right here. How wonderful! Do not ever think that this is superstition. This is the truth of the Bible. This is not the objective truth but the subjective truth. Oh, our God passed through redemption and entered into resurrection, and in resurrection He is the all-inclusive Spirit! On the one hand, He is sitting on the throne; on the other hand, He comes to the earth.<p>This may be likened to electricity in a lightbulb. On the one hand, electricity is in this meeting hall, but on the other hand, it is also in the power plant far away outside of town. The electricity in the power plant can be transmitted into our homes. Without the transmission of electricity, electricity is not practical. If there is merely objective electricity but no subjective experience, electricity is worthless to us. In the same way, we can also tell the Lord, &#8220;Lord, if You only sit on the throne, but You do not transmit Yourself into me, You are not of much value.&#8221; Perhaps you will say, &#8220;Whether or not the Lord transmits Himself into me, I know He is a priceless treasure.&#8221; Yes, He is a priceless treasure. However, He is of not much value to me unless He is transmitted into me. If He is not transmitted to me, of what use is He to me? What does He have to do with me?<p>This is exactly the situation in today&#8217;s Christianity. Many there still think that the Lord is high above, so they do not experience the Lord in them. On Sundays they go to their worship service in the morning and then play cards and watch movies in the afternoon. This is to have only the objective doctrines without the subjective truths. Thank the Lord that it is not so in the Lord&#8217;s recovery today. We want both the objective doctrines and the subjective experience. We want the electricity in the power plant, and we also want that electricity to be transmitted into our homes. We want electricity at both ends, not just at one end. May the Lord be merciful to us!<h2 class=head2>The Word in the Beginning Becoming the Word in the Heart</h2><p>We need to know that today the God in the Gospel of John is no longer just the God who was in the beginning. He became the Lamb, died on the cross, and resurrected, and today in resurrection He is the Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit. He is not only in heaven, but He is also here. Therefore, Romans 10:8 says, &#8220;The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart.&#8221; If you are willing to open your mouth to say, &#8220;O Lord,&#8221; He will enter into you, and the Word who was in the beginning will become the Word in your heart. Let us all say, &#8220;O Lord! O Lord!&#8221; Immediately He is no longer the Word in the beginning but the Word in our heart. The Word in the beginning is good, but it has no effect on us. Hallelujah, the Word in our heart is effective! After you have the Word in your heart, if you go again to shuffle the mah-jongg tiles, He will &#8220;shuffle&#8221; your heart. If you argue with your wife again, He will &#8220;argue&#8221; with your heart until you say, &#8220;Forget about it! Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!&#8221; Hallelujah! What I have today is not just the Word who was in the beginning. Rather, what I have is the Word who was not only in the beginning but who has also become the Word in my heart. This Word in our heart is the Spirit, and this Spirit who is in us is all-inclusive.<h2 class=head1>A TYPE OF THE SPIRIT-THE HOLY ANOINTING OINTMENT</h2><p>Now for the sake of the young people and the brothers and sisters who have recently come into the church, I want to say something about the history of the Holy Spirit. Those who know typology in the Bible all know that there is the olive oil that typifies the Spirit of God; it is the olive oil with which the kings, prophets, and priests were anointed. In the Bible this olive oil typifies the Spirit of God. Before the tabernacle came into existence, there was only the olive oil. After the tabernacle was built, God told Moses to add four kinds of spices to the olive oil. What were the four spices? First, there was myrrh; second, cinnamon; third, calamus; and fourth, cassia. These four spices were added to the basic element-the olive oil-to make the oil into an ointment. The oil was not an ointment; it became an ointment only after the four spices were added. Then from the day the tabernacle came into existence, the tabernacle, along with all its utensils, and the priests had to be anointed with the holy anointing ointment for their sanctification. This record is in Exodus 30.<p>Later when the apostle John wrote his Epistles, he referred to the anointing mentioned in Exodus 30. The anointing, mentioned twice in 1 John, was not John&#8217;s invention; rather, he took it from Exodus 30. When John mentioned the golden lampstands in Revelation, he also quoted from Exodus. Let me tell you, both the anointing and the golden lampstand refer to the all-inclusive Spirit. However, in this message, we want to touch only the matter of the anointing.<h2 class=head2>The Significance of the Numbers</h2><p>We are speaking not of the anointing of oil but the anointing of ointment. The oil consists of only one element, the olive oil. The ointment, however, is one element, the olive oil, plus four kinds of spices. If you study the type carefully, you will discover several points. First, in number the spices are four. In the Bible, the number four signifies creatures. According to our creation, we are all number fours; we are the four living creatures. Second, these four spices are all plants. In biblical typology, plants refer to the Lord&#8217;s humanity. Since four refers to creatures and plants refer to humanity, this tells us that the four kinds of spices refer to the created man. The created man is mingled with the number one. The one single element is the olive oil; it is unique. In the Bible, the number one denotes the unique God. Here in this type we see that the created man is mingled with the unique God to become five.<p>In the Bible, five is the number for responsibility. Look at your hands. One thumb plus four fingers can bear responsibility to do many things. However, if the thumb or any of the four fingers is missing, it is hard to accomplish anything. God without man has no way, and also man without God has no way. &#8220;Four,&#8221; the created ones, plus &#8220;one,&#8221; the Creator, become &#8220;five.&#8221; This five is very good. Today, the condition of some people is such that God is &#8220;one&#8221; and they are &#8220;four,&#8221; but the two have not become &#8220;five.&#8221; However, today we are all number fives. Hallelujah! Originally we were number fours, but now, since there is the number one added into us, we have become number fives. I am really happy that today I am number five because I have God so that &#8220;I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me&#8221; (Phil. 4:13). We were originally the created men, but now the Creator God has been added into us.<h2 class=head2>The Significance of the Ingredients</h2><p>Furthermore, we see that originally the holy anointing oil was solely oil, but with the addition of the four kinds of spices, the ingredients in it increased and it became an ointment. All the four kinds of spices signify the created man, and each item is full of significance. The Lord Jesus is myrrh. This refers to His being a Man who was sweet in His suffering and in His death. He suffered His whole life on earth; He was obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross. Both His suffering and His death were so sweet. This is myrrh. He was a Man who suffered and who died. He was a sweet suffering One and a sweet dying One. He truly is the sweet myrrh.<p>He is also the fragrant cinnamon, which is a very good seasoning. Westerners often use cinnamon in their cooking because it is such a good seasoning. The Lord&#8217;s human living with His behavior is really a seasoning, and it causes our human life to be full of fragrance. When you add the Lord Jesus into you, you will become fragrant cinnamon.<p>He is also calamus. According to the meaning in Hebrew, calamus is a reed that grows out of a marsh or a muddy place. This signifies His resurrection. He was not only a Man who died but also a Man who resurrected. He grew out of the marsh of death.<p>Finally, He is cassia. According to the ancient Jews, cassia has the power to repel snakes and poisonous insects. In ancient times, the sanitary conditions were not very good. There were many poisonous insects, but if cassia was placed in the room, all the poisonous insects, and the snakes in particular, would not come. This signifies the resurrection power of the Lord Jesus. The resurrection power of the Lord Jesus repels the devil, snakes, and scorpions.<p>Therefore, you can see that these four spices signify the Lord Jesus who suffered death, who was fragrant and sweet, who resurrected, and who drove away the devil. This One was added to the unique God. In other words, before the incarnation, death, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit of God had only divinity-the unique olive oil. However, after His incarnation, death, and resurrection, He compounded His humanity, which was a dying and sweet humanity, with divinity. He also compounded His resurrection and the resurrection power that drove away the devil with divinity. Today this Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit. Today in the Spirit of God, there is not only divinity but also humanity. There are also the power of the Lord Jesus&#8217; suffering, His resurrection, and the power of His resurrection, which is the power to drive away the devil. Therefore, this is not merely oil but an ointment; this is not merely the Spirit of God but &#8220;the Spirit.&#8221; Before the Lord&#8217;s death and resurrection, the Spirit was not yet. After the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, the Spirit came into being. Today this Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit.<h2 class=head2>The Significance of the Measurements</h2><p>The measurements of the four spices also have their significance. The first, myrrh, and the last, cassia, both weigh five hundred shekels. Five hundred, composed of one hundred times five, signifies a hundredfold responsibility. However, the two in the middle, cinnamon and calamus, measure two hundred and fifty shekels each, and together they form one unit. There are three units of five hundred; the first and last units are not split, but the middle unit is divided in half. Here you can see that not only &#8220;one&#8221; and &#8220;four&#8221; are here, but &#8220;three&#8221; is also here. This three is the Triune God, and the middle One of the Triune God was indeed split. He was divided and split on the cross.<p>This is so wonderful! Here we have the unique God, the &#8220;three&#8221; of the Trinity, and the &#8220;four&#8221; of the created man all compounded together to become the holy anointing ointment. In this ointment there are God, man, the Lord&#8217;s death, the effectiveness of His death, the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, the power of His resurrection, the sweetness of death, and the fragrance of resurrection. This is the Spirit today. This Spirit is the Spirit of reality in John 14. Also in John 20 this is the Spirit the disciples received when the Lord breathed into them. This Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit. Hallelujah! Today in the universe this Spirit has been consummated.<h2 class=head2>The Spirit Being the All-effective Ointment</h2><p>For an analogy, I will call this Spirit the all-effective ointment that can cure all diseases. Not only does this Spirit kill the germs, but He also supplies life. I am not joking; I speak this out of my own experience. In 1954, in Hong Kong, I released messages saying that the Lord&#8217;s death is in the Holy Spirit. With good intention a brother advised me to change the expression the Lord&#8217;s death is in the Holy Spirit to the effectiveness of the Lord&#8217;s death is in the Holy Spirit. But this is actually so; the Lord&#8217;s death is in the Holy Spirit. Not all deaths are the same. The death of Adam is different from the death of Christ. When Adam died, we were finished; when Christ died, we were all made alive. In the Holy Spirit there is not the death of Adam but the death of Christ. Adam&#8217;s death is detestable, but Christ&#8217;s death is so sweet. If He did not die, how could we live? Today the death of Christ on the cross has been included in the Spirit. We know this from the two types of death. First, myrrh signifies death. Second, the numbers in the type of the ointment signify death. Of the three units, the middle unit of five hundred shekels was split into two halves, each half being of two hundred and fifty shekels.<p>Oh, the Spirit today is too mysterious, too abstract, and too difficult to express in words! However, in His wisdom God has shown us a picture in the Old Testament-the holy anointing ointment. At one time olive oil was used to anoint kings for God. However, in the tabernacle, which signifies the church, the oil alone is not enough; it must be compounded with four kinds of spices, which typify the Lord&#8217;s person, His death, the effectiveness of His death, His resurrection, and the power of His resurrection. All that He had experienced was compounded with the olive oil. In this way the olive oil became an ointment.<p>The apostle John did not say, &#8220;The oil which you have received from Him.&#8221; Instead he said, &#8220;The anointing which you have received from Him.&#8221; I hope that you, the young people, will realize that today the Spirit that is in you is the ointment, not just the oil. These four spices-the Lord&#8217;s death, the effectiveness of His death, His resurrection, and the power of His resurrection-are compounded in the Holy Spirit. Your experience can testify that you do not have to exert any effort to reckon yourself dead. You just need to call on the Lord more often. When you call from deep within, &#8220;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!&#8221;, your flesh is put to death. This is our experience.<p>When we apply the Spirit as the holy anointing ointment into us, this ointment, as an all-effective ointment, can kill all kinds of germs and supply us with all the nutrients. Hallelujah! This is the Spirit, and today this Spirit is with us.<p>This is the Gospel of John. It starts with the God who was in the beginning, and at the end it is the Spirit who has entered into us to be our breath, our living water, our spiritual food, our life, and our life supply. We can eat Him, drink Him, and live by Him.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SUBJECTIVE TRUTHS CONCERNING THE CHURCH IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 12:24; 20:17; 15:5a; 3:28-29; 14:2, 23; 1 Cor. 10:17; Heb. 2:12; Eph. 5:30-32; 1 Tim. 3:15a</h1><p>The Gospel of John speaks repeatedly about how we should have subjective experiences of the Lord. He became flesh for the purpose of working Himself into us. He became the living water that we may drink Him, the bread of life that we may eat Him, and the breath of life that we may breathe Him. Nothing can be more subjective than the subjective experiences produced when water, bread, and breath get into us. We have to receive the Lord into us so subjectively that it is like receiving water, food, and air into us.<p>However, we have to see that these subjective experiences are for the producing of the church. All the subjective experiences that are linked to the Spirit and are hinged on life are for the producing of the church. The issue of our receiving the Lord into us is that we become constituents of the church. To be sure, in the Gospel of John we are shown the subjective experiences. Though the term church is not used, we should not overlook the fact that this book speaks of how the constituents of the church are produced.<h2 class=head1>WE BEING MANY GRAINS GROUND INTO ONE BREAD</h2><p>In the Scripture reading above, five crucial points are presented. First, the Lord said that He was a grain of wheat. This grain of wheat fell into the ground and died, and it bore much fruit (12:24). These many grains are the increase of Christ, the reproduction of Christ. Originally it was one grain; then this grain died and grew up to become many grains. Christ was the one grain, and we are the many grains. We were not the many grains by our human birth. When the Lord&#8217;s life came into us and the Lord dispensed Himself into us, we were regenerated to become the many grains to be made into one bread. Even though we are many, &#8220;there is one bread&#8221; (1 Cor. 10:17). Originally the many grains were grains individually, but now they have been ground to powder and blended together to become one bread. This one bread signifies the church. Every time we break the bread at the Lord&#8217;s table we testify that the church is uniquely one. This bread is one Body, and this one Body is the church.<p>Here we must see that the church is not a composition originated by human will; it is not an organization worked out by a group of people. That is not the church; that is a society. A society is organized by people, whereas the church is produced out of Christ. The church is an issue of His dispensing into us through His death and resurrection to make us grains of wheat. When we as the grains of wheat are blended into one, we become the one bread, and this one bread signifies the one Body. Therefore, we have to see here that the church is produced by Christ&#8217;s entering into us. In other words, the church is produced by our subjective experience of Christ. If Christ did not enter into you, you would remain only of the Adamic race; you would not be a part of Christ. However, because Christ entered into you, He as the one grain of wheat made you a grain of wheat also. This is how the church is produced.<h2 class=head1>WE BEING THE MANY BROTHERS OF THE LORD</h2><p>Second, in John 20, after His resurrection, the Lord said to Mary, &#8220;Go to My brothers and say to them...&#8221; (v. 17). Before His death and resurrection, when the Lord was on earth, He never called His disciples brothers. He called them friends, but He never called them brothers. Why? It was because at that time the Lord&#8217;s life had not yet entered into the disciples. It was through resurrection and in resurrection that His life entered into the disciples. Now since they had His life, they became the Lord&#8217;s brothers. According to Hebrews 2:12, these brothers are the church. There it says, &#8220;I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You.&#8221; What is the church? The church is the composition of the Lord&#8217;s many brothers. Individually, we are the Lord&#8217;s brothers; corporately, we are the church. The church is the composition of the firstborn Son and the many sons of God. Hallelujah!<p>But how can we become the Lord&#8217;s brothers? We must see that we are not the Lord&#8217;s foster brothers; we are the Lord&#8217;s own brothers. We are His own brothers because we have His life and His nature. We are just like Him. Just as He has the life of God, we also have the life of God. Just as He has the nature of God, we also have the nature of God. He is the firstborn Son of God, and we are the many sons of God. Therefore, we are His many brothers. In aggregate we, the many brothers, are the church.<p>One cannot become a constituent of the church merely by being baptized and &#8220;joining the church&#8221; yet without receiving the Lord into him. In my youth every Sunday morning I went to a chapel for Sunday worship. At a certain point in time the pastor and elders considered me quite good and therefore baptized me one Sunday morning. In this way I became a member of their &#8220;church.&#8221; However, the fact is that I did not pray or confess my sins, nor did I read the Bible. Would you consider that to be the church? No. Today you and I have to be clear that the church is a composition of the Lord&#8217;s brothers. The Lord Jesus is God&#8217;s firstborn Son, and we are God&#8217;s many sons. Every one of us, the sons, has the life and nature of God the Father, and when we are put together, we are the church. The church is realized when we experience the Lord in such a subjective way.<h2 class=head1>WE BEING THE MANY BRANCHES OF THE VINE AND THE MANY MEMBERS OF THE BODY</h2><p>Third, in John 15 the Lord said, &#8220;I am the vine; you are the branches&#8221; (v. 5a). The branches are not branches if they do not have an absolutely subjective experience of the vine. The branches and the vine are one and cannot be divided. The life in the vine is the life in the branches, the nature of the vine is the nature of the branches, and the substance of the vine is the substance of the branches. There is no difference at all between the vine and the branches. Strictly speaking, all the branches are parts of the vine.<p>Then how are the branches produced? Each one of them grows out of the tree. When a small sprout first comes out of the ground, there is no branch. After a certain period of growth, the branches appear one after another. By this we see what the church is. The church is composed of the branches growing out of Christ. The church is the aggregate of all the branches of Christ. Every one of us who believes in Him is a branch of Christ because it is He who comes into us to grow in us. Therefore, we are all members of His Body, and when all these members are put together, they are the Body.<p>Consider my body. You cannot say that my fingers or my arms are not my body. In reality, my body is made up of my four limbs and all the other parts. When the limbs and all the other parts-all possessing the same life-are put together, that is a body. We must know the church to this extent. What is the church? The church is formed by all the members of Christ being joined together in the life of Christ as the Spirit. Thus, our experience of Christ is absolutely subjective. Without such an experience, we are not His members, and we are not the church. However, praise the Lord, today when I sit among you, I do feel that among us and in us there is a flow of life just like the blood circulating in all the parts of our entire body. This flow of life is the Spirit, and the Spirit is Christ. It is this life, this Spirit, and this Christ that makes us the church.<h2 class=head1>WE BEING THE ONE BRIDE</h2><p>I would say again that even though the Gospel of John does not have the term church, it mentions the grains, the brothers, and the branches. Do these not signify the church? You might say, &#8220;This is not so clear because the grains, the brothers, and the branches are all individual. You cannot say they are the church.&#8221; But, in addition you can look into John 3:28 and 29 where John the Baptist said to his disciples, &#8220;I said, I am not the Christ....He who has the bride is the bridegroom.&#8221; The Bridegroom is Christ. Then who is the bride? The bride is the church. This is corporate, not individual. This is one bride in totality.<p>The first bride in the universe was Eve. How was Eve produced? When I attended Sunday school as a child, I heard the teacher say that God made man with the dust of the ground. I thought that God made two persons, one male and one female. This impression stayed with me until the time I was saved. When I began to read the Bible, I wanted to find where it was recorded that God made a man and a woman with the dust of the ground. I did not find this. So I wondered how the woman was made. Putting aside all the traditional impressions, I carefully read Genesis 1 and 2 again. Then I discovered that God created only a man; He did not create the woman. After the man was created, God brought all the created animals and birds to him, and the man gave them names. However, he did not find anyone who was like him. Only then did I become clear that God did not create two persons; rather, He created only a man, because we are told that Adam could not find a companion. Then I saw that God caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep, and while Adam was sleeping, God took out a rib from his side and made a woman out of it. The Hebrew word for made actually means built. God took a rib from the man and built it into a woman. Therefore, we need to know that Eve was not created; she was built.<p>Strictly speaking, Adam was created, and Eve was built. With what material was she built? She was built with a part of Adam. Therefore, we can say that Eve came out of Adam; she was bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh. Because Eve was a part of Adam, the two could be one flesh. In God&#8217;s building, Eve came out of Adam. Under God&#8217;s joining, Eve returned unto Adam. She was the first bride.<p>This first bride is a type of the church. The church is the bride of Christ. Strictly speaking, this bride is not created but built. With what material is she built? She is built with the material that came out of Christ&#8217;s side. When Christ was asleep on the cross, His side was opened, and there came out not only blood for redemption but also water for imparting life. This water is the eternal life, which is typified by the rib of Adam. The rib could not be broken because the eternal life can never be destroyed by death. This eternal life is the material for the building up of the church. Therefore, we must have eternal life in us. Without eternal life, we do not have the material for the building of the church.<p>Consider this: Before you were saved, perhaps your parents were already in the church, and they told you how lovely and sweet the church is. You were not interested because within you there was no material for the church. Then one day you were attracted by the Lord and moved by the Spirit, so you said to the Lord, &#8220;O Lord, I&#8217;m a sinner. I believe in You. O Lord Jesus!&#8221; How wonderful! Once you repented and called on the name of the Lord in this way, you began to feel that the church was so good and so lovely. In the past you criticized your parents for always going to the meetings; now you also are constantly going to the meetings. Not only do you go to the evening meetings, but you also go to the morning watches. I tell you, if there were no church on earth today, I would not want to live. I have a family and a great number of children and grandchildren, and I love them all, but it is difficult to be with them all for five minutes. However, when I come to the church meeting, I feel so good even after five and a half hours have gone by. Within me there is the love for the church. If you say I am a &#8220;church addict,&#8221; I will confess that I am. We have all became addicted to the church, and we are all &#8220;church addicts.&#8221;<p>Not only so, if you did not draw near to the Lord, if you did not call on the Lord for a week, and if you did not pray to Him for two weeks, then your love for the church would grow cold. But, if you call, &#8220;O Lord!&#8221;, you will love the church. If you pray to the Lord in the morning, you cannot help but come to the church meetings at night. If you are not willing to come to the meetings, it is a sure sign that you are far from the Lord. This is a fixed principle.<p>You need to know that how much the church is in you depends on how much you love the church. I can truly testify that I am reluctant to spend even one dollar for myself, but I am quite happy to spend ten dollars for the church. Sometimes my friends and relatives laugh at me and tell me that I am a fool. They say, &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to buy this, and you try to save on that, but when it comes to the church, you don&#8217;t care how much you spend. What is the matter with you?&#8221; I am not a fool. I am here enjoying the sweetness of the church.<p>The church is not something organized, nor is it something produced by handshakes. In America, I observed that after finishing the sermon, the pastor goes quickly to the door of the chapel to shake hands respectfully with the people and invite them to come again the next week. Nevertheless, for some pastors, the more they shake hands, the less people come. In the past I received letters from one or two friends, advising me that, as a servant of God, I should not have such a serious look on my face and that I should shake hands with people. However, I have to say that it is not my face that attracts people; it is Christ who attracts them. The expression on my face cannot attract you, but Christ can. The church is neither organized nor man-made. Rather, the church comes out of the enjoyment of Christ. The enjoyers of Christ will not leave, no matter what you do to them. This is what makes us different from Christianity. At the Lord&#8217;s table, we are neither an organization nor a religious group; rather, we are those who have enjoyed Christ inwardly. His water of life has flowed into us from His pierced side, and with that rib in us we are being built into today&#8217;s bride. We are not Americans, Chinese, Germans, or Japanese, but the flowing Christ is flowing into us. Hence, we all have the same kind of material, the same one rib, with which God is building a universal woman, who is the bride, the church.<p>Here you can see that not only are there the many grains, the many brothers, and the many branches, but there is also the one bride built with the one rib. Therefore, in the Gospel of John, there is the church, which is produced out of our subjective experience of Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH BEING THE FATHER&#8217;S HOUSE AND GOD&#8217;S DWELLING PLACE</h2><p>Chapter fourteen says, &#8220;In My Father&#8217;s house are many abodes&#8221; (v. 2). I believe that among you some still hold the old mistaken concept that the Father&#8217;s house refers to a heavenly mansion. As many times as I have read the Scriptures, I have not found any verse that says the Father&#8217;s house is a heavenly mansion. The phrase My Father&#8217;s house is used twice in the Gospel of John. It is used the first time in 2:16, where it refers to the temple (v. 15), the Body of Christ. Based on this, My Father&#8217;s house in chapter fourteen must still refer to the temple, the Body of Christ. We must interpret the Scripture by the Scriptures. Therefore, the definition of My Father&#8217;s house in chapter fourteen must be according to chapter two. My Father&#8217;s house is the temple, the Body, and this is the church today.<p>John 14:2 says, &#8220;In My Father&#8217;s house are many abodes.&#8221; The singular form of the Greek word for abodes in this verse is used in verse 23 of the same chapter. What does abode in verse 23 refer to? It refers to a believer. There it says, &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; The meaning of this verse is implied. It seems the Lord is saying, &#8220;On the one hand, My Father and I will take him as Our abode. On the other hand, My Father and I will be his abode. My Father and I will come to him to make an abode with him, so that he will have an abode, and We also will have an abode.&#8221; Also in 15:4 it says, &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you.&#8221; This is a mutual abode. Then, in the Epistles we learn that this abode is the house of God, the church of the living God (1 Tim. 3:15a).<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH BEING PRODUCED AS A RESULT OF OUR SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</h2><p>We have to see that the Gospel of John refers to the church in five different ways. First, many grains are ground to powder to become one bread. Second, many brothers in totality become the church. Third, many branches joined to the vine become one entity. We are members of His Body, and though the members are many, they are one Body. This is similar to the branches; though they are many, they are still one vine. Fourth, there is one bride. Fifth, the one bride is the house of God, &#8220;My Father&#8217;s house.&#8221; All these different terms depict the church from different angles and aspects. However, the main point we should not forget is that the church is produced as a result of our subjective experience of Christ.<p>It is not enough to know theology and doctrines or merely to read the Bible. If you have never contacted Christ by calling on Him and eating, drinking, and breathing Him, even though you have all the knowledge, you still have nothing to do with Him. You may be a member of Christianity, even one who occupies a very high position there, but you still may not be a constituent of the church. To become a constituent of the church, you must call on the name of the Lord and receive Him into your spirit by drinking Him as the living water. You must also receive Him into you by eating Him as the spiritual food that He may be assimilated into the inward parts of your organic being. Then He will become you, and you will have a subjective union with Him. Moreover, you can even breathe Him in as air. It is only by taking Him in that you can become a constituent of the church. You are a grain, you are one of His brothers, and you are a branch, that is, a member, of His Body. You are also a part of the bride, and you are a part of His eternal dwelling place. This is the church.<p>Brothers and sisters, here I would like to say that in these two messages we have covered all twenty-one chapters of the Gospel of John. In these twenty-one chapters we are told that one day the God who was in the beginning became flesh to accomplish redemption for our sins as the Lamb of God and that He became the all-inclusive Spirit after His resurrection from the dead. This all-inclusive Spirit can be touched by us at any time in any place. He is our living water, our spiritual food, and our air. When we drink Him, eat Him, and breathe Him, we enjoy Him. When we enjoy Him in this way, we will have the subjective experience. This subjective experience makes us His grains, His brothers, and the branches (the members) of His Body. It also makes us His bride and God&#8217;s dwelling place.<h2 class=head1>THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF JOHN&#8217;S WRITINGS BEING CONSISTENT</h2><p>Finally, you have to remember that the conclusion of the entire Bible is the New Jerusalem. On the one hand, the New Jerusalem is the bride; on the other hand, it is the tabernacle of God with men, which is God&#8217;s dwelling place. The entire Bible ends with a bride and a holy city as a dwelling place; both items were mentioned in the Gospel of John. The Gospel of John says that we are the bride and the dwelling place of God. How do we become the bride and God&#8217;s dwelling place? It is by our experience of Christ. In the last two chapters of Revelation you see that the New Jerusalem is the bride, the holy city, the dwelling place, and the tabernacle. There the river of life is flowing in the city and the tree of life is growing on both sides of the river. As we are supplied by the living water and nourished by the tree of life, we become the bride, the tabernacle, and the dwelling place of God.<p>The writings of the apostle John include his Gospel, his Epistles, and finally Revelation. He ended his Revelation in the same way he began his Gospel. In his Gospel, he spoke about how God flows out for us to drink that we may become the bride and the dwelling place of God. When he wrote his conclusion in Revelation, he gave us exactly the same picture: God Himself flowing out of the throne as the living water, and as we drink and eat of Him, we become the bride and the dwelling place, the New Jerusalem. Hallelujah, this is the church! The church is produced because we have the subjective experience of Christ in life. We thank the Lord that today we are all in this experience.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>GOD BEING PROCESSED TO BECOME THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:19; Acts 19:5; Gal. 3:27; Rom. 6:3; 1 Cor. 12:13, 3; Rom. 8:9-10; 9:21, 23; 10:12</h1><p>Through the revelation in the New Testament we can clearly see that God&#8217;s intention is that we experience Him subjectively. In order for us to experience God subjectively He became the life-giving Spirit. The term life-giving Spirit joins together the Spirit and life. God joined life to the Spirit that we may experience Him subjectively. Since He is the life-giving Spirit, we can receive Him and also enjoy Him, and the result is that the church is produced. Therefore, our subjective experience of God is a matter in the Spirit and life, and the issue is the church.<h2 class=head1>GOD BEING PROCESSED TO BECOME THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2><p>In this message I would like to fellowship with you about a certain matter. This matter has been clearly and thoroughly revealed in the New Testament but totally obliterated in traditional Christianity. In other words, there is a basic revelation in the New Testament that traditional Christianity has not seen. What is this revelation? In order to speak about this matter, I must use utterance that has not been used before in Christianity.<p>We all know that before the Lord Jesus was incarnated, God was God. He was the eternal God and the perfect God. At that time God being only God did not have humanity in Him; He had only divinity. He had not gone through death. God in Himself did not need to pass through death; therefore, He did not go through death or resurrection. These are three great points: there was no humanity in God; God had not passed through death; nor had God risen from the dead. He was the eternal and perfect God.<p>However, one day this God in eternity came into time to become a man, putting on human nature. He was God, but He put on man. He was God, but He entered into man. He was God, the eternal God, the perfect God, yet He joined Himself to man to be mingled with man as one. From that day onward in the universe there was One on the earth who was not only God but also man; there was One who was not only man but also God. In this One, God and man became one. In this One, God was there, and also man was there. If you say that He was God, you are absolutely right; if you say that He was man, you are also absolutely right. You can say that He was God yet man and also that He was man yet God. At this time God was no longer merely God; God had become man. He was a God-man. In Him there was the human element and the human nature. In Him there was not only divinity but also humanity.<p>Not only so, after He lived for thirty-three and a half years in His humanity, one day He willingly walked into death. Apparently this One who was God yet man, Jesus Christ, was killed through crucifixion by men. In reality He walked into death of His own volition. He had the absolute authority to reject death. The whole world is destined to die. No one dies willingly; rather, man dies because he is a captive of death. When a man dies, he is captured by death. Only Jesus Christ, this One who was God yet man, died not because He was captured by death but because He walked into death willingly. He entered into death, passed through death, took a thorough look at death, overcame death, and conquered death. Then He walked out of death. This is resurrection.<p>When He was incarnated, He put on human flesh and human nature. As He went into death and came out of death, this humanity which He had put on went through a &#8220;process.&#8221; This process caused His humanity to be uplifted, to be transformed. As a result, after His resurrection, even though He still had a human body and human nature, His body was no longer the same as before. Prior to resurrection, His body was a body of humiliation; after resurrection, it became a body of glory. Prior to resurrection, His body was under limitation; after resurrection, it was not under any limitation.<p>We know that before the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, when He was in Galilee, He could not be in Jerusalem. His body was under limitation. However, after resurrection, He was not under any limitation. He had a body that no one could understand. He could be in Jerusalem and in Galilee simultaneously. His body was truly glorious and without limitation. We all know the record in John 20. On the evening of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, the disciples were gathered together. While the doors were closed, suddenly the Lord came and stood in their midst with His resurrected body. This is truly a mystery. We cannot understand it, but we believe.<p>The Lord Jesus was resurrected, and He possessed a resurrected body that was physical yet without limitation. This body was not limited physically; it was not limited either by time or by space. Today He is such a Spirit. This Spirit is the life-giving Spirit. This is the Spirit of the God who was incarnated, who went through human living on earth, and who went through death on the cross for us sinners. This is the Spirit of the One who put on human flesh in order to shed His blood on the cross for the redemption of our sin. This is also the Spirit of the One who through His death on the cross nullified death for man and destroyed the devil, the one who has the power of death. Thus, He dealt with sin, death, and Satan. His death on the cross terminated every negative matter in the universe.<p>After He accomplished everything, He entered into the tomb, into Hades, and rested for three days. There He did not decay nor was He damaged; He merely rested for three days. After His rest, He came out, overcoming death, Hades, the authority of darkness, and the tomb. By this time He had become God who was &#8220;processed.&#8221; Theologians may say they have never heard this term before. Whether or not you have heard it before, I ask you according to the facts, did the God who became the life-giving Spirit go through a &#8220;process&#8221;? Yes, He went through incarnation, entered into death, was buried, and came out of the tomb and Hades. Is this not a process? Before incarnation God was God, but He had not been processed. After incarnation, death, and resurrection, He was processed.<h2 class=head1>THE TYPE OF THE PASSOVER LAMB</h2><p>Perhaps we can use a type for illustration. We all know that in the Feast of the Passover the children of Israel had to eat the Passover lamb. This lamb first had to be killed and its blood put on the doorposts and on the lintel for their protection that they might be at peace. It was not enough, however, for the Passover lamb just to be slain; it had to be cut into pieces and roasted by fire to be eaten. To be killed, cut into pieces, roasted by fire, and set on the table means that this lamb had to go through a process. They did not eat a raw lamb. They ate one that had been processed, one that had been slain, cut, and roasted. Not only so, while they were eating, there was further processing.<p>To exemplify further, after we go to the market to buy groceries, we do not set them on the table and just eat them raw. That would be barbaric. Rather, we bring the groceries back and wash, cut, cook, and boil them. This is to process them. After the process, we set them on the table. Then as we are eating the food, there is further processing. We do not simply devour the food; rather, we put it in our mouth, chew it, and swallow it. The nutrients in the food are then assimilated in us.<p>The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I am the bread of life.&#8221; Let me ask you, without going through a process, can He become bread? The Passover lamb typifies the Lord Jesus. God said that the Passover lamb must not be eaten raw or boiled; it must be eaten roasted. For the Lord Jesus to be our bread of life, He had to undergo a process. He is not a raw Lamb; He is a processed Lamb. Then as we eat Him, He is being further processed by us.<h2 class=head1>THIS REVELATION BEING ALTOGETHER CONTRARY TO THE RELIGIOUS CONCEPT</h2><p>This revelation is altogether contrary to the religious concept. The religious concept considers God as great and dignified. Therefore, one must exalt Him to the highest place and prostrate to worship Him. When you first thought about worshipping God, was this not your initial concept? When I repented around the age of twenty and worshipped God for the first time, I tidied myself from head to toe and then knelt down slowly to pray to the Lord, &#8220;O God, I worship You.&#8221; Did you do the same when you began to worship God for the first time? I do not believe that there is an exception.<p>In 1958 I went to Jerusalem and visited the place where the world&#8217;s second largest mosque is. There I saw the Arabs worshipping Allah. First they took a bath to cleanse their bodies, and then they put on clean clothes. When they came to worship, outwardly they truly had an attitude of reverence. However, this is religious worship. Those who are in religion do not realize that one day the Lord became a Lamb. John 1:29 says, &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God!&#8221; That was the Passover Lamb. As the Passover Lamb, not only was He killed to shed His blood for the redemption of sins, but He was also &#8220;cut into pieces&#8221; and &#8220;roasted&#8221; for His people to eat. This concept of being &#8220;processed&#8221; and &#8220;eaten&#8221; cannot be found in religion. To this day, some theologians oppose this kind of speaking. They believe that to speak of eating God is a blasphemy to God. However, we know that in John 6:55 and 57, the Lord clearly said, &#8220;My flesh is true food....So he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&#8221;<p>I can never forget the spring of 1958, when at the meeting hall on Jen Ai Road in Taipei, I spoke for the first time about the Lord being edible. One day after my speaking, a brother who was a university professor came to me and said, &#8220;Brother Lee, your message today was very good. However, when you said that the Lord is edible, that was too wild. Can you change your utterance?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Brother, this is not my invention. This is what the Lord said in John chapter six. I am not the one who is wild. Since the Lord Jesus has given Himself for us to eat, why would we dare not to eat Him? If you want something that is civilized or something that sounds nice, you have no way to enjoy the Lord.&#8221; If you want to enjoy the Lord, you should not care whether or not something sounds nice. Just eat.<p>In the past most Christians thought that to eat the Lord is to eat the Scripture. They said, &#8220;The Scripture is manna. To eat manna is to read the Scripture with meditation.&#8221; They believed that to meditate on the Word was to eat the Word. I used to have the same concept, and I even taught others to eat the Word in this way. However, no one was able to eat anything. Meditating is not eating. For example, there may be a fish here. After meditating on the fish for two hours, you still have not eaten it. Then a simple child may come; he does not meditate. While you are meditating on the fish, he will eat the fish. You are empty after meditating, whereas he is full after eating. The Bible does not tell us that to meditate on the Word is to eat the Lord.<p>In John 6, after the Lord Jesus said that He could be eaten, the Jewish religionists said, &#8220;This word is hard; who can hear it?&#8221; (v. 60). Thus, one by one they left Him. The Lord Jesus said to the twelve disciples, &#8220;Do you also want to go away?&#8221; (v. 67). Moreover, He said, &#8220;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing&#8221; (v. 63). The Lord was saying, &#8220;I can be eaten because I am the Spirit. The Spirit can be eaten. Those who eat Me are those who use their spirit to receive Me. The words which I have spoken to you are not merely letters or doctrines; rather, they are spirit and life. You must use your spirit to contact Me.&#8221;<p>Our Lord&#8217;s intention is to give Himself for us to eat. Elderly sisters, you must change your concept. Have you ever once gone to the Lord and said, &#8220;Lord, thank You that Your intention is to give Yourself for me to eat&#8221;? I often give thanks in this way. In the morning I come to the Lord and say, &#8220;Lord, I have come again to enjoy You by eating You. You are the bread of life to me.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>THE PROCESSED GOD POSSESSING RICH INGREDIENTS</h2><p>However, my main point is here: Before our Lord Jesus was incarnated, He was the perfect God in eternity. At that time He could not be eaten because He had neither been incarnated nor gone through death and resurrection. This means that He had not been processed. But after His incarnation, death, and resurrection, He could be eaten. In scriptural terminology, this Lord who can be eaten has become the life-giving Spirit, typified by the holy anointing ointment in the Old Testament. The holy anointing ointment was not merely oil; it was an ointment, and there were many ingredients in this ointment. After the Lord died and resurrected, He became the holy anointing ointment. In Him there are many elements: the elements of God, man, death, the effectiveness of death, resurrection, and the power of resurrection. He is the ointment.<p>We must know that after the Lord Jesus incarnated, died, and resurrected, God became fully mingled with man. The Lord accomplished His death to deal with sin, nullify death, destroy Satan, and get rid of every negative thing. He also uplifted humanity and entered into resurrection to become the all-inclusive Spirit. In this Spirit there are the Triune God, the uplifted humanity, the all-inclusive death with its effectiveness, and resurrection with its power. Everything is in this Spirit. This Spirit is the anointing Spirit, the life-giving Spirit. After everything had been accomplished, in Matthew 28 it is recorded that in resurrection the Lord came to the disciples and told them, &#8220;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&#8221; (v. 19).<h2 class=head1>BAPTIZED INTO THE RICHES OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>Pitiful Christianity has made baptism a ritual. They talk about &#8220;baptizing people in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; I also was baptized that way. After I attended the Sunday services for a period of time, the pastor decided to baptize me. One day I went to the chapel, and those of us who were to be baptized went and stood in the front. The pastor took a small bowl, and then he came to me and said, &#8220;I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; He then sprinkled a few drops of water on my head. After that baptism, I became a &#8220;church member.&#8221; Poor Christianity interprets Matthew 28:19 in this way.<p>Half a year following my baptism, I was genuinely saved. From that day I began to pray and read the Bible. When I read Matthew 28:19, I felt a little perplexed and did not understand what it really meant. Therefore, I looked into the Greek Interlinear Version and found that it is not &#8220;baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,&#8221; but &#8220;baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; The Greek preposition that was rendered in is actually equivalent to into in English. Thus, this verse should be translated, &#8220;Baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221;<p>At that time I understood the meaning of &#8220;baptizing into,&#8221; but I still could not understand the &#8220;name&#8221; in the phrase &#8220;the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; I was not able to find out anything even after searching through reference books, and it was also difficult to explain from my own experience. One day I received a book entitled Word Studies in the New Testament by M. R. Vincent. When I read the word studies on Matthew 28:19, I found that what was written there totally corresponded with my experience. Vincent said that the &#8220;name&#8221; of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit denotes the reality of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. A person&#8217;s name is not an empty expression; rather, it denotes the reality of a person. When I call the name of a brother, I am calling that brother. If there is only a name but not the person, then the name is vain. Thus, the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is not an empty name. This name is the reality of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are the reality of this name.<p>Vincent further said that the preposition here is into, indicating a divine union of the baptized one with the Triune God. This is too great a matter. From that day on my eyes were opened. I realized that baptism is not an initiation rite or a religious ritual. Baptism is to immerse you, one who is outside of God, into God. &#8220;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; To be baptized into the name is to be baptized into the person. To be baptized into the name is to be baptized into the reality. From that day onward, I was clear that baptism is not a ritual but a real action. You have repented and believed, so now I immerse you into the Triune God.<p>Why use the name? This is because the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit-is too mysterious. Your eyes cannot see Him, and your hands cannot touch Him; therefore, if He were not denoted by a name, it would be very difficult to have Him. If I say, &#8220;I baptize you into the Father, the Son, and the Spirit,&#8221; you may ask me, &#8220;Where is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit?&#8221; Therefore, there is the need to use the name for denotation. This principle is in the Bible. John 1:12 says, &#8220;But as many as received Him,...to those who believe into His name.&#8221; If you only say, &#8220;But as many as received Him,&#8221; some may not understand. Since this &#8220;Him&#8221; cannot be seen or touched, how can we receive Him? Where is &#8220;Him&#8221;? However, the verse says, &#8220;But as many as received Him,...to those who believe into His name.&#8221; Although you cannot see or touch or find &#8220;Him,&#8221; you have His name here. You can say, &#8220;Lord Jesus.&#8221; You cannot see or touch Jesus, but you can call His name, &#8220;Jesus.&#8221; You can say, &#8220;Jesus, Jesus, dearest Jesus. I believe in You, Jesus.&#8221; I tell you, when you say this, you touch Jesus.<p>Therefore, to be baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is to be baptized into the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Today this Triune God is the all-inclusive Spirit, the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is like the fresh air. As we are meeting here today, we are meeting in Him. If at this very moment someone is touched and says to me, &#8220;I repent and I believe,&#8221; then I would say to him, &#8220;Since you have repented and believed, I will baptize you into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.&#8221; This is not a ritual but a reality.<p>Matthew 28:19 says, &#8220;Baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Then Acts 19:5 says, &#8220;They were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.&#8221; This tells us that the name of the Lord Jesus equals the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Not only so, further on in the Epistles, we see this word: &#8220;As many of you as were baptized into Christ...&#8221; (Gal. 3:27). This tells us that Christ is equal to the name of the Lord Jesus. Therefore, to baptize people into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit is to baptize them into the name of the Lord Jesus and into Christ.<p>Furthermore, to baptize people into Christ is to baptize them into His death and even more into His Body. &#8220;For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body&#8221; (1 Cor. 12:13). Therefore, baptism is not a small thing. Previously I was not clear, but now I am clear. When a person repents, believes, and is baptized, this baptism immerses him into the Triune God, into the name of the Lord Jesus, into Christ, into His death, and into His Body. This is truly marvelous.<p>I truly hope that from now on, whenever there is a baptism in the church, these five items will be pointed out: the name of the Triune God, the name of the Lord Jesus, Christ, His death, and His Body. In baptism we do not merely immerse people into water outwardly. Water is a symbol, signifying the Triune God, Christ Himself, His death, and His Body. When we immerse people into water, we are baptizing them into the Triune God, into Christ, into the death of Christ, and into the Body of Christ.<p>Since the Lord has given me this revelation, I cannot help saying that Christianity is truly pitiful. It is so poor that the water of baptism consists of just a few drops. With the sprinkling, I did not get immersed into the Triune God or into Christ or into His death or into His Body; I was baptized into nothing. Returning home, I lived and acted the same way as I did before baptism. This was my pitiful baptism. This is also the pitiful condition of Christianity. On the contrary, from now on the church in each locality must no longer baptize people in this poor way. We must use a lot of water as a symbol of the rich God, the glorious Christ, His all-inclusive death, and His universal Body. Today we must put repentant sinners into all of these items. We must baptize in this way. Those who baptize others should pray in this way: &#8220;Lord, give me the power of the Holy Spirit, give me authority, and give me faith. Whomever I put into the water today will be baptized into the Triune God, into Christ, into His death, and into His Body.&#8221; Not only the baptizing one needs faith, but the one being baptized needs it more. If the faith of the two parties are put together, I tell you, when that person comes out of the water, he will jump, praise, and declare, &#8220;Hallelujah! Today I am in the Triune God. Today I am in Christ. Today I am in His all-inclusive death. Today I am in His glorious Body! My sins are gone, the world is buried, death has been nullified, Satan has been destroyed, and I am buried. Today I am in the all-inclusive Christ, and I am in the glorious church!&#8221; This is the rich and glorious baptism of the church. This should be our condition today.<p>Each time the church has a baptism, if you do not have this confidence, this faith, then you should not baptize others. You must have this kind of living authority, living faith, and living assurance: &#8220;I am representing the God of all to immerse you, repentant sinners, into Him, into Christ, into His death, and into His glorious Body!&#8221; Is this not glorious? This baptism ushers us out of darkness into light, out of death into life, and out of the kingdom of Satan into the kingdom of God. We need this kind of baptism.<p>Many who have been baptized this way can testify that after such a baptism, sins and addictions disappeared. They could testify that after such a baptism, inner anguish vanished because they were baptized into the Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. This is a subjective experience. Our subjective experience begins at this juncture. I do know a good number of people who became totally different persons after returning home from baptism because they were immersed into the life-giving Spirit.<h2 class=head1>DRINKING ONE SPIRIT</h2><p>What should one do after baptism? First Corinthians 12:13 says, &#8220;For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body...and were all given to drink one Spirit.&#8221; In this verse there are two important words, baptized and drink. To be baptized means that you enter into the water, and to drink means that you let the water get into you. After this glorious baptism there must be the drinking. You need to drink often. Drinking follows baptism. Once you are baptized, you must drink. Baptism puts you in a position where you have the qualification, the standing, and the authority to drink. The water for baptism is the water for drinking. It is the same water. This life-giving Spirit is the Spirit for baptism and the Spirit for drinking. After baptism you need to drink.<p>How do we drink? First Corinthians 12:3 tells us: &#8220;No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; In other words, whoever can say, &#8220;Jesus is Lord!&#8221; is in the Holy Spirit. Therefore, each time you say, &#8220;O Lord,&#8221; you are in the Holy Spirit. Each time you say, &#8220;O Lord Jesus,&#8221; you are taking a drink of the Spirit.<p>Sister M. E. Barber wrote a hymn, Hymns, #73. The second stanza in this hymn says: &#8220;Blessed Jesus! Mighty Savior! / In Thy Name is all I need; / Just to breathe the Name of Jesus, / Is to drink of Life indeed.&#8221; This is evidence that this sister truly had the experience of drinking. We need only to breathe the name of Jesus, that is, to call on the Lord Jesus, &#8220;Lord Jesus! Lord Jesus! Lord Jesus!&#8221; Then we will drink of His life. This calling does not need to be very loud. In order not to disturb others, we may at times call softly, &#8220;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!&#8221; In any event we must drink. When we call softly, &#8220;O Lord Jesus!&#8221; we are firstly quenched within, then we also are enlightened. After a few more minutes of calling, the inner light will become brighter, and we will end up dealing with our sins. This is truly marvelous! We must drink in this way.<p>Finally, I would like to mention Romans 8, 9, and 10. Apparently these three chapters are not connected, but actually they are completely related. Chapter eight speaks of the living water being in us. Verses 9 and 10 show us that the Spirit of God dwells in us; that is the Spirit of Christ in us, and that is also Christ in us. This refers to the living water. Chapter nine says that we who drink of this living water are vessels. For example, water is poured into a cup, so the cup is a vessel. We are vessels to be filled with the living water. How do we get filled? Romans 10:12 says that the Lord is &#8220;rich to all who call upon Him.&#8221; Do you, as a vessel, want to enjoy the riches of the Lord? There is only one way, and that is to call on the name of the Lord. It is good to listen to messages because they can be helpful to you. However, you must call on the Lord&#8217;s name yourself. Once you call, His riches will become your drink, your supply. Then as a vessel you will be filled with the riches of the Lord of all. It is in this way that we can have the subjective experience of the Lord.<p>Hallelujah! This God has gone through a process to become water that is drinkable, and He is right here. We only need to call on His name, and He as the Spirit will enter into us so that we can enjoy His riches.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>LIVING BY CHRIST TO LIVE OUT CHRIST</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 13:5; Col. 1:27; Gal. 2:20a; 4:19; Eph. 3:16-17a, 19b</h1><h2 class=head1>NOT BEING ACCUSTOMED TO LIVE BY CHRIST</h2><p>Among us, every one knows this truth: &#8220;Christ lives in me.&#8221; Although we all know this truth, we may not have the adequate experience. This is because to this day we are not accustomed to letting Christ live in us. Since the day we were born, we have been living by ourselves; as we grow up, we still live by ourselves. We do everything by ourselves. Whatever we want to say or do, we do so by ourselves. If there is any difficulty, we handle it by ourselves. If there is any weakness, we deal with it also by ourselves. If there is any sin that entangles us, we try to overcome it by ourselves. It is rare that we do not live by ourselves. We know that Galatians 2:20 says, &#8220;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&#8221; We speak this and sing this, but in reality it is still &#8220;I&#8221; who live. No matter how many times we have spoken, sung, shouted, or prayed, &#8220;It is no longer I who live,&#8221; when it comes to our practical living, it is still &#8220;I&#8221; who live.<p>Not the younger ones here, but the older brothers and sisters can remember that since this work of the Lord in Taiwan began in August 1948, the central message preached by us has been, &#8220;Christ living in me.&#8221; I still remember that our message in the first conference was on &#8220;Christ and the cross.&#8221; If you read The Ministry of the Word from twenty years ago, you will see that the first of a complete series of messages was on &#8220;Christ and the cross.&#8221; Therefore, the truth concerning &#8220;Christ living in me&#8221; is not a new one. Today, twenty-eight years later, I come back to this. On the one hand, I am full of joy because I see growth in the young people. On the other hand, I am full of mixed feelings when I see the older brothers and sisters whom I have known for over twenty years.<p>From 1948 the church in Taipei began to have gospel marches. Particularly in 1949 we started going to New Park every Lord&#8217;s Day afternoon to preach the gospel. Each time we were able to get two to three thousand to hear the gospel and three to four hundred to give us their names. Many were saved there. Once saved, they came into our meetings and heard this central truth: &#8220;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&#8221; However, after hearing this for a long period of time, the taste is gone. Even though in the meetings we can say, &#8220;It is no longer I who live,&#8221; once we go back home it is still we who live. This is because the teaching has become empty, having no effect.<p>Tonight before I came to the meeting, the Lord told me to speak on this familiar message-&#8220;Christ living in me.&#8221; However, the Lord also told me that I must not just speak a doctrine, but I must &#8220;negotiate&#8221; with you. I would like to ask you, after being saved for so many years, have you been living by Christ every day? This subject is my burden tonight.<p>I am afraid that among us there are still many who are not accustomed to living by Christ. For example, here is a brother. Let me ask you, &#8220;Suppose your wife who has always been nagging you does it again today. What will you do?&#8221; This brother may answer, &#8220;As one who is from Hunan I cannot take it, so at first I will rebuke her a little. Then, when I sense that I should not be so strong, I will stop being so strong.&#8221; I would say that this is altogether not Christ but he himself. Even the subsequent inner rebuking within him may not have been altogether of Christ, because not only a Christian but even every Chinese would behave this way. You see that the result of twenty years of listening to messages is: &#8220;It is no longer Christ who lives in me, but it is I, a Hunanese, who live.&#8221;<p>The difficulty is here: Although we have Christ, we are not accustomed to living by Him. Nevertheless, we should not be discouraged. We can begin to practice anew. How do we practice? If your wife nags you again today, do not consider who you are. Instead, you should pray, &#8220;Lord, You are in me, and I live by You. Lord, now my wife is nagging me again; what would You do?&#8221; I am convinced that if you are willing to ask the Lord in this way, immediately the Lord will say, &#8220;Let her nag some more. Isn&#8217;t her nagging just like music? While she is nagging, I am in you and will lead you to dance.&#8221; In this way, it is no longer you. It is no more your anger, your patience, or your self-cultivation. Instead, it is Christ within you leading you to dance. This is &#8220;no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&#8221;<p>I know many sisters wish that they did not have a temper because anger destroys the good impression one makes on others. Thus, you all hate losing your temper and would rather be one who is gentle to gain others&#8217; praise. But what happens? On the one hand, you often lose your temper; on the other hand, you do not know what to do about it. You have tried every possible way to not lose your temper. Now you know that this does not correspond with the light you have received from the truth. The light is: &#8220;I have been crucified with Christ. Regardless of whether or not I lose my temper, I am one who has already been crucified. It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&#8221; Do not care for your temper; just care for Christ. Do not deal with your temper; only deal with Christ. However, very few can ignore their temper to only care for Christ. This is not an easy matter.<p>Teaching is one thing, while experience is another. It is especially true with this particular teaching. Why is this? It is because this teaching is concerned with Christ coming into us to be our disposition, our life, and our person. This is not simple. You have your disposition, your life, and your person, yet today within you there is another One who wants to be your disposition, your life, and your person. You must put aside your disposition, life, and person and take Him completely to be your disposition, life, and person. This is not easy. It is easy to listen to the teaching and understand it, but it is not easy to apply it in your daily life. No matter what you do, there is still too much of yourself. It is one thing to speak the teaching but quite another to live it out.<h2 class=head1>PRACTICING TO GIVE HEED NOT TO PEOPLE, MATTERS, AND THINGS BUT ONLY TO CHRIST</h2><p>The Lord must have mercy upon us. The measure of the reality, weight, height, and glory of our church life is determined by the extent to which we live by Christ and live out Christ. Thus, my burden is to fellowship with you on this point. When you have the light, you will focus your eyes on Christ. If you have a problem with your husband, forget your husband; if you have a problem with your wife, forget your wife; if you have a problem with your temper, forget your temper; if you have a problem with your circumstance, forget your circumstance. Just do not forget this One-Christ.<p>You do not need to deal with your circumstance or with yourself because there is no way to deal with yourself. The more you deal with the self, the more difficult it becomes to be dealt with; the more you deal with it, the more it needs to be dealt with. This is our experience. No matter what, the real subjective truth today is to not deal with yourself but to contact Christ. Do not deal with your temper, your weakness, your shortcoming, or your circumstance. Do not focus your eyes on yourself or on any person, matter, or thing. You just need to gaze on Christ, contact Christ, and let Christ live Himself out of you.<p>A certain brother often came to me and asked, &#8220;Brother Lee, what do you think about the way I did this thing? Was it good or bad?&#8221; Or he would ask, &#8220;Brother Lee, what do you think about my haircut? Is it good or bad?&#8221; When he questioned me this way, I never told him that the thing he did was good or bad or that his haircut was good or bad. I would always tell him, &#8220;For your haircut, you need to get in touch with the Lord, contact the Lord. Instead of paying attention to your hair, contact the Lord. When you encounter a certain matter, whether great or small, you must first put the matter aside and contact the Lord.&#8221; Some sisters also asked me, &#8220;Brother Lee, do you approve of our clothing?&#8221; I would always tell them, &#8220;You should not care about your clothing; instead, care for Christ. You need to contact the Lord about what to wear. You should ask the Lord, &#8216;Lord, it is You who live in me. What do You want to wear?&#8217;&#8221;<p>Not only did I speak concerning this truth twenty-eight years ago at the meeting hall on Jen Ai Road here in Taipei, but when I came back in 1967, I solemnly spoke again on Christ as our person. However, now I wish to ask you, &#8220;Today, this very day, how much have you allowed Christ practically to be your person?&#8221; Not much. The truth remains the truth-in actuality we pay too much attention to people, matters, and things, dealing with them all day long. Daily we are concerned with: &#8220;What shall I do with my temper?&#8221; &#8220;I am a quick person, so what shall I do?&#8221; &#8220;I am a slow person, so what shall I do?&#8221; &#8220;I cannot coordinate with the brothers and sisters in my home meeting, so what shall I do?&#8221; &#8220;I cannot get along with my husband and my in-laws, so what shall I do?&#8221; Brothers and sisters, we must see that these are all Satan&#8217;s deceptions, Satan&#8217;s distracting schemes, to draw our heart away from Christ. You and I must see that we ought to be like Peter and John on the Mount of Transfiguration: &#8220;They saw no one except Jesus Himself alone&#8221; (Matt. 17:8). At home, it should be that you do not see your temper, your impatience, your wife, your husband, your children, your in-laws, and not even yourself; you must see Jesus only. This is to see no one except Jesus Himself alone. I do not care about my temper; I only care to contact the Lord. The Lord is my life, my disposition, and even my person. Brothers and sisters, if the Lord is to have a strong revival in the church today, a revival that is up to the standard, there must be among us many who live by Christ in this way.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST LIVING, BEING FORMED, AND MAKING HIS HOME IN US</h2><p>Yesterday morning I said that the light in the church is a sevenfold intensified light. When you are about to lose your temper, the light will shine. Once it shines, your temper is gone. However, this is only on the negative side. What I am speaking tonight is on the positive side. It is not enough to refrain from losing your temper or to be without a temper. You need to let Christ live out of you. &#8220;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&#8221;<p>In pitiful Christianity there is no such thing. Some even say, &#8220;Christ is only sitting in heaven; Christ cannot be in the believers.&#8221; They also say, &#8220;Believers do not have God&#8217;s nature in them.&#8221; This truly is heresy. The New Testament clearly tells us, &#8220;Or do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?&#8221; (2 Cor. 13:5). It also says, &#8220;Christ in you, the hope of glory&#8221; (Col. 1:27). Not only so, Paul also said, &#8220;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&#8221; (Gal. 2:20). It is not just that Christ is doing things for me, helping me, and strengthening me; it is that Christ is living in me.<p>We must know that to let Christ live in us is not a small thing. Suppose I come to visit you in your home. I may sit there for several hours, but that does not mean that I live there. Only your family members live in your home. The Lord Jesus does not merely stay in us; He lives in us. Today many in Christianity only see the biblical record of Christ&#8217;s being taken up in ascension after His resurrection. Hence, they do not understand how Christ can be sitting in heaven and living in us at the same time. They have a one-sided truth, paying attention only to the objective side and neglecting the subjective side. On the one hand, it is true that Christ is sitting in heaven; but on the other hand, it is also true that Christ is in us and even is living in us.<p>Not only so, in Galatians 4:19 Paul said, &#8220;I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you.&#8221; Christ is in you but has not yet been fully formed. What does this mean? This word indicates that, on the one hand, the Christians in Galatia believed in Christ and had Christ within them; on the other hand, they were influenced by the Jewish religion and filled with Judaistic concepts, legalistic ideas, and Old Testament views. Therefore, they did not fully give room to Christ that Christ might be able to spread Himself. Thus, Paul seemed to say, &#8220;I have to travail again in birth for you that you may give all the ground within you absolutely to Christ by getting rid of all the concepts of Judaism, the ideas concerning the law, and all the things of the Old Testament that are still in you. In this way Christ will be fully formed in you.&#8221; This shows us how real and subjective it is that Christ is in us!<p>Then, in Ephesians 3, Paul said, &#8220;I bow my knees unto the Father...that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man&#8221; (vv. 14, 16). This is to be strengthened into our spirit, into our new man, &#8220;that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith&#8221; (v. 17). We all understand the meaning of making home. After you move into a new house, you start to furnish the rooms and make them look attractive. You consider a suitable arrangement for the bed, the dining table, and the desk, and then place them accordingly. This is to make home. Probably Christ has not been formed in us, much less has He made home in us. Therefore, today we need God to grant us grace by strengthening us into our inner man that we may let Christ make home in our hearts.<p>Our heart is composed of several parts, including the emotion, mind, will, and more. We need to open up one part at a time to allow Christ to make His home in each and every part, just as when we first move into a new house, we settle in room by room. Suppose there are two rooms that are still not opened; that means we have not yet made home in those two rooms. Today Christ in us must be so subjective that He could make Himself at home and reside in our entire being. The result is &#8220;that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God&#8221; (v. 19b).<p>All this should not be mere doctrine. Perhaps not many Christians have heard this teaching, but among us we have heard it very much. Therefore, brothers and sisters, tonight before the Lord you must solemnly consider this matter and ask, &#8220;O Lord, in my practical living day by day, are You living in me? O Lord, are You being formed in me? Have I given every bit of room within me to You? O Lord, have You made Your home in me?&#8221; This is not a doctrine.<p>Here a question might arise. Who is this Lord who is in us? He is the Triune God. The Lord who is in us is not only Christ but also the embodiment of God. He is the Triune God. The Father is in the Son, and the Son is the Spirit. He is not in us as a representative, and all the more He is not in us as a doctrine. He is in us today not only as our life, but also as the Lord of all, a person, complete and unique. He is the Triune God as the life-giving Spirit living in us. Brothers and sisters, I want to ask you, &#8220;Is this a doctrine or an experience to you?&#8221; We must say, &#8220;O Lord, have mercy on us. If this has not yet become our experience, we pray that You will make it our experience.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>THE LORD&#8217;S RECOVERY BEING A RECOVERY OF OUR SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF THE LORD</h2><p>We all say that we are for the Lord&#8217;s recovery. However, what is the Lord&#8217;s recovery? The Lord&#8217;s recovery is to recover our subjective experience of the Lord in order that the church can be realized practically. The church issues from the subjective experience. With us, how much of the church element there will be, how weighty the church will be, and how high the church life will be all depend on how much Christ is lived out from within us. We need to be burning in spirit. This is good, but this is not good enough. We must be able to say, &#8220;It is Christ who lives in me, it is Christ who is being formed in me, and it is Christ who is making home in me. My life is He, my disposition is He, and my person is He. I am His dwelling place, His habitation, and I live by Him. I do not care for the world, sin, or my circumstances, including all the people, matters, and things around me. I even do not care about my disposition or my temper. I only care for this precious Christ and live by Him. When He is happy, I am happy. When He suffers, I suffer. When He works, I work. When He stops, I stop. This is because He is my life and my person.&#8221; We must experience Christ to such an extent.<p>Do not be joyful because you are doing good, nor be happy because you feel you are perfect. No! You must ask, &#8220;Am I really living out Christ? Has Christ really made home in me? Is Christ able to live freely in me? Do I indeed take Him as my life, my disposition, and my person?&#8221; These are the questions you should ask yourself.<h2 class=head1>THE TESTIMONY OF THE CHURCH BEING THE LIVING OUT OF CHRIST</h2><p>The reason Christianity has fallen into a religion is because of the neglect of many to live Christ, paying attention instead to outward religious conduct, such as being friendly to others, loving others, being compassionate toward others, and being willing to suffer loss. I tell you, all of these are religious concepts. In terms of human conduct, these are good. However, the church is not formed by these things. Then how is the church formed? The church is formed by the Christ whom we live out. What the church needs today is not the living out of good behavior but the living out of this glorious Christ. The church as the lampstand does not shine forth man&#8217;s good behavior but Christ Himself. Only when Christ is lived out of us and shines forth from us can there be the church life.<p>This morning, I am bold to encourage the young people to go forth to spread the testimony of the church to every place. I hope that you will not repeat the history of Christianity. Rather, I hope that no matter how many of you go to a locality, there will immediately be a living testimony. What is a living testimony? It is Christ. You must let people see that the church is not Christianity, nor a religion, nor outward conduct, but it is the glorious Christ being lived out of His members.<p>We must have this kind of subjective experience; even it should be so subjective that we can say, &#8220;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&#8221; Furthermore, it should be to such an extent that not only can we say this, but even those who observe us can testify, &#8220;I have been watching you for about half a year, and I truly sense that you are extraordinary people. What you live out is not humanly possible.&#8221; This should be the proper condition. Perhaps others can only say to you, &#8220;Your patience is tremendous. You are also quite meek. In all things you are willing to suffer loss while letting others take advantage of you. You are so good. You are a very benevolent person!&#8221; If you go to a place and receive this kind of praise from others, I tell you, your testimony is a failure because you are not testifying the church. The church is not a testimony of a benevolent person but a testimony of Christ. You need to live out a life that no one can describe yet they would admit that it is not anything humanly possible. This is the testimony of the church. This is the recovery that the Lord wants today. This recovery is not doctrines or regulations, but the living Christ being lived out from within us.<h2 class=head1>BEING WATCHFUL IN PRAYER TO ENTER INTO EXPERIENCE IN REALITY</h2><p>This message uses Scripture verses that are very familiar to you. I hope that you will pray-read them carefully and fellowship about them thoroughly until these words enter into you, and you also truly enter into these words. Thus, you can have this experience: &#8220;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me. Daily I give all the ground within me to Christ. Daily I allow Him to be formed in me. Daily I allow Him to make His home in me. I take Him as my life, as my disposition, and as my person. I let Him be my &#8216;I.&#8217; For me, to live is He.&#8221; This is Christ and not Christianity. This is the church and not an organization.<p>This requires us to watch and pray. We need to be watchful in all things and not allow anything to distract us from Christ. Do not let your temper and your disposition trouble you, causing you to be distracted from Christ. You should say, &#8220;Satan, get behind me! I do not pay attention to my temper or my disposition. I only pay attention to the Christ who lives in me. I let Him live in me, I let Him be formed in me, and I let Him make home in me.&#8221; This is the condition that the Lord wants today.<p>If from today onward, these words can hit home in all of us, bringing us into this experience, then everything will be a success. The churches in all the localities will definitely be living and will bear a proper testimony. You need to pray and pray, pray in every way, praying until you get out of yourself and get into Christ. Pray to the extent that you neither pay attention to your circumstances nor care for your own condition. Pray until you are on the Mount of Transfiguration, where you see no one except Jesus alone. Go on to pray that the churches in all the localities will bear the testimony of a living Christ.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>SANCTIFICATION, TRANSFORMATION, AND CONFORMATION</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scriptures reading: 1 Pet. 1:2a; Rom. 15:16; 6:19b, 22; 12:2a; 8:29; 2 Cor. 3:17-18</h1><p>Our knowledge of the Scriptures is often veiled by our natural concepts. It seems we are not able to avoid our concepts when we come to read the Scriptures. Therefore, we do not have any understanding of the many profound truths in the Scriptures concerning subjective experiences. When reading the Bible, almost all Christians read only the letter; they read superficially. Consequently, they do not gain any light or revelation concerning the real things in the hidden places.<h2 class=head1>THREE DIFFICULT TERMS</h2><p>There are three matters we may have noticed in the Scripture verses above. Concerning these matters, many know only the terms but do not have any idea as to what they mean. What are these three things? The first thing is sanctification. It is generally called &#8220;holy purity&#8221; in Chinese. However, in the original language of the Scriptures, this word does not have the notion of purity; instead, it is full of the meaning of separation. So, we see it is not purity; it is sanctification. To be truly sanctified is not a matter of being made pure but a matter of being separated, being set apart. The second thing is transformation. Most Chinese know the term for transformation, but they may not understand it in an accurate and proper way. This term denotes not merely a change but a chemical change, as in chemistry. The third thing is conformation. It is not hard to understand this term in the Chinese language, but it is not so easy to understand it with respect to the subjective, spiritual experiences. Due to our lack of subjective, spiritual experiences, we seem to know these terms when we read the Scriptures, but in reality we do not understand them at all.<p>I started to read the Bible fifty years ago. When I came across terms such as sanctification, transformation, and conformation, my understanding was altogether according to my natural concepts. Concerning sanctification, or &#8220;holy and pure&#8221; in Chinese, I thought that as long as I did not commit any sin or do anything wrong, then I was holy and pure. If I looked serious and remained quiet while others were joking and laughing, then I was holy and pure. Concerning transformation, I did not understand its spiritual meaning. Concerning conformation, because the Chinese Bible translated to be conformed into to imitate, I knew its literal meaning, but I knew nothing of its spiritual significance. I lacked the subjective, spiritual experience, and I also did not have the guidance of those who were experienced. Fifty years ago when I was the same age as some of the young people here, I did not have the help you are receiving today. The experiences I gained in ten years could not be compared with the experiences you have now gained in half a year. Because you have received guidance, it is easy for you to understand the spiritual things. However, even tonight I still do not have the confidence that many among us have a thorough experience of these three matters.<p>What is sanctification? What is transformation? What is conformation? I know that many of you have listened to messages and have read books on these subjects; yet I still would say that you probably have not had enough experiences. At this time we see that the leading of the Lord among us is for us to have a thorough view of these inward, subjective experiences. Our burden is to help you, the younger generation, know the way of the Lord&#8217;s recovery.<h2 class=head1>SANCTIFICATION</h2><p>Based upon the experiences of many years I can say that sanctification is the addition of the divine element into us. For example, there are five cups of pure water here, and you can see that they are all the same. But when you add tea into one of these cups of water, the components in that cup will be different. Among the five cups of water, only one cup has tea, and the other four do not. Therefore, this cup of water that has tea in it has undergone &#8220;tea-ification.&#8221; This illustration explains the meaning of sanctification.<p>Before we were saved, we were all cups of pure water at best. As a matter of fact we were not pure; we were all cups of contaminated water. On the day we were saved, however, the Spirit of God entered into us. This Spirit of God is the divine element, which is God Himself. God Himself was added into us. We have something additional in us which is the element of God. To have this additional element is to be sanctified.<p>Of the five cups of water, four do not have tea added into them; they are common. Only one has tea added into it, so it is separated. There is a distinction between this cup and the other four, and this distinction lies in the element of tea. When tea was first added into the water, only the center showed a change in color, but after a little time and a little stirring, the element of tea spread from the center to the circumference. At the beginning, the appearance of the tea was present only in the middle of the water, but after a period of time the characteristic of tea permeated the whole cup of water. Thus, the whole cup of water was &#8220;tea-ified.&#8221; This is the meaning of sanctification spoken of in the Scriptures.<p>Of course, in the Bible, sanctification has both the objective, positional aspect and the subjective, dispositional aspect. Positional sanctification is like that which is recorded in Matthew 23:17. When a piece of gold is in an ordinary home, it is common. However, when it is placed in the holy temple to overlay the walls, it is immediately sanctified. This is because this piece of gold is different in position from all the other pieces of gold. All the other pieces of gold are in a common position; only this piece of gold, being placed in the temple, has been sanctified. This is positional sanctification.<p>However, the sanctification mentioned in Romans 15:16, 6:19, and 22 is not positional but dispositional. This may be compared to the cup of water that has an ingredient added into it. There is not a change in its position; rather, there is an addition to its composition. Therefore, this is not positional sanctification but dispositional sanctification.<p>Now I would like to ask you a question. After we are saved, we love the Lord and want to pursue the Lord. We pursue &#8220;holiness&#8221; because we see it in our reading of the Bible. Therefore, those who were always joking in the past do not joke anymore. Those who previously were quick and blunt in speaking and thus easily offended others now learn to be slow in their speaking. Those who used to criticize others now restrain themselves from speaking loosely. What would you say about this? I say that this is the sanctification in our natural concept; it is not the sanctification spoken of in the Bible. The sanctification referred to in the Scriptures is that we open ourselves to the Lord from our spirit and let the Lord come into us. It is not a matter of joking or of not joking, nor is it a matter of criticizing or not criticizing others. It is not any of these things. These are all matters in the religious world. Do not remain in that world. Today we are not in the realm of religion but in the realm of life. It is not that we change our behavior outwardly; rather, it is that we open our entire being from within and let the Lord, the living Spirit, infuse Himself into us. When His divine element has been infused into us and has increased in us, this is sanctification.<p>It is not so important whether or not you joke, whether or not you offend others, and whether or not you criticize others. Forget all of these things! I often say that if not joking or not criticizing others is considered holy, then the statue of Mary in the Catholic cathedrals must be the holiest one. That stone statue does not lose its temper, nor offend people, nor criticize, nor joke; it maintains the same posture from the beginning of the year to the end. Do you consider that situation holiness? That is not holiness; that is something belonging to the religious realm. We have been in the environment of the religious world too long. Do not stay there any longer. Forgive me for saying this, but even some of the young people who have come into the church are still somewhat influenced by religion to try to live a &#8220;holy&#8221; life. I am afraid that up to now you still have such a concept.<p>Let me tell a story here. After the war in 1946, the brothers in Nanking invited me to the church there. One day a sister who came from Shanghai acted very much like the statue of Mary you see in the Catholic cathedrals. She was very refined, neither too fast nor too slow, and was greatly appreciated by the brothers and sisters. She came to Nanking while I was in Shanghai attending a conference. When I returned to Nanking, the brothers came to me and said, &#8220;Brother Lee, thank goodness! We now have a sister who is truly holy!&#8221; Immediately I answered, &#8220;Only the statue of Mary in the Catholic cathedral is better than this sister!&#8221; Not only the brothers there in Nanking had that concept of holiness, but I believe even tonight many of you brothers also have the same concept. Suppose I carry a Bible and come into this room with deliberate steps, and then I slowly open the Bible; you will all surely appreciate me. Suppose, however, I walk in with quick steps and just put the Bible on the stand. Surely you would think, &#8220;This Brother Lee is not sufficiently holy or spiritual.&#8221; Am I right?<p>I illustrate just this much to show you that today not only the unbelievers but even Christians, including the Christians among us, are not that serious about things in the religious realm; they do not understand what sanctification is. Sanctification is neither to be quiet nor to be noisy. Sanctification is neither to refrain from losing your temper nor to be free to lose your temper. Instead, sanctification is the addition of the element of God into you to make you distinct from others. This distinction lies not in the fact that you refrain from laughing while others laugh or that you remain standing while others run. These things may make you distinct but they do not make you holy. To be made holy, to be sanctified, is to have God&#8217;s element added into you whether you are laughing or you are not laughing. In order to have this element added into you, you must open to the Lord and call on Him from your spirit, &#8220;O Lord!&#8221; Whenever you have such a little opening and call, &#8220;O Lord,&#8221; His element, His Spirit, will be added and increased in you. In this way you will be sanctified.<p>This dispositional sanctification, of course, is in varying degrees. In adding tea into water, the more tea you add, the stronger the flavor of tea will be; the less tea you put in, the weaker the flavor will be and the fainter its color. In like manner, our sanctification is of different degrees. With certain brothers and sisters you may sense a strong flavor of the divine element, while with other brothers and sisters, you sense that the flavor of the divine element, the element of sanctification, is there but is not that strong.<h2 class=head1>TRANSFORMATION</h2><p>What then is the effect of sanctification? Sanctification is the cause, and its effect is transformation. Transformation is not merely an outward change; it is a metabolic process. Furthermore, transformation is by life; it is organic.<p>We know that metabolism is a physiological function; it cannot take place in non-organic things. Let me give a good illustration. Suppose someone has a face that looks pale. How can he make his face have a rosy color? Generally people would apply some reddish cosmetics to make the face look beautiful. But this is not transformation. Instead, this is similar to the work done in funeral homes. The reformation advocated by many moralists and religionists is just this kind of work. This kind of outward change does not involve the organic process of metabolism. However, if this person were to turn to the way of life by taking in a good amount of nutritious food and by exercising daily, this would improve his metabolism so that the new nutrients will replace his old elements. Thus, after a month the color of his face will become rosy. This is the meaning of the transformation spoken of in the Scriptures.<p>In the process of spiritual metabolism something new replaces the old element. What is this &#8220;new&#8221; thing? We said previously that sanctification is the addition of the element of God into you. The element of God is the new thing. When we are saved, our inner spirit has been made alive. This regenerated spirit, the inner man, is an organism. When the element of God, which is the Spirit of God, is added into us, the organic function within us is activated to discharge the old things and to replace them with the new element. This spiritual metabolism brings to us an organic transformation.<p>I grew up in Christianity and frequently listened to the preaching of pastors. While growing up, I also read some of the Chinese ancient books that had a special emphasis on filial piety, brotherly submission, honesty, and modesty. After reading these things, I began to put a question mark on Christianity. I considered this way: &#8220;The Bible speaks about loving others, and Confucian teachings refer to being forgiving toward others. What is the difference between the two?&#8221; In addition, one day a foreign pastor came and told us that the Bible teaches exactly the same as Confucius. After listening to him, I said to myself, &#8220;If this is the case, why should we believe in the Christian religion?&#8221; Because I was affected by what he said, I grew cold toward the Christian religion. Afterward, when I saw that the pastors also smoked and drank liquor, I felt even more convinced that there was no difference. Therefore, I stayed away from Christianity.<p>However, the Lord was merciful. One day He brought me back, and I was genuinely saved. After I was saved, I was puzzled about the difference between the &#8220;love&#8221; mentioned in the Bible and the &#8220;forgiveness&#8221; referred to by Confucius. For many years I did not get an answer. Then after reading the Scriptures and some good spiritual books, and after having some experiences of my own, I gradually realized that the forgiveness Confucius spoke of is the outcome of our being taught, while the love mentioned in the Scriptures is the issue of God living out from within us. This is not an outward doing; instead, it is the outflow of life.<p>One day this light shone upon me, and I was so happy that I became speechless. Hallelujah! That day I saw that the virtues in the Scriptures are not the result of man&#8217;s work or doing. Rather, they are the living out, the overflowing, of God from within us. This is what I saw initially. Then after some years I also saw that these virtues come from transformation. Tonight if you open yourself and let the Spirit fill you, you will be filled with love. To be sure, this love is an overflow, but it is still not the love that comes from transformation. It takes time to have the love that comes from transformation.<p>There are two kinds of genuine love that originate from God: one comes out as an overflow, and the other one comes out of transformation. The overflowing love is changeable. Today you might be stirred up in your spirit, so love flows out from you. Tomorrow you may not be stirred up, so there will be no overflow of love. Please allow me to say a word to the young people. I have observed that the young people can easily be overflowing in spirit by calling on the name of the Lord, and at such times you are willing to do anything for the brothers and sisters. Nevertheless, you have to know that although today you are overflowing, tomorrow you may not be flowing. As a matter of fact, you might even be &#8220;frozen.&#8221; At such times you need the meeting to fan the flame for you. After half an hour of meeting, your face will open up; after another fifteen minutes, you will thaw out; after another fifteen minutes, you will be filled to the point of overflowing again. This type of love changes very easily.<p>What is the love that comes from transformation? Forgive me for sharing my own testimony. Today it is not easy for me to be either overflowing or frozen, and it is even harder for me to be dried up. Today the love with which I love you is a love that comes out of my transformation. What is transformation? Transformation is God&#8217;s element being constituted into and mingled with our own element.<p>In the New Testament the word transformed is used in only two places. One is in 2 Corinthians 3:18, which says, &#8220;But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&#8221; This verse tells us that we should not have a veiled face. What is the veil? The veil is our concept. The early disciples held the concept of the law, which became the veil on their faces. The apostle Paul told them to break their concept concerning the law and turn their heart from the law to the Lord. Thus, they would have an unveiled face, and they would be like a mirror facing the Lord directly to behold and reflect Him. As a result, they would be transformed into the same image as the Lord from one degree of glory increasing to another degree of glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.<p>Another place transformation is mentioned is Romans 12:2, where it is even clearer: &#8220;And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&#8221; Our mind is not the only part within our being, but it is the leading part. Therefore, here it mentions only the mind. However, when it says that the mind needs to be transformed, we know that the emotion, the will, and the conscience also need to be transformed. Every part within us needs to be transformed. How can we be transformed? We need to open up from deep within to the Lord and let the element of the Lord be added into us. After the element of the Lord has been added into us, we will not be transformed instantly; rather, it will take time for us to be transformed. The Spirit of the Lord as the element added into us moves within us, gradually permeating and saturating our mind. This is transformation. When our mind is permeated with the Spirit of the Lord, it is renewed and transformed.<p>In the same principle, our emotion, our will, and our conscience also need to be transformed in this way. Day after day, we are being sanctified on the one hand, and we are being transformed on the other hand. On the one hand, the divine element is being added into us; on the other hand, this divine element permeates all our inward parts, activating a metabolic function, an organic transformation, in each part. The result is transformation. At such a time, our love will not be the love as an overflow but the love as the issue of transformation. This kind of love does not dry up, and it cannot become frozen. We are not affected by the people, things, and matters around us. This kind of transformation is the mingling of the Lord&#8217;s element with our element, and it is also our becoming one with the Lord. &#8220;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit&#8221; (1 Cor. 6:17). This is a subjective experience.<h2 class=head1>CONFORMATION</h2><p>The next step is to be conformed to the Lord&#8217;s image. Transformation follows sanctification, and conformation comes after transformation. After a period of time sanctification becomes transformation, and the result of transformation is conformation to the image of the Lord. Second Corinthians 3:18 puts transformation and conformation together. It says, &#8220;...being transformed into the same image.&#8221; This is conformation. This is not only to be transformed but also to be shaped. This requires our experiences. After listening to these words, gradually you will experience these items step by step. We need to open up ourselves to the Lord and let the living Spirit of the Lord penetrate us, adding the divine element into us. Thus we will be sanctified. Thank the Lord that when we have this experience, deep within us we can feel that we are different from others. This is not to be proud, not at all; this feeling comes from the reality of sanctification within us.<p>When you let this sanctification linger within you for a while, this sanctification will bring in a metabolic process, causing you to have an organic change. This is transformation. Your mind will be transformed, your emotion will be transformed, and your will also will be transformed. The way you look at things and the way you consider matters will be different from the way you did before. Your feelings of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight will be different from before. Also your decisions, resolutions, and choices will be different from before. This is because a process of metabolic transformation is taking place in your mind, emotion, and will.<p>As a result, when you consider a certain matter, your thought will be the same as that of the Lord Jesus. The way you think when you consider any matter will bear the stamp of the Lord Jesus. The way you love people and the way you decide any matter will also be the same as that of the Lord Jesus. This means that in your practical living you will bear the image of the Lord. This is not an outward improvement, nor is it an outward imitation. Rather, it is that you are inwardly being possessed by the Lord and permeated with the Lord, and His element is permeating your mind, emotion, and will. At this time your thoughts, preferences, and decisions are all the same as the Lord&#8217;s thoughts, preferences, and decisions. Thus, spontaneously you have the image of the Lord; this is conformation.<p>It is not that you read through the Scriptures a few more times, learn more doctrines, or listen to more messages; these are all objective matters. The subjective experience is that you start by opening yourself to the Lord to let the Lord Spirit enter into you and allow His element to be added into you; thus, you will be separated, distinct, from others, and be no longer common. You are separated not by your outward behavior but by the divine element within you. This divine element will permeate and saturate you within, and it will add the element of God into your mind, emotion, and will until your inner being is filled with the divine element. Then your mind will be the same as the Lord&#8217;s mind, your desires will be like the Lord&#8217;s desires, and your decisions will exactly resemble the Lord&#8217;s decisions. All these mean that you have the image of the Lord.<p>Brothers and sisters, today&#8217;s church must be the composition and the totality of such a group of people. What the Lord wants today is a church like this, where all the members are filled with the Lord Spirit and all their inward parts are also saturated with the Lord Spirit, resulting in every part being conformed to the image of the Lord. These are the proper members of the Lord, and in totality this is the Body of Christ, the church of the Lord.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>GROWTH AND BUILDING</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:15-16, 22-24</h1><p>In the past few messages we saw how God was processed to become the life-giving Spirit. Regardless of time and place, everyone who has believed in the Lord has been baptized into this Spirit and has been given to drink this Spirit. Such a person is in the Body of Christ and is a constituent of the church. Thus, Christ is in such a person, living in him, being formed in him, and even making His home in his heart. At this stage, his entire being is filled unto all the fullness of God. Furthermore, we see how this person is also sanctified by the gradual dispensing of the divine element into him, and through this dispensing he is transformed and ultimately conformed to the image of the Son of God.<h2 class=head1>GOD DESIRING TO RECOVER THE SUBJECTIVE TRUTHS THAT HAVE BEEN LOST</h2><p>If we have truly seen this light, we will have to confess that these important points were all lost during the preceding centuries. In today&#8217;s Christianity you can hardly hear anything concerning these subjective truths. What you hear are only human concepts, religious thoughts, or ethical teachings. Therefore, we must see that these subjective truths are what God desires to recover today. Although I know that in the past you heard some of these points, we must confess that our practical experience is insufficient. We do not have enough experience of allowing the divine element to sanctify and transform our entire being, and we have very little of the metabolic, organic transformation. We easily fall into the concept of outwardly improving our behavior. After believing in the Lord, we love Him, pursue Him, live in the church life, and even participate in His service. At this time, we often spontaneously try to improve or change ourselves. Our intention is proper and pure; we want to live before the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints and be like one who serves God in the church. Nevertheless, we must admit that these ideas are still human concepts and religious thoughts which also have the flavor of ethics. They are not our subjective experience of the God who was processed through incarnation, death, and resurrection to be joined with us that we may become a part of Himself. We still lack this kind of experience. Therefore, I hope that first we will speak these things, and by speaking them over and over they will become our experience.<p>The stratagem of Satan is always to take away what we have heard. This is similar to what we are told by the Lord Jesus in the parable in Matthew 13, that the word of the kingdom of the heavens is like the seeds that fell beside the way and were immediately devoured by the birds. The principle today is the same. The messages we preach are not religious or ethical doctrines, nor are they according to the natural human concept; rather, they are out of God&#8217;s revelation. However, we must confess that even though we have heard these words, we still lack the subjective experience. Therefore, I hope that these words will be recovered among us first. We need to fellowship about them and speak them again and again, so that we may truly understand what it means for us to be baptized into the Triune God, into Christ, into the death of Christ, and into His Body, and to be given to drink one Spirit. We must also understand what it is for Christ to live in us, be formed in us, and make His home in us that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God. We also need to comprehend what it means for the divine element to increase in us in order to sanctify and saturate us that we may be organically transformed and thereby be conformed to the image of the Son of God. Ultimately, we will be inwardly filled with Him, we will abide in Him, and we will become the one Body, which is the church. I repeat that we need to constantly fellowship these matters with thorough prayer until we practically enter into these experiences.<h2 class=head1>HOLDING TO TRUTH IN LOVE</h2><p>At this time I want to speak on a few points in Ephesians 4:15-16 and 22-24. These may be considered the truths that are the most deeply buried in Christianity. People in Christianity do not mention these points, and even if they do, their teachings are according to religious concepts and do not take care of the essence of the revelation. Therefore, in this message every point in these few verses of the Bible will be new.<p>The first point is holding to truth in love (v. 15). I believe that eighty percent of you here do not know what it means to hold to truth in love. The Chinese Bible translates this phrase as &#8220;speaking the truth in love,&#8221; but this is too natural. Because the translators of the Bible lacked both the experience and the knowledge, they could only come up with this kind of translation despite all their time and effort. When I was young and came together with young Christians, we often encouraged one another to &#8220;speak the truth in love.&#8221; This was very shallow and low. The meaning here, however, is to hold to truth in love. The love here is not just a matter of loving man but of loving God and of loving His economy, His move, and His eternal plan.<h2 class=head1>GROWING UP INTO THE HEAD, CHRIST, IN ALL THINGS</h2><p>This verse continues by saying: &#8220;We may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.&#8221; It is true that we are already in Christ and Christ is already in us, but you must know that in many things you are not in Christ; rather, you are still outside of Him. Why? Because there is not enough growth in your spiritual life. It is like having a cup of water into which you put some tea leaves. First the water in the center of the cup becomes the color of tea, but the water at the perimeter has yet to have the color of tea. If you say that this cup of water does not have tea in it, you are wrong; however, there is still a lot of water that is not tea. In the same way, even though you have been saved and are in Christ, when you look at your practical living, you are almost the same as the Gentiles. Nothing of your practical living is in Christ; rather, everything is outside of Christ. This is because you have not grown up. This means that there is not enough divine element added into your being. Hence, you have not grown up into Christ in your every part.<p>Thank the Lord that no matter what our situation was, when we came into the churches in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, we heard this kind of word. I remember very clearly in 1958 the first time I spoke a message in Manila on growing up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ. I said that for the building up of the church, we must all practically grow up into Christ in all things. In what things do we need to grow up into Christ? For example, in our attitude and in our speaking we need to grow up into Christ. All things means everything, without exception. Let me give another example: It is a good thing for the young brothers and sisters to get married, but it is also a test. Before you get married, you both think that you are like &#8220;saints,&#8221; &#8220;holy&#8221; persons, but after you get married, your &#8220;holiness&#8221; is tested. You are forced to confess that you have not grown up into Christ in so many things, especially in the matter of speaking with your spouse. The sisters all speak like Mary when they are with the elders, but it is an altogether different story when they are with their husbands. The brothers are very proper when they speak in the church meetings, but their true color is revealed when they are alone with their wives. There is almost no growth into Christ in your speaking; rather, your speaking is ten thousand percent outside of Christ. Perhaps your lips are only temporarily grown up into Christ during your morning watch. But when your morning watch meeting is over and you return home, your lips grow back into Adam. Today, however, we must have the reality of holding to truth in love.<p>What is truth? Or, what is reality? Truth is the Christ you have experienced. It should not be that only when we go to morning watch we begin to mean business and let our lips, tongue, words, and tone of voice grow up into Christ, but then when the morning watch meeting is over, everything goes back into Adam. This is not truth; this is not the reality. We must hold to truth in love; we should hold to truth not only outside of morning watch but even in our dreams during our sleep. The Chinese have a saying that means &#8220;to indulge in wishful thinking,&#8221; but I tell the young people that you should not give your thoughts free rein; rather, you should grow up into Christ.<p>We need to grow up. Growing up is not of our own effort or work. Growing up is a matter of constantly opening our being to allow the divine element to continuously increase within us. It is only by the increase of the divine element that we can grow up in His element. The reason we are outside of Christ is because we lack the divine element. The divine element must be continually added into us, so that we can grow up into the Head, Christ, in the divine element. When the divine element is added into a certain part of our being, we grow up into the Head, Christ, in that part. What is this for? It is for the building up of the church. Thus, we hold to truth in love that we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.<h2 class=head1>BEING JOINED TOGETHER AND BEING KNIT TOGETHER</h2><p>Verse 16 says, &#8220;Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together.&#8221; Out from whom is a continuation of the phrase grow up into Him. If you have not grown up into Him, how can you be out from Him? I would say that if by this time you have grown up into Him, I have grown up into Him, and we all have grown up into the Head, Christ, in all things, then the entire Body now is out from Him, being joined together. This kind of being joined together is not in our naturalness, where your disposition matches my disposition and thus we are joined together. That kind of being joined together will end up in a quarrel after a short period of time. Joining together out of ourselves is absolutely unreliable; our being joined together must be out from Him.<p>This verse continues to say, &#8220;Through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part.&#8221; In our bodies there are many joints of supply, such as the shoulders, knees, and hips. In the Body of Christ, some brothers and sisters are tendons and others are joints. Tendons are for joining, while joints are for supplying. &#8220;Through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part&#8221; means that every part has its function. Consider my little finger. It is not a joint of supply, but it is a part. Whenever my ear itches to the point that I cannot stand it any longer, this little finger is very useful. If I did not have this little finger to function but only had my thumb, it would not be practical. In the same way, you may not be a large shoulder or a knee, yet you are at least a little finger with your own function. If you have not grown up into the Head, however, your function cannot be manifested; you can only be like a so-called church member at the worship services in today&#8217;s Christianity. The &#8220;church members&#8221; in today&#8217;s Christianity do almost nothing but attend worship services. For this reason, in such a situation there is absolutely no building up of the Body. This is not the Lord&#8217;s recovery. We are against this, and we renounce this. Today we desire to have a living Body and a testifying church. Where is the testifying church? It comes when every part exercises its function. However, this does not mean that merely because I encourage you, you now are able to function; rather, you need to grow up into the Head, Christ. You must grow. As you grow, your function will become manifested. The more you grow, the more your function will be manifested. The measure of function that is manifested depends entirely on the measure of your growth.<p>It is through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part that the Body can be knit together. I have known and coordinated with a few brothers for more than thirty years now, and by the Lord&#8217;s grace we can boast that we have certainly been knit together. What is the reason? It is because we have practiced growing up into Christ so that every joint of the rich supply can release its supply and that the operation of each one part can be manifested. In this way we are knit together. It is not because we have a thirty-year-old friendship in the Lord, nor is it because we have stood shoulder to shoulder to fight for the Lord&#8217;s recovery and have gained an inexpressible affection for one another. That kind of relationship is unreliable, and that kind of knitting together is not solid. We, however, can testify by the Lord&#8217;s grace that the condition among us is a knitting together. Furthermore, there are many American brothers and sisters here today with whom I can boast to the enemy that a condition of being joined together and of being knit together exists among us also. It is not emotional, nor is it a matter of having common likes and interests; rather, it is through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part.<h2 class=head1>CAUSING THE GROWTH OF THE BODY UNTO THE BUILDING UP OF ITSELF IN LOVE</h2><p>The knitting together causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love. What is this? This is the practical, subjective experience. This is growth and building. In the last message we spoke of sanctification, transformation, and conformation; in this message we will see growth and building.<p>You may frequently pray, &#8220;O Lord, cause us to be built up.&#8221; It is true that the Lord will hear your prayer, but He will immediately require you to grow. Where does the secret of growth lie? It is in sanctification, transformation, and conformation. If you are not sanctified, transformed, and conformed inwardly, it will be hard for you to grow. To grow up is another way of saying to be sanctified, transformed, and conformed. In other words, if we look at this from another angle, sanctification, transformation, and conformation are simply growth. The amount of transformation you have determines the measure of your growth. Your growth depends on your transformation, and transformation depends on the divine element being added into you. When the divine element is added into you, you are transformed and conformed inwardly. When you have the growth, you grow up into Christ.<p>It is not sufficient to merely be zealous and burning; you and I need to be transformed and to grow. We need to have the element of God constantly increasing in us until we are saturated with the divine element. In this way we will grow up into Christ. Then, if we are the joints of supply, our supply will be able to come out; if we are the parts, our function will be manifested. Thus, we will be knit together and will cause the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.<p>Dear brothers and sisters, can this teaching be found in Christianity today? Absolutely not. However, today among us it is not enough only to have this teaching; the Lord&#8217;s goal among us is to recover this reality-the reality of growth and building.<h2 class=head1>PUTTING OFF THE OLD MAN AND PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN</h2><p>Now we come to see Ephesians 4:22-24, which is connected to 4:15-16. Verse 22 says, &#8220;That you put off...the old man,&#8221; and verse 23 says, &#8220;And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind.&#8221; Then verse 24 says, &#8220;And put on the new man.&#8221; Christianity today also speaks these words but does not apply them properly. What is the old man? What is the new man? You must know that we should not define any term in the Bible by the term itself. You must look at the context around the term and at the entire book; you must even look at the entire Bible. If you look at the context here, you will realize that the old man and the new man are not individual but corporate. The new man here is the church life. Ephesians 2:14-15 says that the Lord has broken down the enmity in His flesh that He might create the two, the Jewish and the Gentile believers, in Himself into one new man. We see in the book of Ephesians that the new man is not individual but corporate, and it refers to the church. Since the new man is corporate, the old man, of course, must also be corporate. To put it simply using today&#8217;s language, the old man is society. The old man in Ephesians is the social life, and the new man is the church life. Putting off the old man is putting off the social life, and putting on the new man is putting on the church life.<p>Your putting off your social life and putting on the church life does not depend on any change in your outward activity; rather, it altogether depends on your growing up into Christ in all things. If you grow up into Christ in all things, will you still be able to have anything in the social life? It will be impossible! For example, at the time of the Mid-autumn Festival every family eats moon cakes and gives moon cakes to others as gifts. If during this season, you have not grown up into Christ in all things, you will not be able to keep yourself from following others to observe the festival. You might say that it is too hard, but I have the assurance that if you grow up into Christ in all things, the Mid-autumn Festival will fall off from you. I can testify that because I have been living the new man for a long time, I do not even know when it is time for the Mid-autumn Festival, despite the fact that I am an old Chinese man. Thank the Lord that the Mid-autumn Festival is a thing of the past for me. We put off the old man and put on the new man because we have grown up into Christ.<p>To help the brothers and sisters understand, sometimes I use putting on clothes to illustrate this matter. Someone may come into the church; he puts on the church life and shouts, &#8220;Hallelujah! I have seen the church!&#8221; But in actuality it is just as if he draped a jacket around his shoulders, and the jacket falls off after a short time. This is an outward kind of putting on. Another one may be a little clearer and say, &#8220;I have seen the church.&#8221; But his case is like putting an arm into one sleeve of the jacket; after a while when he moves around, the jacket still falls off. Yet another one may be even better and say, &#8220;I have seen the church. Thank the Lord, it is so good for me to be in the church life today! The church is my home. Home, home, sweet home.&#8221; This case is like putting the jacket on properly. But the next day suddenly one of the elders may be rude to him, so he becomes unhappy and unbuttons one of the buttons. The next week another person is rude to him, so he unbuttons another button. Then after two weeks a young brother offends him, and by this time his church life is nearly gone. He puts off the church life in just the same way that he put it on, saying, &#8220;Forget it! What kind of church life is this!&#8221; Then he takes off the jacket and throws it on the floor.<p>These kinds of putting on are not a growing up. Do not forget that the putting on in verse 24 is the growing up in verses 15 and 16. In the Bible to put on means to grow. It does not mean that you have a layer of skin and on top of that you put a layer of clothing; rather, it means that the one layer of skin grows. When you have grown up, it will not matter if the elders make you unhappy or if a certain brother offends you or even if all the angels are rude to you; you will have no way to put off the church life because it will have already grown and become part of you. The church life will be grown into your skin, your blood, and your marrow; you will remain a man for the church even after you die. I am not at all joking about this. It has been forty-five years since I came into the church in July of 1932. In these forty-five years I have tasted different things, things that are sour, sweet, bitter, and spicy hot. I did not eat &#8220;almond-flavored pudding&#8221; every day. Many times the situation was hotter than the spiciest Szechwan or Hunan foods, but I had to take it even if I did not like it. Sometimes I had to hold my nose to eat it.<p>The new man is not like a garment that is put on outwardly; it grows from within. How do we know that it grows from within? You see this in Ephesians 4. Between the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man, it says, &#8220;And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind.&#8221; Is this not something inward? This is not an outward activity. It is not a matter of saying, &#8220;Now all the other people are observing the Mid-autumn Festival, but I am not observing it. Rather, I am running to the church meeting.&#8221; No, it is a matter of being renewed in the spirit of your mind. This is not outward but inward. This is also subjective, and it is so subjective that within you there is only Christ and the church. All other things are dispensable: if you can have them, you have them, and if not, it does not matter. Only Christ and the church are absolutely necessary. Furthermore, Christ and the church have been constituted into each one of your cells. Others might compel you to eat moon cakes, but it would not matter. It does not mean that because you have eaten moon cakes, you have thrown away the church life. Even after eating the moon cakes, you can still say, &#8220;Christ is my satisfaction, and the church is my living. It does not matter whether or not I eat moon cakes; what matters is Christ and the church.&#8221;<p>This should be our experience today. The church is not a social group or a family association; the church is Christ wrought into us. We put off our social life of the former days and put on the church life of today. From beginning to end, everything and all things are Christ being manifested in the church. This is the golden lampstand. We all have been baptized into this Christ, and we all drink of Him. This Christ lives in us, is formed in us, and makes His home in us. He continually adds His divine element into us, thoroughly saturating our entire being, and thus we are transformed and conformed to His image. We spontaneously grow up into Him in all things and spontaneously put off the old man (the social life) and put on the new man (the church life). This is a great metabolic process in which new elements come in to replace the old elements, which have become waste to be discharged. We all have an inward, organic transformation, and the result is the church. This is the church life.<p>Dear brothers and sisters, today our fighting is for this, our prayer is for this, and our testimony is for this. This is the Lord&#8217;s recovery today. The Lord today must have this testimony in each locality on the earth before He can return and His kingdom be brought in. May the Lord have mercy on us that we all may see this truth that was lost and now has been recovered. This is the recovery; it is something subjective, and it is an inward experience. These matters are not doctrines; rather, they should all become our experience. Among us, whether young or old, whether brothers or sisters, all should say, &#8220;O Lord, grant me mercy to participate in this testimony. O Lord, do not lose me, and do not let me lose this testimony of Yours.&#8221; For the past twenty centuries, this subjective truth has been buried, but thank the Lord that today it has been resurrected to become a recovered, resurrected truth among us. We should live in it.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>THE GREAT MYSTERY OF GODLINESS, GOD MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 3:15-16; Rom. 8:30; Col. 3:4; 1 Cor. 2:7; 1 Pet. 5:10a; 2 Thes. 1:10</h1><p>In these past few days we have seen more and more clearly that the church is the result of our subjective experience of the Lord. We have also seen that our subjective experience of the Lord must be entirely in the Spirit and related to life, and it must also be the Lord Himself entering into us not merely as our life but also as the constituent of our spiritual being. These matters are not objective but are subjective experiences within us. Today the Lord is the life-giving Spirit. We can receive Him into us, and He can enter into us as our life and even live in us as our person. Thus, He becomes our element and is the inward constituent of our spiritual being. We all experience this Lord together and are built up together in this One to become the one Body. These matters are absolutely inward, subjective experiences. It is not that we have an outward change or that we merely have a kind of outward expression. Rather, we have become completely new in our essence, life, and nature. This is Christ who died and resurrected and now has been wrought into us to become the constituent of our spiritual being, and this also is the church.<p>This knowledge of the subjective aspect of the church has been completely lost over the past nineteen centuries. If you read church history, you will see that even after Luther accomplished the Reformation, those pure-hearted Christians did not have such a deep knowledge of the church. They did not see that the church is Christ constituted into His believers. Because this light was buried, this subjective truth was hidden in the Bible and was not released. Over the past several hundred years there have been many believers in the Lord, and all have felt that they were in the church and have become the church. Nevertheless, in reality they have not had the light of the church&#8217;s being joined to Christ as one spirit. Today the Lord wants to recover what He planned in the beginning and what was realized at the time of Pentecost.<p>If you read the book of Acts carefully, you will see that the condition of those early saints described in chapters two through four was simply Christ living in them. Christ became their life, their human nature, and their person. For them to live was Christ, just as the apostle said. Therefore, according to the revelation of the New Testament, the church is the mystery of godliness, which is God manifested in the flesh.<h2 class=head1>THE MYSTERY OF GODLINESS</h2><p>What is the church? The church is God manifested in the flesh. This is a mystery. At this time, if we are in a normal condition, one that is up to the standard, God will be manifested when we are meeting here together in His name and in His Spirit. Apparently we are ordinary people who are outwardly no different from any other people, but there is a mystery within us. This mystery is the manifestation of God in the flesh. What kind of mystery is this? It is the mystery of godliness.<p>In the New Testament, godliness does not refer to being well-behaved, self-composed, or God-fearing. These are not godliness. In the New Testament, godliness is God manifesting His image. When God is manifested, it is because of a certain condition in your being, and that condition is godliness. For example, a person might honor and obey his parents very much, but what is manifested in that person is honoring of parents. Some people are very moral, proper, and righteous, well-behaved in everything, so you see morality in them. However, Christians should not manifest only these things. Strictly speaking, when we truly live in the seven Spirits and walk by the Spirit, the condition that is displayed in us is not only honoring of parents or morality but also God being manifested. This is far superior to honoring of parents or morality. There is a condition in a brother that cannot be described by human language. It is hard to say whether it is his honoring, being humble, or some other virtue. According to the Bible, it is godliness. Godliness is God manifested. God is manifested in that person by a certain condition so that people cannot help but glorify God. This condition is godliness.<p>What does the mystery of godliness mean? It means that although we are men-some Chinese, some American, and some Japanese-when we sing and praise, a certain condition is manifested that makes people ask, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; This is not honoring of parents, nor is it morality; instead, it is a kind of indescribable condition. It is not merely noisy activity, nor is it excitement. These people are here in a kind of condition that is hard to describe and very mysterious, so it is difficult for people to understand.<p>If you get very excited when you watch basketball or baseball games, then others immediately know that you are a sports fan. When a baseball fan watches a baseball game, he gets excited. What about us? Here there is no baseball, basketball, or any other kind of ball. There is just a group of people sitting here who are well-behaved. They are neither too excited nor too formal; they neither laugh loudly nor laugh softly, but simply smile warmly. What is really happening here? Moreover, they keep coming here every morning and every evening just to hear such a person speak. He does not speak about astronomy, geography, politics, or military science, and he does not know anything about mathematics, technology, or other matters. Yet it seems they are &#8220;addicted&#8221; and keep coming back to listen. What kind of &#8220;addiction&#8221; is this? This is &#8220;God addiction,&#8221; which is a mystery, the mystery of godliness. In this godliness God is manifested-God is here. This is why 1 Corinthians 14 says that if some unbeliever comes to the meeting, &#8220;falling on his face, he will worship God, declaring that indeed God is among you&#8221; (vv. 24-25). This is the mystery of godliness.<h2 class=head1>GOD MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH</h2><p>This mystery of godliness is God manifested in the flesh. We are here, not as angels, but as men in the flesh, yet God is manifested in the flesh. Some traditional theologians say that God manifested in the flesh refers to the Lord Jesus, who was manifested in the flesh through His incarnation, and that it does not refer to the church. When we gave this testimony in America, because we spoke so boldly, some traditional theologians said that we believe in man&#8217;s evolution into God. They say that we who are in the churches believe we all are evolving into God, that our speaking is a high theory of evolution, and that we are making ourselves gods. Some say, &#8220;In the so-called local churches there is a great heresy because they worship themselves as gods in their meetings. They claim that whenever they meet, God is manifested among them, that they are gods, and that they are one with God. Therefore, this teaching makes them the object of worship.&#8221; This is a slanderous word. The opposers say this because they are blind and do not understand what we are teaching.<h2 class=head1>BOTH CHRIST AND THE CHURCH BEING THE MANIFESTATION OF GOD IN THE FLESH</h2><p>Yes, we have indeed said that when the condition of our meetings is normal, we can say, &#8220;Confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh&#8221; (1 Tim 3:16). The critics, however, say that this word does not refer to the church but to Christ. Therefore, at this time I would ask you to please turn to 1 Timothy 3:16 in your Bible. I hope that among us there are no &#8220;blind ones.&#8221; All the Bible scholars confess that the most difficult matter in expounding the Bible is finding the meaning of the original language. I believe that some of you have a Greek-English interlinear New Testament. If you look at the Greek-English interlinear New Testament, you will see that in 1 Timothy chapter three between verses 15 and 16 there is the conjunction kai, which equals and in English. The Chinese version, however, dropped this word in its translation. According to the original language, verse 15 says, &#8220;The house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.&#8221; Verse 16 continues by saying, &#8220;And...&#8221;; this conjunction clearly shows that the church is not only the three items mentioned in verse 15-the house of God, the pillar of the truth, and the base of the truth. And indicates that the church is something more. This conjunction here is a very important word; it is not an empty word. The church is the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth, and the great mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh. Therefore, according to the original Greek, He who was manifested in the flesh certainly refers to the church. We can say that &#8220;He who was manifested in the flesh&#8221; modifies &#8220;the church&#8221; in verse 15. What is the church? It is the house of God. &#8220;The house of God&#8221; modifies &#8220;the church,&#8221; and &#8220;the pillar and base of the truth&#8221; also modifies &#8220;the church.&#8221; The house of God and the pillar and base of the truth describe what the church is. Verse 16 continues by saying, &#8220;And...great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh.&#8221; Just as &#8220;the house of God&#8221; and &#8220;the pillar and base of the truth&#8221; describe the church, so &#8220;He who was manifested in the flesh&#8221; also describes the church. Thus, if the text is read according to the original Greek, no one can deny that God manifested in the flesh here refers to the church.<p>Furthermore, there is still a solid proof which cannot be overturned, and that is the five items which follow &#8220;He who was manifested in the flesh&#8221;: justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory (v. 16). I would ask you, &#8220;Was the Lord Jesus taken up in glory before or after He was believed on in the world?&#8221; We all know that the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens after His resurrection, so He was taken up in glory before He was preached among the nations and believed on in the world. This would tell us here that &#8220;He who was manifested in the flesh...taken up in glory&#8221; does not refer to Christ, because Christ was taken up in glory before being preached among the nations. The Lord Jesus was first taken up in glory, then the day of Pentecost came, and then He was preached among the nations.<p>But here I would ask you to pay attention to the fact that there is a universal man in the universe whose Head is Christ and whose Body is the church. The Head of this universal man is in glory today, but the Body is not yet in glory. The Head is already in the heavens, while the Body is still on earth. Therefore, according to 1 Timothy 3:16 the sequence of being taken up in glory after being preached among the nations proves that this manifestation of God in the flesh does not refer only to Christ but to the two aspects of Christ: the Head and the Body. The Head has already been taken up in glory, but the Body has yet to be taken up in glory. Whether the Head or the Body, both are the great mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh.<p>I am not here arguing, but I am showing you that traditional theology has deeply damaged people. Those who hold on to traditional theology, on the one hand, confess that the church is the Body of Christ, while on the other hand, they confess that Christ is God manifested in the flesh. Yet they remain stuck in their narrow concepts and are not willing to confess that the Body is also the manifestation of God in the flesh. This is the same as saying that a brother&#8217;s head comes from Taiwan, while his body does not. This is a joke. According to ordinary logic, we all know that if the head is Taiwanese, then the body also must be Taiwanese. If the head is American, then the body also must be American. Therefore, since the Head is God manifested in the flesh, spontaneously the Body also is God manifested in the flesh.<p>The Lord Jesus always considered His members on the earth to be Himself. Remember the record in Acts 9. One day Saul of Tarsus was going to persecute Christians; the Lord appeared to him on the road to Damascus and said to him, &#8220;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&#8221; (v. 4). Saul was astounded and thought to himself, &#8220;You are speaking to me from heaven, but I have not gone to heaven to persecute anyone. I am only persecuting people on earth, so why is a voice from heaven speaking to me today, saying, &#8216;Why are you persecuting Me?&#8217;&#8221; Therefore, he asked, &#8220;Who are You, Lord?&#8221; The Lord said, &#8220;I am Jesus, whom you persecute&#8221; (v. 5). The Lord meant, &#8220;When you persecuted Stephen, you were persecuting Me; when you persecute My disciples, you are persecuting Me.&#8221; Here we clearly see that the Body and the Head are one. Hallelujah!<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH BEING THE GREAT MYSTERY OF GODLINESS, GOD MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH</h2><p>What is the church? In the past few days we have learned many new terms. The church is the reprint of the Holy Spirit with Christ and the place of God&#8217;s infusion. Now we must say that the church is God manifested in the flesh. What is the church? To put it a little more poetically, the church is the great mystery of godliness, which is God manifested in the flesh. I would ask you, however, &#8220;If you are living by your self, and if I am living by my self, and if we all are living by the self, then is the church the manifestation of God in the flesh?&#8221; No! That is merely the manifestation of the natural man in the flesh. In order for the church to be the manifestation of God in the flesh, we must live not by our self but by God. If we live by God and take God as our living and our person, then when we come together, it will be the manifestation of God in the flesh.<p>Let me give a little illustration. Suppose some of the young brothers who live together are talking, laughing, and playing ping-pong before the meeting; some are losing their temper and others are criticizing the saints. Then one brother says, &#8220;It is time for the meeting. Let&#8217;s go!&#8221; You all go to the meeting, and one by one you enter and sit there. Do you think that at such a time this is &#8220;Great is the mystery of godliness&#8221;? I do not think so; rather, I think you would have to say, &#8220;Woe is the pitiful flesh!&#8221; Some brothers and sisters are married; the meeting is at 7:30, but at 6:30 they may begin arguing, and they argue until 7:00. At that time a sister who lives next door may come and say, &#8220;It&#8217;s almost time for the meeting!&#8221; Therefore, this married couple reluctantly goes to the meeting. What is this? This is &#8220;Woe is the quarreling flesh.&#8221; You simply cannot say that these conditions display the great mystery of godliness.<p>What is the church? The church is a group of people who have been called by God, who have received His life and nature, who live by God, and who have the element of God added into them daily, transforming them and being formed within them. They grow in this life, putting off the old living and putting on the new living, which is the church life. Thus, when they come together, they do not need even to speak; all they need to do is sit there, and the angels will say, &#8220;Behold! Great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh.&#8221; This is the church.<p>The church is not a religious organization, nor is it a human gathering. The church is a group of people who have been redeemed and regenerated and who live by God. God is their life, their nature, their person, and their living; when they come together, all the angels will say, &#8220;Confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh.&#8221; This is the church.<p>We must know the church to such an extent that we know the church as the great &#8220;mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh.&#8221; Simply put, the church is the manifestation of God in the flesh. Thank the Lord that although I dare not say that every meeting in the local churches is the manifestation of God in the flesh, I do dare to say that many times when the brothers and sisters in the Lord&#8217;s recovery meet together, even the angels nod their heads and say, &#8220;This is God manifested in the flesh.&#8221; They joyfully say, &#8220;Devil and little demons, look; is this not God manifested in the flesh?&#8221; Even the demons must admit, &#8220;Yes, this is God manifested in the flesh.&#8221; Tonight as we are speaking here, I believe that there is such a condition. Hallelujah! This is the church.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH BEING ON THE WAY TO GLORIFICATION</h2><p>The church is the Body, and the Head is Christ, so the manifestation of God in the flesh here is applied to both. The Head has already been taken up in glory, but the Body is still on the way of being taken up and has not yet entered into glory. Hebrews 2:10 says that God is &#8220;leading many sons into glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect.&#8221; He is the Author, the Captain, the Forerunner, and He has already entered into glory. We are on our way into glory. I would like to tell you that even though you may not know this, all the angels know it. Time after time when we meet, we are walking on the pathway of glory. Whenever we meet, on the one hand, we are the manifestation of God in the flesh, and on the other hand, we are heading for glory. We are on our way into glory. Perhaps one day we will be meeting, and the angels will be around us, saying, &#8220;Look! God is manifested in the flesh!&#8221; Before they have finished speaking, the saints will be raptured one by one into glory. If this happens, I will not feel that it is the least bit strange. I hope that I am not at home looking distressed and complaining to my wife when the Lord comes. Then perhaps my wife will be raptured, and I will be left behind. I hope that I will be meeting together with the saints experiencing the great mystery of godliness, the manifestation of God in the flesh, when I am raptured. I believe that this will happen, because every time we meet we are on the proper way to enter into glory. Our meetings are heading toward glory.<p>The church is the house of God and the pillar and base of the truth. Moreover, the church is the great mystery of godliness as the manifestation of God in the flesh and is being taken up in glory. Thus, this passage has a double application. It applies both to the Lord Jesus and to us, both to the Head and to the Body. I hope that our eyes will be opened here to see that the church is not a doctrine. If it were merely a doctrine, there would not be very much to say. However, when it becomes our subjective experience, we can all sing hallelujah! Every time we come together, it is the manifestation of God in the flesh, and we are heading toward the goal of glory and proceeding toward it. Now we are here allowing God to be expressed; one day we will be taken up in glory. Therefore, the last step of the church&#8217;s subjective experience is glorification.<p>Paul said, &#8220;When Christ our life is manifested, then you also will be manifested with Him in glory&#8221; (Col. 3:4). If today we live by Him and take Him as our life, then one day He will be our glory. Oh, Christ in us has become the hope of glory (Col. 1:27)! We are on our way to glory, and with every meeting we are a little bit closer. We meet every day, and we head toward glory every day. Our goal is just glory. When He is manifested, then we also will be manifested with Him in glory.<p>When you read Romans 8, you can see that those whom God called, first He predestinated, justified, and conformed them, and then He glorified them (vv. 29-30). The last step is to glorify us. This glory is neither coincidental nor temporary; rather, God predestined before the ages for us to have this glory (1 Cor. 2:7). In eternity, before the foundation of the world, God had a plan to glorify us.<p>What is glorification? Today we are all in the flesh, and God wants to be manifested in the flesh. However, when we are raptured, in that instant our flesh will be transfigured. Today God is in the flesh, but in that day our flesh will enter into glory. This will be exactly like what happened to the Lord on the Mount of Transfiguration. Before the Lord ascended the mountain to be transfigured, He was Jesus the Nazarene in the flesh, but when He was transfigured, His flesh entered into glory. When He comes, we will be raptured, and our flesh will enter into glory and be completely transfigured, so that we will be conformed to the body of His glory. That will be our glorification. Today we are the manifestation of God in the flesh; in that day we will enter into glory, and our bodies will be transfigured into the condition of glory.<p>This matter is very subjective. You should never think that glory is merely a realm, that today you are a Christian only on earth, but one day the Lord will use His powerful hand to rapture you from the earth to heaven, instantly placing you in glory, at which time you will shine and be glorified. It is not like that. I tell you that today this glory is within you and me, and this glory is actually the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus today is in us as life. Then in that day He will be manifested from within us as glory. &#8220;Christ in you, the hope of glory&#8221; (Col. 1:27).<p>Second Thessalonians 1:10 says, &#8220;When He comes to be glorified in His saints and to be marveled at in all those who have believed...in that day.&#8221; When we will be raptured at His coming back, not only will we enter into glory, but the Lord Jesus will also be glorified in us. Today the Lord Jesus is still concealed within us and has not yet been manifested, so He cannot come out in glory. But when He comes and raptures us to Himself, He will saturate our entire being to completely glorify Himself from within us. That will be His being glorified in us and being marveled at in that day in all of us who have believed. Glory is a seed that is inside us. This seed within us will grow and develop in us until it breaks forth from our body. That will be the redemption of our body, and that will be our rapture, our entering into glory. Thus, we will be brought into the glory which God predestined for us. Therefore, in the end the church will be a group of redeemed people who have been completely transfigured into glory. This is the ultimate manifestation of the church.<p>Today the church here is the manifestation of God in the flesh, but in that day the church will be a group of redeemed people who have been transfigured into glory. That is the church. The Lord has already spoken to us, and I hope that we will have the light and vision to see that this is the church. The church is the reprint of the Holy Spirit with Christ, the place of God&#8217;s infusion, the manifestation of God in the flesh, and ultimately the flesh transfigured into glory. Hallelujah- this is the church!</body></html>
