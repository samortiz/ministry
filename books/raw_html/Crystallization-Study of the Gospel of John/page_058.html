<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE SONSHIP TO EXPRESS GOD IN HIS FULLNESS</H2><P>God the Father has given His glory to the Son, and this glory is the sonship to express God in His fullness (John 5:26). Fullness means the expressed riches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE GLORY OF THE FATHER<br>BEING CONCEALED IN HIS HUMANITY</H2><P>The glory of the Father was concealed in the shell of Christ's humanity, His flesh. Many who saw and heard Him despised Him and said, "Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not His sisters here with us?" (Mark 6:3). Isaiah 53 says that He did not have any outward beauty for people to desire Him (v. 2). The Father's glory was concealed in His humanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. GLORIFYING THE FATHER</H2><P>He glorified the Father by manifesting Him in His earthly living and ministry (John 17:4). When we live to express God, to manifest God, that is our glorifying God. If we live God and speak God, both our living and ministry are God's glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE SON PRAYING THAT THE FATHER<br>WOULD GLORIFY HIS NAME</H2><P>The Son prayed that the Father would glorify His name, and the Father answered Him, "I have both glorified it and will glorify it again" (John 12:28).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE SON HAVING GIVEN THE FATHER'S GLORY<br>TO HIS BELIEVERS</H2><P>The Son has given the Father's glory to express the Father in His sonship to His believers (John 17:22), who are the many sons of God (Heb. 2:10) and share the same divine sonship with Him.</P>
