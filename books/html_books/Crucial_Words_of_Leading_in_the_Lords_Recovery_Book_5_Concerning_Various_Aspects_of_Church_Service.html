<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book contains eighteen messages released by Brother Witness Lee in the first half of 1985 when he was leading the churches in Taiwan in the practice of the God-ordained way. Chapters 1 through 9 were given from February 5 through 8 to the church in Taipei concerning various aspects of church service. Chapters 10 through 18 were given from April 24 through May 9 in Taipei, Taichung, and Kaohsiung. These chapters cover preaching the gospel and the practice of the small groups. Chapter 15 was spoken by Liu Suey and Andrew Yu on behalf of Brother Witness Lee.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CONCERNING THE GOSPEL IN SCHOOLS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>There are close to eight hundred saints who are burdened for the work in the schools. This is unprecedented among us. We rejoice that the saints are burdened to focus on the gospel work. We must fellowship and pray together concerning the way to advance in the gospel work in the junior high schools, high schools, and colleges.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY<br />
TO SPREAD THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>According to statistics, in Taipei there are about one hundred schools that are either junior high school, high school, or college. If we count only the colleges with a day curriculum, there are twenty-one colleges with about one hundred ten thousand students. If we include the students in junior high school and high school, there are a total of three hundred and seventy thousand students. This means that in the city of Taipei alone, there are three hundred and seventy thousand young people between the ages of twelve and twenty-two. We are in a big fishpond! This is a great matter. With regard to spreading the gospel, this is an unprecedented opportunity in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. With regard to the environment, we thank the Lord for giving us a country that is thriving in every aspect. This country has good security, a calm society, and advanced education. The government grants much freedom to the church and does not interfere with the gospel. The past two thousand years of history show that the gospel, the truth, and the church are a great help to any country or society. Whenever the gospel, the truth, and the church enter a country or a society, they bring in blessing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the propagation of the gospel is aided by the availability of education in Taiwan. When Western missionaries went to China to preach the gospel a hundred years ago, the first problem they encountered was the lack of knowledge among the people, because education was not available. Therefore, most people could carry on a general conversation only about simple things. It was difficult for a person to talk about deeper things. Not many people were educated, and the schools were mostly private. Thus, when Western missionaries went to China to preach the gospel, their preaching was restricted by the ignorance of the people. This forced the missionaries to establish schools.</p>
<p>Today the educational standard in Taiwan is very high. Most Westerners are aware of the fact that the Taiwanese people pay attention to education and that all the parents push their children to study hard. There are also many advertisements in the newspapers for additional help in all kinds of subjects. In fact, education has nearly become an idol in Taiwan. This higher educational standard is a great help to the spread of the truth of the gospel. We do not have to labor to establish schools like the Western missionaries. The church in Taipei has been here for thirty-five years, and the number of saints in the church life is close to seven thousand with around three to four thousand in regular attendance. We can say that the church is full of resources.</p>
<p>We have three hundred seventy thousand &ldquo;fish&rdquo; around us, and many saints are burdened for the gospel in the schools. This standard of education and the backing of the church are our &ldquo;capital.&rdquo; With this &ldquo;capital,&rdquo; we need to spend time to study a scientific way to preach the gospel in the schools. In the past we distributed gospel tracts at the gate of a school and smiled even when we were mocked. Although this conduct was noble and we could say we had the Spirit of Christ, our method was primitive. It was not scientific. In every aspect the world is improving and progressing even in the way companies package their products. In the earlier days fruit stores used old newspaper to wrap their products for their customers, but today the packaging is very refined. Preaching the gospel like we did thirty-five years ago is an indication that the church has fallen behind the times.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRUTH BEING UNCHANGEABLE<br />
BUT THE METHODS OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL<br />
BEING CHANGEABLE</h2>
<p>We can never change the truth in the Bible, but there is room for change in the way we preach and spread the gospel. Before the nineteenth century, there were no trains or steam ships. There were only wagons on the land and sailboats in the water. In the 1930s I was laboring in northern China. When I was preparing to travel to the inland area with several co-workers to preach the gospel, the Sino-Japanese war broke out following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, and the entire country was thrust into a state of preparing for war. All domestic trains were stopped. In order to travel to the inland area, we had to use an ox cart. We set off at seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning, but by nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening we had covered less than thirty miles. With all the jolting and tossing on the way, my joints were quite sore by the time we arrived at our destination. Nowadays a direct flight from Los Angeles to Taipei takes only twelve hours, and the journey by plane is smooth. This is an indication of the improvement in the means of transportation. We cannot change the shape of the earth, but we can improve the means of transportation. This is the age of science in which everything should progress. Therefore, the way we preach the gospel and spread the truth should also progress.</p><h2 class="head1">IMPROVING THE WAY TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>The most crucial matter in a scientific approach is to conduct thorough research. We should do research from a number of perspectives to obtain statistics. From the statistics we can determine an appropriate and scientific method. With regard to the way we preach the gospel, everything needs to be improved. The ideal way for us to improve our preaching of the gospel is to use videotapes and even television. It would be wonderful if every household on the island of Taiwan could watch the church preaching the gospel and hear people say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord!&rdquo; All the activities of the church need to be recorded on videotape and made available on television. Even if people do not want to receive the gospel, when they turn on their television, they would hear us sing, &ldquo;Since Jesus came into my heart.&rdquo; If they switch to another station, they would again hear us sing, &ldquo;Vanity, vanity...all things are vain, Christ only is gain!&rdquo; If they switch to a third station, they would hear, &ldquo;You need Jesus, you need Jesus.&rdquo; They would be pressed by the gospel. All these scenarios are not only a dream. I hope that we will see the day when every household that turns on the television will hear programs concerning the gospel, Jesus, and the church. The sound of Hallelujah and Amen should fill the air.</p>
<p>Whether such a scenario will materialize and whether we can carry it out depend on our research. Today Chinese operas and folk operas are available on television. Surely we do not want to imitate others, but we need to research how to preach the gospel. We should not use the old method of pulling an ox cart. The co-workers need to rise up to consider how the work should improve. We should consider and evaluate whether we should videotape the activities of the church and put them on television. We hope that one day the messages given in the morning will be aired the evening of the same day and viewed by every household on the island of Taiwan. We also hope that the faces of the brothers and sisters in the meetings can be seen on television.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Sticking to the Old Ways but Improving</h2>
<p>Our inherent problem is that the serving ones have not progressed. Even commercial packaging has made improvements, but we are still using methods from thirty-five years ago for the sake of saving money. We should progress and change our concepts. We may want to save money, but in fact, we are losing money. In recent years businesses have invested a large amount of money in packaging. For example, in Japan they package merchandise with layers of paper. The outer layers are fancier, and the last layer has a pretty bow. This shows what Japanese businesses are willing to do to entice customers.</p>
<p>This illustration is used mainly to give us a deep impression. This is not a reprimand. We need to see that we have suffered a loss because we would rather stay with the old ways than advance. The attitude of the government in Taiwan has always been reform, which has brought in much success. The Chinese people are intelligent and capable and can succeed as long as they drop the attitude of sticking to the old ways. These examples may seem to deviate from our burden, but the principle is the same. We should not stick to the old ways, but rather, we should seek to improve our ways.</p>
<p>The Lord has richly blessed us in Taiwan. The environment is good, the church is blessed, and there is a large number of saints. It is regrettable that we hold on to our old ways. To further illustrate, the frame of my front door is made of wood, and a section of it needed to be repaired. Many American brothers know how to fix things, and they often told me that if anything in my house needs repair, I should let them know. So I told them about the doorframe. According to my Chinese way of thinking, the only need was to repair the damaged section of the doorframe, but the American way was to replace the entire doorframe with a new one. This was inexpensive and did not take long to do. However, it would have taken much longer and been more expensive to repair only the damaged section of the doorframe. The American brothers did this according to the American logic, the American economics. The Chinese logic, the Chinese economics, is to save money by repairing only the damaged portion of the doorframe. I did not know that it is not easy to repair a doorframe, because wood must be found that matches the color of the original doorframe, which is a troublesome task. This example shows us two kinds of logic, two ways of thinking. One belongs to the new era, and the other belongs to the old.</p>
<p>The church needs to keep up with the new era. The bound volumes of the Life-studies of Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles are a proof of a change in our style. The printing, design, and binding of the Life-studies are of top quality. Before we went to print, we gathered samples of all the hardbound books on the market that were nicely done. The size of the Life-studies is larger than most books on the market. Every volume can be opened flat, which is not a small thing in a hardbound book. We spent much effort to research and print a good quality book. In the past it was difficult to locate a bookbinder in Taiwan who could meet our standard. It is different now. Many bookbinders have improved their skills.</p><h2 class="head2">Abandoning the Old Ways<br />
and Adopting Scientific Ways</h2>
<p>Even though we are all burdened for the gospel in the schools, it is futile for me to explain how to spread the gospel in the schools. Instead, our concepts need to be changed. My fellowship can be compared to a coach teaching a team how to play basketball. The team must first learn how to dribble. In 1953 I held a training in Taipei and spoke on thirty points of character, which included being genuine, exact, strict, diligent, broad, and fine. I taught the saints, point by point, how to be proper persons. If we do not know how to be a proper person, we can never know how to do things, and if we do not know how to do things, we can never labor for the Lord.</p>
<p>There is a large fishpond in front of us, and the resources of the church, including the brothers and sisters, are rich. However, we should not think that this provision is sufficient in order for us to succeed in the gospel work in schools. We must find the right methods and not go according to our old ways. Those who have not learned how to play the piano can still play it, but they play in a natural way. Their way of playing is not appropriate; it is not melodious. When learning to play the piano, one has to learn the scales and practice for one to two hours a day. After several years of daily practice, a person can play melodiously. The sisters who play the hymns play in a proper way, without wild movements. Do we labor in a way that is similar to the way in which people who have taken lessons play the piano? Most of us labor in a natural way, without much learning. How can we expect such labor to bring results? How can we expect the church to be strong?</p>
<p>If you were to ask me to be the principal of an elementary school or a university, I can guarantee you that the school would close within three years. However, if I study education and apply scientific methods to running the school, nearly every parent would want to send their children to the school.</p>
<p>For the past decades we have not made much progress in the work concerning propagation or spread. Thirty-five years ago there were only four hundred saints on the island; in less than ten years the number increased to forty thousand saints in fifty localities. Twenty years have gone by since then. Frankly speaking, we are merely maintaining the old fa&#231;ade. We are not propagating or spreading. This must not continue.</p>
<p>In this day and age it is no longer acceptable to run a school according to the old ways. Sixty years ago I studied accounting in a professional school run by Americans. Then I worked as an accounting clerk for a Chinese customs office. Now even accounting terminology has progressed. Almost all the old accounting terminology in Chinese has been phased out. This proves that everyone seeks progress. The principles in accounting have remained the same, but the application has improved. This is also true in mathematics. The principles in mathematics have not changed, but the way mathematics is taught has changed. Even the elementary school textbooks have changed. No one can change the fact that two plus two is four, but the way to teach this fact can be progressively improved.</p>
<p>Why have we not improved the way we labor? People are traveling in the 747 Jumbo Jet, but we are still riding on an ox cart. To continue in this way is to shut our doors, thinking that we are doing all right, without paying attention to the advancements all around us. Eleven years ago I began to devote all my energy to writing the notes for the New Testament and the Life-studies. After I finished the last book&mdash;the book of Acts&mdash;I said that I would return to Taiwan and begin the labor anew. The Lord has truly blessed the churches here with a good environment and rich resources. It is regrettable that we are holding on to the old ways and not making progress.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Studying, Laboring, and Improving</h2>
<p>We must take a new approach in the work and abandon the old ways. We need to study a new and scientific way to change the way that we labor and make progress. How can we achieve a tenfold increase on the campuses? We cannot guarantee that we will succeed initially. Only the Lord can create something from nothing; we cannot. What we can do is to study, to labor, and to improve daily.</p>
<p>I hope that the older brothers and sisters would be energized. We should not say that Brother Lee is developing some strange ways to lead us and that we did not do these things in the past. No one can guarantee that the way we take will have success, but we would like to see success. We do not want our rich resources to go to waste with no results year after year.</p>
<p>I have been in fellowship with the brothers in Taiwan for more than five years, and many matters have been brought up in my concern for the situation here. Now may the Lord cover me with His precious blood as I ask how we will proceed. We do not have any set plans. We only feel that our work needs to improve. Our maintaining the status quo year after year is hindering the Lord and His move.</p><h2 class="head1">CREATING AND GRASPING OPPORTUNITIES</h2>
<p>A number of saints in the church are serving either part time or full time, and still more saints have a heart to serve full time. Seventy percent of these saints are young people. When the work began in Taiwan, this generation of young people was not born yet. We thank the Lord that these young saints have come into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We must not waste the time of these saints. We must make progress.</p>
<p>We should not blame anyone or anything for the past. There is a Chinese proverb that politicians like to use, which says, &ldquo;Circumstances often create a hero, but a hero creates circumstances.&rdquo; These are two views of the same thing. Those who are wise use their circumstances to distinguish themselves and to make history. I would therefore encourage the co-workers not to waste their time but to open new frontiers, new circumstances, and new prospects. We need to create new opportunities and grasp these opportunities in our labor. Frankly speaking, our situation does not require us to create more opportunities. Thirty-five years ago we came to Taiwan and opened up many frontiers. Now there are many brothers and sisters from many localities. We do not need to create any more opportunities. Our need is to grasp the opportunities that are available. To labor is to grasp the opportunities. If there are no opportunities, we should create some. It is regrettable that year after year we have not grasped these opportunities. Those who allow the opportunities to pass have hundreds of excuses, but no excuse is valid.</p>
<p>Our eyes need to be opened. Taiwan may be a small island, but there are still many towns and villages that do not have a church life and need to be gained. We must raise up a church in these towns and villages. We should not worry about financial provisions. If we fall into this trap, we have become degraded. We are not beginning a new work, we are not going out under a new banner, nor are we starting another recovery. We are one, and we will keep this oneness. The co-workers go out to open new prospects and new opportunities. Even if we should suffer hunger, we will continue until churches are raised up. If all the workers have such a spirit, in two or three years more churches will be raised up. There will even be churches raised up in the neighboring towns.</p>
<p>If we lose the aspiration to create new prospects and new opportunities and instead hold on to our old meetings, we will eventually be discouraged. Going to a town or a village to lead people to salvation, raise up a church, and bring the newly saved ones to serve the Lord is much more valuable than earning all the money in the world. Raising up a church in a town is much more worthwhile than starting a new factory. Making a profit of ten million U.S. dollars cannot be compared to going to a village and raising up one hundred new believers to meet together and serve the Lord. These one hundred souls are more valuable than ten million U.S. dollars. Only this kind of pioneering spirit can stir up the interest of the young saints and cause them to rise up to follow and also serve. In this way, in a few years there will be churches everywhere in Taiwan. Such a pioneering spirit will become our family heritage, and the young saints will be useful and capable. This word is not only to the young saints but also to the co-workers who have been trained for many years. May we not lose this pioneering spirit ever again.</p>
<p>More than twenty years ago I went to the United States with nothing in my pockets, and I did not receive any financial support from any of the churches in the Far East. It was under difficult circumstances that I went to the United States to open up a new frontier. My going forth was to create an opportunity. The work in Taiwan now is much easier. The young saints should take this word to heart. When we go forth to labor in the schools, we should forget all that is behind us. The old ways are not profitable.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COORDINATING TOGETHER<br />
TO PREACH THE GOSPEL IN THE SCHOOLS</h2>
<p>In order to coordinate together to preach the gospel in the schools, there needs to be a number of full-time co-workers who will receive the burden to facilitate the gospel in the schools. We need at least two or three brothers to coordinate together. These full-time brothers should facilitate the gospel work in the schools, including junior high schools, high schools, technical colleges, and universities. The full-timers, especially those who are under the age of thirty, will be assigned to specific schools to carry out the gospel work.</p>
<p>We also need to identify the saints who are under the age of thirty and serve part time. We need to study how these saints can use their spare time. Every block of time is an opportune time for the gospel work in schools, whether it is in the morning, the afternoon, or the evening. The only time that might be difficult to use is the early morning. Therefore, we will ask all the saints who serve part time to fill out a form so that we know who is available at different times each day and can make allocations for the gospel work. This is useful information. If we know that at a certain time every day some part-time brothers or sisters are available to coordinate for the gospel, it will be easy for us to make arrangements. In principle, the saints who serve part time should also participate in the gospel work in the schools.</p>
<p>Hence, we need at least three groups of saints for the gospel in the schools: two or three matured co-workers to facilitate the gospel work, younger full-timers, and part-time brothers and sisters. In addition, there is the need for a fourth group of saints, those who are teachers or staff in the schools. We need to know how many saints are teaching in the schools and how many are burdened to coordinate in the gospel work. The fifth group of saints is very useful in facilitating the gospel work in the schools. This last group of saints is the students who are studying and are willing to participate in the gospel work. We will therefore have five groups of saints: two or three co-workers who take the lead, the younger full-timers, the part-timers, the saints who work in the schools, and the saints who are students.</p><h2 class="head2">Gathering Statistics</h2>
<p>We should make a list of the saints in the five categories mentioned above. These saints are the bases for the work. Then every district should make a list of the schools in which our saints are either staff or students and include the names of the saints. After we gather these statistics, we can use the saints who are staff members or students as the inside help, and the first three groups of saints can be added to them. Once we have the basic statistics, we can identify what each college, high school, or junior high school needs. Then we can make a schedule and also assign saints from the first three groups to the schools in an orderly manner.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Arranging Personnel according to Priorities</h2>
<p>We must take care of our priorities when we assign saints to the schools. If the need in a school is not urgent, we can send saints at a later time. After we have all the necessary statistics, we will know how many saints will be needed for a school. According to this information, we can assign saints to labor in the schools. These assignments should not be according to a saint&rsquo;s preference or desire. In the work there should not be a situation where anyone works independently. Instead, there should be coordination according to priorities.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Researching the Ways to Preach</h2>
<p>First, we should gather various statistics, and then according to the statistics, we can arrange our personnel. After the saints are arranged, we should focus our attention on studying the individual schools. How do we preach the gospel in junior high schools? How do we preach in high schools? How do we preach in technical colleges? The way that we preach the gospel should match the situation of a school. Most junior high schools do not allow outsiders to enter their campus, but it is permissible to enter university campuses. The universities also have different situations. Some universities do not have dormitories or large open areas, whereas others, such as the National Taiwan University, have large open areas. All these factors need to be considered. Based on the situation of a school, we can make a specific plan. Just as there are many ways to reach a destination, there are many ways to carry out a task. We need to study the situation of every school.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters who are burdened for the gospel in the schools should be assigned to labor in a school and should study the various situations in that school. The other saints should also consider how they can participate in this work. There are two difficulties in preaching the gospel to the junior high students: junior high students have a heavy load of schoolwork, and all the parents are vigilant to watch over their children. The parents send their children to school in the morning, and after school they escort their children to extra classes. They closely monitor their children. From Monday to the Lord&rsquo;s Day, parents closely watch their children. From an educational point of view, this is good. If I were a parent, I would do the same. We should not carelessly say that the parents hinder the gospel. We should not cause the gospel to interfere with the education of the children. We respect their education. If our contact with the students distracts them from their studies, their parents will oppose us and may even prevent their children from contacting us.</p>
<p>Does this mean we cannot work in the junior high schools? It seems that the best way is to rely on the students and staff in the school. We need to gather the saints who are either students or staff members in the same school to fellowship and pray together and to consider the ways to preach the gospel in that school. As long as we are willing to consider and fellowship, the Lord can lead us to find out the best way. It may be that the saints who are teachers should be the first to contact the students. The saints who are students can spontaneously preach the gospel to their classmates. On the weekends there can be a gospel outreach for a particular school, and we can invite the students to the meeting hall or to our homes for a gospel gathering. There is always an opportunity to gain people. Through the brothers and sisters who are either staff members or students, we can spread the gospel to the junior high schools.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Studying Scientifically</h2>
<p>We should take a further step in our study. Not only should we invite others to hear the gospel; we can also print material, such as small booklets and gospel tracts. We need to be like gourmet chefs who can cook elaborate dishes using the same three ingredients: vegetables, meat, and fish. Studying scientifically does not mean that we need to use scientific instruments but that we should not use old methods to do things. In our labor we need to study; that is, we need to apply a scientific approach. Gathering statistics is an example of a scientific method used for our study.</p>
<p>We will not achieve results if we scatter seeds randomly or carelessly. Rather, we should sow seeds just like a farmer. We first need to identify which fields belong to us; we should never scatter seeds wildly. Then we need to observe whether the ground is flat, and whether it will retain water. If the field has a slope, we need to make it level. To be a competent farmer requires a study of the various situations related to the ground. We also need to study which area needs seeds planted earlier and which area needs seeds planted later. Some seeds may be sown fifteen days earlier than other seeds. All of this requires study. Furthermore, there is the need to study the different types of seeds. For example, there are different species of wheat. One should never buy the wrong kind of seed, and different seeds require different fields. This is the scientific way to farm. Everything is studied thoroughly so that seeds are sown at the right time, in the right condition, and on the right ground. This illustration helps us to understand that we can no longer do anything in a casual way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">APPLYING SCIENTIFIC WAYS<br />
AND DOING EVERYTHING WITH A GOOD AIM</h2>
<p>The age has progressed; in order to do anything, one has to apply a scientific way and have a goal. We cannot be careless. Some people do not agree with Chinese medicine because it lacks scientific studies. Chinese medicine specializes in four matters: gold, wood, fire, and earth. A person who is high in fire, or is hot, needs to bring down the level of fire. Such speaking lacks a scientific basis, and it is difficult for others to accept. The strength of Western medicine is scientific research. Everything must be verified in a laboratory. As a result, the medicine is almost always effective. Western doctors know that some medications cannot cure a patient but merely afford temporary comfort for the patient to maintain his organic functions and relieve his pain. Such medication is a help to the patient because it is a product of scientific study. We should not continue to do things in an antiquated way. We should do things according to our study. We can compare this to hunting rabbits with the aid of a hawk. We should not let the hawk out unless we see a rabbit; we do not want to let the hawk out randomly, because after it flies for a while, it will come back with nothing. But if we see a rabbit and release the hawk, the rabbit will be caught. This is what we mean by applying a scientific approach.</p>
<p>We do not want the brothers and sisters to carry loudspeakers and walk around a campus shouting. This will disturb the entire school and may eventually cause the school to chase us out of the campus. That is not a scientific way to preach the gospel. Furthermore, except for the Lord&rsquo;s Day when we should be at the table meeting, all the ones laboring on the campuses should spend six days participating in a variety of gatherings, such as the prayer meeting, the small group meeting, and other kinds of meetings for the campus work. They can also study the Bible in small groups. In principle, there should be work to do every evening. We must not be idle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THOROUGHLY STUDYING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>In summary, we should thoroughly study every school where we are serving. We must know what the need is and what the overall situation is at a school. We must know whether our personnel can meet the need of a place and how we should carry out the work. All of this requires time before any action can be taken. In this way nothing will be in vain, and we will have results.</p>
<p>This fellowship is not theoretical; it is practical. We need to fellowship concerning all of our views. This will help us to learn to do things scientifically. Some of the saints have learned the way to preach the gospel in the schools, and they have gained a wealth of experience. These ones should share their experience concerning the difficulties and benefits of the gospel work in the schools, how to utilize resources, and what things to avoid. If we could present all the relevant issues for further study, our work will not be in vain.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</p>
<h1 class="title">CONCERNING THE GOSPEL IN SCHOOLS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>Propagating the gospel in schools can be compared to fighting on the frontline of a war. We need to consider in detail how to fight this war. Many schools are the object of our work, the target of our warfare, so we need to consider how much manpower we can afford to invest. Our manpower includes the full-time co-workers, the new full-timers, and the part-time saints. These three groups of saints are our manpower; they are also the army to be deployed for the battle. In addition to an army, we have the church. The church can be compared to the headquarters, supplying all the needs in the propagation of the gospel work in the schools.</p>
<p>The first step in propagating the gospel in the schools is to identify the brothers and sisters who are either staff or students. We do not need to call a big meeting; neither should we draw attention to this matter. We should contact the saints who are staff members or students one by one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONTACTING THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>We should never attempt to take shortcuts in our labor for the Lord. We do not gain any results by taking shortcuts in an attempt to have an easy time. Our labor is not to have an easy time but to gain results. The more effective a work is, the more difficulty it will bring. For example, a farmer spends a lot of time sowing seeds. The more he labors, the more produce there will be, but the more difficulty he will have. A work that has no difficulties is a work that has no results. This can also be compared to running a business. A person who is good at running a business is always busy. A person who does not know how to run a business always avoids trouble. Eventually, he has no customers and nothing works.</p>
<p>In order to propagate the gospel in the schools, we must first contact the saints who are on the teaching staff in the schools and talk with them concerning the situation of the students in their school in order to know whom we can contact. We should not take the way of calling a meeting or gathering a crowd. We should not arouse the attention of the school, because this might hinder our future work. The principle of our work is for our personnel to contact the students. We are not seeking to increase quickly.</p>
<p>We can help the saints, who are either staff or students, by showing them how to approach others. If we contact one or two saints a week, in a few weeks we will have fellowshipped with all the saints in a school. Soon they will all be contacting the students, and over a long period of time our labor will produce results.</p>
<p>Mankind is reproduced one child at a time. There is no need to call a big meeting and teach people how to reproduce. Revival meetings and meetings for cultivating spirituality are the way of Christianity. We do not depend on that way. Rather, we contact people one by one and save people one by one. After we gain one person, we teach him to contact his close friends. Every one of us has several good friends, who become our contacts for the gospel. Instead of seeking to gain many people in a short time, we should work on one person at a time. This way of laboring seems to be slow, but it is actually rather fast and effective.</p>
<p>The way of gaining one person at a time is solid, and the persons gained will be steadfast, remaining fruit (John 15:16). Trying to gain many people at once can be compared to sewing a garment with eight needles. We may desire to be fast, but in the end we accomplish nothing. It is better to sew slowly with one needle and finish the garment. To contact people one by one is a good way to begin the gospel work in the schools. We are more likely to succeed by beginning the work in this way.</p>
<p>If a school does not have any saints who are students or staff members, we should leave it and begin with another school that has saints. It is preferable to begin with the schools that have the most saints, either as staff or as students. After we work on the schools that have saints, we can work on the schools that do not have saints. It is not difficult to labor on a school that does not have saints. We can wait at the gate of a school at the end of the day and approach the students who are walking out. We can greet them, converse with them, give them a gospel tract, and walk with them for a short distance to get to know them. We might not gain anyone today, but we can go again tomorrow. After three or four days, we will gain someone. Gradually, by contacting people one by one in this way, the Lord&rsquo;s work will take shape.</p>
<p>We must believe that the economical Spirit is with us. One brother testified that he was saved because an unbeliever said, &ldquo;It is a good thing to believe in Jesus.&rdquo; Because of this word, the Holy Spirit was able to operate in him, and he was saved. The Lord&rsquo;s Spirit is operating on the earth. Our saying that the economical Spirit is with us is absolutely different from what the Pentecostal movement promotes. In the 1960s the Pentecostal movement was prevalent in Southeast Asia, and a small number of our saints were affected by Pentecostalism. However, the Lord in His sovereignty cleared up that situation. History testifies that the Pentecostal movement does not bring in much effect. For this reason, when we begin the gospel work in the schools, we should treasure contacting people one at a time.</p>
<p>We need to gain a person so that he takes this way, before we contact a second person. This is the way we gain one person, a second person, and so on. This may seem slow, but it is steady. There is no need to draw attention to our work. We simply gain people one by one.</p>
<p>After we gain a person, we must have meetings with him. Perhaps a saint who is a teacher lives near the school or a saint who can receive the students lives near the school. We can fellowship with the students in that home. We can ask the saint, whose home is near the school, whether we can bring some students to his home after school hours. This gathering should not be long. If it is long, the students will get home late, and their parents will be worried. A gathering for thirty minutes would be good.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHERS&rsquo; HOUSES AND SISTERS&rsquo; HOUSES<br />
BEING RECEIVING STATIONS</h2>
<p>If a school looks promising for the gospel work, those who labor in that school should consider moving close to it. We can start either a brothers&rsquo; house or a sisters&rsquo; house with three or four students. Such an apartment does not need to be large, but it needs to have a living room where we can receive students. This kind of arrangement will hit the target every time. It is effective. Two to three brothers or sisters, who are students, and a couple can live in such an apartment. Every day after school is over, we can bring students to the apartment and meet with them for thirty minutes. The meeting should be without an obvious form. There can be gospel tracts, snacks, and something to drink in the living room so that the students can talk freely.</p>
<p>When we first contact the students, their parents may not understand and may interfere. However, they will gradually understand. After some children are saved, their behavior will change, and their parents will notice the change. Eventually, the parents will find out that their children have believed in the Lord Jesus, or their children will tell them. However, by that time it will be too late, even if the parents want to interfere. Nonetheless, it is a great comfort and blessing to the parents when their children change for the better. When they first find out, most parents do not agree with their children believing into the Lord. But some children have even brought their parents into the church life.</p>
<p>The church in San Francisco rented a house across from a large high school. The house was for the brothers and sisters. On the first floor there was a large living room, and every afternoon the door to the house was wide open. All that a student had to do after leaving school was to cross the street, and he would be in the house. The students could have a drink, sit down, and talk. The gathering was only for half an hour. More than a hundred people were saved in this way. One of the high school students who was saved through such contact even became an elder.</p>
<p>The full-timers who are involved with the gospel work in the schools must find suitable, nearby locations to receive the students. The closer such a location is to the school, the better. For example, to labor at National Taiwan University it is best to move near the university and open our home as a receiving station. Initially, it may be that we only receive students, but eventually we will be giving them hospitality. Sometimes students have special circumstances. A student may become sick and come to our home to be cared for. This is the most effective way to labor. When our homes are receiving stations, we can contact students on a daily basis, and the care that we render will not be routine or formal.</p>
<p>This is the most effective way to labor among the students in high school and in junior high school. We should also be practical. We can receive a student in our home on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. We should not bring a student to the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting immediately after he is saved; rather, we should labor on him gradually until he becomes solid. Then we can bring him to the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting. Before a student is solid, we can meet with him on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, not in the meeting hall but in our home. After we build up the habit of meeting with our new ones on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, we can then bring them to a young people&rsquo;s meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. We should not be too quick to bring them to a general meeting of the church.</p>
<p>If the work in the high schools and the junior high schools is progressing well, we will go further. We can have a conference or a big gathering for all the saints in high school and junior high school at least every six months. We can use a large meeting hall or rent a hall for such a gathering. Such a conference is very helpful. We can use it to bring the students step by step into the atmosphere and the realm of the gospel, into life, into truth, and into the church. This is a good way for the work in both high school and junior high school to develop.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE STUDENTS TO THE MOUNTAINS</h2>
<p>Based on our experience in the United States, we can take the junior high school and the high school students to the mountains every six months for a conference. Such an activity would need the support of the church. The saints&rsquo; children, who are saved, can also coordinate with us. We must entrust the newly saved ones to our children who are students. Some of the newly saved ones are their classmates, and it will be easy for our students to converse with them. In America we conduct mountain trips every six months. We can hold a mountain trip every three months to have a greater impact. A mountain trip should not be long; it can last for a holiday or a weekend.</p>
<p>I am burdened to have a meeting with the elders in the church in Taipei. Perhaps the church can purchase a plot of land in the nearby scenic area and build a recreation center for the students. If we have such a center, the churches can take turns using it. Perhaps this week the students from hall two use it, and next week the church in Yung-Ho or the church in Ban-Chiao can use it. It would be best to purchase about six thousand square feet so that all the meeting halls in the church in Taipei and the nearby churches can use it regularly.</p>
<p>Having such a place available for the young people will make everyone happy, and its effect will be beneficial. We can take the teenage saints, those in junior high school and high school, to the mountains. Even their gospel friends can be saved on such a trip. We can arrange activities for them, and we should set aside three periods of time to teach them something. In two days we can have six periods. Even a naughty child can be saved on such a trip. The mountain trip can be regarded as a kind of incubator. After staying in the incubator for three days, everyone will be changed. In the United States a teenager was saved during a mountain trip and stopped smoking. Such a change is applauded by every parent. We should do this work earnestly, and we should be even more aggressive with the college students. Presently, in the United States the work with the high school and college young people depends on these conferences.</p>
<p>Such conferences uphold our young people. We must work in the junior high schools, the high schools, and the colleges. Every college campus on the island of Taiwan must have a gospel work so that the students who are saved in high school can be worked on for another four years. By the time a person who is saved in junior high school finishes college, he would have received at least seven years of cultivation in the truth, and it will be difficult for him to fall away. If we can weave such a gospel net in the junior high schools, the high schools, and the colleges all over this island, it will uphold all our saved young people.</p>
<p>The principle for the college work is similar. There is one advantage to the college work, which is that college students have more freedom. They live in the dormitory away from home, and the colleges do not watch over them strictly but allow them more freedom. We should utilize this. We need to carefully study how to labor on the college campuses to know how to best utilize their time and how to contact them one by one.</p>
<p>According to our experience with institutions such as Ching-Hwa and Yen-ching universities, most professors live on campus. We can therefore use the homes of the saints who are professors at the universities to contact students and even have meetings. The principle is similar to what we fellowshipped earlier.</p>
<p>We should consider what we will say when we contact the college students. We need to know how to speak and what to say. What we say needs to supply them with food so that they may be fed. We must also supply them with medicine to heal their sickness. Sometimes we even have to operate on them as a surgeon. The content of our conversation with the junior high school students and the high school students should be simple, but it should also stir up their interest. We should avoid debates with the college students. When a person grows to be eighteen years old, he begins to consider the meaning of life. Therefore, when we supply the truth to them, we should avoid debates. It is easier to select material for junior high school students and high school students than it is to select material for the college students. This is what makes college work easy and yet difficult at the same time. The difficulty lies in the fact that the college students have begun to consider certain deep issues, making it easier for them to debate.</p><h2 class="head1">HAVING COLLEGE CONFERENCES<br />
IN THE SUMMER AND WINTER</h2>
<p>We need to take the college students to the mountains many times, at least twice a year. The mountain trip can last longer than the trip for the younger students. The conference for the junior high school students can be two to three days, but for the college students, it is best to have at least one more day. There should be a college conference during the winter holidays and during the summer vacation. The college conference should be by region. The churches in northern Taiwan can have a joint college conference, the churches in central Taiwan can have a conference, and the churches in southern Taiwan can also have a conference. Every region should have a college conference instead of one large conference for the whole island. A large conference will use too many resources and will not be as fruitful.</p>
<p>The location for the college conference needs to be carefully considered. We must seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading. The church in Taipei does not have an adequate facility. Hall one is not large enough for the whole church. The church in Taipei does not have a meeting place where the whole church can gather. It has to rent a place when the whole church comes together. This is inconvenient. If the conference site is not adequate and does not provide sufficient accommodation, some students may have to stay in either the meeting halls or in the saints&rsquo; homes. Even if the messages are uplifting, the time that it takes to travel between the meeting place and their hospitality would be a distraction to the students and will reduce the effectiveness of the conference.</p>
<p>The practice of the saints in Brazil is quite good. For their gatherings, they purchased a piece of property that is about one hundred acres. In order to do a long-term work, we need property. If it is not easy to find such a place in the city of Taipei, it is better to look in the suburbs. Every six months there should be a weeklong college conference. Not more than two thousand college students can gather together for a week and be trained in life, truth, and the gospel. We do not need to have only one speaker for the college conference. Several co-workers can coordinate together for the speaking. We have much material that can be used. If we have a proper place, we can be certain that we will have results. All those in the college conference will be fed spiritual meals for seven days and will be satisfied.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO YEARS OF SERVICE AFTER GRADUATION</h2>
<p>The gospel work should begin with the children. The children in elementary school should be nurtured by the children&rsquo;s work. When they enter junior high school, there will already be a gospel work with the junior high students. Then as they proceed to high school, they will be cultivated by the gospel work in the high schools. During the time they are at college, they will be perfected. If a person is gained in the first year of college, instead of through children&rsquo;s work, the serving ones should take him to the mountains once every semester for a week of training. In four years he would have attended eight mountain trips. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, after eight mountain trips, when he graduates from college, he will continue with two years in the full-time training. Imagine how many thousands of serving ones there will be after a period of time!</p>
<p>If the young people can be perfected from elementary school, through junior high school, high school, college, and two years in the full-time training, they will know whether or not they will serve full time after the training. I believe that at least one out of ten students will give themselves to serve full time for the rest of their life, and the rest will probably get a job. The ones who are trained will be different even if they get a job, because they have a solid foundation in the truth and have been gained by the Lord. Therefore, when they enter into society to work, they will still be working for the Lord. For this reason, the full-timers who are laboring in the gospel work in the schools must be clear and have this goal. This is the goal of the work in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We begin our labor with the children and continue with those in junior high school, high school, and college so that they continue with two years of full-time service in the church. This plan is much superior to any plan set up by a seminary.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GRASPING THE OPPORTUNITY WITH NEW STUDENTS DURING ORIENTATION</h2>
<p>We should also grasp the opportunity with the incoming new students during their orientation. Two brothers once testified that they contacted five hundred new medical students during orientation. This is a good way to contact the students. The best time for a college student to receive the gospel is during his first semester as a freshman. It is easy for a person to receive the gospel when he is undergoing change. If we miss this window of opportunity, that is, the new student&rsquo;s transition from high school to college, we will miss the best time for the gospel. It will be much more difficult to gain the students later. For this reason, we should try our best to preach the gospel to freshmen at the beginning of a semester. The brothers have done a good job in this aspect. Eighty percent of their labor during orientation has been good, but our follow-up is still lacking. If we can take care of the follow-up more thoroughly, more people will be saved. We need to grasp the opportunity during the freshmen orientation.</p>
<p>Our labor can be compared to harvesting wheat in northern China. In May, when the wheat is ripe, none of the farmers are concerned about eating or sleeping. The old people have a saying: &ldquo;The wheat is falling; are you still sleeping?&rdquo; Once the wheat is ripe it must be harvested immediately; otherwise, it will fall to the ground. When the wheat is ripe, no one can sleep peacefully. All the wheat must be harvested in half a day. The new students coming into the schools can be likened to the wheat falling off the stalk. We must not be bothered with anything else, not the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting or any other matters, other than the new students. If we cannot gain eighty percent of the new students, we should at least gain fifty percent. We must grasp this opportunity.</p>
<p>We must also be thick-skinned when we preach the gospel, and we must be sure of what we preach, just as a salesman must be thick-skinned, not shy but confident of his product and confident that the customer will buy it from him. A salesman who can guide a customer in a simple way to buy his product has made a sale.</p>
<p>We still need further study concerning how to put everything into practice. Please do not pay lip service to our fellowship, but outline a way and hit the target. This requires much effort. Our goal is to gain people. Whatever way by which we can gain people is the way we will take. We must take the time and make the effort to study this. In principle, whether we serve full time or part time and are under thirty years old, our labor in the gospel should be in the schools. The saints who are over thirty years old can participate in all areas with the gospel.</p><h2 class="head1">QUESTION AND ANSWER</h2>
<p><em>Question: What should we say if people ask us why we do not participate in a campus-wide fellowship involving other Christian groups?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This matter is related to the truth of the church (Matt. 16:18; 18:17). The Lord Jesus has only one Body in the universe, and this Body is His universal church. There is only one expression of this church in each locality. For example, in Jerusalem there were many believers but only one church, which was called the church in Jerusalem. If there are two expressions of the church in one locality, there is division. This is the reason that at the end of the Bible, in Revelation, each of the seven cities has only one church, such as the church in Ephesus, the church in Smyrna, the church in Pergamos, and the church in Thyatira. There was only one church in a city (1:11).</p>
<p>Shortly after the time of the apostles, however, the church encountered problems. There was a great controversy mainly related to the truth concerning the Triune God and the person of Christ. By the end of the sixth century, after several councils Catholicism was officially formed, and the pope controlled everything. This condition continued for more than nine centuries, that is, close to one thousand years. This period is called the Dark Ages in church history. Later, reformers, such as Martin Luther, were raised up. They did not accept church traditions; they returned to the truth in the Bible and compared traditions with the truth. The first item they recovered was justification by faith. This was the recovery of the foundation of salvation. Thereafter, item after item of the truth has been recovered.</p>
<p>Martin Luther did not intend to leave Catholicism; he felt that he should rise up simply to recover the truth. However, the Catholic Church desired to kill him, which caused a German nobleman to rise up to protect Luther. Under such circumstances, Luther had little choice in the formation of state churches. As a result, the state church, which appeared first in Germany, believed in justification by faith and was called the Lutheran church. It was the first denomination.</p>
<p>Soon many European countries, such as Denmark and England, also rose up to form state churches. There is the state church of Denmark, the state church of Sweden, and the state church of Norway. The rulers of these countries are also the head of the state church. The queen of England is the head of the Anglican Church, which is the state church of England.</p>
<p>Later a group of believers pursued the truth and saw that the practice of state churches was not according to the Bible. They formed the so-called private churches, such as the Baptists, the Presbyterians, and the Methodists. Still later the Pentecostals rose up, as well as many other groups. Now the various denominations and sects can be compared to the numerous trees in a forest. Even in the city of Taipei there are many denominations. This situation has divided the Lord&rsquo;s Body.</p>
<p>About one hundred fifty years ago, the British Brethren were raised up, and they saw the light that the practice of sects is not according to the Bible. Consequently, some left the Catholic Church and others left the Anglican Church. Their leaving the sects was thorough and powerful. The truth unveiled by the British Brethren affected believers in many places.</p>
<p>Around the year 1920 this truth reached us in China, and we began to meet outside of any denominational structure. We accepted all the saints regardless of their denominational background, as long as they were genuinely saved. Our accepting of others was not based on different faiths but on the fact that when a person repents and believes into the Lord, he is washed, regenerated, justified by God, and becomes a child of God. As long as a person was a member of Christ, we accepted him and met with him. This was our attitude.</p>
<p>Any so-called campus-wide fellowship is a gospel organization formed by several groups that work together on the campuses. They send the students they gain to the denominations. We will not interfere with a believer who joins such a campus-wide fellowship, because this will only give rise to criticism. However, we are led by the Lord to enter into the church life, and we believe that gradually all believers will know the truth concerning the church. When we contact students, we need to preach the gospel to them. Then we need to supply them with life. When the students begin to love and pursue the Lord, we can release the truth to them. We do not need to engage others in debates; we should only present the truth to them.</p>
<p>We do not criticize those who desire to meet in the Catholic Church or in the denominations. We leave this decision to them. It would be wonderful for others to be enlightened by our testimony and by the supply of the truth so that they would be unwilling to stay in any division but would rather take the way of the church and become a part of the testimony of oneness. Nevertheless, this choice is theirs, and we should not argue with them.</p>
<p>We have the gospel, life, and the truth. There is also a testimony for others to see. We should also lead other believers to testify for the Lord. We are not creating our own sect. Hence, when someone asks what denomination we are in, we should reply that we do not belong to any denomination. At the most, we can say that we are the local church. We are not a sect, a denomination, or a special group of people. We are those who are saved and who love the Lord. We meet together in each locality to testify for the Lord. Concerning other believers, our hope is simply to state the truth clearly to them. The way they receive our speaking is according to the Lord&rsquo;s leading.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CONCERNING THE GOSPEL IN SCHOOLS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<p>There are many practical needs in leading the gospel work in schools. We therefore may not be able to cover everything thoroughly in a few messages. What we have fellowshipped, in principle, is based on many years of observation. When we begin the work, there will be many more things that we will need to learn.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEGINNING WITH THE BASICS AND BEGINNING SMALL</h2>
<p>Some saints have proposed that we set up a student club on the college campuses and put out a publication. In order to succeed in any endeavor, we need to begin with the basics. This is a general principle. The way to succeed is to begin with the basics and to begin small. Any endeavor that does not begin with the basics and does not begin small will fail sooner or later, because there is no foundation. An endeavor that does not start small may appear to be doing well, but as soon as difficulties come, nothing will remain. In whatever we do, we need to begin with a base and then continue from the base.</p>
<p>Concerning setting up a club on campus or putting out a publication for the truth, we cannot say that this is not good or that it will not have any effect. A club or a publication can be used only to create an atmosphere for change. For example, Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, the founder of the Republic of China, made contacts in China and outside of China in preparation for a revolution. He made contacts with people in China, Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, and America, gaining a group of comrades, both young and old, for the revolution. Some of his contacts were older overseas Chinese who were willing to give money for the revolution, and some were young men in the country who were willing to sacrifice their lives. If he had promoted a revolution only outside of China, without having gained a group of people within the country who dedicated their lives to the cause, the revolution would not have succeeded. This example shows that the most important point in our gospel work is to contact people one by one. If we spend our time establishing a club or putting out a publication to create an atmosphere, in the end we will have nobody but ourselves even if everyone agrees with what we say.</p>
<p>Therefore, we would rather utilize our time to contact students on the campuses. In half a year we can gain at least a few solid contacts among the freshmen and lead them to contact another two or three students. In this way, in half a year we will gain twelve students, and in another half year we will have forty-eight students. This way is more effective than establishing a student club or putting out a publication. Not only should the gospel work in the schools be done in this way, but in all the other aspects of the work we should take the same way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OPENING HOMES AND GAINING PEOPLE IN FOUR WAYS</h2>
<p>The home of a believer has four main functions. It can be used to preach the gospel to other families, to receive students for the gospel work, to preach the gospel in the community, and for the children&rsquo;s work. In order to have a strong foundation for our gospel work, the brothers and sisters need to open their homes. In the church in Taipei we are promoting small group gatherings. There are about four hundred small groups, and every group has two or three families. It would be a great thing to have one thousand open homes in Taipei preaching the gospel. Opening our homes is a very effective move for the gospel. Every year we can harvest four kinds of crop: from the families, from students, from the community, and from the children&rsquo;s work. The foundation for such a work is the home.</p>
<p>No matter how hard we work, we will encounter problems in the gospel work with the students. As soon as there is a change in the environment, the work will be restricted. However, the gospel work in the homes is unshakable. The homes are always there, whether in rain or in sunshine. The base for receiving the gospel work in the schools is the home, and the home unit is the most stable base. Similarly, the base of the gospel in the community should be in the homes. The home of a brother who is a medical doctor can be used to reach doctors with the gospel. The home of a sister who is a nurse can be used to reach nurses. The home of a brother who is a policeman can be used to reach police officers with the gospel. The home of a brother who is a college professor can be used to gain other professors. Even the home of an older sister can be used for the gospel to gain older people. It may be difficult for old saints to speak with young people, but when older people get together, they enjoy talking because there is no distance among them. Therefore, if an older sister is willing to open her home and invite some older women to her home, their heart will be open, and she will hit the target with the gospel. This also applies to the children&rsquo;s work. We must use the homes as a base.</p>
<p>We should use the homes as the base to promote the work. The home is the most basic unit. When this concept is in our veins, the gospel work will succeed. If every brother and sister opens their home to preach the gospel, even a typhoon with heavy winds and strong rains will not frustrate the gospel. We must take the way of using the homes as the base for our work in the schools. With the homes as the base, there is no problem to set up a club or put out a publication. According to our experience, if our work does not get into the homes, we have no base. Once there is a stable base for the work in the homes, with little effort, whatever we do will achieve maximum result.</p><h2 class="head1">DOING A NORMAL WORK BY A NORMAL LIVING</h2>
<p>Some campuses have special circumstances. For example, the school administration may exercise strict oversight, and the students may have a very regimented schedule with little free time. With such campuses, we must keep the principle of not disrupting the order. Even making noise on such a campus can disrupt the order on the campus. We should follow the regulations of a school that has very strict oversight and do what we can in the time permitted and within the boundaries set forth. If a school allows us to use a limited area, we should use only that area. If a school allows us to use only a certain period of time, we should use only that time. We need to receive the Lord&rsquo;s leading and do only as much as we are allowed to do. An attempt to gain more in a short time may cause us to suffer loss. We should not count on luck; neither should we attempt to take the way of miracles.</p>
<p>The church has two thousand years of history on the earth, which show that the way of miracles does not last. There are many miracles in the four Gospels, but this is not the case in the Epistles. Initially, Paul&rsquo;s handkerchief healed the sick (Acts 19:11-12), but in his old age, instead of healing Timothy, his co-worker, Paul advised Timothy to take a little wine (1 Tim. 5:23). The way of life ultimately takes the direction of normalcy and regularity. We should not depend on luck. We should depend on living and working in a normal way. Students in schools that have strict oversight can still be saved. After some students are saved, we will gradually receive the Lord&rsquo;s leading and usher them into the church life. We should not expect to achieve much in a short time; neither should we create any conflict with the schools. According to the boundaries given to us, we should do the best we can. Over the long run, we will see the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING THE BROTHERS&rsquo; AND SISTERS&rsquo; HOUSES</h2>
<p>In mainland China and even during the early years in Taiwan, we did not have the practice of brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses. It was not until 1963, when we were laboring on the university campuses in America that we discovered the need of establishing brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses. Taiwan followed this practice. Even though the practice of having brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses has been blessed by the Lord, it also has its drawback, which is mainly related to management. If the management is loose, there will be chaos. If the management is too strict, it will damage and frustrate the growth of life. The problem is that everyone is willing to set up laws, but no one is willing to obey the laws.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Making Pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word and Calling On the Lord&rsquo;s Name into Laws</h2>
<p>We must not make pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s word and calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name into laws for the brothers and sisters who live in corporate housing. Calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name should not be a law. We heard that after some newly saved believers moved into corporate housing, they were forced to pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s Word, to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, and to praise loudly, even though they did not like it. The Bible does tell us to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name loudly (Acts 7:59-60), but our being loud can either be pleasant to the ears or unpleasant. There is a great difference. In Acts 3 after a lame man was healed, he was walking, leaping, and praising God. Based on this story, a brother once requested that everyone leap about in the meeting hall.</p>
<p>In the Bible there is a practice of calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name. We also call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, but we do not call in a disorderly manner, nor are we wild. Two hundred years ago, John Wesley broke the tradition of worshipping only in a chapel, that is, a so-called sanctuary. He preached the gospel on the streets. He cried out and was loud, and those who passed by stopped and listened to him. Many were touched to repent and be saved. At that time, the tide of the French revolution had swept through Europe, and it would have crossed the English Channel. However, apart from that revolution the English society was already going through a change brought about by the effectiveness of Wesley&rsquo;s preaching. For this reason, the royal household of Great Britain appreciated John Wesley.</p>
<p>During the past two thousand years of church history, different people have been raised up. We do everything according to the Bible, and we are not willing to be bound by an organization. Calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name is in the Bible; therefore, we call on the Lord&rsquo;s name. Praising out loud is in the Bible; therefore, we also praise out loud, but we do not praise wildly. We pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s Word, call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, and praise the Lord, but we do not set these practices as laws for others to obey in the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses.</p>
<p>The Bible encourages us to compel others only in one matter. We should compel others to believe in the Lord Jesus, but we still need to study how to compel others. Sometimes people would be willing to believe without our compelling, but when we &ldquo;compel,&rdquo; they run away. There was a brother in Southern California who was very aggressive. He even compelled a gospel friend to kneel down and pray. The friend was Chinese and reluctantly &ldquo;complied,&rdquo; but he later told others that he would never come to another meeting.</p>
<p>We should not become aggressive in the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses. We do not require the brothers and sisters who live together to uniformly pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s Word and call on the Lord&rsquo;s name. We should always remember that the church is a home. We cannot conduct ourselves as soldiers in a home. We should not require everyone to be the same. We should give the newly saved ones more freedom and encourage them to join us to pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s Word and call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, saying, &ldquo;You may not be used to what we are doing. Please bear with us and do not feel troubled. You are welcome to join us in prayer, or you can stay in your room.&rdquo; In this way they will feel comfortable.</p><h2 class="head2">Learning to Have Regulations<br />
without Legality</h2>
<p>We need to learn to do everything in the Lord&rsquo;s service without legality. This, however, does not mean that we do not have regulations. It is not right for a brother who lives in the brothers&rsquo; house to come home at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning. There is a need to set up rules for their daily living, such as what time the door is locked and what time the lights are turned off. It is appropriate to set up the kind of rules that help others. However, we should change our attitude concerning forcing others to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name or to pray-read the Word. It is not even appropriate to force the saints in a meeting to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Calling on the name of the Lord has indeed helped us, and pray-reading the Word has nourished us. Calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name or pray-reading His Word is not a problem, and it is not necessarily true that those who pray-read the Word are more spiritual than those who do not. This is not to say that we should not pray-read. Taking vitamins is a good example. Those who take vitamins are not necessarily healthier than those who do not. But it is an erroneous attitude to say that if this is the case, we will not take any vitamins. Others may not need to take vitamins to remain healthy, but we may become sick and even die if we do not take vitamins. Some might continue to live without pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word, but we become dry and even wither if we do not pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s Word. Even though we are nourished by pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word, we should not require that others pray-read. Even though we are supplied by pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word, we cannot say that we are stronger than others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Requiring Uniformity</h2>
<p>It is very easy to require uniformity in the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses. Not only so, it is even easy for the elders to require uniformity in a church of only fifty to sixty saints. The elders may expect all the saints in their locality to be as orderly as a gymnastic class so that a visitor would see them pray-reading the Word and calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name in an orderly way. However, the worst possible thing we can do is to turn a church into a gymnastic team or a military platoon. Would you prefer the church to be a home or a military platoon? We all want the church to be a home that can care for the young and the sick and can feed and give people warmth. The feeding and support in a home are lovely. If, instead, there is drill practice every day, the young and the sick would not live longer than six months. Therefore, there is no need to require uniformity in the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Flexible in Our Practice</h2>
<p>We should be flexible and not rigid in our practice. Not only should the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses be managed in this way, but the church should also be led in this way. The brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses render much help to the young brothers and sisters. There must be wisdom and love in leading the young saints. We need to lead them gradually and in wisdom through their weaknesses, and render them proper care. We need to give them the feeling that we are not regulating, restricting, or limiting them; rather, we are sympathetic and considerate, and we think of them for their sake. If we regulate others to do this or that, the result will not be good.</p>
<p>Furthermore, those who have lived in the brothers&rsquo; or sisters&rsquo; house for a longer time should be like older brothers and sisters. They should be supportive and warm toward the younger saints who may still have some bad habits. The younger saints should know that the more experienced ones are willing to help them. We are all the same, and our spirit has been enlivened. If we can cultivate the young ones in this way, in two to three weeks they will be delivered from their old habits. We should not be rigid when we help them, nor should we be loose. We should learn the best way to use the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING A STUDENT CENTER IN TAIPEI</h2>
<p>According to our observation, there is also the need of a student center in Taipei. Hall three will be renovated, and we feel that it should be made into a student center because it is situated near several universities. Our plan is to have a building with six stories above ground and seven stories underground. We would like to be able to house as many people as possible, at least three hundred students. The student center will be larger than a brothers&rsquo; or sisters&rsquo; house, and we believe that it will be twice as effective as corporate housing. The student center will need careful planning. There needs to be space designated for activities and lounges, and at least two or three floors should be used as bedrooms. In addition, there is a need to learn how to manage and take care of such a place so that it meets the needs of the students and can reap a harvest.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Those who are burdened to preach the gospel in the schools or in the community must learn the truth of the gospel. To learn the truth can be compared to receiving an education. A person who has an elementary school education speaks and behaves with the flavor of elementary school; a person who has a high school education speaks and behaves with the flavor of high school; and a person who has a college education speaks and behaves with the flavor of college. This speaking and behavior are related to one&rsquo;s level of education. This is the same as our learning the truth of the gospel. Whether we serve full time or part time, we need to preach the gospel in the schools and in the community. But if we are not equipped in the truth of the gospel, we will be short of the element of the gospel when we speak with others. For this reason we must spend time to learn the truth of the gospel.</p>
<p>In Christianity giving messages, preaching the gospel, and teaching the truth are taken care of by people who have attended a seminary. We cannot say that all the believers in the congregations do nothing, but very few of them do anything. In America there used to be a popular trend in which lay people were invited to give messages, preach the gospel, and serve as pastors. However, this trend could not continue, because there was no material with which to teach. According to the Bible, all believers are priests and should preach the gospel. Not only those who are apostles, prophets, evangelists, and teachers should preach the gospel, but every believer is a priest and should preach the gospel. This is our practice.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Bible</h2>
<p>We need to preach the gospel to families, to students in school, to those who work, and to children. In order to announce the gospel, we must know the truth of the gospel, have the utterance of the gospel, and know the manner of the gospel. In order to know the manner of the gospel, we need to be educated. Without a proper education, we cannot know the manner of the gospel. Hence, we need to equip ourselves with the truth of the gospel. In particular, the full-timers should spend several hours every morning to study the New Testament and the Old Testament. In addition, they should set aside time to read books concerning the truth of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures</h2>
<p>Concerning the truth of the gospel, there are three books we would like to recommend. The first is <em>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures.</em> The sixteen topics in volume 1 are concerning salvation, beginning with the condition of man and ending with the security of salvation. The condition of man speaks of man&rsquo;s need of salvation. The love of God speaks of the source of salvation. Christ&rsquo;s redemption speaks of the accomplishment of salvation. The work of the Holy Spirit speaks of the application of salvation. Repentance and believing speak of the conditions for obtaining salvation. After a person believes into the Lord, he is forgiven, cleansed, sanctified, justified, and reconciled. Thus, he is regenerated, receives eternal life, and obtains the freedom of being released. This is salvation. After being saved, he still needs to know the assurance and security of his salvation. We should have a thorough knowledge of these sixteen topics. The verses quoted are the best verses for the gospel, and we should memorize them. We should memorize the verses related to justification, salvation, regeneration, sanctification, and obtaining eternal life. We need to know not only the verses but also the verse references.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:24 says, &ldquo;Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness.&rdquo; Acts 16:31 says, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household,&rdquo; and 13:39 says, &ldquo;From all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified.&rdquo; We should memorize such verses so that whether we are at home, at school, or in the meeting hall, we can use these verses to preach the gospel. We need to read God&rsquo;s Word to others, because the Bible has the authority of God, and it has a unique place in people&rsquo;s heart. Sometimes when we speak without using the Bible, our speaking is not so powerful. We can open the Bible and read from Acts 13:39: &ldquo;From all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified,&rdquo; and then we can ask the other person to read it. By reading the verse a few times, this word will enter into the person, and the Holy Spirit will operate. Therefore, we need to learn the verses that we will use for the gospel and also learn their references. The young people should commit all the verses to memory.</p>
<p>In 1938 in Chefoo we began to study <em>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures,</em> which contained forty-two topics. By 1949, when we studied it again in Taipei, the number of topics was increased to sixty. The first sixteen topics are comprehensive, and the verses quoted are the most appropriate. If we can memorize all the verses for the first sixteen topics, we will be equipped for battle, just as the children of Israel were equipped in the Old Testament. These verses are like sharp arrows. We should also read the explanations. In particular, the young people need these verses.</p><h2 class="head3">Gospel Outlines and How to Lead<br />
Different Kinds of People to Receive the Gospel</h2>
<p>Another book, <em>Gospel Outlines</em>, contains outlines on specific topics from Genesis through Revelation. This book is not an exposition of the Bible. It covers the Bible by topic, and contains two hundred sixty-six topics. There was an American brother who used to be a preacher with the Brethren assemblies and was an itinerant traveling evangelist. Many were saved through him, and he established at least ten Brethren assemblies. One day he called me and said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you have written so many books, but I think three of them are the most valuable. If you agree, I hope to promote these three books in Christianity so that every believer will have a copy in their hands.&rdquo; One of the books was <em>Gospel Outlines.</em></p>
<p>In the outlines for the training on service held in 1953, there is a section related to preaching the gospel. Later we edited the outline into a small booklet entitled <em>How to Lead Different Kinds of People to Receive the Gospel</em> (see <em>Fellowship concerning the Urgent Need of the Vital Groups,</em> pp. 245-250). In this section, people are classified into twenty categories. The first category of people is those who live in sins, the second is those who are empty, and the third is those who are knowledgeable and rational. The other categories are the moral ones; the self-righteous ones; the atheists; the polytheists; those who are disgusted with the world; lovers of pleasures and vainglory; the realists; those who are ambitious and capable of great achievements; lovers of money; lovers of knowledge; lovers of fame, wealth, and position; the antagonists; the skeptics; those who are sad, pessimistic, and miserable; the stubborn ones; the churchgoers; and those who are indifferent. Once we know these different kinds of people, we can learn how to deal with them.</p>
<p>For instance, when speaking to a person who is living in sins, we need to touch the pains of sins and his conscience. However, we should not provoke him or cause him to dislike us; neither should we cause him to feel that we are condemning him. If we know that he is an alcoholic, we should not mention anything related to alcohol; neither should we mention stealing if we know that he steals. This requires wisdom. After reading the different categories, it is best to remember them and begin to practice.</p>
<p>The American brother whom we mentioned earlier was willing to promote the following three books in Christianity: <em>Gospel Outlines</em>, <em>How to Lead Different Kinds of People to Receive the Gospel,</em> and <em>The Economy of God.</em> This proves that believers have used these three books and know that they are very useful. <em>Gospel Outlines</em> may be more difficult to use, because it contains only topics and outlines. It does not have any explanation. Nevertheless, after reading the topics a person can still understand something related to the gospel. We may not be able to study all two hundred sixty-six topics, but we can at least study a few of them.</p>
<p>For example, the first topic is concerning the origin of the universe, which is God. This topic is worth studying, because God is the source of the universe. The second topic is concerning the meaning of the universe, which is also God, whereas the center of the universe, the third topic, is man. Then there is the evil one of the universe, who is the devil, Satan, and the tragedy of the universe, which is the fall of man. Following these, there is the gospel as the glad tidings of the universe, and Christ as the Savior of the universe. All these are worth studying.</p>
<p>Some of the topics are in groups. For example, there are a number of topics related to man, including the origin of man, the nature of man, the deeds of man, the need of man, the Savior of man, the salvation of man, the way of salvation for man, and the proof of man&rsquo;s salvation, as well as topics concerning after a man is saved. These are all matters related to man. The second group is related to sin, including the origin of sin&mdash;Satan, the one committing sin&mdash;Adam, the One who condemns sin&mdash;God, the One who redeems us from sin&mdash;Christ, the One who forgives sin&mdash;God, the one who is freed from sin&mdash;the believer, and the one who bears sin&mdash;Satan. The third group is concerning the main points of the gospel, including God, the devil, man, sin, the Savior, redemption, believing, and salvation. The fourth group has questions concerning the gospel. The fifth group is the chain of human life, the sixth group is the gospel of life, the seventh group is the meaning of life, and the eighth group concerns the Christian faith. We should make an effort to study these topics. Learning these topics can be likened to dying a piece of cloth. We should not put the cloth in the dye for a short time and then take it out immediately. Instead, we should keep the cloth in the dye for a long time so that the dye can saturate the cloth. We need to stay in the &ldquo;dye&rdquo; of the truth of the gospel for a long time so that we are saturated with the gospel. In this way we will be filled inwardly with the gospel, and what comes out of our mouth will also be the gospel. Then the preaching of the gospel will spontaneously be strong.</p><h2 class="head1">TRYING OUR BEST TO GET INTO THE MINISTRY BOOKS</h2>
<p>While many seminary students are studying in seminaries, they prepare fifty-two topics that they will use weekly after they graduate and become pastors. What we publish in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery contains life and truth, not empty doctrine. We have published quite a number of books and received letters of appreciation from many people. In one letter the writers said that they spent money to buy books from other places but did not gain any benefit even after reading twenty to forty pages; however, they gained something from the first page of our publication. Our publications are the best source to learn the truth, and they are guaranteed not to lead a person into error. Since most Christian books do not contain a controlling vision, a believer can be led astray. However, our knowledge of the Bible affords us a basic controlling vision.</p>
<p>After the apostles, the first group of people to study theology was the church fathers. The last group of believers who thoroughly studied the Bible was the Brethren. In between the church fathers and the Brethren, many believers studied the Bible and put out books, which was their theology. Martin Luther had his theology, and John Calvin also had his theology. There are several schools in today&rsquo;s theology, and the best among them is related to the Brethren. The most orthodox seminaries in America are Dallas Theological Seminary and Moody Bible Institute, both of which are based on the theology of the Brethren. The Scofield Reference Bible is also based on the teaching of the Brethren. If a believer who desires to expound the Bible takes the Brethren theology as his standard, he will not be far off the mark.</p>
<p>We cannot say much concerning other schools of theology. We cannot accept everything from reformed theology. Those in reformed theology do not even speak of regeneration, and they do not accept that believers have two natures within them. In my youth I purchased quite a number of books by reformed theologians, but I eventually threw all of them away. Around 1965 I disposed of five big boxes of books. The books were mainly in English and had followed me from northern China to Shanghai, to Taiwan, and finally to America.</p>
<p>Consulting various schools of theology, especially the theology of the Brethren, has kept us. I was taught by the Brethren for the first seven and a half years of my Christian life. That was my foundation in theology. Later, Brother Nee told me that the <em>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</em> by J. N. Darby would help me the most, and he gave me a set as a gift in 1933. I have used this set whenever I encountered a difficult problem; however, I do not follow it blindly. I also consult others&rsquo; writings. Almost all the notes in the New Testament Recovery Version were written after looking into the writings of others and making a decision about the usefulness of the content. For this reason I have the boldness to say that the New Testament Recovery Version is not my creation. It is the crystallization of Christian theology, which we inherited by standing on the shoulders of those who have gone before us.</p>
<p>We save much time by studying the Recovery Version, because many good points in the expositions of others are included in our footnotes. We should try our best to get into our publications. This does not mean that we should not read books published by others but that reading our publications is the shortest and the safest way to learn the truth. In particular, we should read the Recovery Version.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PURSUING THE TRUTH AND GROWTH IN LIFE</h2>
<p>What we are doing is not out of our own imagination. We have inherited the riches of the past nineteen centuries. We consulted and studied these riches together with the light we received from the Lord, and then we either included or dropped an item. Over the past sixteen years the Lord has given us higher and deeper light. Therefore, we must try our best to pursue the truth. The most important matter for the young full-timers is to know the truth and then to pursue the growth in life. These are two basic matters that we must pursue. If we do not know the truth and do not grow in life, we are lacking the basic condition of service.</p>
<p>There is an older sister in Kaohsiung who received three years of spiritual education in the old meeting hall. At that time she was not married, but now one of her sons is an elder. This shows that the truth is effective. Another sister, who preached the gospel in the schools, was bold and fearless and was not afraid to lose her job. I met her parents when I preached the gospel in Tsingtao, China. Her parents received much help and enjoyed the Lord&rsquo;s grace. This sister is now serving in a church overseas.</p><h2 class="head1">SPREADING THE BENEFIT OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY TO THE ENTIRE EARTH</h2>
<p>These examples show that what we are cultivated in influences the next generation. What we planted spread from mainland China to Taiwan and even overseas. This proves that all the situations in the world today are to facilitate the Lord&rsquo;s move. This also shows that the seed of the gospel that we plant, the truth that we release, and the divine life that we supply are of manifold value. The benefit they bring will spread to the entire earth.</p>
<p>I was saved as a young man. At that time, a young woman came to my town and held a gospel meeting. I went to listen to her out of curiosity, and the Lord gained me. As I was walking home, the Lord called me, and I said, &ldquo;O Lord, even if You give me the whole world, I do not want it. I want to take my Bible and preach the gospel in village after village. Even if I must eat tree roots and drink water from streams, I desire to preach Your gospel.&rdquo; In the summer of that year I went to the villages. I was still a student, but I resolved that this would be my work for the rest of my life. That was a small dream that I had for the countryside of Chefoo. Little did I know that the Lord would take me to country after country.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace, the gospel and life have spread from here to millions of people. For this we worship the Lord from the depths of our hearts. We rejoice that so many young people have consecrated themselves to serve the Lord full time. They must be faithful and loyal to bring in the unlimited blessing of the Lord. There are around two hundred full-timers in Taiwan. We do not know when the Lord will return, but there is a great need before us. Not only do the unbelievers need the gospel; if we open our eyes, we will see that Christianity is desolate and in need of the gospel, the truth, and life.</p>
<p>In 1949 I began the work in Taiwan. I came to Taiwan with virtually nothing and a household of twelve people. We lived in a house that was less than three hundred square feet. I wrote the first publication on a coffee table. When I came to Taiwan, I had only enough money to cover my family expenses for three months.</p>
<p>Before 1949 there were less than twenty churches overseas. Now, thirty-five years later, there are more than six hundred churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery on all five continents, and this does not include those in mainland China. Moreover, the literature work has also spread. There are two main stations in America: one is in Anaheim, California, and the other is in Irving, Texas. In Taipei we have the Gospel Book Room with at least fifty to sixty full-time brothers and sisters serving in three departments. The literature work began in the less than three-hundred-square-foot house where I used to live.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LABORING WITH A GOAL AND CARING FOR THE BASICS</h2>
<p>We need to labor in the Lord&rsquo;s work solidly and care for the basics. We should always begin small. The young serving ones need to understand two points. First, if you have a desire and are willing to receive a burden for the gospel, the truth, life, and the church, the Lord will bless you and use you. Second, you should always remember not to aim high in your work and not to neglect the basics. You should not do a work that is a display, having no substance. Our work must be solid. It should begin small and gradually extend to a larger scale.</p>
<p>From the first day until now, this work has not been thwarted by frustrations. A work that is all show with no substance cannot withstand frustrations, but a work that begins small cannot be thwarted by any frustration. It will grow step by step. Even if there are some frustrations, they will only bring in valuable experiences. For this reason, when the young full-timers labor on the campuses, if there is an opportunity to do something big, you should not do it, because you are not able to bear up a big work, and your foundation and roots are not firm. We should begin on a small scale and work step by step, never attempting to make a show. While you are still young, you should learn to plant your feet on solid ground, care for the basics, and not aim high. You must begin in a solid way from the basics. We should preach nothing but the truth, the gospel, life, and the church. If you take the way of caring for the basics and move forward in a stable way, you will surely bring in the Lord&rsquo;s blessings.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">CONCERNING THE GOSPEL IN SCHOOLS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<p>Concerning preaching the gospel in schools, we still need to fellowship regarding the aspect of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING A PERSON OF PRAYER</h2>
<p>As persons who serve the Lord, we first need to learn and exercise to be persons of prayer. In the beginning of the church life, the believers in Jerusalem practiced having all things common. In Acts 6 the Jewish believers who spoke Greek were murmuring. They complained that their widows were overlooked in the daily dispensing (v. 1). Then the twelve apostles gathered all the disciples and said to them, &ldquo;It is not fitting for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables. But...look for seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint over this need. But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word&rdquo; (vv. 2-4). This shows that the apostles, who were exercised in the ministry of the word, prayed continually and steadfastly.</p>
<p>All the full-time serving ones need to pursue the truth and growth in life. Both are crucial. However, there is still one matter that you must always learn and exercise in, that is, you must be a person of prayer. Whether you are a younger or an older full-timer, since you have given yourself to the work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, you should pray. We should pray for the work we are participating in, pray for ourselves, and pray for the move of the work and the target of the work. We should also pray for the various details of our specific work.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Exercising to Look to the Lord in Our Heart</h2>
<p>For the propagation of the gospel in the schools, we need to visit the students in the dorms, distribute gospel tracts, and even lead small-group Bible studies with the students. We need to cover these matters with prayer. In other words, we need to saturate our work with prayer. The need in the schools is great. We should not say that we are too busy or that we do not have time. When we labor, we often discover that we do not have enough time to do everything. Even if this is so, we still need to pray. Prayer requires time. Even when we are short of time, we still need to pray. We must exercise to look to the Lord in our heart and lean on Him in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Prayer Being to Tell the Lord<br />
That We Do Not Know What to Do<br />
and That We Are Not Able</h2>
<p>Prayer is the expression of our attitude toward the Lord that we do not know what to do and that we are not able to do anything. In principle, it is the poor who ask others for help; the wealthy do not ask for help. It is not easy for a person who is capable, knowledgeable, and resourceful to ask for help, because he has everything he needs. People in the world say that it is best not to ask for help. As those who serve the Lord, we have nothing; therefore, we can only say, &ldquo;In everything ask God.&rdquo; We should ask God concerning everything. In serving God, we should never think that we should ask God only when our inability to do something is manifested. It is our ability to do something that is useless. If a brother who is about to give a message prays only because he cannot speak well, he will not pray if he speaks well. Such a brother must realize that even if he were eloquent, his speaking would be useless. Whatever comes out of our natural ability is useless in our service to God.</p>
<p>We encourage the saints to get a good education, but if we try to apply what we have learned in our education to God&rsquo;s work, it will not be profitable. We encourage the saints to study Greek and to learn many languages, but we should not rely on what we have learned. We must regard both aspects. Some people are highly educated and renowned for their research, which qualifies them to be college professors, but they may not be useful in God&rsquo;s work. Having a higher education is useful when we exercise in prayer to do God&rsquo;s work. Otherwise, the education that we have received can act as veils on our mind, just as layers of dust on a window can block the light. Such veils can be removed only by prayer. How can God use a person with a hardened mind (2 Cor. 3:14-16)? We must learn to be a person of prayer.</p>
<p>To be a person of prayer does not mean that we are constantly kneeling in prayer. A person of prayer exercises to always have an attitude of being nothing. He may pray, &ldquo;O Lord, I am useless.&rdquo; In Luke 17 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Which of you, having a slave who is plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, Come immediately and recline at table? Will he not rather say to him, Prepare something that I may dine, and gird yourself and serve me until I eat and drink; and after that you will eat and drink? He does not thank the slave because he did the things which were ordered, does he? So also you, when you do all the things which are ordered you, say, We are unprofitable slaves; we have done what we ought to have done&rdquo; (vv. 7-10). The slave had done many things for his master; however, when he went home, he still had to wait on his master, indicating that he was an unprofitable slave. Such is the attitude we should have when we pray.</p>
<p>We will not pray if we feel that we can do something. When our heart, our spirit, our attitude, our feeling, and our emotion are that we are useless and incapable of doing anything, we will pray and look to the Lord. Our problem is that we are short of prayer. In this matter not only the young serving ones need to practice, but also the older ones need to practice. We should always have such an attitude toward the Lord of being unprofitable slaves.</p><h2 class="head2">Prayer Bringing In Watchfulness</h2>
<p>Another thing that needs our attention related to prayer is the matter of being watchful. Prayer brings in watchfulness. The Lord Jesus often put being watchful together with prayer. He said, &ldquo;Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation&rdquo; (Matt. 26:41). It is difficult for a person who does not pray to be watchful. I can testify concerning this. The insight I receive concerning the work, including my thorough understanding and my long-term view, comes from prayer. Before I pray, I might have a vague feeling concerning many things, but while I am praying, a sense of alertness comes. This sense is watchfulness. The word <em>watch</em> has the meaning of observing. To watch is to open your eyes. Instead of having our eyes closed in confusion, we observe things thoroughly. To watch does not merely mean to look but also to observe. The most effective observation is done in prayer.</p>
<p>When we pray, we should learn not to speak so many of our own words, because this interrupts the watchfulness and the observing in the spirit. However, if we do not open our mouth to utter anything, our mind will wander. We may be distracted if we pray with our eyes opened, and our mind may wander if we pray with our eyes closed. It is not easy to stop our mind when we pray. We need to learn to be a person of prayer, to have a spirit of prayer, and to give every person we contact and every thing we do to the Lord in prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO REJECT AND DENY THE SELF</h2>
<p>One who serves the Lord should also learn to reject and deny the self. The Chinese Union Version translates the phrase <em>deny himself</em> in Matthew 16:24 as &ldquo;sacrifice the self.&rdquo; To sacrifice the self means to get rid of the self. This translation does not convey the correct meaning, because no matter how hard we try to get rid of the self, the self does not leave us; it is with us all the time. The self is corrupted. The content of the self is the flesh, the old creation, with its passions, lusts, sins, jealousy, strife, and ambition. All of these things are in the flesh. However, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me&rdquo; (v. 24). To take up the cross means to remain in the Lord&rsquo;s death, to not depart from His death, and to allow the Lord&rsquo;s death to operate in us and kill the self. The more we cooperate with the Lord, the easier it is for us to deny the self. We need to learn to deny the self when we fellowship with the brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>We can never fully learn the lesson of denying the self. We need to continue learning this lesson until we are transfigured. As long as we are living, our self and the old creation continue to exist. The longer we live on the earth, the more experienced we may become concerning spiritual things, but our self may also become more experienced. Hence, for the rest of our lives, there is no end to learning the lesson of denying the self. Denying the self is not something that we can learn after hearing a message. We must learn to reject the self and to deny the self all the time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING BEING INDIVIDUALISTIC</h2>
<p>In serving the Lord we also need to avoid being individualistic. We are members of Christ&rsquo;s Body, and no member can exist alone. Any member that is separated will die, because a member that is detached from the Body is isolated, and this results in death. This lesson is particularly for the young serving ones. As we learn to serve the Lord, we need to exercise to live in the principle of the Body. We should never do anything alone. Instead, two or three saints should coordinate together and learn to fellowship together, checking with one another&rsquo;s feelings. This is not the same as a subordinate requesting permission from his boss. It is the fellowship among members of the Body related to their feelings concerning specific matters. This is a great protection. We can compare this to a military troop that is fighting on the front line. Any soldier who leaves the group is likely to be killed. This is an example of how we need to be careful and realize that whenever we are alone and isolated, Satan will take the opportunity to attack us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT HAVING OPINIONS</h2>
<p>In serving the Lord we should not have any opinions. Serving the Lord is a corporate matter that requires the serving ones to come together to fellowship without any opinions. May we all learn to be persons without opinions. You may say that if you are to have no opinion, it is better not to pray or fellowship. This is not a proper attitude. Everyone should speak, but our speaking should be in wisdom, without opinions. We can give an example to show the difference between wisdom and opinion. A person with an ulcer should not eat anything sour, sweet, or fried. This is not an opinion. However, suppose this same person suggests that everyone follow his way of eating. That is an opinion.</p><h2 class="head2">Learning to Have Insight</h2>
<p>Insight requires knowledge and experience. It is a unique view in which a person perceives the need and recognizes what should be done. Generally speaking, most people who like to voice their opinions do not have much insight; that is, their view is not clear. Our view and opinion concerning a matter is often affected by several factors: our habits, environment, and tradition. For example, some people think that we should eat white rice with kimchi every morning, whereas others want to have coffee and toast. However, insight comes from knowledge and experience and from having a thorough understanding of the needs in a matter and knowing how to carry out the matter.</p>
<p>When we serve with others in prayer and fellowship, we need to discern what is an opinion and what is insight. Debates in social meetings are mostly due to different opinions, but in society people do not consider that what is an issue is merely an opinion. We are serving the Lord together, we have spent many years in the church, and we have all kinds of meetings. We need to differentiate between opinion and insight. We at least need to learn to be delivered from our opinion and to exercise to have insight. Then what we say will not be an opinion. We need to practice to speak without opinions and to speak with insight.</p>
<p>Opinions should not be expressed, because they lead to arguments. A husband and wife may have morning revival together, pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word and calling on His name in a good way. Then when they sit down to eat breakfast, the husband might express an opinion, and an argument ensues. Such a scenario is quite common. We should not have opinions about our husband or wife, and we should even refrain from expressing our opinions to our children. If we express too many opinions to our children, it will be easy for them to be confrontational when they grow up. Some children consider their parents&rsquo; opinions and are reluctant to express their own opinions. As a result, all their frustrations remain pent up inside, and they express their feelings by pounding on the wall or stomping on the floor. Those who understand the situation know that this behavior is directed toward their parents. Most arguments in a family come from opinions.</p>
<p>Fights and arguments in human society are due to opinions. Over the years I have learned many lessons. Sometimes a word would be on the tip of my tongue, but I would swallow it as soon as I felt that it was an opinion. The Chinese say that disease enters through the mouth, but misfortune issues from the mouth. Many times when I was meeting with the elders, my words got me into trouble. Therefore, I have learned the lesson to swallow my words as soon as I sensed that they were an opinion. Sometimes, if the urge to say something was strong, I would leave the meeting and return when I was calm. This is my practice not only with the elders but also with my wife, my children, and my grandchildren. Sometimes my grandchildren would say, &ldquo;Grandpa, this is not right.&rdquo; Then I close my mouth and do not say anything else.</p>
<p>It is not easy to learn not to express any opinion. We should learn not to speak casually when we fellowship or to say whatever we like. This is what the Bible calls gossip (1 Tim. 5:13). Idle people do not have anything to do. They gossip about others and say things that they should not say. In our fellowship, however, we should try not to express our opinion. When there is a need to say something, we should look to the Lord to give us wisdom so that we have a thorough view and speak with insight. Then our words will have light and revelation and will render help. We must practice this.</p>
<p>In 1936 the work arranged for me to labor in Tientsin and to cover the need in Peking. I therefore traveled between the two places often. The church in Peking had many lovely brothers and sisters, but they had the problem of opinions. Even the elders had many opinions. There were many opinions because all the saints loved the church and were full of burden. Moreover, they were about the same age. While I was with them, I did nothing but solve the problems caused by their opinions. I tried my best to help them put an end to their opinions. The brothers were willing to be subdued, because they appreciated me. But when I left, their opinions would again arise.</p>
<p>Brother Watchman Nee said that the elders in that locality were the best elders. He felt that those brothers were open and frank, unlike most Chinese people. Brother Nee had insight. He knew that Chinese people pride themselves on being patient and tolerant. It may seem as if nothing is amiss, but everyone has many things within, and no one is willing to open. This is a difficult situation. Those elders expressed their differences so that everything was apparent and open, and this troubled the saints. It was not until the Japanese occupation of Peking, when many brothers and sisters retreated to Chungking, China, that the opinions were eradicated.</p>
<p>Some might ask whether this means that we should not speak so as not to have opinions. Brother Nee had much insight, and he said that those who do not speak may have even more opinions. Chinese people have a culture that emphasizes tolerance and a kind of Christian pursuit of ethics; therefore, it is difficult for our work to advance. For example, a brother can have the strength of not speaking, but I am not certain that this is truly a strength. Whether or not we speak, we have to reject our opinions. On the one hand, it may be better not to speak so that no problems arise, but on the other hand, when we hide things and do not speak, it is even more troublesome.</p><h2 class="head2">Opinions Being Our Greatest Problem</h2>
<p>The greatest problem in the church life is our opinions. Our opinions determine whether our meetings are good. Our opinions determine whether our locality is strong. It may seem that our problems have nothing to do with opinions, but the hidden cause of our problems is opinions. This word is for the young saints as well as for the elder ones. Since we love the church and expect our church to be thriving and prosperous, we must bury our opinions. I dare not boast that I do not have opinions, because opinions are hidden deep within us; therefore, we are not conscious of having opinions. By the Lord&rsquo;s grace, I can testify that on many occasions I have avoided my opinions. We all need to learn this lesson.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING NO COMPETITION IN THE LORD&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>There should not be any competition in the Lord&rsquo;s work. In the world everything involves competition. In education, in sports, and in business people compete with others. But in the Lord&rsquo;s work, we should not compete. Suppose a group of three or five saints are laboring at a junior high school and another three are laboring at a different junior high school. Without a doubt there will be competition between the two groups; they will compete and compare results. An elder in hall one expects hall one to be the best hall, and an elder in hall two expects hall two to be the best. A responsible brother from the church in Hong Kong might not say that he desires to make the church in Hong Kong better than the church in Taipei, but he is displeased when the saints praise the church in Taipei and say that the church in Hong Kong is not as advanced. The saints in Taipei also do not like to hear that the church in Hong Kong is more advanced than the church in Taipei. Such situations exist among us. The brothers and sisters in Hong Kong become angry if they hear someone say that the church in Hong Kong is not good. The saints in Taipei react in the same way if someone says that Taipei is not up to the standard. We are all the same. Our reactions show that inwardly we are troubled.</p>
<p>The brothers from Taichung will be unhappy if they hear that the church in Taichung is not as good as other churches. The brothers from Hsinchu will be beside themselves if they hear people say that Hsinchu is the best church in northern Taiwan, but the saints from Taipei will not be happy. This is our situation. We are always competing and striving. This is the flesh.</p>
<p>In Taipei we are promoting several aspects of the work, including practicing small group meetings, preaching the gospel in the community, preaching the gospel in schools, and carrying out the children&rsquo;s work. However, many opinions have surfaced because every aspect of the work is trying to recruit saints. For example, the saints who are leading the small groups are trying to recruit the most capable saints to labor with them. No one is fighting outwardly, but these contentions do exist. I heard that those who are preaching the gospel in the community are determined to recruit some of the most useful saints. Similarly, those who preach the gospel in the schools have identified some saints not to include in their work for fear that they would not contribute much, and thus they would lose the competition.</p>
<p>Even though the saints are serving, this fighting is a common fault in most of us. We like to work with those whom we consider to be experts. Because many young full-time brothers will participate in preaching the gospel in the schools, everyone should be clear. Otherwise, when you begin laboring, you will all fight for workers; you will want the strong saints to join with you, and you will reject the weak ones. Our hand has five fingers, but not every finger is the same. Not every one of the young full-timers is strong; some of them are weak. Therefore, I am inoculating you beforehand. We must not compete with one another. Everyone who competes will not succeed. Competition will not make us rich; it will only cause us to be poor. This is a law in spiritual things.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Expecting Others to Be Better Than Ourselves</h2>
<p>We each need to adopt the attitude that my work is to glorify the Lord and that your work is also to glorify the Lord. Whatever work we do is to glorify the Lord. Furthermore, we should desire rather to see others succeed in their work. We must learn and exercise to have such an attitude. If I labor in Taichung, I should hope that the work in Hsinchu will be better than that in Taichung or that the work in Tainan will be better. Suppose one of my co-workers would be more useful in another place; I would be willing for the Lord to lead accordingly. This is the attitude we should adopt. In a large church it is inevitable that some areas of the work overlap or that there is friction because everyone wants the capable saints. However, we should try our best to avoid this.</p><h2 class="head2">Having No Choice in the Work</h2>
<p>After I entered the work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, I never chose where to work. I simply did as I was told. Wherever the work sent me, I went. Most of the time I was sent to a place where the work was experiencing difficulty, but by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy I never made my own choices. Wherever the work sent me, I went. When the work sent me to Taiwan, another brother was sent to assist me with the Hok-kien dialect. However, this brother did not come to Taiwan, because he felt that Taiwan was backward. Many years later I went to America and stayed with Brother Samuel Chang for a time. I had much fellowship with him. He told me that when I was laboring in mainland China, some of the workers thought that I was rather na&#239;ve concerning the work, because I went wherever I was told to go, and I did whatever I was asked to do. This is the attitude that we should have. We hope that we will all learn to be na&#239;ve in this way.</p>
<p>The wife of Brother Abraham Chang lived in Shanghai and helped with the literature work in 1940. She can testify that I was indeed rather na&#239;ve. I did not speak much, unless I was giving a message. You would not hear my voice in the co-workers&rsquo; meetings. Coming to labor in Taiwan was the right thing to do. More Chinese people congregate in Taiwan than anywhere else. None of the other countries&mdash;Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, or Thailand&mdash;can match Taiwan. Taiwan is the best place for the work, and it is greatly blessed by the Lord. No one can deny this. Thirty years ago no one would choose to come to Taiwan, but today the churches here are being blessed. No human hand could accomplish this. It was accomplished by the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT HAVING FOLLOWERS</h2>
<p>We should not have a group of followers. Every business requires its employees to be followers, but we in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery must not have a following. I do not have a following. Wherever I go, I am with the local saints. When the Lord took me from Chefoo to Shanghai, I did not take a following with me. The saints who assisted me and coordinated with me spoke the Shanghai dialect. When I went to America, I did not have a following. I did not take a co-worker from Taiwan, and I did not use any co-worker from Taiwan, because what was useful in Taiwan might not have been useful in America. Taking a group of followers from Taiwan to America would have been a hindrance.</p>
<p>If we have a group of followers when we labor in the schools, we will take our followers with us when we are reassigned to work in the small groups. When we are reassigned from one area of service to another, we should go by ourselves and not take any followers with us. This has become a common problem among us: wherever we work, we take a group of followers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT HAVING NATURAL RELATIONSHIPS</h2>
<p>A group of followers is an indication that we have natural relationships with others. In our service we cannot have natural relationships with others. We should not have a group of saints with whom we agree in taste and temperament. This is poison. Those who have a natural relationship discuss everything with each other. The Chinese describe such close friendships as breathing through the same nostrils. The Lord sent the disciples out two by two, but He did not allow them to have natural relationships. Even though Peter, John, and James were always together, in John 21 the Lord told Peter, &ldquo;When you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go&rdquo; (v. 18). In verse 21 Peter asked what John&rsquo;s future would be, and the Lord replied, &ldquo;If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me&rdquo; (v. 22). The Lord&rsquo;s response implied that they must not have anything natural among them.</p>
<p>When the Roman Empire was persecuting the believers, Peter, John, and James were not martyred together. James was martyred first and then Peter, but John was exiled to the island of Patmos. Although we are brothers and sisters and members one of another, there should never be a situation of natural relationships among us. Many corrupt things come out of natural relationships. The points of this fellowship are to inoculate us. Please remember these points. As we continue in the Lord, these things will be manifested among us, not only in the younger serving ones but also in the older serving ones.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING A PURE PERSON</h2>
<p>We need to learn the lesson to be a pure person, that is, a person who trusts in the Lord. We also need to learn to be simple members in Christ&rsquo;s Body, knowing only the Body and the Head, not having our own &ldquo;clique,&rdquo; not having any natural relationship, and not having any following. A following is a little sect. We should not have a following in our own locality, nor should we have a following in other localities. Our co-workers are the co-workers of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. When I come to Taiwan, the co-workers in Taiwan are my co-workers. When I am in America, the co-workers there are my co-workers. When I go to Germany, the co-workers there are my co-workers. It is the same when I go to Brazil. I have so many co-workers because I do not have a following of co-workers. Instead, all the co-workers are my co-workers. Having a following shows that we are sick and divisive, that is, sectarian. This principle applies in one locality and in many localities.</p>
<p>Those who have a heart to serve the Lord should learn this lesson from their youth. They should learn not to have a competitive, comparing spirit but a pure spirit. They should be willing to serve the Lord and give the Lord an outlet. We thank the Lord when He blesses Hong Kong, and we thank Him when He blesses Yungho. We are here learning our weaknesses and also learning from the strengths of others. This is to have a right spirit.</p>
<p>If there are small groups that do well in the future, we all must learn from their strong points and their merits. If the children&rsquo;s work does well, we also need to learn from the children&rsquo;s work. We should never compete or be jealous over one another, nor should we have our own choice. It is only in this way that we can maintain the Lord&rsquo;s blessing and maintain our longevity in the Lord&rsquo;s service. We need to be kept by the Lord; otherwise, we will not last in the service. We must learn these lessons every day so that we can remain in the Lord&rsquo;s work and allow Him to use us to bring His blessing.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CONCERNING THE COMMUNITY GOSPEL</h1>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR LINES OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Gospel in the Homes</h2>
<p>We need to divide the gospel into four lines. The first line is the gospel in the homes, which we should promote in the small groups. We need to encourage every brother and sister in the small groups to open their home. We should encourage all the saints, whether they are strong, weak, or only occasionally attend a meeting, to open their homes for the preaching of the gospel. Some small groups have already begun to promote this. We are not promoting the preaching of the gospel in the small groups; we are encouraging every saint in a small group to open his home and preach the gospel in his home. There may be two to four families in a small group. We are encouraging the brothers and sisters to preach the gospel in their homes.</p>
<p>According to my observation, many small groups have already begun preaching the gospel as a group. Our initial intention in promoting the opening of the homes was to preach the gospel. The small group has many functions. First, it maintains the existing brothers and sisters. It also recovers the dormant saints. Finally, it encourages the saints to preach the gospel in the small group, in their homes, and in their daily living. We should not be mistaken and think that we are promoting the preaching of the gospel as a group. Our intention is to encourage the saints to preach the gospel in their homes. Suppose there are nine saints in a small group from five homes. We should encourage each of these homes to open for the preaching of the gospel.</p>
<p>Do not be concerned whether our promoting will be successful. We should simply promote this matter; we will consider the next step if our promoting does not work. In our leading of the small groups, we are promoting every home to open and preach the gospel. How long it will take for this to be successful is another matter. Every home will not open immediately. It may be that out of five homes none will be willing to open, or it may be that only one home is willing to open. We should not be discouraged. We only need to keep the principle in the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>In Matthew 25 the Lord spoke of a slothful slave who managed his master&rsquo;s possessions. When the master returned, the slave said, &ldquo;Behold, you have what is yours&rdquo; (v. 25). He boasted to his master that he did not lose any money. The slave thought that he had done a good thing because he guarded his master&rsquo;s money and did not lose anything. However, his master reproached him as an evil and slothful slave. The slave said, &ldquo;Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow. And I was afraid and went off and hid your talent in the earth&rdquo; (vv. 24-25). The master replied, &ldquo;You knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not winnow. Therefore you should have deposited my money with the money changers; and when I came, I would have recovered what is mine with interest&rdquo; (vv. 26-27). Every person who serves the Lord should know that the Lord desires us to reap where nothing was sown and to gather where there was no winnowing. We might think that the Lord Jesus is unreasonable. Yes, the Lord is unreasonable. The Lord does not reason according to our reasoning. He has His own reasoning. One day we will stand before the judgment seat, and our excuses will not be accepted. The more excuses we give, the more we will be condemned. The Lord will reprimand us as evil and slothful slaves.</p>
<p>We should not say that we have already spent our energy to bring the brothers to the meeting, and now it is too difficult for us to spend more energy to promote preaching the gospel in the homes. Asking the saints to open their homes may not be as difficult as it seems. We should encourage them. We do not lose anything by encouraging the saints to open their homes to preach the gospel. We do not suffer any loss.</p>
<p>In carrying out the Lord&rsquo;s commission, we should not bargain with Him. I have negotiated with the Lord in the past, telling Him that this or that could not be done. Eventually, I discovered that when I did not negotiate, I spent only ten percent of my energy, but the more I negotiated with the Lord, the more I had to labor. Eventually, I still had to do everything according to Him. Later, if the Lord asked me to do something, I did it without any bargaining. The least costly way is to accept the Lord&rsquo;s command and put it to practice. We are good at bargaining, but the Lord is never bothered with our bargaining. The Lord does not bargain. Rather, the more we bargain, the more we pay. Those who know the Lord understand this. If the Lord says to do something, we should do it quickly. It does not matter whether we succeed or not. Our attitude should be that we go when the Lord wants us to go, and we do what the Lord wants us to do. This is the spirit of a serving one.</p>
<p>We need to encourage the saints to open their homes. The homes may not open immediately, but we should not be discouraged. There is still time. If no home opens this week, we will encourage the saints next week. There are fifty-two weeks in a year, and as long as we are steadfast, every home will be open one day.</p><h2 class="head2">The Gospel in the Schools,<br />
the Gospel in the Community, and<br />
the Gospel to the Children</h2>
<p>The second line of the gospel is the gospel in the schools. According to statistics, the city of Taipei has about one hundred ten thousand college students and two hundred sixty thousand students in junior high school and high school This is a total of three hundred seventy thousand students. We must work on these three hundred seventy thousand students. The third line of the gospel is the community gospel, and the fourth line is the children&rsquo;s work. We should not only preach the gospel to the children but also labor on the children with weekly children&rsquo;s meetings. Hence, there are four lines related to the gospel: the homes, the schools, the community, and the children.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE COMMUNITY GOSPEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Working Saints</h2>
<p>Two full-time co-workers are willing to promote the gospel in the community. In order to begin, we need statistics concerning the number of working saints. In the medical field there are forty-five medical doctors and eighty-two nurses. Fourteen saints are associated with the police force, thirty-four work either with the post office or the telephone and the telegram offices, four are lawyers, and eleven are engineers. Three saints are factory managers, fourteen are company presidents, and twenty-four are general managers. Eighteen saints own companies, and twenty-two are directors. Six saints are representatives in the National Assembly, and one is a legislator. These are general statistics of the employment situation of the brothers and sisters.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Working Saints Opening Their Homes<br />
to Invite Their Fellow Workers to Hear the Gospel</h2>
<p>In preaching the gospel in the community we should not go to a police station or a factory to preach the gospel; neither should we hold a gospel conference in a hospital. Instead, two responsible brothers, who take the lead in the community gospel, need to learn the skill of preaching the gospel. Then they should not preach the gospel directly but teach others to preach the gospel. Therefore, the two brothers need to contact the working saints. For example, the two co-workers need to contact the forty-five saints who are doctors, one by one. They can go to one brother&rsquo;s home to fellowship and pray with him and encourage him to open his home for the gospel to people in the medical field. The co-workers can encourage him to invite his doctor colleagues and their families to his home so that he can preach the gospel while the full-time brothers assist him. This is the way that we preach the gospel to people who work. The working saints should preach the gospel to their fellow workers, that is, to those in their occupation. Their colleagues may be more receptive to them because they have something in common.</p>
<p>In the past preachers gave sermons, but our present leading is completely different. The full-timers should prepare what the brothers and sisters need. If they need Bibles and gospel tracts, the full-timers should prepare them. If they need chairs to be arranged, the full-timers should arrive early to help arrange the chairs. Then the saints should preach the gospel themselves. If a saint does not know how to speak, the full-timers should teach him how to speak.</p>
<p>This way of leading is not a dream; it comes from our observation and personal experience. I studied the way believers preach the gospel in every country that I visited. When I was in Brazil, I spent quite some time observing the largest Christian group there. In America I even studied the method that the Mormons use. Mormonism is heretical because it teaches that the Lord Jesus is not God. However, in America no Christian group can surpass the Mormons in their work. This success confirms the leading we had thirty years ago concerning practicing the small groups. It is regrettable that we later neglected this practice. The success of the Mormons depends on their practice of small groups. The Mormons do not have great evangelists who concentrate on the small groups. Instead, in the small groups they study what should be done and make a plan to be carried out by the small groups. Their way is altogether practical, not theoretical. For this reason, they are more successful than many Christian groups.</p>
<p>In the international airport in Los Angeles, America, there are young Mormon men in teams of two, dressed in suits. They approach Chinese students arriving from China, and in fluent Chinese they offer to give the newcomers a ride to their destination. They can even sit down and engage in a long conversation on world politics in beautiful Chinese. Many new Chinese students who are not familiar with the surroundings are gained by the Mormons, because of their zealous help. This is the reason that many Chinese join the Mormons. The training that the Mormons receive is practical. They learn not only to greet others but also to converse about world politics, and they can speak in good Chinese. After observing them, I feel that our work has not been practical.</p>
<p>The leading in this fellowship is based on our observation and study of both others and ourselves. For example, after considering and studying various aspects of other groups, we discovered that their success depends on the use of small groups. This principle cannot be changed.</p><h2 class="head2">Working Saints Preaching the Gospel<br />
in Their Homes</h2>
<p>In practice, if the saints open their homes for the gospel, they should invite people with the same occupation. There is no need to invite people from other occupations. This is the way we should take if we want to preach the gospel to working people. For example, we can fellowship with a sister who is a nurse to see whether it is suitable for her to open her home. If it is suitable, she can open her home and invite her friends in the nursing occupation to hear the gospel. We should also ask the sister to preach the gospel. There are many advantages to taking this way. Suppose a brother who is a doctor and who does not usually preach the gospel receives the leading of the church and invites his colleagues to his home. His colleagues would be shocked, and their interest would be stirred up when they hear him singing gospel songs and explaining verses from the Bible to them. However, if a full-time brother gives the message, he might display an air of preaching, which would not be interesting to the doctors.</p>
<p>The two kinds of Chinese boxing are an example. One is called fancy boxing, which is mainly for show and cannot inflict any harm. The other is solid boxing which has the ability to kill. We cannot do the Lord&rsquo;s work as if we are merely doing fancy boxing to dazzle the eye but not devastate. We should work as if we are doing solid boxing and hit the target with every blow. This is the burden that the brothers who take the lead to promote the work must receive. This burden will bring results, no matter how heavy it may seem. If we can have thorough fellowship with the working saints in the twenty-one halls in the church in Taipei so that they open their homes to preach the gospel to their colleagues at work, the church will flourish, prosper, and bear new fruit every month. Moreover, this kind of fruit often comes in clusters, like grapes.</p>
<p>Not only should we preach the gospel in the medical field in this way, but we should do the same with the policemen. If a brother, who is a policeman, is willing to open his home for the gospel, he can invite his fellow police officers to his home and preach the gospel to them. We do not have to go to the police station to preach the gospel. Similarly, there is no need to go to the courthouse to preach the gospel to those in the legal field. We first need to pray and ask the Lord to give us a brother who works as a judge and is burdened to invite his colleagues to his home for the gospel. In this way the door to the legal field will be opened. The most effective way is to encourage the working saints to open their homes and to invite their colleagues to hear the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Full-timers and Part-timers<br />
over the Age of Thirty<br />
Being Assigned to the Community Gospel</h2>
<p>There are many brothers and sisters who have consecrated themselves to be full time, and about two-fifths of them are over thirty years old. There are also saints who are over seventy and are retired, and their children are either overseas or married with their own families. The best bargain for these older saints is for them to consecrate themselves to serve the Lord full time. There are still other saints who are willing to serve the Lord part time. We decided that all the full-timers and part-timers who are over thirty years old will be assigned to the community gospel. This is about two hundred serving ones. However, not all of them will go to the homes of the working saints.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching the Gospel in Apartment Buildings</h2>
<p>Here are some suggestions for preaching the gospel in apartment buildings. There may be an older sister who lives in an apartment building and is burdened to serve full time. She should first care for the people living in her building. She should not advertise what she is doing, because this will close people. She can discreetly find out who lives in each apartment, their occupation, whether they are young or old, and their schedules. She should be clear concerning these matters.</p>
<p>Then once a week she can distribute gospel tracts to every home, giving a different tract each week. This is the principle. In the beginning, we should not knock on our neighbors&rsquo; doors but rather place a tract in their mailboxes. One of our neighbors might be an older lady who stays at home to look after children. After two or three weeks of distributing tracts, we can find a morning suitable to knock on her door and visit her. When the older lady opens the door, we can gracefully and politely inquire if she has seen the tracts that were in her mailbox. We should be as bold and thick-skinned as a salesman but also polite and keen. After talking with her for a while, we can ask to enter into the home and chat with her. We can use this simple method in every apartment building in Taiwan. After we cover the building we live in, we can go on to the next building. If we would continue in this way for one or two years, all the people in the apartment buildings will know that we love Jesus. They will like us as their neighbor, and they will welcome us if we visit them again. Most of the older sisters can consecrate their time to preach the gospel in this way if they are retired and do not have grandchildren to care for.</p>
<p>This is not impossible. If three thousand can take this way, it will reap a significant result. The way for increase is through the gospel in the community, and the gospel in schools and homes, and the children&rsquo;s work. Most Christian groups that are successful in the gospel take this way, and this way is most suitable for older sisters. Today everyone is afraid of being robbed, but old ladies do not look like robbers, nor do they act like robbers. They are harmless and do not arouse fear in people. If the older sisters are willing to take this way, their neighbors will know the gospel after six months to one year. Not only so, if some other brothers and sisters, who live in the same area as an older sister does, also practice this, the gospel will be spread in a short while.</p>
<p>The older sisters can also participate in distributing tracts, booklets, Bibles, audiotapes, and videotapes. These can be distributed gradually over time. Our main burden is for the leading ones to encourage the working saints to open their homes and invite their fellow workers to hear the gospel. At the same time, the leading ones should teach the saints how to preach the gospel. Furthermore, the full-timers and part-timers over thirty years of age should participate in the community gospel by visiting families and distributing gospel tracts.</p>
<p>We need to encourage all the working saints to open their homes. This includes not only those working in the medical field, in education, in commerce, on the police force, and in the legal field but also those in politics. There are some saints who hold high positions in the government. We need to pray and ask the Lord to touch these saints to also open their homes and invite their colleagues to hear the gospel. We should also encourage the saints who are school principals to open their homes and invite people in the educational field, such as other principals or well-known people in the academic fields, to hear the gospel. For the community gospel all the saints scattered in various occupations should open their homes and invite their colleagues to hear the gospel. This approach is very profitable. If the church in Taipei is able to break through in this matter, it will cause the rest of the island to rise up.</p><h2 class="head1">FULL-TIMERS AND PART-TIMERS BEING<br />
THE FIRST TO OPEN THEIR HOMES</h2>
<p>All the full-timers and part-timers over thirty years old should take the lead to open their homes. Since you serve full time, this is your occupation. This can be compared to owning a store; you cannot work only once a week. To &ldquo;open your store&rdquo; is to preach the gospel. If the church assigns the older sisters who are full time to preach the gospel, they should first pray for people, then go and distribute tracts to their homes, and then visit them. In addition, they should open their own homes to preach the gospel to their neighbors. At least four days a week we should work in our store.</p>
<p>We should not consider whether there are enough people for us to invite. Those who begin a business are always full of confidence. Brother Nee once told me that in order to open a store, one must have perseverance and patience. If we can patiently persevere for three years, our store will succeed. Therefore, we encourage all the full-timers and part-timers to open their stores and sell Jesus. Our merchandise is Christ. We are &ldquo;Christ stores,&rdquo; and we specialize in selling Christ. We should never say that we opened our store and no one came and that we should therefore close the store. If something is being sold, there will be someone who is willing to buy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DOING OUR BEST TO INVITE PEOPLE</h2>
<p>With regard to inviting people to our homes, we should invite whoever is available. In Luke 14:23 the Lord told us to go into the roads and hedges and compel people to come so that His house may be filled. This means that we need to go to every street and alley to compel people to come. In America compelling is the method of a salesman. He does not force you to buy his product. He continues to talk until you can do nothing but buy the least expensive product so as to send him away. If a salesman is willing to do this for the sake of money, how about us who love the Lord? Should we not be even more willing to compel others for the sake of the gospel? We should find ways to compel the people whom we invite until they have no alternative but to agree with the gospel. However, we should not make them angry. If we can all testify strongly for the Lord, we can bear much fruit. In one year we will lead more than one person to salvation. If we labor and endeavor in this way, we will lead several people to salvation in a year.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THOSE WHOM WE LEAD TO SALVATION<br />
BEING OUR JOY AND OUR CROWN</h2>
<p>The brothers and sisters should realize that we are in the noblest occupation. We are giving the Lord of heaven and earth to people; we are bringing them salvation and grace, as well as life and light. Initially, people may feel that we are bothersome, but after they believe into the Lord, they will appreciate us. Not only so, we should believe in the Lord&rsquo;s word, which says that all those whom we lead to salvation will be our crown (Phil. 4:1; 1 Thes. 2:19). In that day when the righteous receive a reward, many people will welcome them into the kingdom in joy (Luke 16:9; cf. 14:13-14). However, if we never lead even one person to salvation, when the Lord comes back, no one will greet us, but others will have a group of believers, saying, &ldquo;We were led to salvation by this one.&rdquo; How shameful that will be!</p>
<p>Some may say that it is blessed to have children, but those who have children know that our children often provoke us to anger. In Chinese the phrase <em>fu-chi</em> (blessed) is composed of two words: <em>fu</em> (blessing) and <em>chi</em> (anger). If we lead people to salvation, these spiritual children give us only <em>fu</em> (blessing) and no <em>chi</em> (anger). Our children in the flesh give us both blessing and anger, but our spiritual children give us only blessing, not anger. I rejoice that I have received the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to serve Him. Now on all five continents there are brothers and sisters who were saved because of me. They are truly my joy, and they do not provoke me to anger. If all the older brothers and sisters could preach the gospel full time after their retirement, they would save at least three to five people in one year. Is such a thought not enough to make all the older brothers and sisters happy?</p>
<p>I am very happy to see three generations of the same family in the church. When I was preaching the gospel in Taipei, there was a brother who was in his twenties. When I was preaching the gospel in America, I saw him with his son, daughter-in-law, and his grandson; three generations in the church life. Two years ago we had a big reunion in Anaheim. Many families of three generations attended the gathering. When I led them to salvation, they were still single, but now three generations are in the church. My heart was full of joy when I saw them, because they are blessed by the gospel I preached.</p>
<p>I have traveled to more than thirty countries ever since I began serving the Lord. In every place I saw Chinese people. One person said he was baptized in Chefoo, and another person said he was saved through a message I gave in Shanghai. The Bible says, &ldquo;He who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together&rdquo; (John 4:36). Paul also says, &ldquo;My brothers, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown&rdquo; (Phil. 4:1). Those whom we lead to salvation are our joy today, and when the Lord returns, they will be our crown. The children who are saved through us are more precious and valuable than the children of our flesh.</p>
<p>Therefore, I encourage all the saints to bear the responsibility of preaching the gospel. Even though you do not serve full time or part time, you should try your best to preach the gospel to your acquaintances and your fellow workers. We must all rise up to be active and preach the gospel in the community. This is the way that we can double our number every year. May we all call on the Lord and pray.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">CONCERNING THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK</h1>
<p>In the past, according to our concept of the church life, we did not focus on the children&rsquo;s work. However, with the development of human society and culture, there has been more social and educational emphasis put on children. If children&rsquo;s education is not developed, it will be difficult to have a healthy society. For this reason, more and more scholars and experts are beginning to pay attention to children.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BEGINNING OF THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>I entered the church life in 1932, and a church was raised up in my hometown in July of the same year. The following year there was the need for a children&rsquo;s meeting. We did not know anything and were simply groping around. At the time, our purpose in beginning a children&rsquo;s meeting was mainly to care for the saints who brought their children to the meeting. It was simply a child-care service. Later, I moved to Shanghai where the children&rsquo;s meeting was more developed. When we began the work in Taiwan, we also began the children&rsquo;s work because the number of children among us was increasing.</p>
<p>This is also the principle in America. The children&rsquo;s work there is more important than any other work. In America before a child turns twelve years of age, his family has quite an influence on his life. Families there manage children as if managing a machine. A child does whatever his parents say. I have been received by many American families and was never bothered by the children under twelve. For example, one family who offered me hospitality had their children take a nap at one-thirty in the afternoon or simply stay in their bedroom. The children were also sent to their bedrooms at six-thirty in the evening. The children could even jump in their rooms, but they were not allowed to shout. This allowed us to have dinner with the parents without any disturbance. Neither was there any interruption in our fellowship when we returned from the meeting. However, it was entirely different when I stayed with a Chinese family. At ten-thirty at night the children were still running around and very noisy. This often did not allow us to have good fellowship.</p>
<p>Since American society pays much attention to the children, when we began the work in America, we studied extensively the best way for children to participate in the meetings. According to the American custom, when parents go out, they never leave their children alone at home. Therefore, most American parents bring their children to the meeting, and the children even sit next to the parents. When the children squirm a little, the mother stops them. As a result, all the children sit quietly. However, this way of handling the children gives them an unpleasant feeling, and eventually they do not like to attend the meetings when they grow up.</p>
<p>Based on our study, we decided to watch the children for the saints. Children&rsquo;s meetings began with the intention of babysitting the children. Gradually, the matter of preparing teachers came in, and we compiled material. The work progressed like a snowball that grows bigger and bigger as it rolls down a hill. Sometimes the children&rsquo;s work needed more than fifty serving saints to prepare the material, teach the lessons, and care for the children. Many saints joined the children&rsquo;s service.</p>
<p>When I returned to Taipei in 1965, I saw that there were quite a number of children. According to the brothers, from 1966 to 1967 there were about four thousand children in the meetings. However, currently there are not more than five hundred children in the twenty halls in Taipei. This situation can be likened to the sun going down. For this reason, I often reminded the brothers to pay attention to the children&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>From our experience we feel that the children&rsquo;s work is very important. The children&rsquo;s work should not simply be babysitting in order for the saints to come to the meetings. Due to their circumstances, the saints need to bring their children to the meeting, and there is the need to take care of the children for the saints. However, the children&rsquo;s work has another function, that is, to cultivate and nurture our next generation. This is worthy of our careful consideration and examination.</p>
<p>Today several young brothers are elders in various halls. In 1949 when we began the work in Taiwan, the parents of these brothers were not married. They were brought together by us. Thirty years later, their children have grown and are serving in the church, bearing important responsibilities. Similarly, last November I was in the Philippines and was greatly surprised, because a new generation of serving ones has replaced the older generation; a younger generation has been raised up. The co-workers, elders, and my translators were young brothers who were born after 1950. This situation shows that the children&rsquo;s work is very important.</p><h2 class="head2">The Children Becoming the Gospel Seeds<br />
in Their Schools</h2>
<p>God ordained that man be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earth (Gen. 1:28). Thus, man has multiplied, but how do we raise our children? Many years ago we did not know that children could be a great potential for the gospel. We stressed preaching the gospel but neglected the fact that children could also be the fruit of the gospel. When we realized that children could also be considered fruit of the gospel, I fellowshipped with the brothers, asking them to work with the goal of having ten thousand children in Taipei. If we had carried this out at that time and contacted ten thousand children, a majority of them would be older brothers and sisters today. We cannot guarantee that every child would have been saved, but at least eighty percent of the children would have been saved. This would equal eight thousand children. In addition, the ten thousand children was not a fixed number. Every year new children would have been added to us.</p>
<p>When children are saved, they become our young brothers and sisters. After they graduate from primary school, they become seeds of the gospel in junior high school. When we work in the schools, they become our inside helpers and bring their classmates to us. In this way, it is easier to work in the junior high schools. It is difficult to bring the gospel to a school where there are no saints who are teachers or students. However, young brothers and sisters in a junior high school can be likened to little seeds; they are waiting to sprout by responding to our call and bringing their classmates to salvation. When they enter into high school, they again become seeds of the gospel. During their three years of high school, we could bring three times as many people to salvation. When these young saints finish high school and enter college, they are seeds of the gospel in their college. In this way the number of people saved is continually multiplied. This is truly a great thing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Receiving Spiritual Cultivation in the Church</h2>
<p>Suppose these children begin to be cultivated in the children&rsquo;s meetings at the age of six and are saved. They will continue to be cultivated through three years of junior high school, three years of high school, and four years of college. In all, they will receive a total of sixteen years of spiritual education and cultivation. While they will receive sixteen years of secular education, they will also receive sixteen years of spiritual cultivation in the church. How valuable this is!</p>
<p>After graduating from college, this group of young brothers and sisters should not hurry to look for a job. Instead, they should stay in the church and receive two years of full-time training. During the training, they will spend half their time learning the truth and pursuing the growth of life and the other half of their time learning to serve in coordination in the church. After two years they will know whether the Lord is leading them to serve full time for the rest of their lives. It may be that one-tenth of them will continue and serve full time, and the rest will get a job. No matter what they do, these saints will have received sixteen years of spiritual education together with two years of full-time training. When they enter society, they will be different from other people. Such a cultivation is valuable. It is not only a great help to the Lord&rsquo;s work but also beneficial to society, people, and the country.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Families Being Brought In through the Children</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the children&rsquo;s work has an additional function, which is to gain the families of the children. Children like to make friends. It is particularly easy for children between the ages of six and twelve to make friends, and they listen to their friends. It is therefore easy for a child to lead another child. When the children sing hymns together, the gospel is operating and spreads from one child to another child. Our purpose, however, is not focused only on the children, but even more, through the children, we want to reach their parents and siblings.</p>
<p>The first thing that the Western missionaries who preached the gospel in China did was to establish schools. Since the people were ignorant and illiterate, the Western missionaries had to educate them before the gospel could be preached widely. There was no school system established in China, and many towns and villages still had the traditional private tutoring. Many people did not like to hear the gospel, but because they wanted their children to be educated, they sent their children to Christian schools. The Chinese have a saying: &ldquo;He who is near vermilion becomes red, and he who is near ink becomes black.&rdquo; It was impossible for the children who studied in the Christian schools not to hear the gospel, because the schools stipulated that everyone participate in the service on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. On the surface this did not seem to have any effect, but no one can say for certain that there was no effect. Everything depends on the Lord&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<p>A brother once testified that he believed into Jesus because a person who did not believe in Jesus said, &ldquo;It is very good to believe in Jesus.&rdquo; This proves that our Lord is real and living. As long as God&rsquo;s name is mentioned and His gospel is preached, someone will be saved. Hence, we should not despise what the Western missionaries did in China. Although not many were saved through the schools, some were saved. It is likely that some did not get saved while they were in school, but after leaving school, they recalled the gospel that they heard while they were in school and were saved. The Western missionaries put much effort into establishing schools not only to educate people but ultimately to preach the gospel to them. Our children&rsquo;s meetings should have the same function; they should gain many unbelieving families.</p>
<p>The Catholic approach is very effective. A Catholic must obtain the approval of a priest to marry a non-Catholic. The priest then gives his approval with the condition that the couple gives their children to the Catholic Church. Hence, before the children are even born, they are members of the Catholic Church. This method is effective. Sometimes we do not care about people. We think that one or two persons do not make a difference. However, there is the saying that many buckets of water make a river. We should know this principle. If we do not care about any drop of water, eventually, no river will be formed. Therefore, we should care for the children. Then as the children grow, they will learn to lead others to salvation, and they will become seeds of the gospel. From this we can see the importance of the children&rsquo;s work. The children&rsquo;s work is greatly related to the growth of the church. May we not take this matter lightly.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK HAVING MANY ASPECTS</h2>
<p>There is not a definite way to take care of the children&rsquo;s work. There should not be only one aspect to the children&rsquo;s work. There should be many locations for the children&rsquo;s work, meetings can be held at different times, and we can use different methods to conduct the children&rsquo;s meetings. There should also be many goals. The teaching material should also cover many aspects.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Many Locations</h2>
<p>Having a children&rsquo;s meeting only in the meeting hall will be a great hindrance to its further development. The children may not all be able to travel to the meeting hall, and the meeting hall may not have sufficient space for the meeting. In the church in Anaheim there are more than ten rooms for children&rsquo;s meetings, but the space is still not enough. Furthermore, the rooms are used only for a few hours every week and have no other use. This is not cost efficient. Even if we have many rooms, it will not be easy for all the children to come to the meeting hall for a scheduled meeting. Their meetings must have many locations.</p>
<p>According to our study, the most effective way is similar to the way we propagate the gospel. Every saint should open his home and have a children&rsquo;s meeting in his home. If a home has no children, then it is up to the individual saint to decide whether he would open his home. Nevertheless, it is best to have the burden to open one&rsquo;s home for the children. Most of the older sisters are burdened for the children. If their children are abroad or married and their circumstances allow them, they should open their home for a children&rsquo;s meeting. They can invite five or six children from the neighborhood to have a children&rsquo;s meeting. They do not have to worry about how to have the meeting, because the church will prepare material for them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Material</h2>
<p>We have considered using videotaped material, which some localities use. In Texas some of the children&rsquo;s meetings watch videotapes prepared for the children. We want to produce a video that shows children from various countries wearing their traditional dress and singing the hymns. There would be Japanese children wearing the kimono, Korean children wearing the hanbok, Chinese children wearing Chinese quilted jackets, and Indonesian children wearing the sarong. The children would enjoy watching such a video. After watching the video, we can help the children identify the different nationalities and then say something concerning God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Many Purposes</h2>
<p>We can open our homes once or twice a week, even on Saturday afternoons and during vacation time, to invite children to our homes to have a children&rsquo;s meeting. We can also contact the children&rsquo;s parents and preach the gospel to them and to their relatives. This is the principle of our gospel work. The more people we contact, the better. In this way, over a period of time there will spontaneously be an effect. We believe that out of every ten children we care for, three or four will be saved. They might not get saved at this time, but at a later time in their life they will remember something and return to the church. It will be easier for these ones to be saved.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Many Ways</h2>
<p>The households with children can take the initiative to open their homes and ask their children to invite other children in the neighborhood. The children can watch the children&rsquo;s videotapes, sing children&rsquo;s songs, or listen to a story. This is the way to have a children&rsquo;s meeting once a week.</p>
<p>We have about five hundred fifty children among us. The children between the ages of six and twelve come from roughly four hundred families. If each of the four hundred families opened their home for a children&rsquo;s meeting with ten children, there would be four thousand children meeting in four hundred homes. If we include the homes of the saints who do not have children but are willing to open their homes, it will be easy to reach a total of ten thousand children. This is one of the many ways we can use to preach the gospel. This is also the way to gain something long-term. We hope that the whole church will hear this fellowship and take action.</p>
<p>The meeting hall also has its use, but that might mainly be to babysit children. We will not be able to separate the children into smaller groups, because of a lack of rooms and teachers. When the saints come to a meeting, their children can watch a videotape, sing, and be spiritually cultivated.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Different Meeting Times</h2>
<p>Furthermore, it is best to have different meeting times for the children&rsquo;s meetings. The schedule should be flexible. The meetings do not have to be on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Saturday afternoon is also a good time. We need to utilize the time when the children are out of school to have children&rsquo;s meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CRUCIAL MATTERS</h2>
<p>The way to carry out the children&rsquo;s work depends on the brothers taking the lead in the children&rsquo;s work. They should determine how to contact the opened homes and how to lead the saints to receive a burden and be faithful. If every home can open to invite children, we will have enough meeting places and manpower. Furthermore, if some saints are designated to prepare teaching material, the saints will not need to labor that much. We can give only some principles related to the children&rsquo;s work. It is up to the saints to carry them out. We also need the elders to promote this matter. If we are diligent, we will gain many people year after year. The children&rsquo;s work will become one source of increase. It is worthwhile for the elders to promote the children&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>We should not make any special arrangements to get teachers for the children&rsquo;s meetings in the meeting halls. Rather, we should find a number of younger brothers and sisters who meet regularly to be the teachers. Children of various ages can be gathered into one room, and two or three younger saints can tell them stories, sing songs with them, or let them watch a video. This kind of service does not require much manpower. The saints who are between the ages of twenty and thirty can take care of the children. In order to reach the goal of having a large number of children, we need to mobilize the entire church. All the saints need to function for this to prosper.</p>
<p>We need to prepare material for the children&rsquo;s meeting. We should not have children&rsquo;s meetings without preparation. The brothers taking the lead in the children&rsquo;s work need to write and compile material. They need much prayer and fellowship to know the content and write lesson plans. We need to prepare material, but the saints can decide the best way to use it. The meetings should not be monotonous; they can be conducted in many ways.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING THE PRAYER AND<br />
COORDINATION OF THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>The children&rsquo;s meetings should be in many locations, at different times, and use different methods. Moreover, the teachers must have a goal. We should be open. We are taking this way to nourish our children and gain many more children so that the gospel can be preached to their unbelieving families. There are many benefits. We hope that all the saints will pray concerning this matter and not take it lightly. We especially hope that the older sisters can open their homes and gather some children to have children&rsquo;s meetings once a week. It should not be too difficult. There will be results. This requires everyone&rsquo;s cooperation.</p>
<p>The saints who serve either full time or part time and are under thirty years old should not excuse themselves from teaching in the children&rsquo;s meeting. As long as there is no conflict in their schedule, they have an obligation to serve as teachers. This is in addition to their gospel work in the schools. The serving saints who are over thirty years of age need to strengthen the small groups. There are saints who are assigned to work with the small groups, but also everyone should participate and become pillars in the small groups to strengthen the meetings.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE GOAL OF<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S PRESENT LEADING&mdash;<br />
THE INCREASE AND SPREAD OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we thank You from the depth of our being. These days are for Your move. Have mercy on us and grant us the grace that we may be able to match You in Your move. Give us a genuine burden and much prayer so that we may cooperate with Your move. Lord, by Your grace we are willing to consecrate ourselves afresh to You, as a living sacrifice, a burnt offering, to satisfy Your heart&rsquo;s desire. We would like to pave the way for You to advance and expand Your kingdom.</p>
<p>Lord, speak in our midst, operate among us, and even more, walk in our midst. Touch each of us in our inward being so that we would be willing to let You have the first place, to exalt You, and to let You possess us completely so that we can be a people on the earth who glorify You and live in Your glory. Lord, give us the utterance to release Your word and to speak forth Your heart&rsquo;s desire. We pray that by Your Spirit of grace You would transmit Your will, heart, thoughts, and even feeling into each of us so that we would have the same heart and the same mind and that we would testify that we have been joined to You as one spirit. In this one spirit we move and act. In this one spirit we meet and are being built together to serve in coordination.</p>
<p>By Your victorious name we crush the enemy under our feet. The church is victorious. The church is seated together with the Head on the throne. The church has the authority. Lord, rebuke Your enemy. You are the One who goes forth conquering and to conquer. Lead Your church forward in victory to propagate Your work and to cause Your recovery to spread over the entire island of Taiwan until the whole island is gospelized, truthized, and even churchized. Lord, cover us. We look to You, we lean on You, and we hide in Your shadow. Teach us to be hidden in You and to be one spirit with You. Lord, we are one with You. Glorify Your own name. Amen.</p>
<p>Under the Lord&rsquo;s leading, we will fellowship concerning increasing and spreading. We would like to see how a church as large as the church in Taipei should increase and spread. We need to rely on the Lord&rsquo;s grace while we take care of the following matters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ESTABLISHING SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>The first matter is to establish small groups. This might not seem important, but it is a basic matter. The foundation of a church lies in its small groups. Whether we can keep those whom we lead to salvation depends on the small groups. We thank the Lord that we have already begun the small groups, but in order to maintain them, there are still several needs to be met. We need to study how the small groups can move forward and gain an increase. We also need to study the way to lead the saints to enter into the truth, to develop their functions, to shepherd others, and to restore the saints who have not been meeting. In addition, we should encourage all the saints to open their homes to preach the gospel to their &ldquo;Jerusalem,&rdquo; that is, their relatives, friends, and neighbors. Then they should spread outward.</p>
<p>The Lord desires us to be His witnesses, beginning from Jerusalem, then through all Judea and Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth (Acts 1:8). Our Jerusalem is our relatives, friends, and neighbors. We all should have a good number of relatives, friends, and neighbors who are not yet saved. Some of them may have only heard of the name of Jesus. The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;I am debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish&rdquo; (Rom. 1:14). We should have the feeling that we are indebted to our relatives, friends, and neighbors for the gospel.</p>
<p>In Acts 10 Cornelius received instruction from a holy angel to invite Peter to his home (v. 22). Cornelius sent his servants to Joppa to find Peter, and Cornelius also invited his relatives and intimate friends to his home (v. 24). Peter did not need to call a gathering when he arrived. This is a good pattern of preaching the gospel in the home. We hope that every saint&rsquo;s home can become a house of Cornelius. However, this depends on the small groups.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECONSIDERING ADMINISTRATING<br />
AND PROMOTING THE WORK IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We have spent much time to reconsider the way to administrate and promote the work in the church in Taipei. There are only ten elders in Taipei who are responsible for administration, shepherding, and leading the twenty-one meeting halls. This is a huge and difficult task. In the twenty-one meeting halls there are six to seven thousand saints who regularly attend the meetings, but there are twenty thousand saints on the list. In a church with six thousand saints who have a heart to love and pursue the Lord and who meet, serve, and worship the Lord in twenty-one meeting halls, ten elders are not sufficient to administrate and promote the work in a thorough way. This is a heavy burden.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we must keep the principle in the Bible. No matter how many saints there are in a church, it is still one church; it cannot be divided into several churches. The first church raised up in the New Testament was the church in Jerusalem. On the day of Pentecost three thousand were saved in Jerusalem (2:41), and a few days later five thousand were saved, not including women (4:4). Without a doubt the number in the church in Jerusalem exceeded ten thousand within a short period of time (5:14). These ten thousand met &ldquo;from house to house&rdquo; (2:46; 5:42), but there were not many churches in Jerusalem. Therefore, when the church in Jerusalem is mentioned in Acts 8:1, the word church is singular. It was one church, not many churches. Even though there were many saints meeting in many houses, the believers did not have the flavor of division or separation. They were one church.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Separate but Administrating Together</h2>
<p>If the twenty-one meeting halls in the church in Taipei were separate from one another, it would not be difficult to administrate and promote the work. However, according to the Bible, even though there are six to seven thousand saints meeting and serving in Taipei, there is only one church. Hence, it is not easy to administrate the church. To administrate each hall separately suggests separation, but to administrate the church centrally without separating the halls makes it difficult to thoroughly care for every area. Therefore, after spending much time before the Lord in consideration, we feel that the Lord has given us a way. Apparently the twenty-one meeting halls are separate in their service and leading, but in principle they are one.</p>
<p>We can use the United States of America as an example. There are fifty states in America. These states are united to establish a federal government. Under the federal government there are state governments. Each state has power to legislate according to the situation and circumstance of that state. However, all legislations need to be under the restriction of the American Constitution. No legislation can override the constitution; otherwise, it contradicts and violates the constitution of the country. A state&rsquo;s violating the constitution is equivalent to the state declaring independence and creating not only two jurisdictions but also two countries. Therefore, every state in America has the right to legislate, but their legislation is restricted by the federal constitution.</p>
<p>When we began the work in Taipei in 1949, we were blessed in our preaching of the gospel and many were saved. Since there was only one meeting hall, which is presently hall one, the problem of being separate but one, or of being one but separate, did not exist. Our preaching of the gospel and our baptizing of people were all conducted in the same place. However, the church has since increased from several hundred to ten thousand. At one time there were even twenty-four thousand in the church. We therefore formed district halls. In every meeting hall there was a service of baptism, but the time of baptism was determined in the elders&rsquo; meeting. This was not very expedient because the elders had to consider the situation of all the meeting halls before a time for baptism could be set. As a result, some saints waited for a long time before being baptized. This shows that it was not very practical to centrally administrate the matter of baptism for all the halls. As a result, we have made some changes. From now on when a meeting hall preaches the gospel and leads people to salvation, it can baptize them without asking for a decision from the elders&rsquo; meeting. However, after the baptism the meeting hall must give the baptismal information to the business office for their records.</p>
<p>This kind of administration is not a separation. For two thousand years, Christians have debated whether baptism should be by sprinkling or by immersion. In the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we accepted the truth of baptism by immersion; this is the light we saw from the Bible. Consequently, it would be wrong for a meeting hall to say, &ldquo;It is not convenient for us to baptize people by immersion, because we do not have a baptismal tub. We will now baptize people by sprinkling.&rdquo; Such a decision would violate the constitution and would result in a division in the church. There would be a baptism-by-immersion church and a baptism-by-sprinkling church. This is wrong. Each meeting hall can decide when and where to baptize people, but it has no ground to change the truth concerning baptism by immersion.</p>
<p>This example shows that in some matters we can separate administrative practices for the sake of convenience and effectiveness, but we cannot separate ourselves in the truth. This keeps the oneness. It is not necessary to require that all twenty-one districts be uniform in every administrative detail, because of differences due to geography, environment, and time. If we demand uniformity in all things, we will take care of one aspect and miss the other. This will frustrate the administration and promotion of the work. Therefore, for the sake of administrating and promoting the work, we can be separate while administrating as one.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Every Meeting Hall Having Elders</h2>
<p>In the way of our practice, every district will have two or three elders. After careful consideration and thorough fellowship and prayer, we decided to select forty-six elders from among the leading brothers and place them in the twenty-one meeting halls. Most of the current elders are older; the youngest one is fifty-five years old. When a person becomes sixty-five years of age, he feels a lack in his physical abilities. It may be possible for older brothers to take the lead in a smaller church with seventy to eighty saints, but in a church as large as Taipei, which has twenty-one meeting halls and many saints in each meeting hall, the older brothers are bound to feel a lack in their physical ability even though they have insight and experience.</p>
<p>The elders appointed to be responsible for administration and promoting the work in the twenty-one meeting halls must be between the ages of thirty and fifty. They will promote and carry out the work and bring others with them into the work. They must be able to consider things and to come up with ideas. Even if a big mountain is blocking the way, they must be able to cut a hole through the mountain. These new elders must have such a spirit in order for the church to have a breakthrough and to propagate.</p>
<p>It is good for a church to have a large number of saints. However, in terms of promoting the work, it is very difficult to mobilize a large group of saints. Sometimes a large number of saints can be a hindrance. There is no need to administrate a locality with only seven or eight saints. The churches in various places can confirm this fact: when the number in a church reaches one hundred saints, the increase slows down. Much effort is required to increase from one hundred saints to one hundred twenty, and it is even more difficult to reach two hundred saints. This can be compared to the difference between pushing a bicycle uphill and pushing a car uphill. It is much easier to push a bicycle.</p>
<p>Today the church in Taipei is a large church, and it is not easy to move the church. The number of saints in the meetings has not changed much. For the past twenty-eight years, there has not been a significant change in the number of saints in the meetings because this car is too big to be pushed. Therefore, we are determined to have a breakthrough. We would like to include some younger saints to promote the work in every meeting hall. We are determined to push this car. When we are able to push this car, we will say Hallelujah!</p><h2 class="head2">Current Elders and New Elders<br />
Having Their Function</h2>
<p>Since we are taking the way of separating the halls and yet administrating together, there is the need to pay attention to the separate aspect and to the together aspect. The coming together of the elders takes care of the together aspect. There are many affairs that need to be taken care of, such as purchasing land and building a meeting hall for the spread. These matters are not related to the separate aspect; they are matters for the whole church. The six current elders, who are older, should bear the responsibility of matters concerning the whole church, whereas the newly appointed elders, who are between thirty and fifty years of age, should concentrate on mobilizing the twenty-one meeting halls. Therefore, we feel that it is best for the new elders to be under fifty years old. They are still full of energy and have some experience. This will enable them to promote the work in the meeting halls.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Full-time Co-workers<br />
Concentrating on Spiritual Work</h2>
<p>Furthermore, there are ten full-time co-workers in Taipei. Most of them have become stewards in a district, taking care of local administrative work. Few of them concentrate on promoting the spiritual side of the Lord&rsquo;s work. The spiritual side of the work includes preaching the gospel, speaking for God, and teaching the truth. When the co-workers are sent out, they are the apostles. Ephesians 4:11 says, &ldquo;He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers.&rdquo; When the evangelists, teachers, and prophets are sent out, they become apostles. Paul and Barnabas were prophets and teachers in Antioch; they were not apostles. However, according to the record in Acts, when they were sent out, they were called apostles. Today the full-time brothers among us rarely preach the gospel or serve as teachers, nor do they go out as apostles. Most of them are entangled in the administration and service of the local church. This practice is not according to the truth of the Bible or the principle of the Body.</p>
<p>According to the truth, the administration and affairs of a locality should be borne entirely by the local brothers. The full-time brothers have put aside their jobs and consecrated their future to the Lord, not for local administration or local affairs but for the preaching of the gospel, the spread of God&rsquo;s word, and the producing and establishing of the churches in every place. However, instead of doing these things, our co-workers have been busy with the affairs of the church in Taipei and have thus replaced the local brothers. There are many brothers and sisters in Taipei who have a heart for the Lord and are useful, but they have not been put to use. This situation is inappropriate. Our principle is that all the full-time co-workers should be set apart from the local administration and local affairs of a church so that they can concentrate on the spiritual side of the work.</p>
<p>We want to keep these two principles: new elders in the meeting halls should not be over sixty years old, and the co-workers should concentrate on the spiritual side of the work. According to these two principles, none of the newly appointed elders in the twenty-one meeting halls should be over sixty years of age, and the full-time co-workers should not be elders. However, after careful consideration and arrangement, several meeting halls still need a few brothers who are over sixty and a couple of co-workers to remain and labor for a period of time, because we have not found suitable replacements. We hope to find replacements in a few months to correct this situation.</p>
<p>With regard to the length of an elder&rsquo;s term, we need to remember that the appointment of elders is entirely according to the Bible. After many years of practice and study, we can say that even though appointing the elders is in the Bible, there is not a clear statement concerning how long an elder should serve. Our practice in the past has been that once an elder was appointed, the appointment was for life. We did not know how to deal with elders who were not suitable when it became apparent over time. It is a good sign when brothers are willing to serve the Lord for life, but it is not good for such a situation to be without limitation.</p>
<p>Suppose an elder is old, physically weak, and his memory is lagging, but he insists on remaining an elder. Because of him, the elders&rsquo; meeting cannot make any decisions without repeated fellowship. This situation causes everyone to feel helpless. Since we absolutely abide by the Bible, and the Bible says nothing concerning this, no one dares to do anything. We have indeed suffered from such situations over the past fifty years. After such brothers serve as elders for several years, it becomes apparent that they are not suitable to be elders, but it is difficult to ask them to step aside, because we fear that they might get hurt. These are some problems that we have experienced, and we hope that we all understand these situations.</p><h2 class="head2">Additional Conditions<br />
in the Appointment of Elders</h2>
<p>Since we have learned the lesson, there will be a number of conditions in our appointing of these elders. There are no rules concerning retirement, but there will nevertheless be several conditions. First, the appointment of elders at this time is temporary, not definite. I have been overseas for many years, and only the current elders know everyone well. Therefore, I cooperated with them to make these appointments. However, no one can do a thorough and adequate job in appointing forty-six brothers to be elders within only a few days. We can only make a temporary arrangement according to the urgent need. After a period of time we may need to make adjustments. In some places there may be a shortage of elders, in other places there may be too many elders, and in still other places the arrangement may not be appropriate. We will make adjustments according to the situation, and there will inevitably be some corrections when the adjustments are made.</p>
<p>Second, we hope that those appointed to the eldership would be at the height of their physical and mental strength; that is, they should be between thirty and fifty years old. This has a biblical basis. The Levites in the Old Testament entered into the tabernacle to assume their services at the age of twenty-five and continued serving until the age of fifty (Num. 8:24-25). They had many responsibilities that they would not have been able to fulfill after they were fifty years of age. Hence, the duties of the Levites fell on the shoulders of those who were between the ages of twenty-five and fifty. We will apply this principle to ourselves. The responsibility of the elders should fall on the shoulders of those who are between the ages of thirty and fifty. Unless a person is exceptionally strong physically and mentally, it is not so easy for him to function as an elder after the age of sixty-five. In all the countries around the world the retirement age is around sixty-five years. This principle is the issue of history and human experience. Since a person&rsquo;s physical energy decreases when he turns sixty-five, he should no longer assume certain responsibilities. Therefore, this will be a condition. This is not a rigid rule, but it is good to have such a principle.</p>
<p>Third, even though a brother might be able to bear the responsibility of an elder, his condition can change in three or five years. It is not necessary for him to remain in the eldership when he can no longer meet the need of the church. Suppose an elder who is not yet fifty years old becomes ill, and his illness is not serious enough to confine him to bed, but his physical strength is not enough for him to bear the responsibility in the church. In this situation it is not necessary for him to remain in the eldership. Otherwise, not only does he suffer harm by remaining in the eldership, but he may also hinder the work of the church. Under such a circumstance, he should not wait for the church to ask him to resign; he should take the initiative to resign. This is a proper situation.</p>
<p>Suppose the elder&rsquo;s situation has not changed, but his vision and experience enable him to take care of only a meeting hall or a church with one hundred saints. If, after a period of time, the number in the church increases to three or five hundred, this elder will be unable to bear the heavier burden. If he forces himself to remain in the eldership, he is limited in his service, and he will also hinder the work of the church. According to the practical need, he should step down and allow someone more able and qualified to be appointed. We need to know ourselves, and we need to know our situation. When the environment changes and we are unable to meet the need of the church, we should resign and let others bear the responsibility. We hope that these additional conditions will be explained in all the localities.</p>
<p>Fourth, in the New Testament there is only one portion that speaks of how a sinning elder should be punished. First Timothy 5:20 says, &ldquo;The ones who sin reprove before all.&rdquo; This should also be included as one of the additional conditions in the appointment of elders.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUPPLYING THE WORD,<br />
TEACHING, SHEPHERDING, AND VISITING</h2>
<p>The new elders should not only administrate but also promote the work. The saints who handle administration need to be experienced and have a vision, and those who promote need to have energy. For a church to be strong, not only should it establish small groups and have an adequate eldership; it should also be in the supply of the word, teaching, shepherding, and visiting. The supply of the word is related to teaching, teaching is related to shepherding, and shepherding and visiting are also related. Hence, for a church to be strong, it needs to pay attention to these four things: the supply of the word, teaching, shepherding, and visiting.</p>
<p>If there are one hundred saints in a church, twenty saints should be involved in shepherding and caring for others. This is related to the small groups. The saints who shepherd and visit must have some experience in life; they need a certain measure of life and some knowledge of the truth. A person who is experienced in life and knows the truth is able to teach. As he gains more experience in teaching, he can be a teacher and serve as an outlet for the word. This is the relationship between supplying the word, teaching, shepherding, and visiting. In learning to visit others, we must learn to speak, and what we speak needs to be according to life and truth. Hence, we must know the truth and progress in the truth. Gradually, we will be able to speak the truth in the meetings. If we progress further, we will be able not only to speak one message but also to release the Lord&rsquo;s word, which becomes the supply of the word. This is the line of supply and shepherding.</p>
<p>The function of a small group is to connect the members. The members in a group are connected and upheld. The function of an elder is to administrate and promote the work in the church. Ministering the word, shepherding, teaching, and visiting are to supply the saints. Through the supply of the Lord&rsquo;s word the saints are shepherded and receive care. One out of every five saints should be a source of supply of the word in the way of teaching. If twenty percent of the saints in a church with three thousand saints are able to supply the word, there will be six hundred saints who are responsible for supplying the word, shepherding, teaching, and visiting the saints.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, these functions are outside of the elders&rsquo; responsibilities. Some elders are gifted in the word, but because they are still burdened with a job or business and are not serving full time, they can only serve locally. Such saints are qualified to administrate and promote the work in one place. They can also share the burden to supply the word. Furthermore, it is fitting for the elders to teach and shepherd the saints. The Bible clearly says that the elders should shepherd the flock of God. First Peter 5:2-3 says, &ldquo;Shepherd the flock of God among you...[not] as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock.&rdquo; In addition, 1 Timothy 3:2 says that elders should be &ldquo;apt to teach.&rdquo; Therefore, an elder&rsquo;s function is also related to supplying the word, visiting, teaching, and caring.</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to the elders, in every church or meeting hall twenty saints should be charged to teach, shepherd, and visit. We have only recently begun practicing the small groups; therefore, whether you are an elder or a co-worker, an older saint or a younger one, you should go to lead a small group and strengthen it. As the small groups gradually become stronger, we can set aside twenty percent of our manpower to do the work of shepherding and teaching. If necessary, the twenty percent do not have to join the small group gathering. This is the way to divide the labor and cooperate with one another. The saints in the small groups should help the small groups, and those who are assigned to shepherd and teach should care for at least four or five other saints. This is a great responsibility. In this way six hundred saints will be able to care for three thousand saints. It will not be possible for a person to stop coming to the meeting or to become sick without others knowing about it. We must work in this way until one out of every five saints is a shepherd, who shepherds, teaches, visits, and cares for others. This requires much labor.</p>
<p>Thus far we have only temporary arrangements for the new elders. After three months we will make some adjustments, and in another three months we may make more adjustments. In about one and a half years, we should be on the right track. We have not yet considered who should be involved in the shepherding. We hope that the new elders will begin considering this matter. The new elders have been taking the lead in a meeting hall and understand the condition of the saints; they can begin to encourage the saints who are experienced in life and know the truth to bear the responsibility of shepherding, teaching, visiting, and caring.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING MISCELLANEOUS SERVICES</h2>
<p>There are also services in the church that are related to miscellaneous matters, such as guard duty, clerical work, accounting, maintenance, ushering, cleaning, electrical work, purchasing, transportation, baptism, and property management. In the past we wanted the saints who are more spiritual to take the lead in hospitality. Now these saints need to bear responsibility for shepherding and teaching. Other saints can be responsible for the miscellaneous services. These saints are deacons. Hall one needs only two deacons for ushering. These two responsible ones can ask fifty other saints to take turns serving as ushers. The other services should be done in the same manner. In this way everyone can function in a specific task.</p>
<p>We will also change the way in which the service meeting is conducted. In the past everyone attended the service meeting. The elders, co-workers, ushers, and piano players all attended, because the same group of saints took care of all the services. As a result, every service was delayed. This can be compared to the same group of people playing basketball, then playing soccer, and then playing for a music concert. Eventually, everyone is exhausted. In spite of all the fellowship, few things were accomplished. Therefore, there will be a service meeting for ushering, and only the saints responsible for ushering will attend. Likewise, the meetings for the various services will be attended by the saints serving in the respective services. Every saint has a particular service and does not need to come to the meeting hall for every meeting. The elders attend the elders&rsquo; meeting, and the ushers attend the ushers&rsquo; meeting. The service meetings can be held once a week or every other week. It is sufficient for a saint to take care of only his service. Hence, to ensure that a local church is functioning normally, small groups must be established, and the elders should mobilize the church, as well as shepherd and teach. These items must advance together and be strengthened. Then there will not be problems in the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING PROPAGATING THE COMMUNITY GOSPEL, THE GOSPEL IN THE SCHOOLS,<br />
AND THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>In order to propagate, we need to pay attention to three aspects of the gospel. The community gospel involves people in all walks of life, including the medical field, business, education, and the military. We have saints in every occupation, and they can preach the gospel to those in their field. The gospel in the schools includes junior high schools, high schools, and colleges. The children&rsquo;s work is also related to the gospel. We hope that in one year we will have a total of ten thousand children. We need the local saints to coordinate in these three aspects of the gospel, but even more so, we need the participation of the full-timers. Without the full-timers, the work cannot be done. Hence, all the full-time brothers need to participate in the coordination for the community gospel, the gospel in the schools, and the children&rsquo;s work. Some of them may also help with the messages on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. We should all coordinate wholeheartedly to perfect the saints.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SERVICE OF THE ELDERS AND DEACONS IN THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>In order for the service and the leading in the church in Taipei to have a new beginning, we want to have some fellowship and leading for the newly appointed elders and deacons.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>We will first fellowship concerning the Lord&rsquo;s move in the church in Taipei as well as on the island of Taiwan. We were led by the Lord to come here in 1949. That was thirty-six years ago. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we had a very good beginning. Even though we were hindered in some aspects of the work and have not completely followed the Lord&rsquo;s leading, the Lord has kept us so that His testimony has been maintained. When we began, our scope in the work was not large, but by the Lord&rsquo;s blessing we now have a rich heritage.</p>
<p>Under Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry we learned a lesson concerning the importance of the literature work. Therefore, I received a burden from the Lord for the past eleven years to preserve in printed form all the truth and light and knowledge of the Bible that we have received from the Lord so that these precious messages would not be lost.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Contact with Brother Nee</h2>
<p>Before 1950 I co-worked with Brother Nee for nearly twenty years. We had a very close relationship. Whatever he saw and what grace he received, he would fellowship with me in depth. I have not seen another brother who surpassed Brother Nee in knowing the Lord, spiritual matters, life, and the Bible. None can surpass Brother Nee, and there are none who are within reach of him. I received the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to recognize the treasure within our brother, and I received Brother Nee&rsquo;s leading from the depth of my being.</p>
<p>By his contact with me, he got to know me and was open to me and appreciative of me in the work. He also trained me and perfected me in every aspect.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Sent by Brother Nee to Taiwan</h2>
<p>Later I was sent to Taiwan to begin the work and continue the ministry of Brother Nee. Eleven years ago, when I was in America, I received a burden to put all the truths that the Lord has shown us into books. Brother Nee&rsquo;s knowledge of the truth was very deep and very broad. He once expressed the desire to write notes to the New Testament, but God never gave him the opportunity to do so. Brother Nee knew so much, but very little of what he knew was put in writing. He spoke many messages, but not many of his messages were put in print. What remains with us from our brother are the books that we have today, but they cannot compare to what he saw.</p>
<p>Based on this experience, beginning in 1974 I had a burden to hold bi-annual life-study trainings in America. During the past eleven years, I buried myself in the life-studies, ignoring other matters. Since beginning the life-study training, I returned to Taiwan in 1975, in 1977 for a conference, in 1979 on my way to the Philippines, in 1981 after visiting Hong Kong to speak on church history, and again last year. During these visits I was mostly just passing through.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Receiving the Burden to Return to Taiwan</h2>
<p>In 1979 I began to feel that the development of the church in Taipei had stopped. In 1984 I felt that there was a need for me to return, especially to Taipei, to mobilize the work for a new beginning. Last fall when I finished writing the Life-study for the last book in the New Testament&mdash;the book of Acts&mdash;I was clear inwardly that I should return to Taiwan. I received a fresh burden for the work in Taipei. This does not mean that I will completely drop the work in America.</p>
<p>From 1949, when I began the work in Taiwan, until I went to America was about thirteen years. During those years I spent four months every year in Southeast Asia and eight months in Taiwan. If the Lord allows it, I believe that for the next several years I will spend four to five months every year in Taiwan: two months in the first half of the year and another two months in the second half of the year. I would like to work together with the brothers to promote the Lord&rsquo;s testimony on this island. Please pray for my traveling between Taiwan and America, because my returning is not merely for a conference or for a visit but that I have received a fresh burden for Taiwan.</p>
<p>This burden differs from the burden of the work in 1949. At that time we did not have even one meeting hall on the island, and there were only a few hundred saints here. In addition, the island of Taiwan was backward. The streets were unpaved, and most of the residents wore wooden clogs. Today&rsquo;s situation is different. With respect to the church, there are already more than forty localities with close to ten thousand saints attending the meetings every week. In addition, the society, economy, and education in Taiwan have been blessed by the Lord such that Taiwan is suitable to propagate the gospel work of the Lord. In 1949 I was pushing a tricycle, but today we are pushing a train. The responsibility is heavy and great.</p><h2 class="head1">BEARING THE RESPONSIBILITY<br />
OF LEADING THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We hope that everyone will participate in this new beginning. Our leading in the past was to hold trainings, make arrangements, and fellowship. However, we now have many saints, especially with the church in Taipei. If I return merely to hold trainings, make arrangements, and fellowship, without being blended with you and moving forward together with you, there will be no result. Therefore, this time not only will I be involved in trainings, making arrangements, and having fellowship, but I will also participate in this endeavor.</p>
<p>Our current status requires a new arrangement. It may seem as though we are familiar with what we have fellowshipped, but the feeling within me is that every point is a new way. I will try my best to fellowship with you, and I hope that you will try your best to carry it out. If there are any problems or questions, even if I am in America, we can still communicate on the telephone. This will bring in better fellowship, leading, and arrangement.</p>
<p>I have placed myself in this endeavor and will &ldquo;drive this car&rdquo; with you and learn with you. The small groups concerning which we have fellowshipped involve a new way. The way to do the children&rsquo;s work is also new. We have many ways related to time, location, manpower, teaching material, and goal. We are not tied down to what we used to do. The campus work has been here for years, but we should be willing to change our way and make progress. Preaching the gospel in the community may be an old term, but we did not give it much emphasis. This time we are asking the working saints in every profession to open their homes and invite their colleagues to come and hear the gospel. This is also something new. Furthermore, the terms <em>visiting, shepherding,</em> and <em>teaching</em> may not be new, but we must admit that we have not carried them out thoroughly in the past. This is the reason that we are short in our ability to care for people.</p>
<p>We will spend much time fellowshipping concerning the way for the church to move forward so that we may find a new way. The church in Taipei just added almost fifty new elders. That was unprecedented. When a local church is large, meeting in twenty-one halls, it is not easy for the elders in the halls to take care of administrating and promoting the work. Therefore, I must place myself in this endeavor and help bear the burden together with the brothers. I am sitting behind the wheel with you, and we are &ldquo;driving this car,&rdquo; learning, and studying together. These items of our fellowship are new. Some of these items I myself have not even practiced before. Therefore, I am earnestly asking the Lord to keep me and give me a few years to be with you so that together we may bring all the churches in Taiwan to a new standard. This requires that we all participate. It also requires that all the brothers and sisters receive a burden to pray and coordinate.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TWO PILLARS OF TESTIMONY<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY&mdash;TRUTH AND LIFE</h2>
<p>The main burden of this message is to lead the elders and the deacons. It is also a fellowship about training. We need to see that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is His testimony. We also need to see that the testimony of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has two pillars: truth and life. The testimony of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery does not depend on so-called power; neither does it depend on so-called miracles or theological teachings. The testimony of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery depends on truth and life. Whether or not the Lord&rsquo;s testimony on the earth is strong and will be propagated largely depends on the extent to which the co-workers, the elders, and the deacons know the truth and grow in life. If the saints are strong in the truth and in life, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will progress, but if the saints are weak in truth and life, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has no future.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Progressing in Our Knowledge of the Truth</h2>
<p>Concerning the truth, we need to have light. Truth is not doctrine. It is revelation and vision. We need to know the truth. In order to know the truth, we must read and study the Bible. If our reading of the Bible is not thorough and our learning of the truth is shallow, we can be certain that we will not receive light. The light of the truth is according to our knowledge of the Bible and our spiritual learning. The elders and the deacons must make progress and endeavor to enter into knowing the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Holding the Mystery of the Faith<br />
in a Pure Conscience</h2>
<p>First Timothy 3:9 says that a deacon must hold &ldquo;the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.&rdquo; The faith in this verse refers to the entire content of the New Testament. The truth in the New Testament is our faith. In other words, the faith is the things we believe in. We believe in every truth in the New Testament, and we need to understand every truth in the New Testament. Believers in today&rsquo;s Christianity who are qualified to speak of the faith are rare, because their knowledge of the truth is superficial. The extent of their faith is that Jesus died for us so that we can believe in Him and go to heaven to be spared from perdition. Such a content of the faith is far below the standard of the mystery of the faith.</p>
<p>In the recovery there are many important items of the truth. There is the truth concerning the economy of God, Christ as life, living out Christ, living in the spirit, and being one spirit with the Lord in our mingled spirit. These items of the truth are nearly buried in Christianity, but they are what we have emphasized over the years. These basic items of the truth in the New Testament are the content of our faith. Paul says that deacons should hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience, not in the mind. Often times our mind is very clear, but our conscience condemns us. We need to hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</p><h2 class="head3">Living Christ Every Day</h2>
<p>Some elders and deacons among us are not able to speak about the mystery of the faith. If we do not know the mystery of the faith, how can we hold it? The mystery of the faith refers mainly to Christ as the mystery of God (Col. 2:2) and the church as the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4). Therefore, to hold the mystery of God in a pure conscience is to hold Christ, that is, to live Christ out every day. Before we were saved, we lived and acted recklessly; we lied and cheated. After we were saved, our conscience was enlightened, and we became sensitive toward these things. We could no longer cheat or lie; instead, we conducted ourselves properly.</p>
<p>Gradually, we saw that the mystery of God was Christ, not morality, ethics, honesty, faithfulness, righteousness, or holiness. We did not steal or lie, but neither did we live Christ from morning to evening every day. I am afraid that we only lived the life of a proper, moral, and ethical Chinese person; we did not live Christ. Thus, our conscience still condemned us. We were saved, we loved the Lord, and we stood in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, but our testimony was a testimony of morality instead of a testimony of Christ. Therefore, rather than confessing for losing our temper or lying, we need to say, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me for not living You today. People saw my morality, but they did not see You in me.&rdquo; Such an experience proves that we have seen not only the truth but also the mystery of the faith.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Living in the Body Every Day</h2>
<p>Holding the church as the mystery of Christ in a pure conscience includes not only living Christ every day but also living in the Body every day. We do not live Christ by ourselves; we live Christ in the church. Living Christ and also living in the Body of Christ causes the devil to fear. We are people who live in the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>While instructing the elders and the deacons, Paul tells the deacons to hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience (1 Tim. 3:9). This means that the deacons should live Christ in His Body. If we do not live Christ in His Body, our conscience will be bothered by the shining of the truth. Our conscience will condemn us. Although we might not have any wrongdoings, our life is not a life in the Body of Christ nor a life that lives out Christ. Our conscience, which has been enlightened, must be so pure that it wants nothing other than Christ and the church. Then our conscience will not condemn us, and we will have a pure conscience to hold the mystery of the faith. People in the world may know that we believe in Jesus, but they do not know the mystery of our faith in Jesus. The mystery of our faith in Jesus is to live Christ and to live Christ in the Body of Christ. This is a great matter.</p>
<p>The testimony of the church depends upon whether the serving ones&mdash;the elders and deacons&mdash;know the truth. They not only need to know the truth, but they need to keep the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. If all the elders and deacons do this, the church will be strong and rich, and it will be able to spread.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Life Being to Live the Life of Christ in the Body</h2>
<p>In addition to the truth, there is also life. Truth and life cannot be separated. Life is to live the life of Christ in the Body. If you ask me why I have my hair styled in this way, I would say that it is based on my living of Christ. Because I live Christ, my conscience determines how long or how short my hair should be. Similarly, if the elders and the deacons know the truth and live Christ in the Body, that church will be strong and rich.</p>
<p>The first matter that we need is to hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience, that is, to live Christ in the Body of Christ. This is the highest standard of morality, and it is much higher than the standard of morality in society. If we would be in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must live Christ in the Body. This is more than the four ethical standards in Chinese culture: being faithful, filial, kind, and righteous. It is to live the living Christ in the Body of Christ. Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; Philippians 1:21 says, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ.&rdquo; This is not a matter of being kind or loving. This transcends human kindness and love, because Christ transcends human kindness and love. Christianity has lost this, and the Lord is recovering this today.</p>
<p>The elders, deacons, and co-workers need a clear understanding of this. Many young full-timers grow and make progress because of their growth in the truth and in life. I encourage you to read the Bible diligently so that you can see the truth, be enlightened, and have a living that expresses Christ in the Body of Christ. This is life, and the foundation of life is the truth. Thus, truth and life cannot be separated, and they issue in one testimony&mdash;the church life.</p><h2 class="head1">REASONS FOR THE PRACTICE<br />
OF THE CHURCH LIFE BEING LIMITED</h2>
<p>Now we would like to fellowship concerning our practice. In order to lead the church and give accurate direction, we must have sufficient knowledge of the Bible. We must know the Bible not merely in theory but more so in practice. To this end I have returned to the Bible many times, and especially the New Testament, to consider the matter of levels in the church.</p>
<p>I have been overseas for more than twenty years. Approximately one hundred churches in America and Canada have been raised up since I went there. There are also approximately one hundred churches in South and Central America that have been raised up by this ministry. These churches and the more than one hundred churches in Europe, New Zealand, Australia, and Africa have all been raised up recently. All these churches are in my heart, and I have been observing and considering their situation. In addition, there are three hundred churches in the Far East. Altogether there are six hundred churches. In all the churches everyone wants to gain a high position. This is true in the West and in the East.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Wanting to Become Great</h2>
<p>Everyone regards the elders very highly. In 1976, during the training on the <em>Life-study of Matthew,</em> we read where the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant&rdquo; (Matt. 20:25-26). During that training I told the sisters whose husbands are elders that they should say, &ldquo;When my husband became an elder, he became a slave&rdquo; (<em>Life-study of Matthew,</em> p. 656). The sisters whose husbands become elders in the church should not consider themselves to be first ladies. They must realize that elders are slaves and that elders&rsquo; wives are slaves&rsquo; wives. In America there are some in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery who travel from place to place looking for an opportunity to be an elder. Such an ambition limits the Lord&rsquo;s spread. Many brothers and sisters who could have been useful have stopped growing in life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Too Much Authority Being a Limitation</h2>
<p>When the elders in the church have too much authority, it becomes a limitation. Ten years ago there were four thousand in the children&rsquo;s meeting. Based on this, I suggested that it would be good to work on the children until there were ten thousand children. Now there are only five hundred fifty in the children&rsquo;s meeting. The functioning saints stopped laboring in the children&rsquo;s work because no one promoted the work and no one sounded the call. At the end of 1980 the total attendance in all our meetings was not very high.</p>
<p>We need statistics in everything. As soon as we look at the statistics, we know where the lack is. The elders&rsquo; administration of the church has unconsciously become a limitation to us, because they do not have a long-term view and do not bring the saints into function. The elders are not aggressive to make arrangements, so the saints cannot do much. If the elders were aggressive to make arrangements, all the saints would be able to function. This limitation comes from the elders having too much authority. Whatever the elders do not decide upon does not get done. It does not seem as though this is the situation, but it is the fact. The root of our sickness is that the elders have too much authority, so there are levels in the church.</p>
<p>Suppose a young person wants to live in a brothers&rsquo; house. The elders do not have to be involved in this matter. They should hand it over to the responsible ones in the brothers&rsquo; house. Whatever decision the responsible ones make should be good enough. There is no need to obtain the approval of the elders. This is the main reason that our work does not spread and advance. This does not mean that our condition is declining or corrupted on the negative side but that we are trying to maintain an orderly condition on the positive side. Therefore, whatever happens, even at the &ldquo;lowest level,&rdquo; has to be approved at the &ldquo;highest level.&rdquo; Such a situation is a hindrance, causes much trouble, and consumes much manpower and time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Co-workers and Elders<br />
Not Being a Special Class</h2>
<p>I stand before the Lord and beg that we would change our way of doing things, especially with the newly appointed elders and deacons. In the past the co-workers and elders among us were treated as a special class of people. Such a flavor, to an extent, still exists among us. For the sake of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony on the island of Taiwan there should not be any special class of people among us, whether in the church or in the work.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, the work here was entrusted to me and has been built up by me with the brothers. The Lord knows that I am often in fear and trembling in His presence, that I would not have a haughty manner when I contact the saints. However, according to my observation, the co-workers have a haughty and lofty manner, and the elders have a bureaucratic flavor. The elders have their responsibilities, but they should not be haughty. The elders are not higher than the deacons, and the deacons are not higher than the saints. There are no such levels in the church.</p>
<p>Leading a church can be compared to leading a country. A country has a constitution, and a church has the Bible, which is our constitution. Everything we do should be according to the Bible. For instance, some of the elders have been serving since they were in their thirties, and they are now in their seventies. Because their physical energy is decreasing, they cannot bear too many responsibilities, but they are still elders. How should we deal with such a situation? How long should an elder&rsquo;s tenure be? I cannot answer this question. Although I am rather familiar with our constitution, the Bible, I cannot find a word that specifies how long the tenure of an elder should be. In practice this is a problem.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD NOT WANTING US TO BE LEADERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">There Being No Leader among the Apostles</h2>
<p>There are many portions in the New Testament that show that the Lord does not want anyone to be a leader. In modern society every group has a leader. For example, among five members of a board of directors for a school, a president must be elected, or at least a convener must be chosen. In the New Testament, however, the Lord Jesus appointed twelve apostles, but He did not appoint a chief apostle among them, nor did they elect a leader among themselves.</p>
<h2 class="head2">There Being No Leaders in the Small Groups</h2>
<p>In the book of Acts the disciples were greatly multiplied in number. There were Jews who spoke Greek and Jews who spoke Hebrew, and the two groups could not communicate with each other. As a result, the daily dispensing was not done equally, and there were complaints. Then the twelve said, &ldquo;It is not fitting for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables. But brothers, look for seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint over this need. But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word&rdquo; (6:2-4). Seven disciples were chosen to serve food, but no leader was chosen among them.</p>
<p>In the New Testament Paul speaks of appointing elders and of their qualifications, but he does not speak of electing a leader among the elders (Titus 1:5; 1 Tim. 3:1-7). Based on these examples, we do not have leaders in the small groups. If a brother says that he has been in the church life for more than twenty years, loves the Lord, and never misses a meeting but complains when another brother, who has been saved for only five years, is appointed as a leading one, his concept of position will become a source of stumbling. The desire to be a leader is a poison that only damages the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THERE BEING NO DISTINCTION OF LEVEL<br />
AMONG THE ELDERS</h2>
<p>Among the co-workers and elders there are always some that are more spiritual and more experienced, who make decisions (cf. Acts 15:13-21). However, this does not mean that such brothers are the head. During the early period of the church, Peter took the lead and James followed. However, in Galatians 2 James was placed before Peter and John (v. 9). Later, James brought Judaism into the church, and this caused God to destroy the church in Jerusalem; even the entire city of Jerusalem was wiped out and totally destroyed.</p>
<p>These examples show that taking the lead is not the permanent responsibility of one person. In the New Testament no elder has a head position over other elders. All the elders are on the same level and have the same rank. There is no distinction of levels. The saints should not have to report every matter that needs a decision to the elders, nor do the elders in a meeting hall report to the elders in the central meeting hall for approval. Rather, the elders should fellowship among themselves.</p>
<p>However, the brothers in a meeting hall cannot say that baptism by immersion is too troublesome, and they will therefore baptize by sprinkling, because they do not have the authority to do so. There is no such constitution among us. Any person who would do such a thing would be writing his own constitution and is not under this ministry. Any change that is related to the truth must be based on the Bible. Whether to baptize people in the morning or evening, whether to use a big tub or a small tub, or whether to use cold water or warm water do not need to be reported to the elders. Such decisions should be made according to the practical situation in a hall.</p>
<p>If a matter cannot be worked out in a meeting hall, whether it is related to the work, the gospel in schools, the children&rsquo;s gospel, or the community gospel, I am open to fellowship with you. There are no levels in the church. For a matter that will affect all twenty-one meeting halls, any meeting hall can call an elders&rsquo; meeting. There is no convener among us. As long as a matter concerns the whole church, any elder can call an elders&rsquo; meeting, and the elders in the twenty-one meeting halls should come and fellowship together.</p>
<p>We hope that we can be exercised not to have a leader. Leaders do not exist in the New Testament. If we remove the leaders, there will be no levels among us. The deacons should not regard the elders as their boss. According to the teaching of the Bible, the elders are appointed by God and so are the deacons. In the past our view concerning this point was not correct.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Elders and Deacons Both Having Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Perhaps the brothers and sisters would ask how to practically carry out this fellowship. The elders have their responsibilities and so do the deacons. The responsibilities of the elders are not under those of the deacons, nor are the responsibilities of the deacons under those of the elders. According to the Bible, the elders should take care of shepherding and overseeing, and the deacons take care of various affairs. For example, the matters related to cleaning are carried out by the deacons and do not need to be reported to the elders. Once a matter related to cleaning requires an elder&rsquo;s approval, levels are produced. In our study of the Bible for the past years, we have found neither leaders nor levels in the New Testament. In the New Testament there is only fellowship and coordination. When the elders decide on what needs to be done for a conference, including set-up, cleaning, and ushering, they often assign subordinates to carry out each task. This way of doing things is according to the way of the world, not according to the teaching of the Bible.</p><h2 class="head2">Fellowshipping, Not Ordering</h2>
<p>The Bible speaks of fellowshipping, not of ordering. The elders should communicate in the way of fellowship, instead of taking a superior position to speak to a saint who is serving as a deacon. An elder should be willing to be lower than the deacon. First Corinthians 12:28 speaks of helps and administrations. No one can deny that those who help are the deacons and those who administrate are the elders. In this verse Paul places the deacons before the elders. If the elders are higher than the deacons, why did Paul put the deacons before the elders? Paul purposely arranged the order in this verse. He says, &ldquo;God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers,&rdquo; and then he mentions helps and administrations. Therefore, based on the divine revelation in the Bible, we cannot have levels. Without levels everything can still be accomplished. This is coordination.</p>
<p>It is the elders&rsquo; responsibility to determine how the meetings should be conducted, but this decision should not be made only by the elders. They should fellowship with the saints and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading. In principle it is the elders who make decisions concerning matters, and their decisions should be carried out through fellowship. For example, the elders should inform the brothers responsible for cleaning which facility will be used for a certain meeting and ask the brothers to take care of the cleaning. The elders should also inform the saints responsible for set-up and for ushering. This should all be done in fellowship and not by giving orders. Then everyone can carry out his portion side by side.</p>
<p>If we do not function in this way, we cannot explain Matthew 20. There it says that those who want to be great should be servants, and whoever wants to be first shall be a slave (vv. 26-27). Therefore, we should not be according to the order in 1 Timothy 3, where the elders are mentioned first, before the deacons. We should not think that the elders are higher and that the deacons are lower. Otherwise, we will not be able to explain Matthew 20. This is the answer we have found after many years of studying the Bible, consulting other books, and passing through painful experiences. We cannot have levels or ranks, but with regard to responsibilities, there should be distinction. Everyone functions according to his portion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EACH MEMBER OF THE BODY FUNCTIONING ACCORDING TO HIS PORTION</h2>
<p>The Epistles speak of each member of the Body functioning according to his portion. Each member of the Body has a place and a function (1 Cor. 12:18). Hence, we should remove the concept of rank, which we received from society. An elder should not feel that he is higher than others, nor should a deacon feel that he is lower than others. An elder makes decisions concerning certain matters and asks the deacons to cooperate, but an elder does not ask in the way of a boss giving orders to his subordinate. Those who clean the hall are not subordinates listening to the command of their boss. They are serving the Lord in coordination with the church.</p>
<p>In this way we can keep the word in Matthew 20:26-27, which says, &ldquo;Whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave.&rdquo; We are brothers one of another; no one can be a master over others. This also corresponds to Peter&rsquo;s word. He says, &ldquo;Elders...shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not under compulsion but willingly, according to God;...nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock&rdquo; (1 Pet. 5:2-3). This also corresponds to what Paul said in Acts 20:28, &ldquo;Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers to shepherd the church of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we do not keep this in mind, whenever we think of administration, we will be haughty, as if we were a general manager ruling over a company. In other words, the thought in the Bible is absolutely not according to the way of society. The Bible says that the church is Christ&rsquo;s Body (Eph. 1:22-23). In the Body no member can come forth to rule over other members. Instead, the many members in the Body are coordinated, and each member operates according to its measure and function. According to 1 Corinthians, even the head is a member (12:21). This does not refer to Christ as the Head of the Body, because Christ is the unique Head. No member in the Body rules over other members; rather, every member keeps his position and exercises his function.</p>
<p>Therefore, this abnormal way of doing things among us must change. Instead of forming a special class of people, we are to serve the saints by giving messages and teaching them. If we are a special class, we are in degradation and have become a degraded religion. There is no special class in the church. Paul says, &ldquo;In nothing am I inferior to the super-apostles, even though I am nothing&rdquo; (2 Cor. 12:11). However, he also says, &ldquo;To me, less than the least of all saints&rdquo; (Eph. 3:8). This is the kind of heart and attitude that we should have. The elders should never have the concept that is in society and think that they are the first, the elders, the &ldquo;president.&rdquo; Such a concept must be completely removed. Likewise, other saints should not think that they are nobody in the church, since they are neither elders nor deacons. In the church each of us must function according to our portion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NO MANPOWER AND NO RESOURCES BEING WASTED</h2>
<p>Since we are not able to make arrangements for every saint, we have listed the various categories in the work, such as the small groups, the gospel in the homes, in the schools, and in the community, and the children&rsquo;s work. Our hope is that every saint would participate in one category. Nevertheless, every saint should participate in promoting and strengthening the small groups, and every family should participate in the gospel in the homes. Although we are not elders or deacons, we should still participate. The concept of levels or rank must be removed. Every saint should function according to his portion and do what he can to the best of his ability in his place. No one can limit others, rule over others, or restrict others.</p>
<p>In this way, no manpower and no resources will be wasted, and we will not hinder the Lord&rsquo;s business or waste His time. May the Lord have mercy on us. We hope that all the brothers and sisters will have the heart to enter into such a burden.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SERVICE OF THE ELDERS AND DEACONS IN THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>This message is concerned with the elders&rsquo; responsibilities, the service of the deacons, and the relationship between the elders and the deacons.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS&rsquo; RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Leading</h2>
<p>The elders&rsquo; responsibilities consist of four main items, and the first item is leading. The word <em>leads</em> is used in the New Testament, but it is regrettable that in the Chinese Bible this word is translated as &ldquo;administrates.&rdquo; Romans 12:8 in the Chinese Union Version says, &ldquo;He who administrates, in diligence.&rdquo; The word <em>administrates</em> in this verse should be translated as &ldquo;leads,&rdquo; because here it refers to taking the lead diligently.</p>
<p>According to the Greek text there is only one portion in the New Testament where the word <em>administration</em> is used in relation to the elders&rsquo; responsibilities. First Corinthians 12:28 says, &ldquo;God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.&rdquo; Except for this verse, all the other verses that have the word <em>administrates</em> in relation to the elders&rsquo; responsibilities should be translated with the word <em>leads.</em></p>
<p>Hebrews 13:7 says, &ldquo;Remember the ones leading you, who have spoken to you the word of God; and considering the issue of their manner of life, imitate their faith.&rdquo; The word <em>leading</em> in this verse and <em>leads</em> in Romans 12:8 clearly indicate that the main responsibility of the elders in the church is to lead.</p>
<p>This also corresponds to 1 Peter 5:3, which says that elders should not lord it over their allotments but should become patterns of the flock. The flock is the allotment. The elders should not lord it over the flock but rather they should become patterns of the flock. Becoming a pattern means to take the lead as the lead sheep. When I was in Scotland in 1958, I saw many herds of sheep. I observed that the herd would follow the way that the first few sheep in the herd took. The shepherd did not need to guard the whole herd. He only needed to direct a few sheep in the front. When the sheep in front made a move, the entire herd moved accordingly. When the sheep in front stopped, the herd also stopped. If the sheep in front turned, the whole herd turned.</p>
<p>When I saw this, I understood why the Bible says that the elders are entrusted to shepherd the flock of God. Strictly speaking, the elders shepherd the flock by taking the lead. If the sheep taking the lead say to go left but do not go left themselves, how can the herd go left? Therefore, to genuinely shepherd the flock of God, the elders have to take the lead. The main responsibility of the elders in the church is to take the lead. If the elders take the lead in everything, the rest of the saints will spontaneously follow. If the elders love the world, it is guaranteed that the saints in the church will also love the world. Peter was such an example. After the Lord had resurrected and ascended, Peter said to the rest of the disciples, &ldquo;I am going fishing,&rdquo; and they responded, &ldquo;We also are coming with you&rdquo; (John 21:3). The primary responsibility of an elder is to take the lead.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Teaching</h2>
<p>First Timothy 3:2 says, &ldquo;The overseer then must be without reproach,...apt to teach.&rdquo; The elders must be apt to teach. This does not refer to being a teacher. The New Testament says that God gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelists, and some as shepherds and teachers (Eph. 4:11). Shepherds and teachers are not two different persons but one. Teachers must be shepherds, and shepherds must be teachers. The elders&rsquo; being apt to teach is not the same as teachers teaching in schools. It is more like parents helping their children with their studies at home. If parents are able to help their children with their schoolwork at home, the children will succeed in school. If parents do not know how to teach their children, the children will suffer a big loss. The teaching by teachers in the schools differs from that of the parents at home. These are two different kinds of teaching. The elders in the New Testament are parents, not teachers.</p>
<p>These two kinds of teaching are different in nature. According to their duties, the elders must teach, whereas according to the gift, a teacher is able to teach. Teachers teach the truth, which includes defining the truth. For example, to teach the truth concerning justification, one must explain clearly the objective and the subjective aspects of justification. This is the teaching by teachers. The teaching by the elders, however, is different. An elder may stand up in a meeting and say, &ldquo;The New Year is near, and the people in the world are busy shopping. However, we who belong to the Lord cannot be the same as they. We should be separated from the world. We use the New Year holidays for prayer and for preaching the gospel.&rdquo; This word of exhortation is a kind of teaching by a parent. The church needs this kind of teaching. The church needs ones to speak words of exhortation and teaching to the brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Some elders progress gradually from teaching as parents to teaching as teachers. For example, they can release message after message on the mystery of the faith in order to unveil Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ. This progress is encouraging. The local churches need these two kinds of teaching. The elders should regularly speak a word for three to five minutes. They should teach the saints how to have the table meeting, and how to pray, call hymns, and testify. This &ldquo;home teaching&rdquo; is needed in all the churches. I hope that in every meeting hall there will be at least one elder who is responsible for this kind of teaching every week. Then after fifty-two weeks, there will be an accumulation. This will render help to the young ones who recently entered the church life as well as to those who attend the meetings regularly.</p><h2 class="head2">Shepherding</h2>
<p>The third responsibility of an elder is to shepherd. In Acts 20:28 Paul said to the elders in Ephesus, &ldquo;Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers to shepherd the church of God.&rdquo; In this verse shepherding does not refer to being the head sheep but to being a shepherd. The first thing a shepherd must do is to supply food to the flock by preparing all that the flock needs for food and drink. The elders need to prepare spiritual food for the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Promoting</h2>
<p>The fourth responsibility is promoting. In addition to leading, teaching, and shepherding, the elders need to promote the work. The elders should be the ones who promote the work. The church can be compared to a car and the elders, to a driver. A car without a driver will not move. There is a saying in the Philippines that illustrates the function of a driver: &ldquo;The car is here, but the head of the car is not here.&rdquo; This means that the driver is the head of a car. The church is likened to the car and the elders to the driver. A church should never be in the situation where the car is present, but the head of the car is absent. The elders should always remember that even if they do well in leading, teaching, and shepherding but do not know how to promote, they are still not up to the standard of being an elder. Without a driver, a car will not move even if there is gas. The elders in each meeting hall must take the responsibility to drive the car.</p>
<p>A businessman who can produce superior ideas makes more money. The most valuable managers in the business field are those who can come up with ideas. During the Sino-Japanese War, there were several businessmen living in Shanghai. When they saw that the war was going on in earnest and that every country was using sulfur to make ammunition and matches, they realized that sulfur would be in short supply. So they began to stock up on matches, and true to their prediction matches came to be in short supply. They then sold the matches at more than ten times the regular rate and made a profit. In terms of promoting the work, all the elders should learn from these businessmen and come up with ideas. They should not be ones who do not know how to do things. The elders should always exercise to come up with ideas to promote the work.</p>
<p>Suppose in one meeting hall there are over eleven hundred saints on the list, but six hundred do not meet regularly and only about two hundred fifty saints meet on Lord&rsquo;s Day. The elders in that meeting hall need to come up with ideas, because there is too much work to be done. They might not be able to recover all six hundred saints who have not been meeting, but they can at least try to recover half of them. They should make a plan to recover ten percent of the saints in three months. Then they should work on another plan to recover another ten percent in the next three months.</p>
<p>The elders need to have ideas concerning the principle of the work and concerning the details. The church in Taipei urgently needs practical ideas in order to recover one hundred saints in three months. For many years no one has been recovered, but we must practice this. Every meeting hall will be entrusted to two responsible brothers who need to be accountable to come up with ideas.</p>
<p>In addition, we are opening up four areas for the co-workers: the gospel in the schools, the small groups, the community gospel, and the children&rsquo;s work. The co-workers are happy with this arrangement. Now the elders can labor in these areas.</p>
<p>We have a great possession, and our need is to promote it in this way. Even our possession in Taipei is great. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day there are three thousand saints meeting in Taipei. This is a great possession. Things will happen when the elders begin to promote. Our lack in the past was that we did not promote things. For this reason, as soon as the work on the Life-study of the New Testament was finished, I put down my pen and said, &ldquo;I am returning to Taiwan to promote things.&rdquo; We need to pray for this.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei is large, with at least eleven thousand saints. However, only six to seven thousand saints are in the meetings. It seems as though these six to seven thousand saints alternate in attendance. You come to the meeting when I do not come, and he comes to the meeting when you are absent. As a result, only three thousand saints are in the meetings. If we would gradually promote the gospel, truth, life, and the church among the saints, there will be results.</p>
<p>This is an urgent need. We must promote these matters. We are led by the Lord to begin promoting the small groups. Therefore, all the elders need to promote the small groups. Once all the responsible brothers assume the responsibility of the meeting halls, the first matter for them is to study how to promote the small groups. The small groups must be promoted among us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DEACONS&rsquo; SERVICE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Visitation</h2>
<p>In addition to the elders&rsquo; leading, teaching, shepherding, and promoting, in a local church there is still a need for the deacons&rsquo; visitation. The needs in a local church are of various aspects. According to our experience, the greatest need is visitation. There are many names on our list, but less than half the saints come to the meetings regularly, because there is a lack in visitation.</p>
<p>Visitation is an upholding and support that can keep people in the church. Because we have a lack in our practice of visitation, many people slip through the cracks in our localities. We must raise up a sufficient number of saints in the local churches to take up the responsibility of visitation. These saints should know the truth, have some growth in life, love the brothers and sisters, and have a heart to serve the Lord. Such saints, whether they are brothers or sisters, should serve as deacons.</p>
<p>In the past we had the mistaken concept that we should not have too many deacons; thus, our need was not met. For this reason, we have added many saints to serve as deacons. We should charge these saints to take up the work of visitation. Visitation is a miniature of shepherding and teaching. In fact, visitation is shepherding.</p>
<p>According to our experience we need to carry this out in two ways. First, some older saints are retired and no longer work, and they do not have much responsibility at home because their children are all grown. If these saints have a heart, they can do two things. First, they can pray for the church regularly. The church needs such a group of older saints to pray whenever they have the time. Although they do not have the strength to go out, they can pray regularly at home. Sometimes three or five of them can come together and pray. We believe that the Lord hears their prayer, and the church indeed depends upon their prayer. This is something precious.</p>
<p>In addition, we can encourage the older saints to do some visitation. They may not be able to travel far, but they can take care of nearby brothers and sisters. In particular they can care for the saints before and after every meeting. We should help the older saints to participate in the work of visitation, but we do not need to give them the title of a deacon. Their physical strength may not be adequate, but they can still be in the coordination for visitation.</p>
<p>The second aspect, with regard to the older saints, is to appoint saints under sixty years of age, who have much growth in the truth and in life and who love the church, the Lord, and the saints, as deacons and entrust them with the responsibility of visitation. Sixty deacons is not too many for a church with one thousand saints. The deacons are the saints in a locality or in a meeting hall who have the growth and experience in life. It is better if more saints of this kind do the work of visitation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Taking Care of Miscellaneous Matters</h2>
<p>Besides visitation, there are still many other miscellaneous matters, such as business office responsibilities, clerical needs, accounting, record keeping, ushering, cleaning, set-up, electrical maintenance, purchasing, hospitality, transportation, repairs, and estate management, which includes property, housing, and appliances and furniture. Almost every meeting hall has these miscellaneous items, and every item needs an experienced saint, who has the energy and the physical capacity, to be a deacon. Ushering needs a brother or a sister who is a deacon to bear this responsibility and to ask other saints to serve as ushers. When he asks other saints to serve, he should not approach the saints who take care of visitation. We hope that every saint will take up only one task, and no one will bear two tasks. We should not ask the saints who already have a task to serve in another task.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can entrust the task of cleaning to one or two deacons, who in turn can ask other saints to come to the meeting hall at an appointed time to clean. We hope also that the saints who take care of cleaning will not do other things. The same principle can be applied to each item. Besides the deacons who are responsible for visitation, there is still a need for a dozen more deacons to bear responsibility for these miscellaneous items. In this way almost all the saints can be utilized. If we are aggressive, every saint will have a function in the service.</p>
<p>We should not have only one group of saints who are always ushering in every meeting. Instead, we should use several groups of saints: one group for Lord&rsquo;s Day, another group for Tuesday, and still another group for Thursday. Thus, many saints will be involved in serving as ushers, no one will be tired, and all the services will be evenly borne by the saints. The elders in each meeting hall should take care of making arrangements, because they take the lead and are familiar with the condition of each saint. It is the elders who should select appropriate saints to be deacons for visitation and also select the saints to be in charge of the miscellaneous items. Then the church will be on the right track.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
THE ELDERS AND THE DEACONS</h2>
<p>There is no rank in the church. The relationship between the elders and the deacons involves everyone fulfilling his respective responsibilities. We have been in human society for so long that we all have the concept of a social organization. Hence, as soon as elders and deacons are mentioned, we spontaneously bring in the concept of a social organization. We feel that the elders are high and the deacons are low, or that the elders give orders and the deacons take orders. This ranking system is not right. As a result of this matter, I have spent time studying the New Testament again in detail, and the Lord has given me clear light to see that there were no leaders in the New Testament. When the apostles were appointed, no one was appointed as a chief apostle among them. When the elders and deacons were appointed, there was no chief elder or chief deacon appointed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having No Distinction of Order or Rank</h2>
<p>In the Bible there is no distinction of rank between the elders and deacons. If there were such a distinction, it would mean that the higher group would rule over the lower one. But this does not correspond with the word of the Lord Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew. The Lord said, &ldquo;The rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant&rdquo; (20:25-26; cf. 23:11). Based on this truth and principle, the British Brethren were raised up over one hundred years ago. They called themselves merely brothers and did not use any title. Therefore, others called them the Brethren Assembly. Among them there was no order or rank; hence, there was no boss or subordinate.</p>
<h2 class="head2">There Not Being Bosses or Subordinates</h2>
<p>However, the concept of rank from society has invaded the church. We still consider an elder&rsquo;s position to be higher and a deacon&rsquo;s position to be lower. In some churches the manner in which a deacon in the business office contacts the elders is like that of a subordinate reporting to his boss. It is good that the deacons are humble, gentle, and full of love and sweetness when they give a report to the elders. But a deacon is not a subordinate reporting to his boss. A person can be gentle, humble, and kind in their demeanor without the flavor of subordination. We must remove every vestige of this concept in our being.</p>
<p>To a certain extent the elders and co-workers have the attitude that they are a special class in the church, that they are higher than others. Although they do not say this nor do they make a show of it, they still have a superior attitude, according to my observation. This is not right. If I express such a flavor in my going out and coming in among you, please tell me, and I will definitely change and apologize, because it is to my shame.</p>
<p>Paul says, &ldquo;I count myself to be inferior to the super-apostles in nothing&rdquo; (2 Cor. 11:5). He also says that he was &ldquo;less than the least of all saints&rdquo; (Eph. 3:8). The co-workers are the least of all saints. Even though we may accomplish much, we still have to return to the Lord&rsquo;s presence and remember His word in Luke 17:10: &ldquo;When you do all the things which are ordered you, say, We are unprofitable slaves; we have done what we ought to have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of the saints we should not be able to boast of anything. There is nothing special about elders and deacons. They are only brothers. The chorus of hymn #251 in Chinese says, &ldquo;I am a sinner saved by grace!&rdquo; We have no position to assume among the brothers and sisters. We are not a special class of people among them; we are sinners saved by grace. Although the elders and co-workers do not flaunt a difference among the saints, their attitude indicates that they are different from the brothers and that they are a little higher than the brothers. May the Lord have mercy on us. We need to remove such a situation from among us. If people who come to the church can tell who among us are the &ldquo;bosses&rdquo; and who are the &ldquo;subordinates,&rdquo; it is to our shame. We must remove the concept of rank.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Responsibilities without Rank</h2>
<p>We must believe that the Bible is absolutely right. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 12:28 that God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, and at the end helps, administrations, and various kinds of tongues. Paul puts the deacons, referred to as helps, ahead of the elders, referred to as administrations. This shows that there is no rank between the elders and deacons and that the elders are not higher than the deacons. They differ only in their responsibilities. However, the responsibilities of leading, managing, shepherding, teaching, and promoting are not higher than the responsibilities of a deacon. In society people who take care of miscellaneous matters are lower, and people who manage are higher. This is not the concept in the Bible. The Bible emphasizes the fact that each member has responsibilities, but there is no distinction as to who is higher or who is lower.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many&rdquo; (Matt. 20:28). We should never think that the Lord Jesus is lower than us since His duty is to serve us. Generally speaking, those who are served are higher, whereas those who serve are lower. This is the case in society without exception. The Bible is the only exception. Those who serve as elders have their responsibilities, but their position is not higher than that of the deacons. Those who serve as deacons have their responsibilities, but their position is not lower than that of the elders. We are all brothers. The only thing that distinguishes us is our responsibilities. Peter says, &ldquo;Each one, as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God&rdquo; (1 Pet. 4:10). Among the brothers and sisters there can be differences in gifts but there is no difference in position.</p><h2 class="head2">Having Different Functions<br />
but Being Members One of Another</h2>
<p>We need to consider what 1 Timothy 3 says concerning the person of the elders and deacons. However, if we read only this chapter, we may think that it shows rank. First Timothy 3 first mentions the elders (vv. 1-7) and then deacons (vv. 8-13), as if elders are higher and deacons are lower. However, the Bible is not one-sided. Romans 12:4-5 says, &ldquo;Just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, so we who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another.&rdquo; Moreover, both 1 Corinthians 12 and Ephesians 4 say that we are members of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>If we look at our physical body, we may say that the feet are lower than the legs. However, such a thought does not exist in our head. Being high or low is an organizational view, but in the organism of a body, there is only a distinction of function. There is no distinction related to a member being high or low. If the eye is higher than the nose, then we would ask, does the nose rule the mouth, or does the mouth rule the nose? In the Bible there is no distinction of being high or low; such a distinction exists only in an organization. We are all members one of another in the one Body of Christ. There is no high or low but only the distinction of function. The most we can say is that we are in one communication, one fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Co-workers Not Being<br />
a Special Class in the Body</h2>
<p>The co-workers are merely members in the Body of Christ. They are not greater than other saints. The co-workers should not regard themselves as a special class of people. Some co-workers consider themselves to be higher than the saints. Although they do not say so, their mannerism and their airs indicate it. We must realize that we are merely sinners who have been graced by the Lord. In Christ&rsquo;s Body we are merely members who have received mercy from the Lord. There is nothing in us that is higher than the saints.</p>
<p>Therefore, the elders should not give orders to the deacons, and neither should the deacons consider themselves to be subordinates to the elders. We are in the Body of Christ. The saints who are responsible for a service do not need to report back to the elders. The elders should not give orders when they need help; rather, they should get help through fellowship. Forty years ago when I was in the church in Chefoo, every item in the service was put into good order. I even got involved in the cleaning and took the lead to clean. Before I got involved, none of the elders were involved, but after I took the lead, they all followed.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei needs to have a new beginning. We hope that all the elders will also take the lead and sometimes vacuum the floor of the meeting hall. If the brother leading the cleaning assigns a sister, who works as a house servant, to clean the toilets, and then assigns another sister, who is the wife of a banker, to dust the lectern, others will feel that this brother is prejudiced. However, if we simply change and let the banker&rsquo;s wife clean the toilet and the servant dust the lectern, we are being political to avoid criticism. We must consider the brothers and sisters as the same, without any concept of rank, and therefore do everything through fellowship. May we have a good beginning; I trust that the Lord will be with us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO MOVES OF GOD IN TAIWAN</h2>
<p>We will now see two crucial matters that concern the Lord&rsquo;s move in Taiwan. May we all receive the burden to pray for these matters.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Building a Large Meeting Hall<br />
with the Capacity of Ten Thousand</h2>
<p>The first matter concerns the building of a large meeting hall. The church in Taipei is the largest locality in Taiwan; the Lord has a large possession here. In order for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to move forward, for all the churches to be established, and for those who have a heart to be raised up, perfected, and cultivated, we need to build a large meeting hall in Taipei. We should try our best to build a meeting hall with the capacity of ten thousand people. If we feel that we should do this, we need to pray earnestly and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading. We also need to consider many details in this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Evangelizing Taiwan in Five Years</h2>
<p>The second matter is to evangelize Taiwan in five years. This is not a light matter. After considering the various situations in Taiwan related to society, economy, transportation, and education, we feel that Taiwan is the most ideal field for our work. The gospel candidates here are also the best. In Taipei alone, there are over six hundred thousand students from primary school to college. Eight hundred saints would not be too many to preach the gospel and meet the needs of these six hundred thousand students. I have been serving the Lord and doing His work for fifty-three years, and I have never seen a place so suitable for the work. We are the Lord&rsquo;s possessions. When we came here thirty-five years ago, our possession was not large. However, now there are at least ten thousand saints living in the church life in Taiwan. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day the total attendance is about six thousand. These saints, together with the meeting halls, are a great possession. If we would gradually mobilize the saints, by the Lord&rsquo;s grace there will be an effect.</p>
<p>My desire is that we would utilize the possessions that we have in coordination with a society that is suitable for the gospel. We will use five years, from 1985 to 1990, to evangelize the entire island of Taiwan. We will work out an environment where there will be a church in every town and every village.</p>
<p>My fellowship with you concerning this matter is related to two intentions. First, I hope that we will pray and ask the Lord to give us a clear leading. Second, since we are learning how to serve in these meetings, we are telling you what our feeling is and the goal toward which the Lord is leading us. Our goal is to evangelize Taiwan in five years so that there will be a church in every town and every village. In order to reach this goal, we must try our best to obtain a large meeting hall.</p>
<p>Once these two matters are well under way, many other positive things will take place. Many brothers and sisters will make material offerings, and a substantial number of saints will migrate to Southeast Asia, India, Sri Lanka, and Burma. Currently there are temples and pagodas in every town and village in Taiwan. We must depend on the Lord&rsquo;s grace so that every town and village has a church. We believe that this will bring in a great blessing to this country. Since our God is the true God and our Lord is the Lord, we must speak Him forth and dispense Him so that the gospel can be spread to all our countrymen for them to obtain salvation. This is not an empty dream. We have an environment and a large possession. As long as we are faithful to mobilize every church, beginning with Taipei, we believe that we will accomplish this goal in five years.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">PREACHING THE GOSPEL<br />
IN THE WAY OF COMPELLING PEOPLE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 14:15-23</h1>
<p>The Lord always leads us forward. We hope that the church life will now have a new beginning. In order for the church life to have a new beginning, we need to promote and carry out the small groups. The goal of promoting the small groups is first to bring in new ones, then to recover those who have not been meeting, and lastly to uphold the saints who meet regularly.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRST GOAL OF THE SMALL GROUPS<br />
BEING TO BRING IN NEW ONES</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, to bring in new ones is to preach the gospel and lead people to the Lord. In promoting the small groups, we first need to encourage the saints to bring in new ones. When we came to Taiwan, we were rather successful in preaching and promoting the gospel. Almost all the saints in the church in Taipei were mobilized to distribute gospel tracts to every door on the street where they lived. As a result, in one week every household in the city of Taipei received a gospel tract.</p>
<p>We printed many gospel banners, such as &ldquo;God so loved the world&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jesus Christ came to the world to save sinners,&rdquo; and we posted them in streets, alleys, and crossroads, and at train stations and bus stops. At that time there were not many high-rise buildings; most buildings were Japanese-style houses. The saints posted banners on both sides of the front door of their house. If someone walked on the street and saw gospel banners posted on the two sides of a front door, he knew that it was the house of a saint.</p>
<p>In addition, we often conducted gospel marches on Lord&rsquo;s Day afternoons. The saints would walk to Taipei City New Park and preach the gospel in the outdoor amphitheater, which had enough seats to hold about three thousand people. We often filled the seats. After every gospel meeting, we usually received about five hundred names. The next evening the saints would gather together, and the names would be distributed to the saints. Everyone received a burden from the Lord and visited the gospel friends. In this way we contacted over two thousand new ones within a month. One time we baptized seven hundred. Many of those who were newly saved later became elders, deacons, and deaconesses in various localities all over Taiwan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COMPELLING PEOPLE TO RECEIVE THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>During those years, the fire of the gospel was indeed burning among us. However, we did not reach the stage of going out and compelling people. In Luke 14:23 the Lord Jesus told us that to go out and bring people in, we even need to go to the roads and hedges and compel people. According to the original Greek, to compel people means to force people. The Lord said, &ldquo;Go out into the roads and hedges and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled.&rdquo; Our burden is to teach you how to compel others. The Lord Jesus spoke of our need to compel others.</p>
<p>In verse 23 the Lord said that we should compel people to come in. Then in verse 26 He said, &ldquo;If anyone comes to Me and does not hate.&rdquo; These two matters spoken of in Luke 14 are quite harsh. First, we have to go out and compel people to believe in the Lord. Second, after they believe, they have to &ldquo;hate.&rdquo; Seemingly, this is against what Christianity teaches about being kind, loving, and broad, but this is indeed the Lord&rsquo;s word. Not only do we have to hate our parents and our wife, we also have to hate our self. The teaching of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; is quite particular. Hymns #664 in Chinese says, &ldquo;Rise up quickly and preach the gospel!&rdquo; But the Lord&rsquo;s word goes even further; He wants us to rise up quickly and compel people. The secret to preaching the gospel is to have a zealous heart, to be crazy. A person who is crazy does not care for himself. Forty years ago I was crazy whenever I preached the gospel. However, I was not crazy to the extent of compelling others. For this reason, I feel that I am still indebted to the gospel.</p>
<p>Our main impression concerning the Gospel of Luke is that it is a sweet gospel. It tells us that the Lord Jesus is a good shepherd who is full of compassion. In His tender love He looks for us, He embraces and bears us, and He brings us back to His flock (15:1-7). This Gospel also tells us that the Lord is a good Samaritan. We are wounded and on the verge of death, but He binds our wounds and pours oil and wine on them (10:25-35). However, we never saw the matter that the Lord Jesus wants us to go and compel others, nor did we see that the Lord wants us to hate.</p><h2 class="head1">ALL SAVED BELIEVERS RECEIVING ONE MINA&mdash;<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S SALVATION</h2>
<p>Chapter 19 is another example. Verses 1 through 10 speak of the salvation of a tax collector named Zaccheus. In verse 9 the Lord joyfully said, &ldquo;Today salvation has come to this house.&rdquo; Then He said, &ldquo;The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost&rdquo; (v. 10). Immediately after that the Lord spoke another parable (vv. 11-27). He compared Himself to a man of noble birth who was going to a distant country to receive a kingdom and return. This means that He would leave the world, ascend to receive His kingdom, and return. This man called ten of his slaves. Ten is the number of completion and represents all the saved believers. The ten slaves included Zaccheus and even you and me. Each slave was given one mina, which signifies the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. A mina is a silver coin, and in the Bible silver signifies the redemption of Christ. The one mina signifies the redemption of Christ that we receive and the salvation of Christ that we enjoy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE WHO RECEIVES SALVATION<br />
DOING BUSINESS</h2>
<p>This parable in the Gospel of Luke is different from that in Matthew 25. The parable in the Gospel of Matthew speaks of one slave receiving five talents, another receiving two talents, and another receiving one talent (v. 15). The talents refer to spiritual gifts. The parable in Luke emphasizes the common salvation given equally to each believer. Paul received one mina, and we each received one mina. We need to use the one mina to do business. The Lord commanded us to make a profit. After we are saved, we need to use this mina to earn ten minas. As soon as we are saved, we need to save ten people. We at least need to save five.</p>
<p>In Luke 19 the Lord did not ask us to use one mina to earn another mina or to earn half a mina. He asked us to use one mina to earn at least five minas (vv. 16, 18). After we earn ten minas, the Lord says, &ldquo;Well done, good slave. Because you have become faithful in the least, have authority over ten cities&rdquo; (v. 17). This means that when the Lord returns, we will be co-kings with Him. Each of us has one mina in our hand. Whether we will be able to rule over ten cities in the future does not depend on fate; rather, it depends on whether we do business.</p>
<p>The person who kept the mina in a handkerchief said to the Lord, &ldquo;Master, behold your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief; for I was afraid of you, because you are a harsh man: you withdraw what you did not deposit, and you reap what you did not sow&rdquo; (vv. 20-21). This slave represents many Christians who do not preach the gospel. It is not that they do not love the Lord but that they fear the Lord more than they love Him. Therefore, they keep the Lord&rsquo;s salvation carefully and wrap it in a handkerchief for fear that they will be penalized because they lost it. To them the Lord Jesus is unreasonable and very harsh. This is why they say, &ldquo;You withdraw what you did not deposit, and you reap what you did not sow&rdquo; (v. 21).</p>
<p>Do we love the Lord or fear Him? If we truly love the Lord, we would seize the opportunity and utilize our one mina to earn ten minas. If every brother and every sister would lead ten people to salvation, and these ten would each bring in another ten, there would be one hundred newly saved believers. Then each of the one hundred would gain another ten, resulting in one thousand. In this way all the people in Taiwan would be saved in ten years. Whether we reach this goal depends on whether we are willing to carry it out. The only question lies in whether we love the Lord more or fear the Lord more. Sometimes we reluctantly preach the gospel, but inwardly we still feel that the Lord is harsh. Those slaves who do not do business always feel that the master is harsh and that the master wants to withdraw where he did not deposit and reap where he did not sow. They feel that the master is unreasonable and that they are being forced. Actually this corresponds to compelling people in Luke 14.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE STAGES OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The First Stage of Preaching the Gospel&mdash; Targeting the Jews</h2>
<p>Luke 14 speaks of a man who prepared a great dinner. After everything was ready, he invited many to come (vv. 16-17). This represents the gospel. The Lord Jesus was crucified, which means that the fatted calf was slaughtered, and a feast was prepared. Then God sent His slave to invite people to the feast. This refers to three stages of preaching the gospel. In the first stage, those who were invited all made excuses. The first said that he had bought a piece of land and needed to go out and see it (v. 18). The second said that he had bought five yoke of oxen, and he needed to prove them (v. 19). The third said that he had married a wife and therefore could not come (v. 20). The ones who had money, land, oxen, and wives refer to the Jews. Today the Jews in the world refuse the Lord Jesus. God is not pleased when people do not believe in Jesus (v. 21). It is a great insult to God that people do not believe in His Son. As a result of the Jews rejecting the Lord, in A.D. 70 the Roman army destroyed Jerusalem and did not leave even one stone upon another. That was a very cruel event in the history of Israel.</p><h2 class="head2">The Second Stage of Preaching the Gospel&mdash; Targeting the Gentiles</h2>
<p>In the second stage God sent people to the Gentiles. In the eyes of the Jews, the Gentiles were poor, crippled, blind, and lame (v. 21). Yet God said to invite such people. When I was young I saw the Western missionaries who came to my hometown. The Chinese people who had knowledge, position, and money entirely ignored them. However, those who were blind, lame, and poor went to them. There was a Western missionary who at that time was over ninety years old and could only speak a few Chinese words. He often stood by the street with a big handful of coins, which attracted many children from the poor families to follow him. As he went along the street, he would scatter his coins. Then when he entered into the chapel, all the poor children swarmed in as well. It could be said that the blind, the lame, and the poor all came. At the time I did not approve of this, but from among those poor children many of their offspring love the Lord, and a number of them became well-known revivalists.</p>
<p>During the eighteenth century, many Western missionaries came to China to preach the gospel. At the time China was against foreigners. As a result, they had many difficult experiences. When the Western missionaries first went to the inland area, the Chinese people regarded them as &ldquo;foreign devils&rdquo; and would not rent houses to them, nor would they sell them any food. Some missionaries lived under a bridge or in a local temple. If it was difficult to live in the city, they would move to the countryside. When the village elder would find out, he would ban them. The elder would even order the villagers to beat a gong whenever they saw the missionaries so that everyone could run home and close the door. Then when the Western missionaries entered the village, they could not find anyone. One missionary developed a method to deal with the situation. He took a solid staff with him, and before a villager closed the door, he put his staff inside the door to prevent the door from shutting. Then he squeezed through the gap into the house. In northern China every household had a mill. After entering the house, the missionary went straight to the mill to turn it. He would turn the mill all morning. Even though people in the countryside disliked &ldquo;foreign devils,&rdquo; their heart was softened when they saw him working so hard, so they would ask a child to take him some water. The missionary would thank the child, take the water, and continue turning the mill. This touched the people in the house, and they prepared a little food for him. Then they would converse a little, and gradually the gospel had a beginning. This kind of testimony is very touching. Preaching the gospel in those days was extremely difficult. When the Western missionaries began to preach the gospel in China, they never went to the house of a wealthy man. They always went to the homes of the lame, the blind, and the poor.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Third Stage of Preaching the Gospel&mdash; Compelling Others</h2>
<p>In the second stage of preaching the gospel Western missionaries went to the ends of the earth to preach the gospel in all the foreign lands. However, Luke 14 says that when the slave returned and said, &ldquo;Master, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room,&rdquo; the master then said, &ldquo;Go out into the roads and hedges and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled&rdquo; (vv. 22-23). This is the stage where we are today, the third stage of preaching the gospel. The method of preaching the gospel in the third stage is to compel people. The stage of preaching the gospel to the Jews has been fulfilled; the stage of preaching the gospel to the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame has also been fulfilled. Now we need to go to the roads and the hedges to compel people to come in (v. 23). The roads refer to the main thoroughfares where there is traffic, and the hedges refer to the houses where people dwell. Now when we preach the gospel, we go to the places where there is much traffic and where many people reside. We should compel whomever we come across to come in. This means that whenever we meet someone, we compel him to come in. We are born in the age of compelling people to believe in the gospel.</p>
<p>Taiwan today is very different from the Taiwan of thirty-five years ago. The society of Taiwan at that time was backward, and there were many people who fled from mainland China and did not have homes. As a result, preaching the gospel was very easy. Today, however, Taiwan is developed with high-rise buildings everywhere. If we use the same method of gospel preaching that we used thirty-five years ago, it will not be effective. We need to go to the roads and the hedges, that is, to the places where traffic is convenient and the places where people dwell, to compel them. If we do not compel them, they will not come. Have we compelled our father and mother to believe in Jesus? Have we compelled our own friends to believe in Jesus? We need to know how to compel them. The best way for a daughter to compel her mother to believe in the Lord is to weep. As soon as the daughter weeps, the mother&rsquo;s heart is moved. After weeping to get her mother saved, she should then go and compel her grandmother. Some brothers preach the gospel with an iron will. They are not afraid of being disliked or of being a nuisance; they compel people insistently. Their compelling causes people not to have a day in peace or a way out, until the person believes in the Lord.</p>
<p>There was a brother in Tsinan, China, who was a janitor in a government office. He put a gospel tract on the desk of his boss daily. This boss would throw the gospel tract on the floor in front of the brother. He then told his boss, &ldquo;Jesus loves you.&rdquo; His boss scoffed at these words and said, &ldquo;Who is Jesus?&rdquo; In this way they began to converse. Apparently, this may not be forcing others; however, this is to compel others. It is a gentle compelling of others. No matter how opposed his boss was, this brother would not let go. This way of preaching the gospel needs a steadfast character and a fiery zeal for the gospel. No matter how strongly others reject, we must be indomitable.</p><h2 class="head1">DEVOTING TIME AND ENERGY<br />
TO COMPELLING OTHERS</h2>
<p>If we read the Gospel of Luke thoroughly, we will see that the age we are in today is the third stage of preaching the gospel. This stage requires that we go out to the roads and the hedges to compel people. Whomever we come across, we need to compel. We need to think of ways to compel our cousins, classmates, and colleagues until they believe in the Lord. Do not think that this is a small matter; this is the principle of preaching the gospel. In the first portion of Luke 19, Zaccheus obtained salvation and was therefore joyful; however, if he were the evil slave who did not go out and do business, he would lose his reward when the Lord returns. The first part of Luke 19 is a story of salvation, whereas the second part is concerning the reward.</p>
<p>We all are saved and have received one mina. Whether we will rule over ten cities or five cities in the future is a serious matter. In this stage the Lord is harsh. He did not say that it is easy to go out. It is indeed not easy to go out and reap the harvest; however, those who preach the gospel in this stage will receive a reward. It is not easy to lead a person to salvation, because the world is attracting people and daily occupying them. We must use all of our strength to compel others. In addition, we should never think that we will quickly lead people to salvation. If we can all practice to preach the gospel in the way of compelling, each one of us will bring at least one person to salvation every year.</p>
<p>Having a close relative who is not saved indicates that we have not devoted our time and energy to compelling people. Never look for an excuse and say that he is too superstitious to believe or that he is too hard. We should counter our excuses by compelling him to believe. Sometimes we can go and weep before our relative, at other times we can beg him, and still at other times we can go to his home and speak incessantly. No one can withstand a persistent person. As long as we are willing to bother him persistently, he will be saved. The gospel preaching in Taiwan must enter into this kind of reality. It is not sufficient for us only to invite people to come and hear the gospel. We must compel them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERY HOME AND EVERY SAINT<br />
PREACHING THE GOSPEL IN THE COMMUNITY</h2>
<p>According to the parable in Luke 14, we are in the third stage of preaching the gospel; hence, we must compel people to hear the gospel. Our preaching of the gospel should begin from the homes. Every home should preach the gospel. Currently we have small groups. When several families come together to have a small group meeting, they can bring unbelievers. We should bring our gospel friends, relatives, and friends to the small group and preach the gospel to them. After a period of time, when the small group is strong, we can preach the gospel by the homes.</p>
<p>Moreover, we should promote preaching the gospel in the community. This does not mean that the co-workers go and preach the gospel in the community, or that we invite people from different occupations to the meeting hall to hear the gospel. Rather, the elders and co-workers should receive a burden to encourage the working saints to preach the gospel. We can encourage the saints who are medical doctors, lawyers, legislators, nurses, or policemen to rise up and preach the gospel. The elders and co-workers need to kindle the spirit of the gospel in the saints and raise them up to preach the gospel to their colleagues. For instance, a brother who is a medical doctor can open his home, not to invite his relatives but to invite his colleagues and their families to his home for the gospel. The elders or co-workers also can contact the brothers who are doctors and encourage them to speak the gospel in their private clinics or in the hospitals where they work. Suppose a saint who is a legislator lives in housing appointed by the government, and his neighbors are all legislators. The elders can encourage this saint to open his home to invite his neighbors to hear the gospel. In this way we can gain some legislators and their families. The same principle can be applied to saints in any occupation.</p>
<p>The secret to promoting the gospel in the community lies in the promoters being burning, crazy, and going out to compel others. We shall compel the working saints by dragging them out one by one and bothering them until they cannot sleep peacefully unless they preach the gospel. If we are burning, we will be able to kindle others. It is not easy to make others burning. Therefore, those, especially the full-timers, who go to compel others, must be burning. Then they can go out and compel others. This is our job; every one of us must be burning for the gospel and crazy for the gospel. Since we are Christians and we cannot resign, we must go and compel others to receive the gospel. This is what the Lord has entrusted us with in the third stage of preaching the gospel.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">OFFERING MANPOWER AND FINANCES<br />
FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOSPEL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 16:9; 19:15-26; 1 Thes. 2:19-20</h1>
<p>It is a great thing to encourage the working saints to open their homes and to participate in the gospel at their work place. The increase and spread of a church is entirely dependent on its widespread preaching of the gospel. Without the widespread preaching of the gospel, the increase and spread of the church has no way to begin. If we understand that the Lord&rsquo;s heart is to cause His church to increase and spread, we will preach the gospel widely.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROMOTING THE WORKING SAINTS<br />
TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THEIR FELLOW WORKERS</h2>
<p>According to our experience, we cannot merely talk about the widespread preaching of the gospel. We must find a practical way to carry it out. First, every saint must grasp the opportunity to preach the gospel to every person they encounter. Next, we need to open our homes, just as Acts 5:42 says, &ldquo;Every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and announcing the gospel of Jesus as the Christ.&rdquo; At the time of the apostles every home preached the gospel. We are practicing the small groups so that after the small groups are established, every saint&rsquo;s home will become a gospel-preaching home.</p>
<p>We also need to encourage the saints to open their homes and concentrate on preaching the gospel to their fellow workers. This refers to the saints in different occupations, whether in schools, hospitals, businesses, factories, or government offices. This is according to God&rsquo;s sovereign authority, and it is the opportunity that God has arranged for us so that we can daily preach the gospel to our fellow workers. The church needs to promote this. The church should encourage all the saints, no matter what their occupation is, to concentrate on opening their homes and inviting their fellow workers with their spouses and relatives to come and hear the gospel. Furthermore, the saints need to learn to receive a burden for the gospel and not rely on others but to practice preaching the gospel by themselves.</p>
<p>Perhaps some might feel overwhelmed by this kind of gospel preaching and say that they cannot do it by themselves. Then the brothers responsible for promoting the community gospel should assist them. This especially applies to a saint who wants to begin preaching the gospel at his work place. It is not enough for the saint or his family to bear the responsibility alone. There is a need for others to help them. I hope that we will all be dreaming the same dream, conducting the same business, and working to produce ideas for the sake of the gospel. I hope that all the co-workers will work toward this dream. Often times I wake up in the early morning and cannot go back to sleep. While I lie in bed, I dream spiritual dreams. This is when all the business ideas for the gospel come forth.</p>
<p>It is very good that there are forty to fifty medical doctors among us. These saints should not merely have a high social status and make much money, but even more, they should preach the Lord&rsquo;s gospel. Although they are busy, we cannot deny the fact that they are saved. As long as they are saved, we should help them to fan into flame the gift within them and cause them to have a heart for the Lord. After they have a heart for the Lord, we need to help them to open their homes. This is the kind of dream I often have.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL TO BOTH OLDER PEOPLE<br />
AND CHILDREN IN THE APARTMENTS</h2>
<p>Many of the old-fashioned Japanese-style houses in Taiwan have been replaced with high-rise apartment buildings. During the day, most of the people at home in these apartments are older people whose children have grown. For this reason, the brothers responsible for the community gospel must locate all our older saints who live in these apartments. We should ask them to open their homes and preach the gospel to the older people living in their apartment building. Mobilizing our older saints will have a great influence. To gain a grandmother is to gain a household of three generations, because the grandfather will be influenced by the grandmother, and the children will be influenced by their mother. Not only so, the third generation will be influenced by the second and first generations. I have had endless dreams similar to this. If we are willing to practice this, the gospel can be promoted to all ages.</p>
<p>The older sisters who live in the apartments should preach the gospel not only to other older people in the same building but also to the children. Today every household in Taiwan focuses on the children. The parents focus on their children&rsquo;s studies and conduct because they expect the children to do well academically and be proper human beings. Hence, it is worthwhile for us to do business in the children&rsquo;s gospel. Older sisters can prepare snacks and gather the neighborhood children to their home for a children&rsquo;s meeting when the children get back from school. The sisters can teach them children&rsquo;s songs. The parents of the children will appreciate this.</p>
<p>When the older sisters sing, the children will be happy to follow and sing as well. This is one of the ways to promote the children&rsquo;s meeting and also to promote the community gospel. We can say that this is to hit two birds with one stone. Every parent likes his children to be good. After the children participate in the children&rsquo;s meetings, they become a testimony when they return to their home. Therefore, the older sisters who serve the children must believe that if we gain the children, sooner or later we will gain their parents.</p><h2 class="head1">NEEDING FULL-TIMERS TO PREACH THE GOSPEL<br />
IN THE TOWNS AND VILLAGES</h2>
<p>We need to promote every person preaching the gospel and every home preaching the gospel. We also need to promote preaching the gospel to children and in the community. Moreover, in order to evangelize Taiwan, we still need people to go out to the towns and villages. There are presently seventy-seven cities and towns in Taiwan that have a church. Every church should be concerned with more than just their own place. This means that the church in Taipei should care not only for Taipei, and the church in Tainan should care not only for Tainan. Every church must be a center for the increase and spread of the gospel. In other words, in order to evangelize the entire island of Taiwan, we must see that each local church is a center to evangelize Taiwan.</p>
<p>However, according to what we have seen and learned from the Lord, we do not want any aspect of the work to have a centralization of power. To centralize authority in one place is not according to the principle in the Bible. Therefore, we will not promote the evangelization of Taiwan in a central way. Every local church is a center for the work. There is a proverb which says that many hands make light work. For this reason, we will never carry out the evangelization of Taiwan centrally.</p>
<p>There is also a need to produce full-timers and to support their material needs. According to the basic principle in the Bible, in the Old Testament God asked His people to give one-tenth of all their produce (Deut. 14:22). We should not think that God was asking the children of Israel for only one kind of tithe. According to my own calculation from reading the Bible, there were five to six kinds of tithes. The first kind of tithe was general (Exo. 30:11-16). There was also a tithe when there was a feast and when there was a special occasion. Not only so, there were twelve tribes among the Israelites, and the one tribe, the tribe of Levi, was supported by the other tribes (Num. 18:21, 24). This means that for every twelve Israelites one was a full-timer. In the Old Testament the Levites were separated to do nothing but serve God. They had no portion in the land; they relied on the other tribes.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the Lord personally selected twelve disciples when He was on the earth. Without a doubt these ones were full-timers. According to Acts, there were about one hundred twenty people who prayed in the upper room in a house in Jerusalem. These one hundred twenty people were in one accord and had a definite part in God&rsquo;s economy. Among them twelve were full-timers. This means that one hundred eight people supported twelve full-timers, or one full-timer was supported by nine believers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Every Twenty Saints Producing One Full-timer</h2>
<p>In 1957 I visited Toronto, Canada, where there was a large group that was rather spiritual. The characteristic of that group was that it sent out many missionaries. On the average, for every twenty persons one missionary was sent out to preach the gospel. When we went to visit their chapel, we noticed that it was very clean, but the furniture and the windows and doors were rather old. The doors and windows had not been painted for at least ten years. The believers there said that they allocated most of their money to sending out missionaries. As a result, in 1958 this group sent out more missionaries than any other group in North America. We have been on the small island of Taiwan for over thirty-five years, and we still have not spread the gospel through all of Taiwan, but the Western missionaries took only two hundred years to spread the gospel from Europe and America to Africa and Asia. During the days of the Western missionaries, transportation was not as convenient as it is today. They had to cross the ocean to preach the gospel. Every time I consider this, I feel we are still so short.</p>
<p>Concerning the practice of producing full-timers, we can learn from church history. In all of Taiwan there are at least nine thousand brothers and sisters who meet regularly. According to the principle in the Old Testament, every eleven persons should support one full-timer. According to the principle in the New Testament, every nine persons should support one full-timer. According to church history, every twenty saints should produce a full-timer. After much consideration, we decided that we will follow the pattern of church history, which is that for every twenty persons there should be one full-timer. This means that nine thousand saints should produce four hundred fifty full-timers; however, we have a little under two hundred full-timers. In order to evangelize Taiwan in five years, we have to clear this debt. If we do not have one full-timer for every twenty saints, we cannot give an account to the Lord, and the Lord will not have a way among us. If we desire to advance, we must climb over this high hill.</p>
<p>I hope that during the next two years, 1985 and 1986, the number of the saints will double. We should never say that this is idealistic. This goal can be reached. One of the small groups has been established for a little over two months, and yet it has brought in forty newly saved ones. If there is a will, there is a way. If we are all willing to do our best, by the end of this year the total number of believers in Taiwan will double. It all depends on our way and our willingness to practice this new way. When our total number doubles, the percentage of full-timers should also double. We cannot be relaxed. If we want to evangelize Taiwan in five years, every year we should produce five hundred full-timers. Then in five years there will be twenty-five hundred full-timers.</p>
<p>The full-timers produced by a locality should be supported by that locality. The full-timers produced in Taipei should be supported by the church in Taipei. Those full-time brothers and sisters should take Taipei as their center and preach the gospel in the nearby areas. The full-timers produced by Taichung should take Taichung as their center and spread the gospel in the nearby towns and villages. There should be saints going out from all seventy-seven local churches to preach the gospel. In this way all seventy-seven localities will be stirred up.</p><h2 class="head2">Full-timers Not Being the Hirelings of the Church</h2>
<p>Concerning the administration of the full-time brothers and sisters, they are not directed by the elders. Acts 13:1-3 says, &ldquo;There were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers...And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them. Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.&rdquo; This portion of the Scriptures does not mention elders; it speaks only of five prophets and teachers. As they were fasting and praying, the Lord set Barnabas and Saul apart to work in the Gentile lands. In chapter 14 Paul and Barnabas returned to Antioch. We believe that the local church in Antioch must have provided for their needs on the journey.</p>
<p>Only the five prophets and teachers took part in sending out some, but the whole church supported them. When Barnabas and Saul finished their work, they returned to the church and fellowshipped with the church concerning what happened during their trip. This clearly indicates that the full-timers are not hired by the local churches. The full-timers produced by a local church are supported by that local church, but the local church does not hire them. Neither should the churches direct the full-timers. The authority to direct the full-timers rests with the co-workers in all the localities, just as it did in the church in Antioch. The prophets and teachers bore the responsibility of sending out the apostles. Hence, it is rather simple and practical to send people out. There is no need of an organization. We hope that all the saints will take action. Those who should resign from their jobs, should resign, and those who should close their shops, should close them. The saints should hand over their lives to the Lord. Whenever people are enlisted for warfare, there will be people who donate supplies. Whenever people offer their lives, there will be people who offer their money. The elders should take action by considering how to support all the full-timers. The co-workers should also bear the responsibility of equipping them.</p>
<p>When the full-time brothers and sisters go to the various towns and villages, they do not need to be involved in many activities. They should first take a look at the local situation. It is good if there are saints who can receive them; otherwise, they may rent a place. Every place the saints visit for the work will become a gospel station of the church. The full-timers should begin the work there and lead eight to ten people to salvation. Eventually, the gospel station will become a small church. All nine thousand saints who regularly meet should do their best to offer manpower and finances, and we should use the seventy-seven local churches as bases and centers to spread. Unless we are unfaithful in these matters, it will be easy to evangelize Taiwan in five years.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FAITHFUL IN MATERIAL OFFERINGS</h2>
<p>According to the teaching of the Bible concerning material offerings, every person who belongs to the Lord should regularly give one-tenth of his income as an offering. From church history and the biographies of the saints, as well as from my own experience, I can testify that whoever practices giving one-tenth of his income, according to the Lord&rsquo;s word, will never suffer loss. We should not be greedy, however, and think that if we would give the Lord a little more, He will give us more in return. If that is our thought, we are truly and genuinely &ldquo;Jacobs.&rdquo; We are all descendants of Jacob who have bargained with God. In spite of that, the Lord still remembers what we offer.</p>
<p>Throughout the centuries, every saint who gave one-tenth of their income, according to God&rsquo;s word, was blessed by God. Eventually, some will even give two-tenths or three-tenths. The more we give, the more we want to give. Even if our earnings are barely enough to meet our needs, we still must give one-tenth to the Lord. Our income may be short a little, but we will see the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>In addition to the regular giving of one-tenth, in the Old Testament there is also the giving for special occasions. After giving one-tenth, some brothers and sisters who have a higher income will have more than enough left over. These saints should not consider what they give for the construction of a large meeting hall as part of their regular giving. Some saints may think that our God extorts high taxes, because there is the first kind of tithe, a second kind of tithe, and other tithes. A person could give a tithe during the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Pentecost, and the Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets. Malachi says, &ldquo;Bring the whole tithe to the storehouse that there may be food in My house; and prove Me, if you will, by this, says Jehovah of hosts, whether I will open to you the windows of heaven and pour out blessing for you until there is no room for it&rdquo; (3:10). What we give to the Lord is merely one-tenth of our income, but the Lord opens the windows of heaven and pours out manifold blessings on us.</p>
<p>Some saints are not willing to give the Lord the one-tenth that He wants. As a result, the Lord shuts up heaven and makes heaven like bronze and the earth like iron; there is no rain from heaven and no produce on the earth. In 1958 I visited Palestine. When I saw the land there, a reverence for God welled up in my heart. This was the land that God promised would be flowing with milk and honey. A cluster of grapes produced from that land had to be carried by two people on a pole (Num. 13:23). However, what I saw outside of Jerusalem was nothing but small pebbles. The wind had blown away all the soil. The land was so arid that nothing could grow in it. The grapes produced were so small that not only was there no need for two people to carry a cluster, but one person could carry twenty clusters. Therefore, we need to fear God. Everything that the Bible says will be completely fulfilled in time. We should not bargain with God; otherwise, He will shut the windows of heaven.</p><h2 class="head2">People&rsquo;s Salvation Being Related<br />
to Our Giving of Our Money</h2>
<p>According to my knowledge of God, I would like to advise the saints not to be calculating with God. We must give one-tenth of whatever the Lord gives us as our income for His use. We should never touch this one-tenth. Besides this, whenever the Lord has a move, we need to give. In the Old Testament the basic tithe came from the produce of the land, and the additional tithes were given by the children of God according to their ability which had been measured to them by the Lord. We should never be calculating with God. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles&rdquo; (Luke 16:9). Who are these friends? They are the sinners gained through the preaching of the gospel and by the money we give.</p>
<p>We may not feel that people&rsquo;s salvation is related to our giving, but actually their salvation depends on our giving. Suppose Taiwan produces one hundred fifty full-timers who are supported by the saints. The full-timers will preach the gospel and lead thousands of people to salvation, and the newly saved believers will remember our giving in their thanksgiving to God. We may not know of it today, but when the Lord returns, these friends will come forth to welcome us. What a pleasant scene that will be!</p>
<p>Paul says that the Philippians were his joy and his crown (Phil. 4:1). In the same way, when we give money to supply the full-timers for the gospel and a person is saved through them, we can say, &ldquo;That person is my joy and my crown.&rdquo; When the Lord returns, He will settle accounts with us. Both Matthew 25 and Luke 19 reveal that the Lord will return and settle accounts with us. He will give an account of how many persons we led to salvation, and how much money we gave for the spread of the gospel from the time we were saved. Then He will give each of us what is due. This is the joy and reward of preaching the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Returning to Settle Accounts with Us</h2>
<p>In Luke 19 the Lord said to the one who gained ten minas, &ldquo;Well done, good slave. Because you have become faithful in the least, have authority over ten cities&rdquo; (v. 17). Then to the one who gained five minas He said, &ldquo;You, be over five cities&rdquo; (v. 19). But to the one who did not gain even one mina, the Lord said, &ldquo;Take the mina away from him, and give it to the one who has the ten minas...I tell you that to everyone who has, more shall be given, but from him who does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away&rdquo; (vv. 24-26). This also applies to our giving of money. There is a reward and punishment related to our use of our money. If we have surplus money and only deposit it in the bank or put it as a mortgage for a house, when the Lord returns, there will not be many people welcoming us. We should not think that we need to be cautious in our giving. If we are too cautious, we will hinder the Lord&rsquo;s business and hinder the salvation of people&rsquo;s souls. The angels are expecting people to be saved, and the Lord is also waiting for people to be saved. If we do not cooperate by giving our lives and our money, the Lord has no way to move.</p>
<p>This fellowship is not concerning fund-raising; it is the truth in practice. We cannot speak only of the first part of Luke 19, concerning the salvation of Zaccheus; we have to speak also of the second part of Luke 19, concerning one mina gaining five minas or even ten minas. If we preach the gospel, we will gain a reward, but if we do not preach the gospel, we will receive punishment. When the Lord returns, He will settle accounts with us. He will give an account of our life concerning how we used our lives and how we used the money He gave us. At that time we will not be able to say, &ldquo;Lord, I was very cautious. I put the money in the bank where it was safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us that we may be faithful in doing three things: first, to rise up to pray; second, to cooperate with the Lord&rsquo;s touching us and calling us to hand over our lives to serve full time for His move; third, to follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading concerning our money and to continually give according to the Lord&rsquo;s need without being afraid of giving too much. These are three practical things we can do according to our present situation. If every saint rises up and follows this way, we will have a great prospect of evangelizing Taiwan in five years.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE JOY AND REWARD<br />
OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 19:13-15; 21:15-16; Luke 15:7, 10; 16:9; 1 Cor. 9:16-17; 2 Tim. 3:15; Deut. 6:2, 7</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the way to preach the gospel. Stanza 1 of <em>Hymns,</em> #1068, a gospel song, says, &ldquo;In tenderness He sought me, / Weary and sick with sin, / And on His shoulders brought me / Into His flock again. / While angels in His presence sang / Until the courts of heaven rang.&rdquo; The angels sing until the courts of heaven ring because a sinner is saved. This sentence is based on Luke 15:10, which says, &ldquo;In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting.&rdquo; This is a good hymn. From the perspective of sinners, receiving God&rsquo;s salvation is an occasion that is full of warmth and affection. From the perspective of the angels, it is an occasion for singing. When we sing this hymn, we must understand the feeling of the angels.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL BEING THE PRINCIPLE OF INCARNATION</h2>
<p>The rejoicing of the angels shows that a person&rsquo;s salvation is important and that his repentance is precious. It is possible that our feeling toward a person&rsquo;s repentance and salvation does not compare to the feeling of the angels. It is also possible that the angels are jealous that the Lord did not entrust the responsibility and the blessing of preaching the gospel to them. The gospel cannot be entrusted to the angels, because the basic principle of preaching the gospel involves the principle of incarnation. God must entrust it to those who are in the flesh. The angels do not have flesh and hence cannot preach the gospel.</p>
<p>In the case of Peter going to the house of Cornelius to preach the gospel, an angel appeared to Cornelius and said, &ldquo;Now send men to Joppa and send for a certain Simon, who is surnamed Peter&rdquo; (Acts 10:5). Even though an angel appeared to Cornelius and spoke to him, the angel did not have the privilege of preaching the gospel. If I were that angel, I would have been jealous that Peter was so blessed. The angel did not have that privilege. He was not in the right position and therefore could not carry out that task. All he could do was tell Cornelius to send for Peter. Peter had the position because he was a person in the flesh.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL<br />
BEING A GREAT PRIVILEGE AND A GREAT JOY</h2>
<p>We need to see that preaching the gospel is a great privilege and a great joy. When a sinner is saved, the angels rejoice, praise, and sing in the heavens. In the Gospel of Luke it is mentioned twice that the angels rejoiced. In Luke 2 when the Lord Jesus was born, there was a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God and saying, &ldquo;Glory in the highest places to God, and on earth peace among men of His good pleasure&rdquo; (vv. 13-14). Then in chapter 15, when a sinner repents, the angels rejoice (vv. 7, 10). Christianity thinks that angels only sing Christmas carols on December 25, but the Gospel of Luke says that a sinner repenting can be compared to the Savior being born. On the day we were saved the Lord Jesus was born into our being, and the angels rejoiced and sang.</p>
<p>If we go on strike and do not preach the gospel, the angels become unemployed. The angels might say, &ldquo;We would like to sing, but there is nothing to sing about.&rdquo; We have seen many people being saved and have become accustomed to it. Hence, it seems that we are not interested, and we do not have energy for it. As a result, many saints take a leave of absence from preaching the gospel. They even go into hibernation. However, in the matter of preaching the gospel, we have been on leave long enough. We cannot hibernate any longer. Now is the time to wake up. We must all awake from our hibernation. Regardless of whether we are young or old, we should rise up, preach the gospel, and rescue souls.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING AT LEAST ONE PERSON<br />
TO SALVATION EVERY YEAR</h2>
<p>This is the time that we should devote ourselves to preaching the gospel. We should consider the Lord&rsquo;s heart as well as the feeling of the angels. The angels look forward to the salvation of sinners. We are promoting every saint and every home to preach the gospel, especially to preach the gospel in the community and even to go to the countryside. Our desire is for many more people to be led to salvation. In all of Taiwan there are at least nine to ten thousand saints who meet regularly. It should not be difficult for every one of these saints to lead one person to salvation each year. We all have relatives and friends, but are they all saved? These are not harsh words. One day the Lord will come to us and ask, &ldquo;Where are the ones that you led to salvation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke 19 shows that the salvation given to us by the Lord is our capital. The Lord has given each one of us one mina. The Lord said that we could give the money to &ldquo;the bank,&rdquo; and when He returns, He will collect the principle plus the interest (v. 23). Who is the bank? The bank consists of those whom we have led to salvation. We deposit salvation into those whom we lead to salvation, and these ones become our bank. We can continually distribute this one mina to people, and it will not be exhausted. Eventually, the one mina will gain ten minas. When we read Luke 19, we must pay attention not only to the story of Zaccheus&rsquo;s salvation but also to the story after Zaccheus obtained salvation; that is, we should distribute salvation to others. In this way, we can gain ten minas. Ten minas might not represent ten; it might be a thousand. The number ten signifies completion. When the Lord returns, He will settle accounts with His slaves. He will ask us whether we utilized His salvation to save others. Our answer will determine whether we can reign with Him when He gains His kingdom and returns to establish it on the earth. This is not our imagination but a prophecy that will be fulfilled.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE SPEAKING OF REWARD AND PUNISHMENT AS WELL AS SALVATION</h2>
<p>We believe in the Lord, and we also believe the Bible. The Bible not only speaks of salvation but also of reward and punishment. In 1 Corinthians 9:16-17 Paul says, &ldquo;If I preach the gospel, I have no boast, for necessity is laid upon me; for woe to me if I do not preach the gospel. If I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with a stewardship.&rdquo; Since my youth I did not understand what these verses meant. Why should we be in woe if we do not preach the gospel? I preached the gospel because I loved the Lord, but why would I become woeful if I did not preach the gospel? Gradually, I understood that the woe of not preaching the gospel is something negative. It refers to our losing our reward and not having a part in the kingdom with the Lord.</p>
<p>The positive aspect of our preaching the gospel is spoken of in Luke 16:9, which says, &ldquo;Make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.&rdquo; Fallen man is unrighteous, but it pleases God in His mercy to use us, the unrighteous people, to preach His gospel. Furthermore, not only has God put unrighteous money into our hand; it also pleases Him to use that unrighteous money to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>The people whom we save by preaching the gospel become our good friends. They are also our friends by means of the unrighteous mammon. If we would preach the gospel in this way, there will be many people welcoming us when the Lord returns. The people who welcome us are those who were saved through our investing of our energy and our money. Paul says in 2 Corinthians 12:15, &ldquo;I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your souls.&rdquo; Paul spent all that he had for the Corinthians, and he even spent his person, his self. The Corinthians were Paul&rsquo;s children born in Christ; they were also the friends Paul made by means of his money. When the Lord returns, these will welcome Paul. They will also be Paul&rsquo;s joy and crown. We must be honest and ask ourselves, &ldquo;How many people will welcome us when the Lord returns?&rdquo; This is not a joke. The Bible says, &ldquo;They may receive you into the eternal tabernacles&rdquo; (Luke 16:9). We should not take this matter lightly.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD JESUS DESIRING THE CHILDREN<br />
TO COME TO HIM</h2>
<p>If the heavenly host rises up to praise when one sinner is saved, we must regard the preaching of the gospel seriously. This also applies to the children, because the Lord wants the children to come to Him. In Matthew 19 some children were brought to see Jesus that He might lay His hands on them. When the disciples rebuked them, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Allow the little children and do not prevent them from coming to Me, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens&rdquo; (v. 14). The Lord did not refuse the children from coming to Him; He also laid hands on them and blessed them.</p>
<p>In chapter 21 the Lord Jesus went into Jerusalem for the last time, and the city was filled with people welcoming Him. The chief priests and the scribes knew the Bible, but they did not welcome the Lord. However, the children were singing and rejoicing, crying out, &ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David&rdquo; (v. 15). The children who cried out were very young, because in the next verse the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Out of the mouth of infants and sucklings You have perfected praise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2 Timothy 3:15 Paul says to Timothy, &ldquo;From a babe you have known the sacred writings.&rdquo; Paul says that Timothy knew the Bible since he was a babe. I believe that when Timothy&rsquo;s mother was feeding him, she must have been speaking the Bible to him. The faith in Timothy came from his mother and his grandmother (1:5). Even the Old Testament says, &ldquo;Fear Jehovah your God and keep all His statutes and His commandments, which I am commanding you, you and your son and your grandson, all the days of your life; and that your days may be extended&rdquo; (Deut. 6:2). God commanded the children of Israel to speak the law to their children (v. 7a).</p>
<p>How many children are there in our church life? A brother said that we have less children than what we had twenty years ago, because there are fewer children in each household. However, in some churches the number of children in the children&rsquo;s meeting is larger than the number of saints in the meeting. We should not depend only on the saints&rsquo; children; there are children everywhere. We can also gain the children of unbelieving families for the Lord. In order to lead children to the Lord, we must take care of the children&rsquo;s meeting; this includes the matter of teachers. In the past most of the shepherds for the children&rsquo;s meetings were mainly the saints in high school and college, but there is now a great shortage of teachers for the children&rsquo;s meetings. We need to consider this.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERY SAINT AND EVERY HOME INVOLVED<br />
IN THE COMMUNITY GOSPEL<br />
AND IN THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>Concerning preaching the gospel, the church in Taipei is not at a low ebb but on the rise; that is, the tide is rising on the matter of preaching the gospel. We do not agree that we only pay attention to the meetings. We should also pay attention to how many people we have brought to salvation. Hence, each of us must set aside some time to visit our relatives and friends. It is better for us to sacrifice a few meetings and use that time to visit people and lead them to salvation. If the person we visit does not believe today, we can visit him again next week and continue visiting him until he is saved. Then all the angels in heaven will rejoice.</p>
<p>We should consider what will make the angels rejoice: our attending all the meetings or our leading some to salvation. May we all receive this burden. The church should be a church that saves sinners. On the day of Pentecost the Lord added newly saved ones to His church, and all the saved ones announced the gospel of Jesus from house to house. We should have such an atmosphere among us. The older sisters can open their homes and preach the gospel to their neighbors who are available during the day. They can also invite children to their homes for a children&rsquo;s meeting in the afternoon. The sisters can prepare some snacks for the children and tell them stories. If we would carry this out, the Lord will remember us.</p>
<p>Concerning going to the countryside to spread the gospel, we must be clear that there is no organization among us; neither is there any centralized power, or even any organized move. Every saint among us must open to the Lord and receive His leading. We need not wait for one another, nor do we need to move unanimously. As long as there are two or three, they can proceed. Please pray for this. We hope that the spirit of every saint will be kindled so that all the homes and all the saints are preaching the gospel in the community, to their colleagues, in the countryside, and to the children. We must not take the children lightly. All the verses from the Bible that my mother read to me when I was a child have remained in me to this day. These verses are seeds. We should speak the Lord&rsquo;s word, grace, salvation, and gospel to our offspring and to other children. When other children are brought in, their parents will follow. May we all receive this burden.</p>
<p>We look to the Lord to encourage all the saints to rise up. May the Lord kindle a fire in the ten thousand saints who meet regularly so that every saint will have the spirit of the gospel. The way of the gospel involves everyone preaching the gospel, every home preaching the gospel, the saints in all walks of life preaching the gospel to their colleagues, and the saints preaching the gospel in the countryside and among the children.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">TRAINING FOR THE MEMBERS<br />
IN THE SMALL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we ask You to remember us as we are here for Your recovery. By Your precious blood and through You as our sin offering and trespass offering, we enter into Your presence. We confess that we are still weak and full of failures and that we are lacking in many ways. We still live on this earth and in this flesh, and we are contaminated in many aspects. We are indebted to You for Your grace, Your mercy, and Your glory, but Your mercy is exhaustless and never ceases. For this reason, we are still in Your recovery.</p>
<p>Lord, cleanse our conscience, our mind, and our feeling so that our inner being is bright. We truly desire to have fellowship with You in the light so that each one of us departs from darkness and so that we speak in the light, listen in the light, and receive in the light. Dispense more of Yourself into us. We only want You. Lord, we are willing to enter into Your burden. We are here because we want to receive a new burden from You.</p>
<p>We offer praise and thanks from the depth of our being, because we are Your treasure. We receive Your grace, and we have been Your continuation for the past thirty-six years. Lord, we look to You to give us grace that we may enter into another stage and that we may sense that a new age has begun. We want to enjoy new grace and experience new riches of Christ. Cause all of us to see, to understand, and to enter into a new realm. Cause the trumpet of Your recovery to sound stronger. How we desire to see Babylon fall down. Build up Your Body and build up Your testimony on the island of Taiwan! We give You the glory. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EACH MEMBER SHOWING CONCERN<br />
AND HAVING A BURDEN</h2>
<p>There are close to thirteen hundred brothers and sisters participating in this training for the members in the small groups. These saints are the fruit of the past thirty-six years of our labor on the island of Taiwan. This is a fulfillment of Isaiah 53:11, which says, &ldquo;He will see the fruit of the travail of His soul, / And He will be satisfied.&rdquo; After the Lord resurrected from the dead, He saw the fruit of His labor and He was satisfied. We also are satisfied by seeing the fruit of our labor. This gathering is a revival meeting, and the reviving factor is the small groups. We must labor in the small groups, and we must work out a way for the small groups.</p>
<p>For the construction of any building there must be a solid foundation. If the foundation is not solid, the building will not be strong. According to our fellowship and the report from the brothers, the ones participating in this training for the small groups are concerned and burdened about the small groups. Praise the Lord that He has gained thirteen hundred members who are each concerned, eager, capable, and have a sense of responsibility.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being One with the Lord and<br />
Cooperating with His Move</h2>
<p>In the beginning of August 1949, when we began the labor in Taipei, three or four hundred brothers and sisters were gained quickly. However, they were the old churchgoers from mainland China. Because the denominations they belonged to had not yet moved to Taiwan, they were temporarily homeless, and therefore came when they saw our meeting hall. The thirteen hundred members, however, are different. These saints are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and are concerned about the recovery. They have a burden and are experienced. We can say that these are family members. For years we have been bathed in the Lord&rsquo;s grace, and now our heart is moved by His grace. We can even say, &ldquo;Lord, whatever You need, we are willing to give ourselves to You. Because You have given everything to us, we now want to give everything to You.&rdquo; This is the feeling of each one of us. The Lord is happy to see so many people who are one with Him and are cooperating with His move.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Every Person Brought In through the Small Groups<br />
Knowing How to Function</h2>
<p>Currently there are over three hundred sixty small groups in Taipei. If the thirteen hundred saints were evenly divided, each small group would have three to four persons. Initially, many of us were very worried about how to lead the small groups. Even though the burden for taking care of the twenty-one meeting halls was heavy, we were increasing from twenty-one areas in which we labor to three hundred sixty. If the thirteen hundred saints can be brought into function, all our worries can be laid aside.</p>
<p>Through much consideration I studied once again all the portions concerning Christian meetings in the New Testament and saw that there is a distinction between large and small meetings. In order for an airplane to be steady when it flies, both wings are needed. We cannot fly an airplane with only one wing. In the past we relied on the big meetings, which was like relying on one wing to fly an airplane. Now we want to stress both the small groups and the big meetings. From the day of Pentecost, when the church was produced, the disciples met in the temple as well as from house to house. This shows that the practice of small groups is according to the Bible. The history of the church also confirms that small groups are the most effective way to bring in new ones and to uphold them. All the people brought in through the small groups grow up in the small groups, and they do not need to be prodded to function. They know how to function. In this way every new one becomes a responsible one because the atmosphere in the small group causes every member to exercise his function.</p>
<p>After many years of studying, we discovered that it takes a great effort to encourage one saint in a traditional gathering to open his mouth and function in the meeting. He might even stop meeting and complain, saying, &ldquo;It is most difficult to worship in your meeting hall. When I go to another place for Sunday worship, I can sit and enjoy their service. People sing for me, pray for me, speak a message for me, and bless me. I do not need to do anything.&rdquo; We need to see that it is wrong to bring people to the big meetings and ask them to share and fellowship. This can be compared to asking a person who is born and raised in Shantung province to speak Cantonese. We are asking too much of him. If we want him to speak Cantonese, we need to send him to live in Hong Kong. Then there is no need to force him. As long as he lives there for a period of time, he will be able to speak Cantonese fluently. After we lead people to salvation, we should bring them to the small group meetings where there is the atmosphere of each member exercising his function and responsibility. After participating in the small group a few times, the new one will spontaneously exercise his function and responsibility.</p><h2 class="head1">A MEETING NEEDING THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD<br />
IN ORDER TO BE STRONG, LIVING, HIGH, AND RICH</h2>
<p>We have all been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for quite some time, but we do not know how to lead the small groups. A person who receives a complete education spends a couple of years in preschool, six years in primary school, three years in junior high, another three years in high school, and then four years in college. They spend eighteen years getting an education. Many of us, however, have been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery longer than eighteen years. If three of us are in a small group, we should be able to lead the meeting. After years of experience we know that in order for a meeting to be rich, strong, living, and high, there must be the Lord&rsquo;s word. Once we have the Lord&rsquo;s word, a meeting will be uplifted, living, and rich. It will not be boring.</p>
<p>In order to have the Lord&rsquo;s living word, we can use the Life-studies. Every one of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament has been opened and edited into messages. We can use one Life-study message per week in three ways. The saints can read a message in the meeting hall or at home during morning revival time. They can also read a message in the small group meeting. In addition, the main points and an outline of the same message can be released in the big meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. It may seem that we are covering only one message a week at a slow pace, but we are actually covering fifty-two messages in one year.</p>
<p>In the long run, in one year all the saints who attend the meetings, whether the big meeting or the small group meeting, will enter into fifty-two messages that are based on the Bible. In two years they will have read more than a hundred messages and in four years more than two hundred messages. Two hundred messages will produce an effect on the saints. A small group entering into the content of the Life-studies can be compared to the members of the group preparing a meal to eat, or to their speaking and listening to a message by themselves. Many points will be worked into their being through week after week of this way of accumulation. Not only will the members receive the supply, but it will also be an example for others. When the children in our homes see us get into the Life-study messages, they will do the same. The small groups are the most effective way to uphold the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SMALL GROUP<br />
HAVING THE BEST ABILITY TO INCREASE</h2>
<p>Suppose there are eight members in a small group, and they read a Life-study when they come together. Every week they can read half a message in the small group meeting and read the other half after the table meeting. After two or three months, if the number in the group increases, they can split to form a new group. In this way there will be two small groups. In the small group everyone can read, speak, and pray. If we practice this for months and years, the multiplying ability of the small group will be very high, and everyone will be strong and will know how to deal with the enemy. We all need a clear view of this goal. Practicing the small groups will bring in a great result.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with only eight persons in a small group the absence of a brother or a sister is easily noticed by others. Then some saints will go and visit the saint who was absent, and he will be strengthened. A brother who has encountered a difficult situation will be supplied when the brothers visit him. If this brother needs financial help, the brothers can put something in the offering box to render support and supply to him. The church will be built up with such mutual care and support. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day when everyone comes together, the taste of the meeting will be different. Since everyone has been built up through the fellowship in the small group and there is one accord among them, no one will be lost. Even if a person is lost, he will be recovered quickly and brought back through the timely supply. The practice of the small groups causes all the saints to have a mutual concern for others. The benefits of the small group are numerous.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;COOKING AND EATING&rdquo; IN THE SMALL GROUP</h2>
<p>We need to pay attention to several points concerning how to use the Life-studies. We should not read through a message without stopping. When we come to a crucial point, we should repeat it, and someone in the group can point out the importance. After reading the message, a brother can pray or give a testimony. Then the saints can sing a hymn. The small group should not be led by one person; everyone should function. Everyone in the small group should learn to cook, that is, to prepare food. Furthermore, we do not wait until we have finished cooking before we eat. We eat while we are cooking. The small group is a dining room as well as a kitchen. We can &ldquo;cook&rdquo; and &ldquo;eat&rdquo; there. This makes the small group full of enjoyment.</p>
<p>We need to read the important sections with emphasis. We also need to give testimonies and pray. We hope that in the small groups no one will speak too much. A person who speaks too much will become &ldquo;Mr. Do-it-all.&rdquo; The crucial points in the Life-studies need to be pointed out; the sisters can also do this. The Life-study reading, the testimonies, the singing, and the prayer make the meeting living and rich.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HEAVEN AND EARTH PASSING AWAY,<br />
BUT NOT SKIPPING THE SMALL GROUP MEETING</h2>
<p>Heaven and earth can pass away, but the small group meeting must not be skipped. We can forget about eating and sleeping, but we cannot forget about the small group meeting. If there is a meeting, none of us should miss it. If we are in a meeting, we must read something, and if we read something, we will also speak it. If we speak in the meeting, we will also pray, and if we pray, we will also give a testimony. We must consider the small group meeting to be more important than anything else. Each one of us should attend a small group meeting every week. There is no exception even if we are not feeling well. There are fifty-two weeks in a year, and the small group should meet every week. If we practice this, I guarantee that we will grow in life, and we will shine. Furthermore, we will have the rich truths to supply others at any time. In this way, the Lord will have an outlet.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYER</h2>
<p>Lord, our heart is full of joy and happiness. We praise You that You have gained us. We call heaven and earth to be our witnesses that from today onward we will praise You and pray every day. We will also attend the small group meeting every week. Lord, we pray that You will bless the small group meetings, bless everyone who attends them, and bless everyone who makes a vow in Your presence. We look forward to seeing the results of these vows in eternity. Bless all the brothers and sisters, bless their homes and their children, and bless all the young brothers and sisters with their studies and their jobs. Make us prosper materially, spiritually, and mentally so that others may see that we are Your living witnesses.</p>
<p>Lord, we want You to be expressed through us. We pray that You can have a way among us. Glorify Your name. Lord, evangelize Taiwan in five years so that every village may have the gospel and the church. May all the glory be to the One who is seated on the throne forever and ever. Amen.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>

<p>It is very profitable to use the Life-study messages in the small groups. I am full of confidence that the <em>Life-study of Galatians</em> is not only useful but also timely medicine. Some of the saints know how to meet in a small group and some do not. We are not able to do things with our natural man. Take playing the piano as an example. Everyone can make sounds on the piano, but it is not easy to play music. Those who can play the piano know that it requires much practice. Therefore, I hope that we all will have an attitude to learn how to use the Life-study messages in the small groups. Otherwise, even though it is not difficult, we will not learn how to use them. As long as we are willing to learn, we will succeed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE LEAD OUT OF BURDEN<br />
AND NOT OUT OF ARRANGEMENT</h2>
<p>There are over one thousand brothers and sisters in this training. The church in Taipei now has around three hundred sixty small groups, and each small group can have at least three to four saints in this training. These three or four saints are members who care for the group and are burdened and experienced. According to man, there is no leader in this arrangement. In the Bible the Lord Jesus appointed twelve apostles, but He did not appoint a chief apostle among them. In Acts 6 the church appointed seven brothers to serve food, but there was no chief serving brother among them (v. 3). Deacons and elders were appointed in the New Testament, but there is no record of a chief deacon or chief elder (14:23). Similarly, in every small group, there are members, but no one is appointed by anyone to lead. This can be compared to a family with eight children. There is no need to designate who is the eldest or who is the youngest, because everyone knows. There is no need to appoint anyone. In a family with many children, the cleverest child is often not the oldest but the second oldest. Therefore, the leader among the children is not necessarily the oldest but perhaps the second oldest.</p>
<p>Recently I went to a small group meeting that did not have a leader. When the meeting began, not many people were present. After a few minutes, a brother asked about a brother who was not present. After a few minutes he asked again. I realized that he was a real responsible one. I also saw an eighty-year-old brother who was ushering with a respectful attitude. I felt that he was the best usher. If the meeting were held in the meeting hall, no one would arrange for such an old brother to be an usher, but when the small group meeting was in his home, he was a ready usher.</p>
<p>There were five family members in the home where we met: the older parents, the son and daughter-in-law, and the grandson. In the past the son did not meet regularly, but now that he had a small group meeting, he was stirred up to invite and bring people. After a while a sister arrived. She testified that she had not been to a meeting for many years but was now recovered by the small group. By sharing in this way, she became the best leader of the meeting, and she was appropriate. It is good that we did not arrange for any leader in the small groups. If a leader was appointed, the father, mother, son, and daughter-in-law, thinking that the church would send a person to lead the meeting, would at best clean their house, get it ready for the meeting, and then retreat to their rooms.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING THE LIFE-STUDIES<br />
TO ENRICH THE CONTENT OF THE MEETING</h2>
<p>There were more than ten persons in that small group, including the gospel friends and those who had not met for a while. Spontaneously, the gospel was preached, and it was full of taste. At the end of the meeting another brother arrived and apologized for being late. Right away the other brothers invited him to come and fellowship. The small group was truly full of flavor. Every member complemented another&rsquo;s shortage, and they all functioned. This kind of functioning is impossible to work out in a large meeting. Hence, we do not need to feel disappointed; rather, we must drop our prejudice and give up our opinion. The Lord is leading us this way, and I hope that we can all follow.</p>
<p>The small group meeting may be simple and spontaneous, but the content is very important. How do we enrich the content of a small group meeting? The way to enrich it is to use the Life-study messages. We can divide the messages into two portions. The first half can be used in the small groups and the second half after the table meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>For example, Message 2 of the <em>Life-study of Galatians</em> is entitled &ldquo;The Apostle&rsquo;s Gospel.&rdquo; This message says that Matthew&rsquo;s gospel is the gospel of the kingdom, John&rsquo;s gospel is the gospel of life, Luke&rsquo;s gospel is the gospel of the forgiveness of sins, Mark&rsquo;s gospel is the gospel of service, and Paul&rsquo;s gospel is the gospel of completion. The message goes on to show that Paul&rsquo;s gospel speaks of Christ being five matters to us. Christ is in us as the hope of glory (Col. 1:27), Christ lives in us (Gal. 2:20), Christ is being formed in us (4:19), Christ is making His home in us (Eph. 3:17), and we are being filled with Christ to be the fullness of God (v. 19). All these points are excellent for the content of a meeting. We need to practice speaking these points in the small group.</p>
<p>We should never think that those who come for the first time will not understand what we are talking about. We must believe that they can understand. Little children learn to speak by listening, and gradually they understand everything. In our meetings we are using the heavenly language and speaking heavenly words. You speak to me, and I speak to you. Eventually everyone will learn to say, &ldquo;Christ is in us as the hope of glory.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">Reading the Life-study Message and<br />
Praying Before the Meeting</h2>
<p>If we desire the small group meeting to be enjoyable, we need to be faithful to use the Life-studies. Whenever we come to a crucial point in the Life-study message, we should repeat it. Every one of us should learn to lead the small group and should focus on the crucial points in each Life-study message. Do not worry that others will not understand. We should continue to speak. We should speak on the second message of the <em>Life-study of Galatians</em> until everyone can say that the crucial points of Paul&rsquo;s gospel are Christ is in us as the hope of glory, Christ is living in us, Christ is being formed in us, Christ is making His home in us, and we are being filled with Christ to become the fullness of God.</p>
<p>The key to the success of the small group meeting depends on whether we follow this method. As long as we have no doubts, we will see the riches in the Lord&rsquo;s word and understand that this is the right way. In both the small group meeting and the time after the table meeting, we can read half a Life-study message. In one year every saint will be supplied, be clear in the truth, grow in life, bear fruit, and multiply. We must focus on this way. Heaven and earth may pass away, but the small group meeting must never be forsaken. Not only should we be diligent to go to the small group meetings, but we should bring others to the small group. We should try our best to recover those who have not been meeting for a long time, and we should bring our unbelieving relatives and friends. We can use the Life-study message that we are reading to speak a simple gospel. We should believe that the Holy Spirit will operate through our speaking.</p>
<p>Every week, beginning from Monday, we should read a portion of the Life-study message every day. Then by the time of the small group meeting we will be very familiar with the content of each section in the message. However, before the meeting we need to pray in order to prepare our spirit by asking the Lord to fill our spirit, strengthen our spirit, and make our spirit strong and bright. We should also ask the Lord for utterance and pray for the meeting. If we can all exercise in this way, the small group meeting will be strong.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR SPEAKING NOT BEING LONG AND<br />
UNRELATED TO THE MEETING</h2>
<p>Furthermore, in the small group meeting our speaking should not be long. Speaking for a long time kills the meeting. A long testimony kills the meeting, and a long prayer kills the meeting. A small group is a &ldquo;small&rdquo; group in which everything should be simple and short. A young person is usually not verbose and long-winded. It is often the older ones who cannot stop speaking even though they speak out of concern and love and want to explain things so that others understand. Please remember not to be long-winded. When we are long-winded, it is difficult for others to tolerate it, and their interest is killed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE LIFE-STUDY<br />
AS THE CENTRAL LINE, THE CENTER</h2>
<p>In the small group meeting we should take the Life-study messages as the central line. We should not bring in any other things, speak of unrelated matters, or repeat the old stories of our salvation. We do not need to speak about other subjects. Other people want to hear words that are concerning Christ being revealed in us, living in us, making His home in us, filling us, and making us the fullness of God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the small group meeting the &ldquo;ball&rdquo; should be passed around, and everyone should learn to pick up the ball and pass it. If everyone does not bear the responsibility to participate, we should not blame a person who speaks too long. Some saints speak too long because we do not open our mouths. We all must be diligent to learn how to have a good small group meeting. This is our only way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">TRAINING FOR THE MEMBERS<br />
IN THE SMALL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we praise You for revealing Yourself in us and for living in us. What a life, what a peace, what a joy, and what a rest! Grant all Your children to be brought into a real experience of You, eating You every day, being mingled with You, living by You, enjoying You, and allowing You to enjoy us. Lord, we look to You again. As the Lord of our life in the church, we pray that You would lead us, supply us, and encourage us.</p>
<p>I believe that now all the brothers and sisters have seen that the small group is the way to build up the church, the way to gain people, the way to shepherd others, and the way for mutual care. Not only so, the small group is also the way to uphold the saints and to equip and perfect the saints in the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ESTABLISHING THE SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>I hope that we all see the importance of the small groups: it is the way of the Lord today. If we do not go forward on this way, there is no other way that we can take, because this is truly the way of the Lord. However, this does not mean that blessings will be poured out instantly from heaven. We still need much more practice. We must have the sober feeling that only success is allowed, not failure. We must have faith. As long as we are willing to give ourselves to this endeavor, we will succeed. As long as we are willing to learn, we will succeed. During our fellowship, Brother Lee has reminded us on many occasions that the main reason for the lack of results in our service is that we are not willing to learn and to make progress. When we encounter a problem, we complain that this way does not work. Since we have an attitude that the way will not succeed, we want to give it up. Nothing that is of value is easy to do. If we are willing to face the difficulties we encounter, we will succeed, and if we are willing to labor, we will reap a harvest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WHOLE CHURCH EMPHASIZING<br />
THE SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>Establishing the small groups is not only a change of method but also a change of system. In the past, one person spoke and the rest listened, but now everyone is speaking, everyone is pursuing, and everyone is preaching the gospel. This is a change of system. The small groups provide a venue for the saints in the church who have a heart to serve. It gives them the opportunity to exercise their organic function. We want the Body of Christ to be expressed on the earth, but it is not easy to arrive at this point. In a big meeting it is not easy for the saints to function according to their portion. However, in a small group everyone has an opportunity to practice. Therefore, in the service of the small groups we must be active, and we must be concerned, burdened, and willing to exercise our portion.</p>
<p>From now on we need to pay attention to the following points. First, the atmosphere in the church must emphasize the small groups. Such an atmosphere comes from fellowship. This means that we need to consider this matter in our hearts all the time and that we need to speak about it. We all need to see the importance of the small groups and that the small groups are the way for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to change the system so that everyone can function to express the Lord&rsquo;s Body. If we speak of this in private as well as in public, eventually an atmosphere that supports our speaking will spontaneously be formed in the church. To this end, the members must give themselves to enable the whole church to see the importance of the small groups.</p>
<p>Second, we should participate in the small groups every week, unless it is absolutely unavoidable. Do not forsake the small group meetings because of trivial things. Third, we should be prepared to get into the Life-study messages. We can use the time during morning watch or another time to enjoy the message and to touch the revelation, the sweetness, and the light in the message. If we store these in us, we will be enriched when we go to supply others.</p>
<p>Fourth, in a small group meeting it is crucial that we do not speak for too long. Every member in a small group should not speak too long. Being long-winded kills the meeting, because others become tired and begin to look down. Whenever the saints begin to look down, we should stop speaking. We should practice taking turns to speak. Then every person can speak several times, but we must not speak too much at one time.</p>
<p>Finally, after every small group meeting, there should be some review and consideration in fellowship. Without such a review, there will be no progress. Those who are burdened for the progress of the small group should be willing to speak truthfully in love to one another. There should be an open atmosphere so that no one would take offense with another. If there is a review after a meeting, it will be beneficial, and if we review regularly, there will be regular progress.</p>
<p>If no new ones are added to a small group after several weeks, it is not progressing as it should. The crucial key to the progress of a small group is the continual addition of new ones. The regular addition of new ones to a meeting indicates that the small group is in a constantly new condition. A small group should never reach the stage where only a fixed number of saints meet regularly. If a new one is added every two weeks, there will be a sizable increase in the church each month. Now our progress is very slow. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we promote the small groups, recover the saints who have not been meeting, and preach the gospel to bring in new ones.</p><h2 class="head1">EVERYONE PRACTICING THE SEVEN WAYS<br />
OF READING THE LIFE-STUDIES</h2>
<p>Whether a meeting is good or bad is not determined by a method but by whether we enjoy the Lord. After each meeting we must ask ourselves whether the Lord&rsquo;s word was opened to us and whether we touched the riches in His word. If the Lord&rsquo;s word was not opened to us and we did not touch the riches in His word, then we need to reconsider what profits us. We should use these two points as our criteria when we review our meetings.</p>
<p>Brother Lee has given us seven ways to read the Life-studies in a small group: reading a short portion, reading with expression, reading with emphasis, reading in a living way, reading with explanation, reading with prayer, and reading with songs. Everyone in the small group should read a short portion. When we read a long portion, it is difficult for others to join in. We should also repeat any crucial phrase or sentence. Even if someone has already read it, we can read it again, and the whole group can repeat it together. If someone feels that a certain phrase is important, he can read it with emphasis. This calls everyone&rsquo;s attention to the phrase. To read with emphasis is to deepen and strengthen our feeling toward the text. One person may emphasize one phrase, and another may emphasize a different phrase. When all the phrases are put together, the message becomes very rich.</p>
<p>We can also read the message in a living way. Reading in a living way requires the person who reads to be living. To read in a living way is to read with much expression so that others touch the Lord&rsquo;s living word. To read with explanation is to explain the meaning of the text so that others may understand. To read with prayer is to turn the text we read into prayer, and to read with songs is to use the crucial words to compose a song or to use a familiar tune to sing the words. This deepens our impression. It is easier to remember the text if we sing it a few times. Initially, these seven ways of reading the Life-studies may not feel spontaneous to us, but because there are few people in a group, if we practice, we can enjoy the riches in the word.</p>
<p>(Spoken by Liu Suey)</p>
<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING SEVEN THINGS<br />
WHILE READING THE LIFE-STUDIES</h2>
<p>In addition to paying attention to the development of the small groups so that they become the key to spreading and transmitting the truth, there are also seven things that all the saints should exercise to avoid.</p>
<p>First, we should not wait for someone to read. Rather than just beginning and joining in, we often wait for someone else to read, but they are waiting for someone else to read as well. When no one speaks, the small group cannot move. Therefore, we should not wait for one another.</p>
<p>Second, we should not attack others. In our reading we should not emphasize a phrase in a way that attacks others. Doing this embarrasses others, and they will not come the next time.</p>
<p>Third, we should not trouble others. It is difficult for some people to open their mouths due to their disposition. We should not force them to speak. This will trouble them, and they may not want to come again.</p>
<p>Fourth, we should not argue over terms. Some people like to ask questions and are even insistent. We should not engage in any argument with them. When a small group meeting enters into an argument, the spirit leaves. If a person asks a question that is bound to arouse an argument, instead of replying, it is best to smile and to refocus on the subject. We should also indicate our willingness to speak with him at a later time to respond to his question.</p>
<p>Fifth, we should not lecture and give orders. We should never use strong words as a stick to beat others or criticize them. For example, there may be a sentence in the message about Christianity or Catholicism. We should read it without using it as a pretext to criticize others.</p>
<p>Sixth, we should not do everything by ourselves. Some of us may feel so burdened that we read the Life-study message in all seven ways by ourselves. This hinders and even robs others of the opportunity to function.</p>
<p>Seventh, we should not be inflexible. We do not have to use a song to begin every meeting. To do so is to be inflexible.</p>
<p>As a conclusion, do not wait for each other, do not attack others, do not cause others trouble, do not argue over terms, do not lecture or give orders, do not do everything by yourself, and do not be inflexible. We should try our best to avoid these points in our practice of the small groups.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PAYING ATTENTION TO SEVEN POSITIVE PRACTICES</h2>
<p>After looking at seven things that we should avoid, we should now look at seven positive factors. First, we need to recognize the operation of the Holy Spirit. If we desire to read the message and bring it to life in the small group, we must recognize the operation of the Holy Spirit in the meeting. We need to know what the Holy Spirit has touched through the reading and then follow the leading of the Holy Spirit to speak. Even though we need to read from the message, we should be flexible and not rigid. In short, our spirit must be living, and we must recognize the operation of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Second, we need to be keen to sense others&rsquo; reactions. We should be able to tell from a person&rsquo;s facial expression whether he understands what he is reading. If we see that a person&rsquo;s expression or eyes indicate that he is confused, we need to explain the reading. Do not be afraid to do this. We must minister the word to others.</p>
<p>Third, we must learn to be flexible in using the hymns. Hymns are the best way to open people&rsquo;s hearts. We must also be flexible in selecting a hymn. There is no need to sing from the beginning to the end of a hymn, nor is it good to sing only stanza 1. We can select two or three stanzas according to the situation of the meeting. The new ones may not understand many terms in the hymns, so we need to explain the terms so that the new ones can understand and thus enter into the feeling of the hymn.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must pay attention to the actual needs of others. If we know that a brother in our small group is feeling down, we should pay attention to his reaction to the message and care for his inward need. At an appropriate time we should expound the reading to meet his real situation. In this way he will receive the help to deal with his circumstances. All the words in the Life-studies are able to meet our practical needs.</p>
<p>Fifth, we should apply God&rsquo;s word appropriately. All the words in the Life-studies come from the Bible. Hence, we should learn to bring people, especially the new ones, back to the Bible, to the Lord&rsquo;s word. We need to lead the new ones to find the appropriate verses in the Bible and to read the verses so that they realize the source of the words in the Life-studies.</p>
<p>Sixth, we should give testimonies from our experience. We should not be rigid when we apply God&rsquo;s word and use it in a living way. We should avoid abstract talk and give practical testimonies. Suppose we speak concerning the Son of God&mdash;a living person. To explain how He is a living person to us and how we can experience Him as a living Lord in our daily life require that we share our practical experiences. Then we can minister the word to others in a fresh way. As much as possible, we should give testimonies from our experience and not speak in the way of preaching.</p>
<p>Seventh, we should encourage the new ones to open their mouths. We must not make it difficult for them, but we must encourage them to speak. To open one&rsquo;s mouth does not necessarily mean that he should be loud when he releases his spirit. In a small group there may be some believers who have not met for over twenty years and some gospel friends who have been to only a few meetings. They might not be loud when they release their spirit. In principle, in every small group meeting we should make sure that everyone opens his mouth at least once. If a person finds it hard to open his mouth, someone can read with him. We can ask, &ldquo;Is it okay for us to read this section together?&rdquo; Once he opens his mouth, it will influence him. He will have a sense of participating in the meeting, which is totally different from what he would feel if he had never opened his mouth.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the seven positive practices include recognizing the operation of the Holy Spirit, being keen to sense others&rsquo; reactions, being flexible in using the hymns in a living way, paying attention to the actual needs of others, applying God&rsquo;s word appropriately, giving testimonies from our experience, and encouraging the new ones to open their mouth. These items are a matter of practice and skill. We should not be casual and careless in the meeting. In every meeting we need to strike the crucial points, and we need to work the riches into others.</p><h2 class="head1">TEN DEADENING FACTORS TO THE SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>I have observed that some small groups are going on strongly, but others are not doing so well. I have studied this situation with some brothers, and we came up with ten factors that deaden a small group. A small group that suffers from one of these ten factors will fall into a deadened situation.</p>
<p>First, if a meeting is too long or drags on it becomes deadened. There is a common fault among the saints who meet regularly. One saint may feel that a point has not been covered sufficiently. Fearing that others might not be clear, he takes five minutes to strengthen the point. Then another saint feels that the point is still not complete and something needs to be added. In this way the meeting drags on, and the spirit of the meeting collapses and dies. Although explanations are necessary, as long as the main points are stated, there is no need to repeatedly add explanations until the meeting cannot be rescued.</p>
<p>Second, a meeting will be deadened if it is disorganized and without focus. Every Life-study message has a subject. We need to grasp the subject, speak it strongly, and then conclude with it so that every person in the meeting knows the content of the message. We should never allow small details to distract us. When the saints do not know the subject, the meeting will become disorganized and without focus.</p>
<p>Third, a meeting will be deadened by the spread of gossip and the stirring up of discord. After meeting for a while, the saints become familiar with each other, and it is easy to chat about different things that can stir up gossip and discord. The small group should be a place that supplies life. When the saints begin to gossip, the small group becomes a place to spread germs. We must ensure that no gossip originates from our meetings. Otherwise, the gossip will be passed on to another person in another small group, and eventually the entire church will be contaminated.</p>
<p>Fourth, a meeting will be deadened if a person gives a message and the rest criticize. When a person continually expresses his feeling or his view, others may not interrupt him, but inwardly they will criticize him. Because we have heard many messages, we have become experts in critiquing. We should avoid this. In a small group it is best that no one gives a message or criticizes.</p>
<p>Fifth, a meeting will be deadened if the meeting is inflexible and routine. When we do not care whether or not the saints enjoy reading the message but instead insist on covering the message according to a schedule, we are not flexible.</p>
<p>Sixth, a meeting will be deadened if the meeting is full of anecdotes and reminiscences. A person may appear to be using the Life-study, but he is actually recounting an event that occurred many years ago. It is rather easy for those who have been saved for many years to tell stories. In principle, it is best to share a new experience. In other words, we should speak about our recent enjoyment of the Lord over the past week. This surely will bring a fresh feeling to others.</p>
<p>Seventh, a meeting will be deadened if the saints talk freely and express the self. Some brothers and sisters have no opportunity to speak in the big meetings and grasp the opportunity in the small group meeting to talk freely and express themselves. This causes others to lose interest. The saints come to the group meeting because they desire to obtain God&rsquo;s word. They are not interested in other things.</p>
<p>Eighth, a meeting will be deadened if the saints make extravagant food and strive to have the best love feast. In the small groups we are enjoying the Lord&rsquo;s word; we are not competing for the best snacks. Eating and drinking are not the purpose of the small group. If we always strive to make better snacks, we have confused the aim with the means. Snacks in the small groups should not be forbidden, but snacks are not our focus.</p>
<p>Ninth, a meeting will be deadened if the saints solicit business or borrow money in the small groups. We should never use the small groups to solicit business or to sell merchandise. The saints are not our customers. When such a situation arises, it must be stopped.</p>
<p>Tenth, a meeting will be deadened if there is no preaching of the gospel or no new ones in the small groups. This is a deadening factor to any small group. The absence of new ones in a small group violates the spirit of the small group and is also against the purpose of the small group. Even if the same saints attend the meeting every week, rain or shine, that group will decline if there are no new ones. The small group meetings are not only for us; they are to spread the gospel and uphold the saints.</p>
<p>If every small group can avoid these ten deadening factors and week by week focus on life, truth, and new ones, the small groups will surely be living and successful.</p>
<p>(Spoken by Andrew Yu)</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">CONCERNING THE SUPPLY OF THE WORD<br />
IN THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You. We need the cleansing of Your blood. We confess that even today we have unconsciously been contaminated in many ways. Cleanse our conscience, cleanse our feeling, and cleanse our condition. We confess that we are truly weak and ignorant and that we are not useful. Lord, please lead us. We look to You. You are the source, and You are what the Body needs. We open, and we give ourselves to You unreservedly. Every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning more than three thousand saints listen to Your word; we do not want to take this matter lightly. Lord, how will You lead us? Reveal Your heart&rsquo;s desire again to us. Lord, only You know what we should do concerning the supply of the word in the small groups and after the table meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. We present ourselves before You. Cause each of us to feel a sense of responsibility and to not be spectators but rather be involved in bearing the Ark. Lord, we cry out to You again. Have mercy on us and do not cast us into darkness. Lead us. Amen.</p>
<p>With regard to the supply of the word in the big meetings on Lord&rsquo;s Day morning and in the small groups, I am still not at rest. I hope that those who bear the responsibility to minister the word will regard this matter seriously. They should not take it lightly. We must regard the supply of the word very seriously.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH DEPENDING<br />
ON THE SUPPLY OF THE WORD</h2>
<p>It is difficult for a local church that does not receive the supply of the rich, fresh, and living word to be strong. The strength of a church depends on the supply of the word. We can compare this to a family. Whether or not the members of the family are healthy depends on the person who distributes the food. If poison is supplied, one meal can kill the entire family. If only pea pods are supplied, everyone in the family will become very thin. If nutritious food is supplied, every member will be healthy. Hence, all the brothers who bear the responsibility to supply the word must regard this matter seriously. They should not consider it a light matter.</p>
<p>According to our present situation, it would be excellent if the message on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning could be coordinated with the message being read in the small groups. However, we are not sure that we are able to use the Life-study messages one way in the small group meetings and use them in a totally new way for the Lord&rsquo;s Day message. If we use the messages in the same way, the saints may lose their appetite and stop coming to the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting. God&rsquo;s word is rich. The same message can be touched in one way in the small group meetings and in a completely different way on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Hence, the brothers responsible for the word in each meeting hall must have thorough fellowship concerning this matter and consider every aspect of our situation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Keeping the Central Line</h2>
<p><em>Question: Every week we read a Life-study message in our morning time, we fellowship concerning the same message in the small group meeting, and on Lord&rsquo;s Day we fellowship again concerning the same message. We do not want to merely repeat the same content in the message on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, but we are afraid to use our own utterance. As a result, we feel apprehensive, because we are not sure whether we are on the central point.</em></p>
<p>Answer: Let us take Message 1 of the <em>Life-study of Galatians</em> as an example. The opening section says that the book of Galatians is related to Christ; it is a book on Christ. It says that Galatians speaks of Christ and of how this Christ becomes our experience. It is not a problem for us to develop this point. Another section of the first message is concerning the background and subject of Galatians. The background of this book is that Judaism with its laws was replacing Christ. This is a general statement and does not seem to apply to us. Since we are neither Jews nor in the atmosphere of Judaism, how does this statement relate to us? When the brothers release the message, they need to apply this point to themselves. This is the way to develop the central subject so that others get the benefit.</p>
<p>I have given messages for over fifty years, and I know that nothing is more serious than being an outlet of the word. Even today I confess that I still do not know how to give a message. When I was in school, economics was a broad subject that involved political science, geography, social science, and finances. A person who wants to be an expert in economics has to be well versed in these relevant fields. However, I have realized that a person who speaks for the Lord needs an almost unlimited amount of knowledge. We must possess not only general knowledge concerning many things; we must also have cursory knowledge of the biographies of spiritual men. Then when we speak, even when we give examples, we can apply our knowledge.</p>
<p>However, our speaking should not cover too many subjects. The primary matter is to keep the central line. Whatever we say must follow the central line. I can boast to you, and the saints who have listened to my messages for over thirty years can testify, that my messages have never changed. This is because I saw a vision in 1935, and this vision has captured me such that I always center on it no matter what I say. We have developed many new terms, because as more and more riches are unearthed, new utterances are required. Nevertheless, we have continually stayed on the central line of God&rsquo;s economy.</p><h2 class="head2">Having a Principle in Expounding the Bible</h2>
<p>The brothers serving in the word must have a burden. Message 1 of <em>Life-study of Galatians</em> says that Galatians, the first of four books that make up the heart of the divine revelation in the New Testament, is concerned with Christ. We must study to find out what kind of Christ is presented in Galatians. If Message 1 does not give us enough detail, we should read the footnotes, and if there is no explanation in the footnotes, we should consider which Life-study speaks of Christ. The most appropriate Life-study would be on Philippians. We should spend time studying Philippians so that we can develop something without departing from the topic.</p>
<p>The first message also speaks of the background of the book of Galatians, which is that Judaism and the Mosaic law replace Christ. We should thoroughly explain what Judaism is and that the principle of Judaism is religion. What is religion? It is a teaching that is based on doctrines. What is the law? To many, the law teaches people how to do good deeds. Concerning all these points we should get into the footnotes, which contain a substantial amount of explanation. This is the way we should dig out material for the message.</p>
<p>Do not depend on imagination to minister the word. If we read the Life-studies over a long period of time, we will find the principle. Proper biblical exposition points out principles. Without a basis, we cannot say that Judaism is similar to Chinese ethical teaching, or that the Mosaic law is similar to Chinese ethics and morality. We need to speak according to the principles. A Jew must worship God by obeying the Mosaic law. Similarly, the Chinese have their own ethical teaching, morality, and laws. We need to point out the principles, and we need to dig out material from the Life-studies and the footnotes. After we gather material, we still need to practice speaking and consider how we should speak. We must always digest the material and then apply the digested material in our speaking. This is the way to prepare for a message.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Digging into the Riches of God&rsquo;s Word</h2>
<p>We first need to dig into the Lord&rsquo;s word. Let us return to Message 1 of the <em>Life-study of Galatians.</em> Galatians is a book concerning Christ, so we must dig and find Christ. When we come to the section concerning the background, we must pay attention to two things in the background: religion and the law. We also need to dig into these two points. We need to find ways to develop all the material that we have unearthed into our utterance, making the message rich and interesting. This is not so difficult to do. As long as we are willing to dig and to hold on to the principles, every message will be good.</p>
<p>Our material is rich. We have Life-studies of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. When I was saved, I desired to know the Bible. Later, Brother Watchman Nee introduced Darby&rsquo;s <em>Synopsis of the Bible</em> to me, and I was overjoyed. During that time and under very difficult circumstances, I browsed through other books in Christianity, but it was mostly a waste of time. Today, however, we have the Life-studies in our hand, and every message is profitable. We should never take the Life-studies as mere reference books. We need to be aggressive and enter into the riches.</p>
<p>We must not merely repeat a message that is used in both the small group meeting and on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, because God&rsquo;s word is too rich. We need to have a vision. After hearing a message, we should not think that we do not need to hear it again; rather, we need to hear it again and again. Such a vision will create an atmosphere among us of wanting to continually hear the Lord&rsquo;s word. D. L. Moody once spoke in a chapel, and he used John 3:16. The next day, after much consideration, he quoted the same verse, and he continued to speak the same message concerning how God loved the world. After he left, the chapel was burned down. Later, when he was invited again, he still spoke on God&rsquo;s loving the world. The chapel might have been burned down, but the truth that God loves the world will never be burned down. The audience was not bored with the message; instead, they felt that the truth of God&rsquo;s loving the world was endlessly precious.</p>
<p>The truth that we have touched is on the central line. This includes the essential Spirit, the economical Spirit, and God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. All these truths are deeper than the love of God. All the messages in our Life-studies touch the central line. If we have a heart to mine these messages, we will discover that there is a gold mine in them. The Life-studies have been translated into many languages and have gone to all the continents in the world. It is regrettable that not many saints have gotten into them. Many saints have not even entered into the Bible, not to mention the Life-studies. I earnestly hope that we all can diligently enter into the riches in the Life-studies. This was my attitude when I wrote the footnotes of the New Testament Recovery Version. Sometimes I rewrote a footnote ten times. Sometimes when I woke up early in the morning, before getting out of bed I would consider whether the footnotes that were written the night before were thorough. I was in fear and trembling. For example, footnote 6 on 1 John 1:6 concerning the word <em>truth</em> has eight points, which were gleaned from reading various reference books and getting into the Greek grammar and studying it. I hope that we are encouraged by this word.</p><h2 class="head1">SPEAKING FOR THE LORD BEING A SERIOUS MATTER</h2>
<p>We must be very careful when we touch the matter of ministering the Lord&rsquo;s word. It is not an easy task to touch the Lord&rsquo;s holy Word, so we must see the importance of this matter. My advice to you is to spend time studying the Bible and the Life-studies. If we are willing to mine the riches in them, many problems will be solved. This can be compared to playing the piano; much time and continued practice are required for a person to be qualified to perform in a concert. This fellowship is not to trouble you, nor is it to discourage you from ministering the word. I believe that many of us are gifts raised up by God. However, I am concerned that we esteem the Lord&rsquo;s word too lightly; we have not given serious regard to the matter of speaking for the Lord.</p>
<p>Only God can create something out of nothing; we cannot. We are human beings, and therefore we need to learn continually. We all need to receive the Lord&rsquo;s grace and the Lord&rsquo;s gift. Paul says, &ldquo;Fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you&rdquo; (2 Tim. 1:6). First and 2 Corinthians, Hebrews, and Ephesians reveal that the gift in us requires nurturing and development. Sooner or later we have to take this way; otherwise, we will never be an outlet for the rich word. At best we will be able to borrow a few main points from others and use them to speak. If we desire to be an outlet for the rich word, we must be saturated with the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>The Lord has granted us His grace. Everything depends on how we cooperate with Him. I once observed some students in a seminary collecting material for fifty-two sermons. This was to meet the need of being a pastor. After staying in a place for one year, they would move on to another place because they had exhausted their sermons. If they do not move to another place after exhausting their sermons, they would begin to speak on unrelated matters. It is better not to speak than to fall into a similar situation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">APPLYING THE WORD TO BUILD UP<br />
THE SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>We are using the same material for morning watch and for the small groups. This is not a conflict; instead, it is a strengthening and an application. It is the responsibility of every member in a small group to apply what he learns from morning watch. The elders in each meeting hall must also bear this responsibility. They cannot rely on the co-workers to promote this. All the elders in each meeting hall should regularly visit different small groups. If they notice that a particular group is falling behind, they should be willing to meet with the group for a while and help lead them to advance. This is what the elders should do until all the small groups are built up.</p>
<p>This practice will help the saints to exercise their organic function. If we depend solely on the big meetings, no matter how much we endeavor, we will not bring the saints into a situation where everyone exercises his organic function. However, if each of us can take what we read in the morning and apply it in the small group meeting, the result will be impressive. The elders must build up the small groups. The co-workers should also devote themselves to working on the small groups. We must get through. If we can spend two years to devote ourselves to the small groups and lay a foundation, we will reap a great harvest. This is not like holding a revival meeting and inviting a spiritual giant to speak a few messages. The effect of such a meeting is seen for one week, but it does not last. Building up the small groups requires real labor.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DILIGENTLY PROMOTING THE SMALL GROUPS<br />
AND LEADING THE SAINTS INTO THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD</h2>
<p>If the Lord allows it, I would like to consecrate three months to helping you build up the small groups. Much is involved in the small groups. In order to build up the local churches, especially in large localities, we must build up the small groups. We have no excuses. We must build up the small groups. When the small group meetings are strong, the table meeting will be rich, the prayer meeting will be strengthened, and the gospel preaching will be effective. The small groups are the foundation of the church. If the foundation is solid, we can accomplish much more with half the effort.</p>
<p>Some people have been in Christianity for years but know very little. However, if they were to attend fifty-two small group meetings in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, they would change. Their knowledge of the truth and their utterance would indicate that they are from an educated family. We all can make this our goal. If we do not devote time to this now, we will still have to do it in another ten years. However, if we diligently build up the small groups, within half a year all the saints will be getting into God&rsquo;s word. We should labor in one accord toward this goal by diligently facilitating the small groups. Then the saints will be brought into the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PRACTICE OF THE BODY LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:5; 1 Cor. 12:12; 2 Cor. 12:15; 8:12-15</h1>
<p>The church is Christ&rsquo;s Body. This is something that many Christians know. However, even though many are familiar with this doctrine, few live the life of the Body of Christ. For this reason, we will briefly mention three aspects of the practice of the Body life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING AN ORGANISM OF LIFE<br />
AND EVERY BELIEVER NEEDING<br />
TO FUNCTION ORGANICALLY</h2>
<p>In order to practice the Body life, we first need to see that the Body is a living entity, an organism of life. Hence, every member in the Body should exercise his function organically. For example, the many members in our physical body are not the result of organization or arrangement. Every member has its respective function from birth. Our physical life is the organic function of all the members in our physical body. When I speak, apparently I am exercising only my throat, lips, and tongue, but actually my eyes, shoulders, and the rest of my body are all coordinated to enable me to speak. I am not a robot. I am a living person, and I speak living words with the coordination of all the members in my body. However, whenever we think of the church, we are unable to drop the natural concept of a social gathering. We think that the church is an organization, a mere collection of people. This is not the church.</p>
<p>We need to know that our being members of the church is not because we are Christians who were baptized and have joined a group. We are members of the church because we have been regenerated. In addition to our human life we have received the Lord Jesus, the living God, into our inner being as life. This is what makes us members of the church. Regeneration does not involve what the Chinese proverbs refer to as &ldquo;correcting one&rsquo;s errors and making a fresh start&rdquo; or &ldquo;being dead to yesterday&rsquo;s mistakes and being reborn today.&rdquo; Regeneration is the addition of another life into us. When we believe into the Lord, God&rsquo;s life enters into us. Regeneration enables us to be God&rsquo;s children and members of Christ&rsquo;s Body. It is God&rsquo;s life within us that enables us to have an organic union with one another.</p>
<p>Although we cannot see this union, we nevertheless have illustrations of this union. For example, the many light bulbs in the meeting hall may not appear to be related to one another, but the electricity within each light bulb is the same. Through this connection, the union of electricity, all the light bulbs are connected with the power plant and are one entity; they have the same electricity flowing through them. In this electricity, the light bulbs become one with one another. Apart from electricity, the light bulbs are not related to one another. This is a picture of all those who are saved. Before we were saved, we were sinners who were unrelated to one another. But after we were saved, the life of God, like electricity, entered into us, and we thus became one entity in the life of God. This is the reason that we come together: we are an organism.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man&rsquo;s Way Damaging<br />
the Organic Function of the Saints</h2>
<p>From church history we see that the church became degraded shortly after the time of the apostles. The church became degraded because it departed from its function as an organism in God&rsquo;s life and fell into the organization of human society. In Catholicism there are bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and a pope above the deacons. In the same principle, Protestantism has many levels of rank. History shows that religious organizations have damaged the organic function of many members in Christ&rsquo;s Body; human organization has annulled the organic function of many members. In most religious meetings one person speaks and the rest listen. This way of meeting has only a few benefits but brings in much damage and has many drawbacks.</p>
<p>It is not easy to give a message to an audience of one thousand people, and not all seminary graduates are good speakers. In recent years a renowned evangelist emerged in America, but this is quite rare. The result of one person speaking a message to an audience is that the function of the saints is annulled. Here is an example. Before this meeting, we could hear many voices in the meeting hall. Many saints were praying and singing in a living way. However, as soon as the speaker stood on the podium, everyone became quiet. This situation is abnormal. When many saints come to the meeting, only their ears are open, but their mouths are shut.</p>
<p>It seems that giving a message helps the saints, but over the long run, it does more harm than good. Many saints among us have listened to messages for more than twenty or thirty years and have become experts in listening to messages. The more they listen, the more they prefer to listen instead of speaking. They give every speaking brother a grade for his message. For example, this brother does not have the right tone, or that brother does not know how to give appropriate examples. Their criticism may be accurate, but after listening to so many messages and criticizing the speakers, can they themselves speak? The purpose of setting up the small group is so that all of us will not only exercise our ears to listen but also exercise our mouths to speak. All the listening experts must learn to speak in the small groups. After hearing so many messages, it is unreasonable that they cannot speak.</p>
<p>Let us use another example. How long does it take for a child to learn to speak? It would be unthinkable for a normal child to listen to others for thirty-six years yet be unable to speak. If we continue to listen without exercising to speak in the church meetings, we will not be able to speak. We must therefore consider this situation and find a way to enable the saints to exercise to speak.</p><h2 class="head2">The Practice of the Initial Church</h2>
<p>On the day of Pentecost three thousand people were saved. After that there were big meetings in the temple. If Peter had not been a speaker in a meeting, John would have been. Their meetings must have had one person speaking and the rest listening. This was absolutely good for them at that time, because except for the one hundred twenty who prayed in the upper room, none of the other Jews knew the gospel. In Acts 2 Peter gave the first gospel message to three thousand people. Afterward, each of these three thousand taught others from house to house. Hence, the example in the Bible shows that after the saints were saved, day by day they continued steadfastly in one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house (v. 46). The advantage of having big meetings was to produce those who could meet with others and teach from house to house.</p>
<p>It is likely that the three thousand met in hundreds of homes. If there had only been Peter, it would have been impossible for him to go to these homes and speak to all of them. So who was the speaker in the homes? The most likely solution is that those in each home meeting took care of teaching. The initial church produced teachers very quickly. We can say that Peter hit two birds with one stone. On the one hand, he preached the gospel, and some were saved; on the other hand, his preaching was a demonstration that showed others how to teach. His first message also produced teachers who could speak the same thing. This is the example set forth in the Bible.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that Christianity has preserved the practice of only giving messages in the temple but has dropped the practice of meeting from house to house. When we began the work in Taiwan, the number of people increased greatly, and we began the practice of small groups. However, gradually we also went downward, because we dropped the practice of the small groups and stressed only the big meeting. In every aspect it is easier to have the big meetings. It is easier for the elders, the co-workers, and the saints, because all we need to do is to bring our Bible bag to the meeting. This matches what Christianity calls the &ldquo;Sunday service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us take singing in the meeting as an example. Two brothers lead the singing, and everyone follows mechanically. With so many people in the meeting, are there not some who know how to sing? It may be that the brothers leading the singing annul the singing function of the saints. We do not want a dead way; we are living stones. Living stones do not need to wait to be told when to sing; instead, living stones sing spontaneously. This also applies to the brothers who lead the Scripture reading. It seems as though many saints are unable to find the verses and need to be told which page to turn to. This situation has evolved among us because we stress the big meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Everyone Functioning in the Small Group Meeting</h2>
<p>We attend big meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day fifty-two weeks a year. Every Lord&rsquo;s Day we meet in the same way. This has cultivated a habit among us. When it is time to sing, only the brothers who lead the singing function. When it is time for the Scripture reading, only the ones who lead the Scripture reading function. When it is time for the message, only the one speaking on the podium functions. Every year only two brothers exercise their function during the singing, only two brothers exercise their function during the Scripture reading, only one brother functions to speak, and only one brother exercises his function to pray. In one meeting only six saints function: two during the singing, two in the Scripture reading, one in speaking, and one in the prayer. Although this seems like a big help to the other saints, none of the other saints need to exert their strength or exercise their function. They only need to sit and listen. We must see that these six people have not done anyone a favor; rather, they have annulled the organic function of all the saints.</p>
<p>In a small group meeting the members must do everything. This includes singing, reading the Scriptures, speaking, or praying. The brothers who can sing, read the Scriptures, speak, or pray are not the only members of Christ&rsquo;s Body; every saved believer is also a member of Christ&rsquo;s Body. The big meetings are for us to learn. After these lessons in the big meetings, every saint should exercise his function in the small groups. The situation in which one person speaks and the rest listen should not continue among us. We are members of the Body of Christ, and each of us should exercise his portion and function. From now on we need to rise up and earnestly pursue to promote the small groups.</p><h2 class="head2">The Practice of the Small Groups<br />
Being the Way to Live the Body Life</h2>
<p>There are currently about three hundred sixty small groups in the church in Taipei. Every small group should bring in one new one every week. Then there will be three hundred sixty new ones every week, and there will be close to one thousand five hundred new ones in four weeks. The primary task of the small groups is to bring in new ones. The second task is to care for those who have not been meeting for a long time. In Taipei there are over twelve thousand saints who can be located by their name and address, but only four to five thousand are in the meetings. We need to take care of the seven to eight thousand saints who do not come to the meetings regularly. This burden should not fall only on the elders; instead, each member in the small groups should pick up the burden to care for the saints who have not been meeting for a long time. Every local church should know which saints have not been meeting for a long time. The small groups should go and recover these ones. The third task of the small groups is to uphold the saints. There should only be about twelve people in a group. Then if someone is absent from the meeting, it will be noticed immediately. The saints in the group should go and visit him or her to express their concern and mutual care. The warmth of the brothers and sisters is able to uphold the saints.</p>
<p>A small group has many functions. It meets the needs of the young and the old, and it causes every saint to spontaneously exercise his function. The small group can be likened to a basketball court in which everyone has an opportunity to play ball. There is room for everyone to either dribble the ball or to shoot baskets. We all need to see that the small groups are the way to practice living the life of the Body of Christ. This is the right way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Furthermore, to practice the Body life, we also need to spread the gospel. For many years we have paid much attention to the big meetings. As a result, we neglected preaching the gospel. Taiwan is now economically prosperous, and people do not lack food or clothing. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been on this island for thirty-six years, but the gospel has not yet been preached throughout the land. Many of the small villages surrounding Taichung still do not have a church. During the past two hundred years, the Western missionaries that were sent from Europe and America preached the gospel throughout Africa and Asia. At that time transportation was extremely inconvenient. It took six months for a Western missionary to travel to China by boat. Even though transportation and communication methods have greatly advanced, we have not spread the gospel to all of Taiwan. We have to confess our shortage before the Lord and produce many more full-timers so that the gospel can be preached widely.</p>
<p>Among the children of Israel in the Old Testament, the tribe of Levi should be considered as full-timers. The rest of the eleven tribes were responsible for the livelihood of the Levites. In the New Testament there were one hundred twenty people when the church was established. These believers supported the twelve apostles. In the New Testament nine persons supporting one full-timer is more advanced than eleven supporting one in the Old Testament. According to church history, there was a group that practiced every nineteen saints supporting one full-timer. According to the practice of this group, at least one in every twenty saints was sent overseas to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>In the past it was expensive for Europe or America to send missionaries overseas, yet they had the spirit to do so. Suppose we follow their pattern and send out one full-timer for every twenty saints. Then Taichung, which has a regular attendance of seven hundred saints, should support thirty-five full-timers. The number of full-timers in Taichung, however, is far below this goal. This means that we owe the Lord many full-timers. I speak this word to all the saints. We should all agree with this word whether we are young or old. We should have the feeling that we owe the Lord taxes. The Lord does not want only our money; He wants men, full-timers.</p>
<p>Without full-timers we will not be able to reach the goal of evangelizing Taiwan in five years. When we first arrived in Taiwan in 1949, the crime rate was not as high as it is today. Many serious crimes are reported daily in the newspapers. These crimes are the issue of Taiwan being short of the gospel. Whose responsibility is this? There are over ten thousand saints in Taiwan. If we can produce one full-timer out of every twenty saints, there would be five hundred full-timers. If we sent three full-timers to one place, they would cover at least one hundred sixty-five places, and by the end of this year there would be churches in one hundred sixty-five new places. Not having the small group meetings is a great damage to the Body of Christ. Similarly, if there are no full-timers produced among us, it will also be a great damage. Thirty years ago there were not so many temples on the island of Taiwan, but now there are huge temples everywhere, and many people go there to worship. This indicates that there is a shortage of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING OUR MONEY TO EARN SINNERS&rsquo; SOULS</h2>
<p>In practicing the Body life we also need to take care of material offerings. A single full-timer, for example, needs to eat, live, and work. He will need at least ten thousand Taiwan dollars per month as support [note: approximately 330 U.S. dollars]. When I last visited Taichung, I appreciated the big meeting hall, but I also lamented the fact that we spent too much money to build it. We should have saved some for the support of full-timers to go out and spread the gospel. We should not spend all our money on buildings. In God&rsquo;s eyes only people&rsquo;s souls are precious. We need to use our money to support full-timers to go out and spend it on the Lord&rsquo;s gospel.</p>
<p><em>Hymns,</em> #1068, stanza 1 says, &ldquo;While angels in His presence sang / Until the courts of heaven rang.&rdquo; This hymn says that whenever we bring one person to repentance, the angels in heaven will sing and rejoice. The angels might be saying, &ldquo;If you do not preach the gospel, we have nothing to do.&rdquo; If we are all preaching the gospel, and someone is saved in Taichung, in Nantou, and in Fong-yuan, the angels will be very busy, singing and rejoicing. Therefore, please remember Paul&rsquo;s word: &ldquo;I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent&rdquo; (2 Cor. 12:15). Paul spent his money, his energy, and even himself for the Corinthians. Not only did he spend money and energy, but he also spent his person.</p>
<p>I hope that the young brothers and sisters would have such a heart and are willing to spend their lives for the sake of people&rsquo;s souls. They still have many days ahead of them, so they should have a firm resolution of heart to give their lives to the Lord for His move on the earth. It may not be suitable for the working saints and the older saints to serve full time due to their age and circumstances, but they should nevertheless spend their money on the gospel. Then the church where we are will be able to declare, &ldquo;We spend money, energy, and even ourselves for sinners&rsquo; souls.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE ASPECTS OF THE SAINTS FUNCTIONING</h2>
<p>I hope that we all have a clear view of today&rsquo;s situation. First, we need to promote the small groups by encouraging the saints to function so that the Body of Christ may be expressed practically on the earth. Second, we need to have thousands of young brothers and sisters who will give themselves to serve full time. These ones should go to the towns and villages all over the island to evangelize and &ldquo;truthize&rdquo; Taiwan. This should be the glorious goal of our lives. I hope that many young brothers and sisters will give themselves to this cause and share in this glory, and the rest of the saints should match them with prayer. Third, we should give financially to match this move and make friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness (Luke 16:9). All of us should function in these three aspects. We should function in the meeting, we should function by giving our bodies to serve full time, and we should function by giving money. This is the way for us to live the practical Body life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">SPENDING OURSELVES FOR<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S MULTIPLICATION AND INCREASE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:19; Acts 1:8</h1>
<p>Even though I have been in America, for the past five years my heart has been in Taiwan. I have been observing and continually seeking in which direction the Lord desires for us to move. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been in Taiwan for thirty-six years. During the first twelve years, I spent seven to eight months a year in Taiwan and the rest of the time in Southeast Asia. During those years many full-time serving ones were produced, and the number of saints on the island grew to almost forty thousand. At that time we increased by leaps and bounds. Twenty years later, however, the number of saints in Taiwan has not increased but has decreased. It seems as though the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in Taiwan is grinding to a halt.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAIWAN&rsquo;S PROSPERITY AND PROGRESS BEING<br />
FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S MULTIPLICATION AND INCREASE</h2>
<p>Even though the saints continue to love the Lord and zealously preach the gospel so that new ones are regularly baptized, few new ones have remained. The churches in Taiwan have a more solid foundation, and the saints have progressed in knowing the truth and growing in life. However, if we look at the numbers, we see that there is hardly any multiplication or increase. We must be burdened to find out why the Lord&rsquo;s work on the island of Taiwan has not advanced. We must identify what has caused the Lord&rsquo;s work to stop, or rather, to hibernate.</p>
<p>I have been observing this matter for the past five years, and up until last October I had not come to a conclusion. However, as soon as I finished writing the notes of the Life-study of the New Testament, I became very clear. I put my pen down and said, &ldquo;I am going back to Taiwan.&rdquo; It seems as though my age would not allow me to do so, but because of the burden in me, I came back so that together with the brothers we could move forward with the work in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Last October, when we held a conference entitled <em>The All-inclusiveness and Unlimitedness of Christ,</em> we spoke of Christ&rsquo;s multiplication and increase. These two words, <em>multiplication</em> and <em>increase,</em> express my burden for Taiwan. The churches on the island of Taiwan have been under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing since 1949. We have witnessed His blessing for the past thirty-six years. The whole world is amazed at Taiwan&rsquo;s prosperity and progress. Security is good, the transportation system is developed, education is available to all, and the economy is booming. Furthermore, instead of the government restricting the church from preaching the gospel, it grants the church many favors to preach the gospel. Because of these five points, we do not have any excuse, nor can we evade our responsibility. We must not say that the gospel cannot be spread throughout all of Taiwan. We need to seize this opportunity to spread the Lord&rsquo;s work in Taiwan. Taiwan is not large. The freeway from Keelung in the north to Kaohsiung in the south is a little more than four hundred kilometers. We have a rich spiritual possession, together with security, transportation, education, a good economy, and favors from the government, so we have no excuse for not spreading the gospel throughout Taiwan.</p>
<p>Two hundred years ago, when transportation was not so developed, the Western missionaries went from Europe and America to China to preach the gospel. It took them half a year to travel by boat. For six months they suffered severe seasickness, and some died shortly after they arrived in China. Those who survived the journey established schools to produce qualified teachers. This was a preparation for the preaching of the gospel to the local people. In this way, after only two hundred years the Western missionaries preached the gospel throughout the two major countries in Asia&mdash;China and India. Besides this, the missionaries translated the Bible into the local languages of some of the other countries in Asia. They also undertook such a difficult task for the Lord&rsquo;s work in Africa. Even though the circumstances were difficult, it took them less than two centuries to spread the gospel throughout the whole world.</p>
<p>We have been here for over thirty-six years. When I left Taiwan, there were dozens of churches and thousands of saints meeting regularly. However, we have been here for more than a quarter century, and yet we have not spread the gospel throughout this island. All the saints who love the Lord should repent and ask for the Lord&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD DESIRING PEOPLE&rsquo;S SOULS</h2>
<p>I returned to Taipei with a heavy burden. Therefore, in the first message of the conference last October, I spoke of the unlimitedness of Christ. Christ&rsquo;s multiplication is unlimited, and His increase is also unlimited. Contrary to this fact, however, we have entered into a state of hibernation. This is unacceptable. I remember the first time I went to Kaohsiung in 1949. There were one hundred people in the meeting. That was thirty-six years ago. If we use one hundred as a base number and if the rate of annual increase is ten percent, we would have about three thousand people meeting in Kaohsiung today. However, the regular attendance in Kaohsiung is less than fifteen hundred. There are more than three hundred towns and villages in Taiwan. There are not more than fifteen churches in the great plain from Chiayi to Tainan. From the viewpoint of statistics, we owe the Lord very much.</p>
<p>For many years all the churches have been stable, without any turmoil, problems, heretical teachings, or disputes. We worship the Lord for this. However, we cannot say that we have satisfied the Lord&rsquo;s heart. The Lord charged us to go and disciple all the nations (Matt. 28:19). He also said, &ldquo;You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth&rdquo; (Acts 1:8). We have not even taken the gospel to the area surrounding Kaohsiung, not to speak of the uttermost part of the earth. We all need to bring this matter before the Lord. We must see that the Lord does not desire something outward; the Lord desires souls. The church in Kaohsiung has been stable for over thirty years. It would not be too much for there to be eighteen thousand saints meeting in Kaohsiung today. Neither would it be too much for there to be thirty to forty churches that were established by the saints sent out from Kaohsiung.</p><h2 class="head1">USING AT LEAST ONE DAY A WEEK<br />
TO RECOVER THE DORMANT SAINTS</h2>
<p>During the past thirty years, no less than five to six thousand people were baptized in the church in Kaohsiung. We took the time and made the effort to preach the gospel to them, bring them to salvation, and baptize them. But today more than three thousand of them are lost. We have an obligation to find them and recover them. I am speaking these words in every place, not only here. I am speaking the same thing in every locality. The churches have not fulfilled this obligation. Recently I visited a church in Taichung County that has the names and addresses of more than two hundred saints on their list, but only forty saints are in the meetings. This locality has a beautiful meeting hall with a nice office building in the front, but who is in the meetings? I exhorted the saints to promote the small groups and have love feasts in order to focus on recovering the two hundred dormant saints. If they are willing to practice this, within a year one hundred dormant saints will be recovered.</p>
<p>The saints who meet regularly should set aside at least one day a week to look for the saints who have not been meeting for a long time. If a dormant brother is only available during the table meeting, we should sacrifice the table meeting to go and be with him. If we are willing to sacrifice even the meetings to be with the dormant saints, in two or three months they will be recovered. Some brothers or sisters may say, &ldquo;We have suffered a great deal because of the dormant saints. We have begged them and visited them. Week after week the more we begged, the harder their hearts became. You told us that the Lord&rsquo;s work is like a farmer working the soil and that if the soil cannot take a seed, we should move to a location that is more receptive to the seed.&rdquo; Even though this word is true, I would still ask you to go back to visit these ones. Then you will see barren ground turning into fertile land.</p>
<p>We have not yet spread the gospel throughout the entire island. Although we put much effort into bringing people in, we did not uphold them or keep them, nor did we take the time to search for those who were lost. We will not be able to give any excuses for this to the Lord. This is not according to the Lord&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire. The Lord treasures the one lost sheep more than the ninety-nine (Luke 15:7). Moreover, the Lord said that when a lost sheep is found, the angels in heaven rejoice. This is not a small thing. It is good that there are saints who are faithful to come to the meetings, but it is also our responsibility to consider the thousands of souls who are perishing and the thousands of brothers and sisters who are still wandering.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONLY SOULS BEING BROUGHT<br />
INTO THE LORD&rsquo;S KINGDOM</h2>
<p>We will now consider the support for the full-timers. In the Old Testament one tribe among the twelve tribes of Israel served full time. This means that eleven tribes supported the livelihood of the tribe of Levi. In Acts 1 one hundred twenty saints were gathered together. Among the one hundred twenty, twelve apostles served full time. One-tenth of the saints served full time; therefore, nine persons supported the livelihood of one. Church history shows that when various mission groups sent missionaries from Europe and America to Africa and Asia to preach the gospel, one out of every twenty believers was sent out as a missionary. I paid a special visit to one of those groups. Their chapel was old, and the furniture and chairs were clean but well-worn. Those believers told me that every penny they had was saved to send missionaries overseas to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>Does the Lord want a beautiful meeting hall, or does He want ten full-timers to go out and serve Him? A beautiful meeting hall cannot be brought into the kingdom. Only people&rsquo;s souls can be brought into the kingdom. If there are fifteen hundred saints meeting regularly in the church in Kaohsiung and twenty saints support one full-timer, the church in Kaohsiung would have seventy-five full-timers. However, there are only a dozen full-timers there. We owe the Lord sixty full-timers. I would like to ask the saints where we can find these sixty persons? I hope the young brothers and sisters would reply, &ldquo;Find them among us.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">SENDING OUT FULL-TIMERS<br />
TO EVANGELIZE TAIWAN IN FIVE YEARS</h2>
<p>There are more than four thousand saints meeting regularly in the church in Taipei. If one out of every twenty saints would serve full time, the church in Taipei owes the Lord another one hundred full-timers, not including the one hundred who already serve full time. In order to evangelize Taiwan in five years, we must produce five hundred full-timers every year, beginning from this year. The Lord sent me to remind you to pay your debt. Our burden in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to spread the gospel so that the gospel would multiply and increase in this age. For this we must produce full-timers. It should not be a difficult thing for one out of every twenty saints to come forth and serve full time or for nineteen saints to support one full-timer. If we do not practice this, the Lord cannot have an outlet in Taiwan. Who will evangelize Taiwan? Will angels do it? Even if the angels are happy to do it, it is not their privilege. The Lord has entrusted us with the position and the privilege to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>If one out of every twenty saints would serve full time, what would the other nineteen do? The full-timers cannot live on air; therefore, the other nineteen saints should bear the burden first to pray for them, that is, to match them in prayer. Furthermore, these nineteen saints should try their best to give financially. Suppose there are seventy-five full-timers, and every full-timer needs ten thousand New Taiwan dollars a month. We would need seven hundred fifty thousand New Taiwan dollars every month, or a total of nine million a year. [Note: ten thousand New Taiwan dollars is equivalent to three hundred thirty U.S. dollars; for seventy-five full-timers, there is a need for roughly twenty-five thousand U.S. dollars a month, or three hundred thousand a year.] For this reason, whenever we spend money, we need to consider how to meet this need. Paul loved the Corinthians and was willing to spend his money and his energy for their souls. He says, &ldquo;I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your souls&rdquo; (2 Cor. 12:15). According to the original Greek text, <em>to be utterly spent</em> refers to his person. For the sake of others&rsquo; souls, Paul not only spent his money but also spent his entire person.</p><h2 class="head1">SPENDING MONEY, ENERGY, AND OUR PERSON<br />
FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>If we want the Lord to have an outlet and for the gospel to spread, every brother and sister should have the attitude of spending their money, energy, and person for the sake of the gospel. I have been serving full time in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for over fifty years. During the Sino-Japanese War, when I was recuperating from a sickness, my family sometimes went to the beach to pick up driftwood because we were short of cooking fuel. We also lived on soybean cakes. That was a very difficult time for us. Perhaps the parents of our young saints would oppose their children serving full time. However, we must remember what the Lord said concerning using unrighteous mammon to make friends while the mammon is still useful (Luke 16:9). We need to use unrighteous mammon to preach the gospel and bring people to salvation. Those who are saved due to our money are the friends whom we have made with our unrighteous mammon. When unrighteous mammon fails, all these friends will welcome us into the eternal tabernacles (v. 9).</p>
<p>We should never be wasteful. For our daily life, it is sufficient to have clothing and food. We should save money for those who go out for the Lord&rsquo;s work under difficult circumstances. Do not think that I have an easy life because my work is successful and the saints take good care of me. I have testified to you that when I began to serve the Lord, I was determined that if I drank mountain water and ate tree roots, or even if I starved, I would not complain. May the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood cover me. Until today I have not forgotten my co-workers. The Lord is true, and His Word is reliable. If we can be saved by believing into the reliable Word of the Lord, then the portion where the Lord said that He would settle accounts with us when He returns is also reliable. We must keep in mind His word of warning.</p>
<p>The Lord has blessed our country, and our income has increased. However, as we are enjoying the riches, we should never forget the source. Do not forget that all the blessings we have are from the Lord. If a dollar is enough for me to purchase what I need for myself, I will not spend a dollar and twenty cents. I would rather save the twenty cents for the gospel. When we build a meeting hall, we should consider how best to use the money. If we can meet the construction need with five hundred thousand dollars, we should never use five hundred twenty thousand. We should save the twenty thousand for sending out full-timers. The Lord never intended that we spend a large sum to build a meeting hall. Instead, the Lord wants us to go out and gain people. We would rather have a simple meeting hall, which can shield us from the wind and the rain, than be short in sending out full-timers. The Lord is pleased when we save money in order to send out full-timers. We should not only consider our current situation; we should also consider our future.</p>
<p>In order to produce full-timers continually, we also need to have a training. Most of the saints will not be able to work for the Lord immediately after they set their heart to serve full time. We hope that every full-timer would receive two terms of training. Each term would last for four months, so they would receive eight months of training in a year. We have to arrange room and board for these ones. This is a great burden. Whenever I consider the work ahead of us, I feel that the burden is too heavy. We have a long distance to travel, and the burden is heavy. I hope that all the saints will waste themselves in this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WASTING OURSELVES FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>On the one hand, we hope that all the parents will encourage their children to serve full time; on the other hand, we hope that all the saints in the churches will give their best for the spread of the gospel. It is a shameful thing for a church to construct a luxurious meeting hall. We should give our money and send out full-timers. I believe that we all love the Lord. Our love for the Lord is expressed by our pouring out the ointment upon the Lord rather than on other people. Even the two denarii that the widow gave were remembered by the Lord. I hope that when the sisters buy groceries, they will calculate a little. Whenever there is a way to save ten dollars, they should do so for the gospel. In every aspect of our daily living&mdash;what we eat, what we wear, where we live, and how we travel&mdash;we should save money for the Lord. This is the only way for us to go forward. There is no other way.</p>
<p>Whether we are able to climb up this slope depends on how much effort we exert. We cannot continue to hibernate. In order to evangelize Taiwan in five years, we need to produce five hundred full-timers every year. Who will answer this call? Should I bear this burden alone, or should all the co-workers bear it together? If I am to bear the burden alone, how can I support twenty-five hundred people? Hence, the co-workers should give themselves for the Lord&rsquo;s sake by offering up whatever they can to bear this burden.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is necessary to have a big meeting hall where all the saints can come together to be supplied and to be perfected, but the big meetings should only be forty percent of the church life. The other sixty percent should be spent in small groups. The small groups can bring in people, recover the dormant saints, and uphold the saints. We cannot rely solely on the elders or a few responsible brothers. Instead, we must all participate. Every small group should take care of itself, and the members in the small groups should have mutual care for one another. The saints must change their view concerning the church life, from stressing the big meetings to emphasizing the small groups. We should give the big meetings only forty percent of our time, and the rest of our time should be given to the small groups. If we continue to pay attention to the big meetings and neglect the small groups, we will never build up the church in our locality in a solid way. We must build up the small groups and diligently take care of the brothers and sisters in the small groups. All the co-workers and elders should diligently build up the small groups in each locality.</p>
<p>We need to be impressed that we are not here to do another work in Christianity. We are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Our first responsibility is to spread the gospel. This is an obligation from which we cannot escape. Furthermore, we need to support the livelihood of the full-timers so that they can go out and spread the gospel. This requires that all the saints save money, because we love the Lord. Then our money can be given to save people&rsquo;s souls. In addition, we must learn to bring the saints into the truth and to progress in learning the truth.</p>
<p>I truly look to the Lord that you can all receive this word and that you can put your spirit, your prayer, and your shoulders under the Ark to bear this testimony together with me. I believe that if we are faithful in this matter, the Lord will bless us.</p></body></html>
