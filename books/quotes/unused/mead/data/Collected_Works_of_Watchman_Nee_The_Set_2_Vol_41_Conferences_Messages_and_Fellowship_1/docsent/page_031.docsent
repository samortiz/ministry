   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BELIEVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to receive and experience the overcoming life, there are four steps we have to take.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, we have to see that we cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second, we have to give up trying to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Third, we have to boast in our weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Fourth, we have to believe that God is able, that is, we have to believe that God can make it for us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As long as we act according to these four steps, no temptation can stand in our way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I grouped the first three things together under the heading of letting go.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The last step is to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Have you come to God once in a definite way and said to Him, "I know that I cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I cannot change myself and it is impossible for me to change.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I do not intend to change anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I commit everything to Your hand"?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once you commit everything into the Lord's hand and let go, you have only taken the first step towards victory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The next step is to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Letting go is passive, whereas believing is active.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In addition to letting go, you must still believe that God is able, that He can overcome for you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once I met a Western missionary who often joined us for breakfast when we were having meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>She heard the teaching on the overcoming life, yet she still did not understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I asked her, "Others have overcome in a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why have you not overcome after two weeks?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Have you let go yet?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She said, "Yes, I have.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I know that I cannot make it, but I still have not overcome."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I said, "If you have let go, you should have experienced it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Have you offended anyone?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She said, "I dare not say that I can overcome any sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I dare not say that I will overcome if I do this or that."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I said, "You know sin very well, but you do not know the Lord enough."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I opened the Bible and showed her in Romans that we will bear fruit unto sanctification if we offer up ourselves to God as those raised from the dead 6:13, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What is consecration?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Consecration is presenting ourselves to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is offering up ourselves to God and allowing Him to do whatever He wants to do.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God says, "You only deserve to die.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have crucified you on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You do not have to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All you have to do is to hand yourself over to Me. I can make you bear fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She told me that she dared not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>My face immediately became stern.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I stood before her and pointed at her face, saying, "Do you know whose word you are doubting?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God said that if you hand yourself over to Him and consecrate yourself to Him, He will make you holy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But even though you have consecrated yourself, acknowledged that you are unable to do anything, and have offered up everything to God, you say that God has not done His part.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This verse says that man has his part and God has His part.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If man has done his part, God will do His part.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But even though you say that you have let go and done what you should do, you say that God has not given you the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do you know what your word means?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You are saying that God has made a contract with you and that you have done your part, but that God has not done His part.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You are saying that God is not righteous, that He is dishonest, and that He is unfaithful."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>She said, "How can I dare say this!"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I said, "If that is not what you mean, then you have to say, God, I have committed myself into Your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I know that I will surely overcome because I have done my part, and You will surely do Your part.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You will surely cause me to overcome because I have committed myself to You.'"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After one lets go, he has to testify, saying, "Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I believe that He has done what I committed to Him."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God will work in you only to the extent that you have committed yourself to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once you believe, the matter passes into Christ's hand, and He will take over.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A Christian was riding a bicycle in a rural countryside.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He reached an open deserted place, where there was an old well.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He wanted to go to the bottom of the well, and so he tied a rope to the edge of the well and lowered himself down the well.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When he reached the end of the rope, he could not feel the bottom of the well.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He tried to climb back up, but did not have the strength.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hanging with his hands on the rope, he was unable to go either down or up.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He cried for help, but the place was deserted, and no one heeded to his call.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He hung on for a while, but the weight of his body became heavier and heavier.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For two hours he was helplessly hanging there.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Finally, he could stand it no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He was a Christian and he thought that he should pray.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He said, "God, I am about to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Let me fall into eternity."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After he prayed, he let go of the rope, thinking that he would certainly die.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But he was only a few inches from the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>After he fell to the bottom of the well, he regretted that he had suffered so much because he had not let go of the rope any sooner.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is the way we are towards Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We think that we will fall into Hades unless we struggle, strive, and make resolutions.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Actually, if we would let go, we would not fall into Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We would fall on Christ the Rock.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We have to believe that as we let go, God will take over.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He will give us the power.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He will make us overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We only have to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Friends, once our life runs out, God's life will operate.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Once we let go, God will take over, and His life will be lived out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Whenever we stop living our own life, God's life will be lived out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>As soon as we put ourselves aside, God's life will be lived out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If we want to experience Christ as our overcoming life, the first thing to do is to let go and see that we cannot make it, to give up trying, and to boast in our weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>After we have completely let go, we have to believe that God is able to make Christ our overcoming life, and that He can manifest Christ's life and power through us.</S>
