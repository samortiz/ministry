   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us come to the third point Paul's attitude towards money.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His own word on this subject is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Acts 20 he said to the Ephesians, "I have coveted no one's silver or gold or clothing" v. 33 . This is a matter of motive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He did not covet anything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In his work for the Lord, he was able to boast that he never coveted anyone's possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He had no thought concerning anyone's gold, silver, or clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the first statement.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then he said, "You yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my needs and to those who are with me" v. 34 . This should be the common attitude of all servants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must covet no man's silver or gold or clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Others' possessions are their own, and we have no desire for them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They can keep what they have.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the same time, we work to supply our own need and those of our co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This does not mean that a worker of the Lord has no right to exercise his right in the gospel 1 Cor 9:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But it does mean that a worker of the Lord should view the gospel as such a serious and immense responsibility that he would rather offer his hands and his money to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This should be his desire before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If at all possible, his hands should be working.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of course Paul accepted gifts from others, but that had to do with another subject the responsibility of the giver.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We will come to that in a minute.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul's word to the Corinthians was very sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 2 Corinthians 11:7 he said, "Or did I commit a sin, abasing myself that you might be exalted, because I announced the gospel of God to you free of charge?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He continued in verses 9 through 12: "And when I was present with you and lacked, I was not a burden to anyone; for the brothers who came from Macedonia filled up my lack, and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and will keep myself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The truthfulness of Christ is in me, that this boasting shall not be stopped as it regards me in the regions of Achaia.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because I do not love you?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God knows.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But what I do, I also will do, that I may cut off the opportunity of those desiring an opportunity, that in the thing in which they boast, they may be found even as we."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul did not categorically deny all gifts, but in Achaia it was a matter of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some were criticizing, looking for opportunity, and boasting as if they were different from others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul did not want to give them an occasion for criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He said that he announced the gospel of God to them free of charge, that he was not a burden to them, not even when he lacked.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He kept himself from being burdensome to them, and would continue to keep himself in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He would not allow himself to become a burden to them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This does not mean that he did not love them, because what he did, he would continue to do.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But he acted in this way to cut off the opportunity of those desiring an opportunity, and to shut their mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the attitude of a worker towards money.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Wherever we go, as soon as we sense any reluctance, we should cut off any opportunity for criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God's children must maintain their dignity in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more a person loves money, the more we should give the gospel to him free of charge.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The more a person holds on to his money, the less we should receive any gift from him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should realize our position as servants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we find anyone like the Achaians, who were reluctant and who were looking for opportunity to criticize, we should say to them as Paul seemingly said, "I will not be a burden to any one of you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you want to send something to the poor in Jerusalem, I can take it to them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If Timothy comes, you can send him forth in his journey in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But as for myself, I must maintain my dignity as a worker of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we are criticized for receiving any gift from anyone, we have lost our dignity as servants of the Lord altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to maintain our dignity as servants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In our service to the Lord, we cannot be careless with money.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to be very strict in this matter; otherwise, we will not be able to do much for God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul told us not only how he maintained his integrity, but also how he worked with his two hands to supply the needs of his co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This shows us the principle of giving.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul said, "These hands have ministered to my needs and to those who are with me" Acts 20:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No worker will be depleted by giving.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we keep all that we have received and only make provisions for ourselves, we do not know the meaning of the work of a minister.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If there is little offering from the purses of the co-workers, something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If a worker can only receive, that is, if his faith is exercised only to the point of his receiving, but does not extend to his giving, his function is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Brothers and sisters, our spiritual future has much to do with our attitude towards money.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The worst attitude we can take is to gather only for ourselves and to do everything for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It seems a hard task to ask the Levites to offer.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Yet the Levites have just as much responsibility to tithe as everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is true that the Levites had no inheritance in all the cities; they sojourned among the twelve tribes and lived by the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some Levites might have been tempted to say, "I live by the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What do I have to give?"</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But God said that all the Levites should receive tithing and should also tithe.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This stops all the servants of God from saying, "I have given up everything.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Do I still have to offer from the meager income I receive?"</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If our eyes are always on our own needs, we will end up in financial straits and will not be able to supply the needs of our co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to learn to give.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must be able to supply all of our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we keep money in our hands, no matter how little it may be, and if, at the same time, we expect God to constantly work on the other brothers and sisters, we will find that God does just the opposite; He will not entrust His money to our hands.</S>
