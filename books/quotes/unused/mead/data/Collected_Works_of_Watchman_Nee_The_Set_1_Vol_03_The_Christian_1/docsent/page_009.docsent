   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>From the New Testament we see that under the hand of Satan there are two living beings: 1 angels and 2 demons.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us first look at the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew 25:41 speaks of "the devil and his angels."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Revelation 12:4 says that the dragon's "tail drags away the third part of the stars of heaven, and he cast them to the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The stars denote the angels Rev 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore 12:9 says, "And the great dragon was cast down, the ancient serpent, he who is called the Devil and Satan,...he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These angels were probably the ones established by God in the beginning to assist Satan to rule the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They were "the congregation of the mighty" and "the gods" in Psalm 82 cf.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 10:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When Satan fell, they either conspired or sympathized with him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, they fell together with him and became today's "rulers," "authorities," "world-rulers of this darkness," "the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies" Eph 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Note that the numbers are plural.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These angels are not disembodied demons; they have ethereal bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why the Lord promises that the children of resurrection will be like the angels in the heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Satan has another class of subjects, the evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Demons and the evil spirits or filthy spirits are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can tell this by checking with the translation of the Mandarin Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Matthew 8:16, it firstly mentions the demons, then the spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the Bible translators, seeing that the Holy Spirit used the words "demon" and "spirit" interchangeably, translated both into "demons."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Luke 10:17 the word "demons" is in the original language, but in verse 20 the word "demons" should be "spirits."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In these two verses of the Bible we see the Lord Jesus acknowledged the "demons" and the "spirits" to be the same and thus the Chinese Bible translator again translated both as "demons."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Matthew 17:18 speaks of the Lord casting out a demon, yet Mark calls this demon an unclean spirit and dumb spirit Mark 9:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Demons and spirits are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These demons, or spirits, probably were the race who lived in the former world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They helped Satan in his sinning; or, perhaps after Satan sinned, they followed him rather than forsaking him and obeying God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, they were cut off by God and their bodies were removed from them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, they became disembodied spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although we cannot find any clear evidence in the Bible to confirm this theory, we can find some clues.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Matthew 12 we see the situation of a demon when he left the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He became helpless and wandered about.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Besides the human body, he could not find another resting place.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, he eventually returned to his original place, the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If they were not disembodied spirits, why did they have to enter into man's body?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we read Luke 8, we see how the legion of demons was unwilling to leave the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When they had no way to remain in the human body, they even entered the bodies of the swine.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Presently in the world they still cling to human bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even some believers are unconsciously possessed by them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are different from Satan and his angels who do not like to enter human bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Satan and his angels still have a spiritual body, but the demons do not.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Their character and liking seem to prove that they are the disembodied spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since they are disembodied spirits, where were they when they were disembodied?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We know that the spirits of all the dead are in Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>So, where do these spirits come from?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They must have come from the former world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>While they were alive, their habitation was probably the former world where Satan exercised his rule.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the Bible we can find another clue that tells us that there were inhabitants in the pre-Adamic world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Isaiah 45:18 shows that the world created by God in the beginning was not waste and empty.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since this verse speaks of the original world, one expression suggests to us the existence of mankind in the previous world.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It says, "He is the God / Who formed the earth...</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>/ He did not create it waste."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This clearly refers to the original creation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Following this it says, "He formed it to be inhabited."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This seems to clearly tell that the earth then was inhabited by some race.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As we read the Bible further, we find clues which indicate that there is a detention place for the demons now.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The legion of demons in Gadara must have known this.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They were in great fear and begged the Lord that He would not "order them to depart into the abyss," Luke 8:31 because they would be tormented there Matt 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Mr. Pember says that this "abyss" in the original language is abussos; and that "in some passages, such as the ninth chapter of the Apocalypse, this term is evidently applied to a fiery hollow in the centre of the earth: but it is also used for the depths of the sea, a meaning which accords well with its derivation" Earth's Earliest Ages, p.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>60 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the future Satan will be detained in a bottomless pit in the center of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is revealed in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The demons are also detained in an abyss now, yet some of them still have freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must wait until God's appointed time comes for them to be completely shut inside.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This abyss is probably different from the one in the heart of the earth; it is in the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Furthermore, at the final judgment Rev 20:11-15 when all the prisoners will have been thrown into the lake of fire, there will be no more sea in the new heaven and new earth Rev 21:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, there may be only one abyss that is divided into two parts.</S>
