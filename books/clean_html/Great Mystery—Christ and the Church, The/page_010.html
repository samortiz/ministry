<h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLE ADMONISHING<br />
AND TEACHING PEOPLE WITH CHRIST</h2>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s apostleship, which was also his stewardship, was to minister Christ to people (Eph. 3:2, 8). Paul announced and preached Christ, and then he admonished and taught people in all wisdom according to Christ (Col. 1:28). Confucius admonished and taught people concerning proper human relationships and morality, and philosophers admonish and teach people with philosophical ideas, but Paul admonished and taught people with Christ. We need to ask ourselves how we admonish and teach people.</p>
<p>Suppose a newly married couple is having problems. How would we admonish them? According to my observation, it is common for a husband and wife to have problems. Some couples have problems before their honeymoon is over. Our God is wonderful; He created males to be completely different from females and makes two different persons a couple. In over fifty years of serving I have observed the same situation everywhere. Both in the East and in the West, regardless of nationality, there are problems between husbands and wives. God usually does not put two quick persons together, nor does He put two slow persons together. Rather, He marvelously matches a slow person with a quick person and a soft person with a harsh person.</p>
<p>In my early years of serving the Lord, I often saw a brother and a sister whom I thought would be a suitable match. Whenever I acted on this sense, I ran into trouble and had to repent. Therefore, I eventually stopped making suggestions because I found that my view was not accurate. I might consider a brother and a sister to be a good match, but they might not think so. We would pray according to the principles in the Bible and consider the social condition, education, and age of the brother and sister. But when we introduced them to one another, they did not like each other. Eventually, they picked their own match and still suffered. There are many stories like this.</p>
<p>We need to admonish and teach the couples who have problems. The brothers who administrate the church and lead the saints need to learn how to admonish and teach. We should learn from Paul as our pattern. Paul says that he announced Christ by &ldquo;admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man full-grown in Christ; for which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power&rdquo; (vv. 28-29). Paul did not merely write epistles and give messages; he also admonished and taught people with Christ. We know from our experience that when there is discord between a husband and wife, we need to admonish and teach them with Christ, not with doctrines. Such admonishing and teaching require us to have experiences of Christ. If we do not have experiences of Christ, we cannot admonish and teach people with Christ.</p>
<p>The purpose of admonishing people with Christ is not for them to get along but to present each one full-grown in Christ. Proper admonition leads the saints to grow unto maturity. We should not correct the saints; rather, we should minister Christ to them and help them eat, drink, and enjoy Christ. There is a great difference between the practice in Christianity of admonishing and teaching people with doctrines and Paul&rsquo;s ministering Christ to people.</p>
<p>There are problems between husbands and wives because they lack Christ and need the supply of Christ. This principle applies to all the problems among the saints: problems are the result of our lacking Christ and needing the supply of Christ. For example, if an elder has a problem with a deacon, both the elder and the deacon are short of Christ. If two sisters have a problem and cannot serve together, they are both short of Christ. All kinds of problems arise when the saints are short of Christ. The problems in the churches are the result of a lack of supply, a shortage of Christ. I hope that everyone in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery would minister Christ and serve Christ to people.</p>
<p>Paul says that he labored and struggled to minister Christ to people. The purpose of such ministering is not to solve problems but to help people grow unto maturity so that each one might be presented full-grown in Christ to God (v. 28). The word <em>present</em> in verse 28 is the same word as that in Ephesians 5:27: &ldquo;That He might present the church to Himself glorious.&rdquo; The same word is used in the phrase <em>present your bodies a living sacrifice</em> (Rom. 12:1). Paul struggled to present every saint full-grown in Christ. It is a shame if the co-workers serve for many years, but very few saints in their localities are full-grown. We should always minister Christ to the needy ones, not to solve their problems but to help them grow in life unto maturity so that they may be presented to God.</p>
