   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW TO LIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But in the last few months I have been bothered for a further step, that is, how to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No doubt while I have been so seeking, the Lord has answered His promise that if we seek we would find Matt 7:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Recently I have told you that the first way to live Christ is that you have to pray before doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second, I also discovered that you have to continue your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>While you are doing certain things, you have to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Third, we have seen that we must practice a kind of breathing prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to make our prayer a matter of breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means we have to pray unceasingly; we have to pray continually.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Fourth, I also shared with you that we have to get into the Word, not only by reading and not only by praying, but also by singing, psalming, and thanking.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You must get into the Word because the Holy Bible is God s Word, God s breath.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is even the consolidation of God s breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Don t get into the Word like a scholar or a student, but get into the Word to pray-read it, to sing it, to psalm it, to thank God all the time through it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I believe all of these give us the way to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although our experiences in these matters may be limited and shallow, yet we can testify this is the right way to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we pray-read, when we sing, when we psalm, when we thank God for the Word, we have the inner conviction that we are really one with the living One.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At that time we really get some fresh air into our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every day I need about one hour s exercise, either to walk or to do this or that.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Otherwise, I could not sleep well.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But by exercising I breathe, and it refreshes me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same way when you pray-read the Word, when you sing the Word, when you psalm the Word, and you thank God for the Word, you get the fresh air into your inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>OUR HABITUAL LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the last meeting we saw that many Christian practices become a trap to keep us from living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now I would mention a further thing that keeps us from living Christ and is a kind of current that carries you away unconsciously and subconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You may be able to avoid stepping into a trap, but you are simply in the current.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the current flows you are carried away.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is the current that unconsciously and subconsciously carries us away from living Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is our habitual living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In our daily lives we live according to habit, and this habit is a current carrying us away from living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although we know we need to pray, we need to sing, still we don t practice these things that much.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our habitual living frustrates us from practicing these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to see that our habit of not living Christ is even sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When a married couple sits down to eat, they nearly always talk in a habitual way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sometimes they may have some good news or bad news to talk about, but at other times they may hunt for some material to talk about.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They may talk about a brother s new suit or a sister s testimony in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a kind of trend.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Unconsciously and subconsciously all the day long we are living in a trend.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Years ago I learned there is a kind of lust to know things about others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we have learned the real spiritual lessons, we would not like to know things concerning others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To know things concerning others always kills us and always damages others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It doesn t help, and it doesn t build up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I come to your home, I don t like to look around.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I don t like to look at your kitchen or your bedroom or your closet.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have learned that is a temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To want to know how many suits someone has and what color they are is an evil, lustful desire.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many Christians today and even many among us have not been delivered from this desire.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is why so much death has been carried on and on.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is because we have gotten to know too many things about others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If I never get to know anything about you, I could never carry out any death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we sit down together, whether as a husband and wife, or as brothers with brothers, or as sisters with sisters, we must be alert not to speak things, to talk of things, and to do things in a habitual way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Recently, when I have wanted to talk about some brothers or some churches I have been stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The question came to me: why talk about this?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is just your habit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Why don t you pray?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Why would you talk about that church?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Why wouldn t you pray?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To talk about things, to talk about certain persons, to talk about certain churches is our habit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I don t mean that we criticize others.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We may talk about others in a nice way, but still it is just a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Why not spend that time pray-reading the Word?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Why not spend that time singing or praying?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Don t talk about the things which you don t need to talk about.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By this you can see that we have wasted and misused our time by our habit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We say that we don t have time to pray, but we all agree that we have a lot of time to talk.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Consider how much time you use daily for talking.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You talk concerning that sister being weak and that brother being sick and that church not being good and another church being pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You don t need to talk about these matters; you need to pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You don t need to tell people that a certain church is pitiful, even you don t need to say that a certain church is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Why do you need to talk about it?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I don t mean that we always are talking in a way of evil gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Even if we talk about things in a so-called holy way, it may be a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It may be just a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>For you and me to talk is very easy, but for us to stop talking and to pray is very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Because a habit has been built up.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even today we are still living in that habit unconsciously and subconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This means we are in a trend, a current.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is a crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God wants us just to live Christ, but we like to do this, and we like to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>All the Christian practices become a trap to us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We have a kind of living that has altogether become a habit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In this habit we do a lot of things habitually without any thought.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We just talk spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We need to be bothered by this matter, and we need the Lord s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We need the Lord s mercy to rescue us from anything of our habit.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We have to hate our entire habit, not only our bad habit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It is not that we simply need to hate a drinking habit, or a smoking habit, or a gossiping habit; we need to be rescued from our habitual living.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Our habitual living is the biggest frustration to living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Our habitual living is a kind of trend, a kind of current, a kind of downhill current, carrying us away from Christ unconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When we come together we don t have the habit to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Our singing is altogether formal, not habitual.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Habitually, you simply ask about a brother s wife or children, or you discuss a certain word of fellowship that a brother gave in a previous meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is just habitual talk.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Ever since I have been bothered concerning the matter of living Christ, and since I have seen some light concerning this matter, when I hear this kind of habitual talk I am disgusted.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When we come together, why do we not have the habit to pray-read?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If we just pray-read two minutes, how good it would be.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Let us pray-read John 1:1 even for a half minute.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Do you really have that much concern in your asking about that brother s wife and children?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Actually you don t; you just ask habitually.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Eventually, that is a kind of hypocrisy.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Do you really have a loving concern?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I m afraid you re just talking habitually.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Based upon this you can see how much time has been wasted day after day by our habitual living.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>How could we give up our habitual living?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We need the Lord s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>On the one hand to see some practical light in this way is a pleasant thing, but on the other hand it is not a pleasant thing.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is why the Lord said we have to weep and we have to mourn Matt 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Look at the present situation among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Who is living Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Not only among the denominations, but even among us how little we live Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>It is altogether a pitiful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>How much has the Lord gained for His purpose even among us?</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>I m afraid not much.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We know a lot, yet we do not live Christ that much.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>So we need the mercy of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Only one thing is true, that is, to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>To live Christ requires us to drop everything, and the hardest thing for us to drop is our habitual living.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Don t think this means we need to be a mental case.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>I do believe the more we give up our habitual living, the more we will be sober.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Many times we are not sober; we are just habitual.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Many times the things we do are a waste of our time because of our habitual living; that is not sober.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>If we would drop our habitual living and gird our loins 1 Pet 1:13 , we would be sober.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>In our home we will sing and pray, and when we see each other and come together, we will sing, pray-read and psalm together.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>We all have to admit that nearly every day we are committing a kind of unconscious sin in our habitual living.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Hardly any of our habitual living is something that God wants us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>We simply do it unconsciously; we do it subconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>We just do it because that is our habit.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>I feel this is a very practical word.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>If we would drop our habitual living, all the sinful things will be gone; all the negative things will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>No time would be wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>To redeem the time Eph 5:16 is mainly to drop the habitual living.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>If you don t drop your habitual living, every bit of your habitual living is a waste of time.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Then spontaneously you will be a person praying unceasingly, praising your Savior all the day long.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>If you become a person like this you won t waste your time.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Also you will be so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>The more we live Christ the more we become simple.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>What I mean by being simple is that you don t know anything concerning anyone or any church or anything; you only know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Many among us know too much concerning others.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>They are like an information desk.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>If you want to know something concerning a certain brother, you go to that desk, and you can get the full information.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>But if you would drop your habitual living you would not know anything about any brothers or any churches.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Then you would never spread any death.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>You would never pass on any rumor.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>You would never be involved with any gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>But the point is this: you have been carried away from living Christ by your habitual living.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>This is the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>We all can testify that many days in the morning we had a good time in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>But right after the prayer we came to breakfast and our habitual living began.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>And this caused trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>Later in the morning and at noon we endeavored to have another time to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>After that we went back to the habitual living.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>Later during the day, we endeavored to have another time to be with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>We did this many times day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>What caused us this trouble?</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>Our habitual living.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>We don t condemn it, and we don t hate it.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>What wasted our time?</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>Our habitual living.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>I hope that we all may see a vision concerning this matter and that we would pray, Lord, have mercy upon me and deliver me from my habitual living.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>Lord, I don t like to have one wasted word out of my mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>I don t like to live a habitual life.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>I want to live a life of being watchful and on the alert minute after minute.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>I want to watch and pray with no idle word, no wasted word, no unnecessary word coming out of my mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>For many years I have been ministering the Word to God s people, yet I must confess I was there still so much in the habit.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>I don t mean in a bad habit.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>I must boast to you that for over fifty years I haven t had any bad habit.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>But I have a lot of habits that have wasted my time.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>We all must stand up against our habitual living.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>Stand up against your habit.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>Rise up against your habit.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>You must do this in order to be emancipated and released from your imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>Your habitual living is a strong imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>This applies even to functioning in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>Have you noticed that through all the years the functioning ones are the functioning ones, and the unfunctioning ones are the unfunctioning ones?</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>Sometimes in the prayer meeting we know who will pray tonight and who will not pray.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>You must realize that probably those who do not pray do not pray out of habit.</S>
   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>It is their habit not to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='179' RSNT='1' SNO='179'>Even with those who do pray, it may be only one-half spiritual and one-half habit.</S>
   <S PAR='180' RSNT='1' SNO='180'>Our meeting is not that normal because the brothers habits are there and the sisters habits are there.</S>
   <S PAR='181' RSNT='1' SNO='181'>The Texas brothers have their habit, the California brothers have their habit, and some particular ones have their particular habit.</S>
   <S PAR='182' RSNT='1' SNO='182'>I don t like to offend you or hurt your feelings, but this is our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='183' RSNT='1' SNO='183'>When you come to the meeting, you don t like to be bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='184' RSNT='1' SNO='184'>You just come to the meeting in your habit.</S>
   <S PAR='185' RSNT='1' SNO='185'>If a brother says, You need to function, you feel he is forcing you to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='186' RSNT='1' SNO='186'>This is a matter of our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='187' RSNT='1' SNO='187'>Disposition, character, and habit are three demons forming one company.</S>
   <S PAR='188' RSNT='1' SNO='188'>They are the board members of one company.</S>
   <S PAR='189' RSNT='1' SNO='189'>This is the executive committee of your being.</S>
   <S PAR='190' RSNT='1' SNO='190'>You are under this administration of your disposition, your character, and your habit.</S>
   <S PAR='191' RSNT='1' SNO='191'>So we have to rise up against these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='192' RSNT='1' SNO='192'>In the northeast there is a clear summer and winter season.</S>
   <S PAR='193' RSNT='1' SNO='193'>I notice that sometimes certain brothers and sisters also have seasons.</S>
   <S PAR='194' RSNT='1' SNO='194'>When some brothers are in the winter season, no one can open their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='195' RSNT='1' SNO='195'>They are absolutely frozen.</S>
   <S PAR='196' RSNT='1' SNO='196'>They become a frozen port.</S>
   <S PAR='197' RSNT='1' SNO='197'>After this winter season is over, though, summer may come and they get very excited.</S>
   <S PAR='198' RSNT='1' SNO='198'>Then they have not only a loud mouth, but they seem to have twelve mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='199' RSNT='1' SNO='199'>This is all habitual.</S>
   <S PAR='200' RSNT='1' SNO='200'>My point is this: the habitual living carries us away from living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='201' RSNT='1' SNO='201'>We fail to live Christ not because we are sinful, but because of our habitual living.</S>
   <S PAR='202' RSNT='1' SNO='202'>The most striking item of our habitual living is our talk.</S>

   <S PAR='216' RSNT='1' SNO='216'>To pray, to sing, to psalm is still something formal and not habitual to you.</S>
