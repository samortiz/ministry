<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Passing through the Dealings<br>to Know the Riches of the Lord's Life</H2><P>The life that all the believers receive is a rich life. Yet we do not realize how rich this life is. It is only when our outward shell is broken that we realize how rich the Lord's life is, and how it can achieve things that we cannot achieve.</P><P>During the war in Europe, one man was hit by forty-seven bullets. Yet he still lived. A man's body can take in as many as forty-seven bullets and yet still be alive. Some people are very healthy, and their bodies have never been cut once. These people have not yet found out the amount of abuse the body can endure. The riches of the Lord's life are beyond any of our imaginations. Hence, no one should feel sad about the trials that come upon him. Trials are there not only to test a man's faith; the purpose of these trials is for the Lord's life to be expressed. God measures to us all kinds of circumstances and environments in order that we will receive the benefit of knowing Him. Only those who have passed through the dealings will know God, and only those who know God will be able to serve Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Paying a High Price for the Lord to Have a Way</H2><P>Today, our outward man has to be broken before the inward man can be built up. We have to consecrate ourselves in a desperate way to the Lord before He will bring us through. If we do not put ourselves in His hand in a desperate way, the Lord will do nothing. There was once a sister who had an argument with her family, and she threatened to kill herself. She told everyone that she was going to jump into the river. The family followed her to the edge of the water. But when they saw her carefully holding up her skirts, they realized that she was not going to kill herself. Today, unless we are reckless in giving up everything, we will not have a way to go on. If a man worries about this and that, and if he always makes sure that he is not too much, and if he is always careful and afraid, he will not be able to go on. A man has to learn to pay the price in a desperate way. If we want to be a Christian, we have to be one in a desperate and thorough way. Today is the end time. We need desperate people. Otherwise, there will be no spiritual future for us. It is difficult for those who go halfway and who are reluctant and unwilling at heart to go on. Among us, we need to have some desperate ones to rise up. Only then will the Lord have a way.</P>
