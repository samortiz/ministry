   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BRIDE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Ephesians 5 we see the church as the Bride of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This aspect reveals that the church comes out of Christ, as Eve came out of Adam Gen 2:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church has the same life and nature as Christ and becomes one with Him to be His counterpart, as Eve became one flesh with Adam Gen 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eventually, as Eve went back to Adam and was presented to him, so the church will go back to Christ and be presented to Him as His Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eve typifies the church as Christ's Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eve was built with a rib taken out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After building this rib into a woman, God presented her to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What came out of Adam went back to him and became one with him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the same principle, the church comes out of Christ and will go back to Christ to be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A Matter of Love</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The aspect of the church as the Bride implies love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Marriage is a matter of love, and the life of a marriage depends on love.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If a husband and wife do not love each other, it will be very difficult for them to remain together.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No doubt, Adam and Eve loved each other.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because of this love, they became one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today there is a mutual love between Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not only do we have Him as our life and as our person, but we also enjoy this mutual love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ desires to make known His love to the church, and the church responds by telling the Lord how much she loves Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whatever we do for the Lord we do joyfully and willingly out of love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When you love someone, you are happy to serve him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You serve not out of necessity, but out of love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As the church, we must bear the testimony that we love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whoever contacts us should receive an impression that we love the Lord and, out of our love for Him, serve Him willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the aspect of the church as Christ's Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE HOUSEHOLD OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 2:19 Paul says, "So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow-citizens of the saints and members of the household of God."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As members of the household of God, we are God's family, even God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Both the Jewish and Gentile believers are members of God's house, which is a matter of life and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All believers were born of God into His house to enjoy His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our Real Family</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we have a genuine love for the Lord, we shall spontaneously be the church in the aspect of God's family.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>So many worldly people today are either orphans or wanderers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are homeless.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We in the church life are members of God's family.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, we are at home.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church is our real family.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We appreciate the natural family life created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But we can testify that this family life is not as sweet as the family life in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How pleasant is the church as God's family!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you stay away from the church life for a period of time, you will realize how precious the church is in the aspect of God's family.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Oh, we in the church are God's family!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The house of God leads to the kingdom of God, indicated by the term "fellow-citizens of the saints."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All the believers are citizens in God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His kingdom is a sphere for Him to exercise His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In 5:5 Paul says that "every fornicator or unclean person or person of unbridled greedy lust, who is an idolater, has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This refers not only to the millennium, but also to the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God John 3:5 and are in the church life, living in the kingdom of God today Rom 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Under God's Rule</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As we have pointed out, we are also God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the church we all are under God's government, God's authority and rule.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are not lawless.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the contrary, we are governed spontaneously in a pleasant and loving way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although there are elders in the churches, they do not exercise control over the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, all the saints are willingly under God's rule.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the church as the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If all the people in this country lived like this, the enemy would be completely subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the church we are under divine government.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because of an inward ruling, we cannot cheat others or take advantage of them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This inner ruling is the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today in the church Jesus Christ is King.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is the King on the throne within us and among us.</S>
