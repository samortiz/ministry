It cannot be sent to most of the localities in Kiangsu and Chekiang. Many readers have moved but have not notified us. Of course, we must bear some responsibility in this respect because The Christian is not published on schedule many times, and it is easy for the readers to forget. For now, we can only place the mailings into the Lord's hands.</p><p>Sister Shen Shi-kwei sent a letter from Shanghai on April 13 saying that her mother is recovering at home.
