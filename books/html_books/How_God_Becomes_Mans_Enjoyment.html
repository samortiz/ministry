 <h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
 <p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in the young people&rsquo;s meetings of the church in Taipei from August 3 through 16, 1961. The messages were originally published in Chinese in 1962 in <em>The Ministry of the Word.</em></p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">A TREE AND A RIVER</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE SCRIPTURAL BASIS OF<br />
GOD BECOMING MAN&rsquo;S ENJOYMENT</h2>
<p>God being man&rsquo;s enjoyment is related to a tree and a river. Immediately after God created all things and man, the Bible speaks of a tree and a river (Gen. 2:1, 7-10). A tree and a river are again spoken of at the end of the Bible (Rev. 22:1-2). Hence, we may say that everything related to what God is to man and to man&rsquo;s condition before God begins and ends with a tree and a river. God&rsquo;s relationship with man and man&rsquo;s relationship with God depend on a tree and a river.</p>
<p>Genesis 2:8-9 says, &ldquo;Jehovah God planted a garden in Eden, in the east; and there He put the man whom He had formed. And out of the ground Jehovah God caused to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, as well as the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.&rdquo; The tree of life was the central and most important tree in the garden.</p>
<p>After the children of Israel left Egypt, they came to Marah and could not drink the water, for it was bitter. So Moses &ldquo;cried out to Jehovah, and Jehovah showed him a tree; and he cast it into the waters, and the waters became sweet&rdquo; (Exo. 15:23-25).</p>
<p>Song of Songs 2:3 says, &ldquo;As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, / So is my beloved among the sons: / In his shade I delighted and sat down, / And his fruit was sweet to my taste.&rdquo; This signifies that the Lord Jesus is an apple tree to His lovers; His shade covers them, and His fruit supplies them.</p>
<p>John 15:1 says, &ldquo;I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus Christ is God incarnated to be a man. In this verse He said that He is the true vine and that the Father is the husbandman.</p>
<p>Revelation 22:2 says, &ldquo;On this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.&rdquo; Here <em>tree</em> is singular. In the New Jerusalem there will not be many trees; there will be one unique tree of life. Verse 19 says, &ldquo;If anyone takes away from the words of the scroll of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city, which are written in this scroll.&rdquo; According to this verse, the tree of life is the greatest blessing in the universe. If anyone takes away from the words of prophecy in the book of Revelation, God will take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city. This indicates that to not enjoy the tree of life is a very serious matter.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Bible, God put man in front of the tree of life. At the end of the Bible, a person&rsquo;s standing before God is related to the tree of life. If we despise the Lord&rsquo;s words and take something away from His words, the blessing of the tree of life will be taken away from us. In contrast, the Lord said, &ldquo;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God&rdquo; (2:7). This shows the importance of the tree of life in the universe.</p>
<p>The river is first spoken of in Genesis: &ldquo;A river went forth from Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four branches&rdquo; (2:10). This river went forth from Eden; that is, it went forth from God, for Eden was where God was. This river divided and became four branches, indicating that it had only one source, God, but it flowed in four directions to supply the needs of people in every place.</p>
<p>Psalm 36:8-9 says, &ldquo;They are saturated with the fatness of Your house, / And You cause them to drink of the river of Your pleasures. / For with You is the fountain of life.&rdquo; The river of God&rsquo;s pleasures is the river of water of life that flows out from God, the fountain of life.</p>
<p>John 4:14 says, &ldquo;Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.&rdquo; This proves that the water of this river is the eternal life of the Lord. Verses 37 through 39 of chapter 7 say, &ldquo;On the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive.&rdquo; According to these verses, the Spirit is the unique river that becomes rivers of living water in us.</p>
<p>Revelation 22:1-2 says, &ldquo;He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life.&rdquo; Here the river of water of life is with the tree of life. The Lord promises to give the spring of the water of life to those who thirst (21:6). Furthermore, the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd and guide those who serve Him to springs of waters of life (7:17). The river of water of life is an exceedingly great matter in the universe. God has promised that those who thirst will drink freely of the water of life, and the Shepherd will guide His sheep to the springs of the waters of life for them to drink.</p>
<p>The Bible repeatedly speaks of the wonderful tree of life and the river of water of life. The tree signifies the Lord Jesus, and the river signifies the Spirit. Everything related to our experiencing and enjoying God is included in this tree and this river. There is a hymn that says, &ldquo;The tree the glorious Christ does show... / The river does the Spirit show&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #509). The tree supplies man with food, and the river quenches man&rsquo;s thirst so that he may fully enjoy God. This is the story of God being enjoyed by man.</p><h2 class="head1">BASIC CONCEPTS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Intention Being for Man<br />
to Eat the Fruit of the Tree of Life and<br />
to Drink the Water of Life</h2>
<p>Most people have the natural concept that God is great with glory, honor, and majesty, that He is far above the earth, and that man is a creature who must worship and serve Him respectfully. Although this concept is good, it is a natural human concept; it is not the divine thought. The natural concept is far from God&rsquo;s intention and is unacceptable to God, because it is not God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire for man.</p>
<p>In Genesis God created the heavens and the earth in five days, and He created man on the sixth day. Then He put man in the garden of Eden. The word <em>Eden</em> means pleasure. According to the natural thought, after putting man in the garden of Eden, God should have demanded that man bow down and worship Him.</p>
<p>When religion speaks of God, worship and service are involved. But the first thing that the Bible reveals concerning God&rsquo;s relationship with man is not man worshipping God but God putting man in a garden in front of a tree near a flowing river. God did not speak of having a desire for man to worship and serve Him or for man to do something. What the Bible reveals is completely different from the religious concept. God put man in front of the tree of life with a river next to it. This indicates that man was to eat the fruit of the tree of life and drink of the river. Hence, man&rsquo;s first responsibility before God is to have a proper attitude toward the tree of life and the river of water of life. Man&rsquo;s condition before God depends upon how man deals with the tree of life and the river of water of life. Man&rsquo;s condition depends on whether he eats the fruit of the tree and drinks of this river.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man Needing to Eat and Drink God<br />
in Order to Be Complete</h2>
<p>After God formed Adam from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, Adam became a living soul (Gen. 2:7). However, Adam was still not complete; God determined that Adam needed to eat and to drink. Adam had to eat and to drink in order to maintain his life. This is the principle that we live by today: in order to be healthy, a person needs to eat and to drink. Therefore, eating and drinking are indispensable to man.</p>
<p>What man eats and drinks are what he becomes. For example, people who always eat beef smell like beef. Hence, we must pay attention to what we eat. The Bible says that &ldquo;man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God&rdquo; (Matt. 4:4), and it says that the Word is God (John 1:1). God did not tell Adam, &ldquo;If you worship and serve Me, you will live. In addition, you must love others and do good.&rdquo; Rather, God put Adam in front of the tree of life near a river. God wanted Adam to eat the fruit of this tree and to drink from the river so that he would live. The tree signifies Christ, and the river signifies the Spirit. Since God is in Christ and God is Spirit, He wants man to eat Him and drink Him, that is, to enjoy Him.</p>
<p>After God created man, He put Himself in front of man as the tree of life and the water of life in order for man to eat Him and drink Him. None of us is complete; we need God to supply us as food and make us complete. Without God as our food, life supply, and nourishment, we are incomplete. A person without God is an incomplete person, because he does not have life or satisfaction.</p>
<p>Every person has a body, a soul&mdash;which includes the mind, emotion, and will&mdash;and a spirit. Even a person who is highly educated has a sense that he lacks something. He does not lack material things; he lacks God. We need God to be our life, our nourishment, and our supply and thus to make us complete. A person without God is incomplete, deficient, and empty. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst&rdquo; (John 6:35). He also cried out, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink&rdquo; (7:37). These verses show that man is hungry and thirsty. Without God, man is deficient and incomplete. His life is incomplete because he lacks the eternal God.</p>
<p>A complete person is a person who gains God and enjoys God as his life supply and who lets God live in him. As a result, his disposition is desirable, his conduct is proper, and his life is complete. Such a person has been made complete by God.</p>
<p>God makes us complete by being our food and drink. A person cannot live without food and water; he must eat and drink daily. This shows God&rsquo;s intention in being the tree of life and the river of water of life. We need to eat and drink Him daily so that He can fill us and make us complete.</p><h2 class="head2">The Line of the Tree and the River in the Bible</h2>
<p>There are at least two verses in the Bible that speak of how man receives God as his enjoyment. Song of Songs 2:3 speaks of a person who knows and enjoys God as her Beloved, Husband, and Supplier. The believer in this verse compares her Beloved to an apple tree. She finds delight in His shade and sits down, and His fruit is sweet to her taste. Psalm 36:8 speaks of a person being saturated with the fatness of God&rsquo;s house and drinking of the river of God&rsquo;s pleasures. One verse speaks of God as a tree supplying fruit, and the other speaks of God as a river for man to drink.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John also speaks of man receiving God as his life and enjoyment. Hence, it says that the eternal God was incarnated so that He could become man&rsquo;s life and enjoyment (1:1, 14; 6:35; 4:14). On the one hand, John says that God is like a vine (15:1), and on the other hand, John says that God is like rivers of living water (7:38).</p>
<p>At the end of the Bible, the tree is with the river. Revelation 22:1-2 says, &ldquo;A river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life.&rdquo; The tree of life will be enjoyed in eternity by all those who have been saved by the grace of God. The tree of life grows on both sides of the river of life as an eternal blessing to those who have been saved by grace. The central thought of the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, is the tree of life and the river of water of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Tree Signifying Christ<br />
and the River Signifying the Spirit</h2>
<p>The tree signifies Christ, the embodiment of God, coming to be man&rsquo;s life. The river signifies the Spirit, the transfiguration of Christ, flowing into man as the water of life. God is embodied in Christ, and Christ has been transfigured into the Spirit (Col. 2:9; 1 Cor. 15:45). Now God is the tree of life to be man&rsquo;s food, and He is the river of water of life for man to drink. The tree and the river are God in Christ as the Spirit to be our life supply.</p>
<p>The Christian life is not a matter of worshipping or serving God, or of doing good, but of eating Christ and drinking the Spirit in order to enjoy God. If we eat Christ, we will spontaneously live out Christ, and if we drink the Spirit, He will flow out of us. God is not focused on our worshipping or serving Him or on our doing good. His intention is for us to eat and drink Him. God is embodied in Christ and realized as the Spirit for man to eat and drink. Therefore, the Lord said to the hungry and thirsty people, &ldquo;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst&rdquo; (John 6:35). He is the tree of life and the bread of life, and the Spirit is the river of water of life. God wants us to eat and drink Him so that He may become our life, our nourishment, and our supply. He is our completion; without Him we cannot be complete in this life or in eternity. Only by eating, drinking, and gaining the Lord can we be blessed and made complete.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S EXPERIENCE OF<br />
EATING, DRINKING, AND ENJOYING GOD</h2>
<p>Now we come to the experiential aspect of eating Christ as the tree of life and drinking the Spirit as the water of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man&rsquo;s Experience of the Tree of Life</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s introduction to the tree of life began in Genesis 2. After God created Adam, He put him in the garden of Eden. There were many trees in the garden, but in the middle of the garden there was the tree of life. God wanted Adam to eat of the tree of life.</p>
<p>Even though Adam had the highest created life, it was still only a created life; he did not have the uncreated, eternal life of God. Therefore, God put him in front of the tree of life so that he would contact and receive God&rsquo;s eternal life. The focus of the tree of life in Genesis 2 corresponds to the thought in the Gospel of John, which is that man would gain the life of God (1:4). Our first experience of the tree of life is regeneration, whereby we receive the life of God.</p>
<p>In Exodus 15 the children of Israel came to Marah, but they could not drink the water, because it was bitter. God showed Moses a tree to cast into the waters. Then the waters became sweet (vv. 22-25). This incident shows that in our journey through life the only way to be saved from bitterness, suffering, anguish, and misery is to cast the tree into the bitter waters, that is, to receive Christ into our bitter situations. Then we are healed from being bitter, and we become sweet and are able to rejoice and praise in our suffering.</p>
<p>Song of Songs 2:3 says that the Lord whom we pursue is as an apple tree. We can sit down in His shade to enjoy His covering, and we can taste of His fruit. This experience follows the experience at Marah. After we take the Lord into our sufferings, the Lord will change our bitterness into sweetness. The Lord will also become our enjoyment&mdash;He will cover us with His shade and supply us with His fruit so that we may have delight in His shade and sit down to enjoy the sweetness of His fruit.</p>
<p>John 15:1 says that the Lord is the vine. The emphasis of the vine is not our enjoyment of the Lord but our union with Him. We have become the branches of the vine; that is, we can experience an intimate union with the Lord. We were once without Christ, we were without hope in the world (Eph. 2:12), and our life was filled with pain. Then one day we received Christ, and our life became sweet. Now, when we seek Him, we can enjoy Him by sitting under His shade and tasting the sweetness of His fruit. Then we will enter into a life union with Him. He is the vine, and we are the branches. We have a life relationship with the Lord.</p>
<p>Revelation 22:2-19 reveals what the enjoyment of those who are saved by grace will be in eternity. In eternity the Lord will still be the tree of life for us to enjoy. We will enjoy this blessing for eternity. A person who does not enter into this blessing in this age will suffer eternal perdition. This blessing is the enjoyment of Christ as our food and supply for eternity.</p><h2 class="head2">Man&rsquo;s Experience of the Water of Life</h2>
<p>Our experience of the water of life is related to drinking the Spirit. We did not make up the expression <em>drink the Spirit.</em> First Corinthians 12:13 says that we were all &ldquo;given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; Verse 4 of chapter 10 says also, &ldquo;All drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.&rdquo; According to these verses, God&rsquo;s people can drink the Spirit who flows forth from Christ. When we drink the Spirit, we will have the following experiences.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being Convicted and Confessing Our Sins</h2>
<p>John 16:8 says, &ldquo;When He [the Spirit] comes, He will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment.&rdquo; Our experience upon drinking the Spirit is to see our sinful condition. Feeling sinful and being convicted of sin are proof that the Spirit has entered a person and is working within him. Believers often ask how to be filled with the Spirit. Being filled with the Spirit is not a matter of feeling excitement but of letting the Spirit search us and dig out our sins and shortcomings. If we are willing to receive His shining and to confess and deal with our sins one by one, the Spirit will be able to fill us.</p>
<p>Stanza 3 of <em>Hymns,</em> #250 says, &ldquo;I will dig by praying, / Dig the dirt entirely, / Thus release the Spirit, / Let the stream flow freely.&rdquo; The dirt in us is sin. As soon as we are saved, the Spirit indwells us; however, He cannot fill us, because we are still full of sin. This can be likened to a glass that cannot be filled with water because it is filled with dirt. The dirt must be emptied out before water can be poured in. The amount of dirt that is removed is the amount of water that can be poured into the glass. Water can fill the glass only when the dirt has been removed. We should ask ourselves whether we have ever thoroughly confessed our sins to the Lord even once.</p>
<p>It was eight years after my salvation that I had a thorough confession of my sins. In 1925 I repented and was saved. I knew that the Holy Spirit lived in me. However, it was not until 1933 that I began to confess my sins daily to the Lord. During that time, when I prayed, I cared for nothing other than confessing my sins. The more I confessed, the more there was to confess. I spent several days and nights confessing my sins until I sensed that I was free from the heavy burden of sin and was assured, refreshed, and uplifted in my spirit. I began to mount up with wings like an eagle (Isa. 40:31); I was full of joy within and could not stop singing and praising. That was an experience of being filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>There are believers who have been saved for many years but have not had a thorough confession of their sins. It is not that the Spirit does not visit them or shine on them but that they have refused to confess their sins. As a result, they are clogged by the dirt of sin.</p>
<p>I have spent a substantial amount of time before the Lord to consider the condition of the saints. Many saints, experientially speaking, are deadened in their spirit. Merely preaching doctrine is futile to these saints. They must be led to &ldquo;dig wells.&rdquo; It is not a matter of receiving the Spirit or of the Spirit coming upon them. These saints are closed; their soul is like a fortress, even though they appear to be without sins or problems. Such a condition makes it difficult for the Spirit to flow; thus, they need a thorough digging.</p>
<p>The river of water of life has flowed into us, but it cannot flow through us because we are closed, clogged, and unwilling to open and confess our sins. It is not that we do not have the sense of sin but that we refuse to confess our sins. If we are willing to confess a sin when the Lord shines on it, He will shine on something else for us to confess. If we confess this, He will shine on another item. This can be likened to a house that has not been cleaned for many years. Before it is cleaned, we may not see the dirt, but once we begin to clean it, we discover the filth that is everywhere. The house will look like new only after a thorough cleaning, that is, after all the filth is cleared away. This is the type of cleaning that we need.</p>
<p>Even though some of the saints are in their teens, they have accumulated sins. They profess that the Lord Jesus is their Savior, and they believe that He bore their sins on the cross, but they have never spent time to thoroughly confess their sins. Therefore, they are not living, and they have pushed the Spirit into a small corner so that He cannot move within them. The Spirit has no ground to reign in them. They initially drank the living waters for their salvation, but this water has not become in them a fountain flowing forth as rivers of living water (John 4:14; 7:38). Therefore, even though the Spirit is within them, they are poor and dry because the Spirit does not flow out as rivers of living water.</p>
<p>In order for the Spirit to flow out as rivers of living water, we must have a thorough confession of our sins. There is no other way. The Spirit is waiting for us to confess our sins. It might be that He has been shining on our sins for more than three years, but instead of cooperating with Him, we refuse to confess our sins. When the Spirit comes to us and we sense our sins, we should confess them immediately. This is the work of the Spirit (16:8). We should say, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me.&rdquo; If we receive more shining, we should continue to confess until we are filled with the Spirit. This is the kind of digging spoken of in <em>Hymns,</em> #250.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters who pray in a released way in the meetings are like unclogged passages for the Spirit. Other brothers and sisters, who pray faintly, are like smoking flax. These saints either do not pray often, or they are clogged because they have not confessed their sins in a long time.</p>
<p>If I were in a gathering where some saints prayed faintly, I would immediately pray, &ldquo;Lord, dig in us; dig away our sins. Empty us; empty our filth.&rdquo; I would also fellowship with them, saying, &ldquo;Brothers, if we have the Spirit&rsquo;s shining and a sense of condemnation, we need to confess our sins. We should confess whatever the Spirit shines on. We need to be cleansed of our sins. We must not confess in a general or vague manner but confess our sins item by item, just like settling an account. We should confess not only sinful words and deeds but also our sinful intentions and motives. We should confess until we realize that there is nothing good in us and that there is nothing good in our dealings with our parents, siblings, teachers, schoolmates, and especially with the Lord. We should confess our sins until we are ashamed, remorseful, sense our hopelessness, and see that our only recourse is to deliver ourselves to the Spirit. Then the Spirit can gain the ground to fill us and be poured out upon us. Furthermore, we will taste the rivers of living water and know what it is to drink of the Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">Glorifying the Lord Jesus</h2>
<p>When we drink the Spirit, He also causes us to exalt and glorify the Lord Jesus, that is, to praise and worship Him. John 16:14 says, &ldquo;He [the Spirit] will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Spirit works, we first sense the need to confess our sins. We should not think that everything is fine as long as we give the Lord Jesus glory and praise. We should call upon the Lord Jesus when we sense our sins. We must confess our sins until we no longer sense our sinfulness and are at peace. Then the Spirit will spontaneously lead us to offer praises to the Lord.</p>
<p>There is a Christian group that first leads a person to thoroughly confess his sins and then leads him to praise the Lord. Although this is not so accurate doctrinally, it is correct experientially. Those who have confessed their sins have an open heart and can immediately praise the Lord. When we praise Jesus the Lord, we experience the pouring out of the Spirit.</p>
<p>May we all have prayers of thorough confession. We should confess at night and in the morning until we are refreshed and unclogged, that is, until we no longer have any burdens, coverings, or blockages. Then we will see that the Lord Jesus is lovely, glorious, and worthy of our honor, praise, and worship. Not only so, the Spirit will be poured out upon us and will fill us; we will drink the Spirit richly and be saturated with the Spirit. Then rivers of living water will flow and overflow from within us to supply all those in need. This is the experience of the river. May the Lord lead us to have such experiences.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">EATING AND DRINKING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 6:35, 48-58, 63; 7:37-39; 1 Cor. 10:3-4; Rev. 2:7; 21:6</h1>
<p>In John 6:35 the Lord said to His disciples, &ldquo;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst.&rdquo; Even though the Lord spoke only of the bread of life, He addressed the problem of thirst as well as the problem of hunger. This proves that the bread of life is related to the water of life. The bread of life deals with the problem of hunger, and the water of life deals with the problem of thirst. In verses 48 through 51 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever; and the bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world.&rdquo; The Lord focused first on bread, and then on eating. He who eats the bread of life shall not die, and the bread is the Lord&rsquo;s flesh, which was given for the world to have life.</p>
<p>Verses 52 through 58 say, &ldquo;The Jews then contended with one another, saying, How can this man give us His flesh to eat? Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves. He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day. For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink. He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in him. As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me. This is the bread which came down out of heaven, not as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread shall live forever.&rdquo; The words <em>eats Me</em> in verse 57 are rendered as &ldquo;eats My flesh&rdquo; in the Chinese Union Version. However, the word <em>flesh</em> is not in the Greek text.</p>
<p>Verse 63 says, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; In chapter 7, verses 37 through 39 say, &ldquo;Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; Chapter 6 is concerning bread, and chapter 7 is concerning water. This means that chapter 6 is concerning eating, and chapter 7 is concerning drinking.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 10:3-4 says, &ldquo;All ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Revelation 2:7 says, &ldquo;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.&rdquo; In chapter 21, verse 6 says, &ldquo;I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely.&rdquo; Chapter 2 speaks of eating, and chapter 21 speaks of drinking. Even the end of the Bible is concerning eating and drinking.</p>
<p>We have looked at the tree and the river. Now we will consider eating and drinking. The Bible is different from every other book in the world. Classical writings in the world use profound and mysterious expressions or doctrines that are difficult to comprehend. The Bible is different. On the one hand, the Bible is profound, containing sentences such as, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word&rdquo; (John 1:1). On the other hand, the Bible is easy to understand, and it often presents the deep things of God with plain words. For this reason, when we give messages, we use very plain words to explain spiritual matters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S INTENTION BEING FOR MAN<br />
TO EAT AND DRINK HIM</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals a tree and a river as the means for man to enjoy God. We cannot partake of the tree or the river apart from eating and drinking. The fruit on the tree is food for us to eat, and the water of the river is a beverage for us to drink. According to the human concept, God is dignified and great; hence, we need to worship and fear Him. However, in Genesis God presented Himself to man, not as a dignified or great person but as a tree and a river. God&rsquo;s intention is to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life supply; therefore, man must eat and drink Him.</p><h2 class="head1">WORSHIPPING GOD<br />
WITHOUT EATING OR DRINKING HIM<br />
BEING VAIN</h2>
<p>I had the opportunity to visit Jerusalem, and I saw how Muslims worship. The old temple site in Jerusalem is occupied by the Arabs, who have built a great mosque on that site. The Muslims are more pious than Christians when they worship. First, they worship from morning to evening. All day long people are worshipping, and the elderly spend even more time worshipping.</p>
<p>Second, the Muslims are pious in their posture; they prostrate their whole body to the ground when they worship. This is different from Christians, who often only lower their heads and close their eyes. Moreover, the more time Muslims spend prostrating themselves, the more piety they show. Their worship is solemn and grave. Everyone has to remove his shoes, just as Moses did when he saw the burning bush on Mount Sinai (Exo. 3:4-5). This shows how pious their worship is outwardly.</p>
<p>Although Muslims are pious, they do not worship according to the true knowledge of God. They worship God, but they do not know God or His heart&rsquo;s desire; hence, they worship in vain. They do not know that God never intended for man to worship Him in such a way. They do not know that God is the tree of life and the river of water of life. The tree and the river are not for man to worship but for man to eat and drink.</p>
<p>Many of us have been Christians for a long time, and some have even been here since they were in the children&rsquo;s meeting. How many times have you gone to a meeting with the concept of eating and drinking God, not with the concept of worshipping Him? Have you ever said, &ldquo;Lord, I did not come to worship or venerate You but to eat, drink, and enjoy You&rdquo;? Do we have such a concept? Many Christians might condemn me and say, &ldquo;You are too daring and preposterous. How can man eat and drink God instead of worshipping or venerating Him? It is unimaginable that man can eat God!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1"><em>EATING THE LORD</em> <br />
BEING A BIBLICAL EXPRESSION</h2>
<p>While visiting the West in 1958, I spoke concerning eating and drinking the Lord. After the meeting, an American brother told me that he felt the expression <em>eating the Lord</em> was too crude. He also said that this expression was not in the Bible. I asked him to read John 6:57, where the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&rdquo; I told him that this translation is according to the Greek text. Thus, it is not that this expression is not in the Bible but that natural concepts have prevented believers from accepting it. A person who says that these words are crude disapproves of what the Lord Jesus said, for these are His words.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MEETING<br />
BEING TO EAT AND TO DRINK THE LORD</h2>
<p>For several decades the chapels in China have had a Worship Service Schedule posted on the door. About ten years ago it was changed to Worship Schedule. Now words like <em>service</em> and <em>worship</em> are rarely found; instead, there is a Meeting Schedule. However, God does not want us merely to meet; He wants us to eat Him and drink Him. We should not consider the meetings to be services for worship but for eating and drinking the Lord.</p>
<p>Suppose there is a tree with fruit that is good for food, and next to the tree there is a river. There is no point in our worshipping the tree and the river. If the tree and the river could speak, they would scold those who piously worship them, saying, &ldquo;We are here for you to eat and drink; we do not need your worship.&rdquo; We cannot touch God&rsquo;s heart by meeting near the tree of life and the river of water of life. God does not want us to merely meet; He wants us to eat and drink Him when we meet.</p>
<p>I hope that we will grasp the concept that God is a tree and a river and that we need to eat and drink Him. We have given many messages on eating, drinking, and enjoying the Lord, but I am afraid that we still have not clearly seen that God is a tree and a river and that our relationship with God depends on our eating and drinking Him. We must be impressed with this point.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BELIEVING IN THE LORD BEING<br />
TO EAT THE LORD</h2>
<p>According to John 6, to believe in the Lord is to eat the Lord. If we say that we believe in the Lord and yet we have never eaten Him, then our believing in Him is largely religious. It is not enough to look at a meal; we must eat it. However, this is the way that some saints believe in the Lord Jesus&mdash;in a religious way. My mother believed in Jesus and often told me that He is good, but I did not eat Him. Many saints also believe according to tradition and teaching, but they do not eat and drink the Lord.</p>
<p>The Bible says that we should eat the Lord. It is not enough to believe that food tastes good; we need to eat the food. The proper concept is to say, &ldquo;Lord, I believe in You, but my believing is focused on eating You. I love You by receiving You into me. I worship You by receiving You into me.&rdquo; Believing, loving, or worshipping the Lord without receiving Him will ultimately leave Him in the heavens. As a result, the Lord is the Lord, and you are you; He is still outside of you.</p>
<p>To believe in the Lord and to love and worship Him are to eat and drink Him, that is, to take the Lord in as our supply. Those who believe in Him, love Him, and worship Him by eating and drinking Him are those who contact the Lord. Those who do not eat and drink the Lord have little to no contact with Him. We must be deeply impressed that God is a tree and a river and that we must eat and drink Him. He is the bread of life and the water of life for us to eat Him and drink Him. This is the way to gain Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING AND DRINKING THE LORD CONTINUALLY</h2>
<p>Believing in the Lord for our salvation is a once-for-all matter, but eating and drinking the Lord is a daily matter. We need to eat and drink every day. It is possible that a brother who believed in the Lord ten years ago has not eaten the Lord since the day of his salvation. This is the experience of many saints. Some have not eaten the Lord for three days, a year, or even longer. I marvel that a believer can go without eating the Lord for so long and still be spiritually alive. Many believers are not living because their sins have not been confessed, but many more are dying of starvation and thirst. Any believer who has not eaten the Lord for two years is probably &ldquo;dead&rdquo; from starvation.</p>
<p>Eating and drinking the Lord are a daily matter that must not be interrupted or stopped. It is possible to quit a job or miss a class, but we cannot do without food and water. Similarly, a believer cannot say that he has believed in the Lord and that he understands everything about the Lord. It is not a matter of understanding or comprehending but a matter of eating and drinking. Our need is to eat the Lord, drink the Lord, and enjoy the Lord. Eating and drinking are continual and must not be interrupted.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD BEING SATISFIED ONLY<br />
BY OUR EATING AND DRINKING OF HIM</h2>
<p>Remember that the Lord is a tree and a river. He is the bread of life and the water of life. The Lord said that those who come to Him shall by no means hunger and that those who believe into Him shall by no means ever thirst (John 6:35; 4:14). The purpose of our coming to the meetings should not be merely to meet but to eat and drink the Lord. &ldquo;Come, for all things are now ready&rdquo; (Luke 14:17). The fattened cattle have been slain, and the wine has been pressed. Our only need is to come, eat, and drink. God does not want us to do anything. Nothing that we do can touch His heart. Only eating and drinking Him please and satisfy Him. He longs for us to eat and drink Him in every meeting. He longs for our prayers to be our eating and drinking of Him, for our reading the Bible to be our eating and drinking of Him, and for our fellowshipping with other saints to be our eating and drinking of Him. He wants every saint to eat Him, drink Him, and enjoy Him. Then we will be satisfied, and He will be satisfied. May the Lord be gracious to us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

<p>In the previous chapter we fellowshipped concerning eating and drinking, based on John 6. In this chapter we will say more concerning eating and drinking.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER CHRISTIAN FAITH INVOLVING<br />
EATING, DRINKING, AND ENJOYING CHRIST</h2>
<p>When we come before the Lord, we must see that He wants us to eat, drink, and enjoy Him; therefore, He is a tree and a river. We should not think that God wants us to be good, to do good, or to please Him. We must drop such concepts because they are from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and not from the tree of life. God does not want man to pay attention to good and evil. He wants us to focus on how He can be our life. He wants to feed us. He wants to be our food and our living water so that we may eat and drink Him in order to be satisfied. Then we will not only do good, but we will have a holy living. Holiness surpasses good, because holiness is God. God wants to feed us, fill us, satisfy us, and overflow from within us. This divine thought far surpasses the good that man focuses on.</p>
<p>We all believe that Christians should zealously preach the gospel, and we are often exhorted to be zealous for the gospel. I do not like to exhort others in this way, because zealous gospel preaching can often be merely behavior, which is of little value before God. Moreover, such behavior will not last, for the Christian walk is not mere behavior. The Christian walk is the expression of life. It is the expression of eating and drinking the Lord to our satisfaction.</p>
<p>There is no need to exhort a tangerine tree to bear tangerines. Such an exhortation is useless, for bearing tangerines is the spontaneous expression of the life within the tangerine tree. If the tree has water, good soil, fertilizer, sunshine, and air, it will spontaneously bear tangerines in abundance. If the tree does not have adequate water, soil, fertilizer, sunshine, and air, it will not bear fruit, no matter how much it is exhorted.</p>
<p>A brother who does not eat or drink God does not have any spiritual fertilizer or spiritual water. Exhorting him to preach the gospel zealously can be compared to exhorting a dead person to stand up. However, a brother who fellowships with the Lord daily, enjoys Him as his daily satisfaction, and lives because of Him is one who is filled with the Lord; hence, he does not need to be exhorted in order to preach the gospel. A brother who is filled with the Lord will have a fire burning within and will not be able to stop preaching the gospel. He will not be able to stop himself from overflowing with the Lord and expressing the Lord. This is the living of a person who is full of the divine life.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s concept is always related to outward behavior and doing things, but God&rsquo;s way is to enter into man in order to supply and transform him. God is both water and fire. He wants to enter into us and to cleanse and burn us. Then He can occupy us and be expressed through us. This is God&rsquo;s way, and this is the true significance of the Christian life. The Christian life is not a matter of behavior or of being good. The Christian life is a matter of Christ entering into us to be our life and life supply so that He can be expressed through us. The Christian faith is also not a matter of exhorting believers to honor their parents. We cannot honor our parents in ourselves; we need to allow Christ to fill us as our life by eating Him as our food and drinking Him as our living water. When we are filled with Christ, we will express Him by honoring our parents. This is the proper Christian life.</p>
<p>I hope that we can distinguish between behavior and the Christian life. Religion tells people to improve and cultivate their character. Christianity tells people that Jesus can change them. The proper Christian faith teaches people that Jesus Christ is their life, their food, and their living water. Hence, they need to receive Him by eating, drinking, and enjoying Him so that He will fill them, and they will live out His divine life. The chorus of <em>Hymns,</em> #509 says, &ldquo;God is in Christ to be my supply, / God as the Spirit nourisheth me; / If upon Christ in spirit I feed, / Filled with His life I&rsquo;ll be.&rdquo; When God lives in us, fills us, and occupies us, He will be expressed through us. This is glorious. The proper Christian faith involves eating and drinking Christ. This is the Christian life. It is a life of enjoying Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">CRUCIAL POINTS CONCERNING<br />
EATING AND DRINKING THE LORD IN JOHN 6</h2>
<p>In John 6 the Lord Jesus mentioned some crucial points concerning our eating and drinking Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Being the Bread of Life</h2>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life...This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die&rdquo; (vv. 48, 50). The Lord is the bread of life; hence, there is life within this bread. Those who eat this bread receive His life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Flesh Being Bread</h2>
<p>There is a turning point in verse 51. In this verse the Lord said, &ldquo;The bread which I will give is My flesh.&rdquo; Here bread becomes flesh. Bread comes from the vegetable life, but flesh comes from the animal life. In verse 51 the Lord turned from bread to flesh; that is, He turned from vegetable life to animal life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Blood Being True Drink</h2>
<p>The Jews did not understand what the Lord said; hence, they asked, &ldquo;How can this man give us His flesh to eat?&rdquo; (v. 52). The Lord Jesus then said, &ldquo;My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink&rdquo; (v. 55). In this verse the Lord spoke of His blood. The Jews should have understood the Lord&rsquo;s words because of their knowledge of the passover. During the passover every Jewish household killed a lamb, put the blood on the doorposts and the lintel, and ate the flesh of the lamb (Exo. 12:1-8). When the Lord spoke of flesh and blood, the Jews should have remembered the story of the passover. However, what the Lord said in John 6:55 went further than what the Jews did during the passover, because the Jews ate the lamb; they did not drink its blood. But in this verse the Lord said, &ldquo;My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In order for the Lord to be our food, He cannot be merely bread, which is of the vegetable life. If we had not sinned, it would have been sufficient for Him to be of the vegetable life. He would not be able to solve the problem of sin if He were merely of the vegetable life. God has ordained that without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness (Heb. 9:22). If the Lord were merely bread, there would be no shedding of blood, and as a result, our sins would not be forgiven. Unforgiven sins are a barrier that keeps us from contacting and enjoying the Lord. In order to deal with our sins, the Lord could not be merely bread. He had to be a lamb in order to be slain for the shedding of His blood. His blood had to be shed in order to wash away our sins. Then His flesh could be given for us to eat as our true food.</p>
<p>During the passover in Exodus 12, the children of Israel killed the passover lamb, ate its flesh, and put its blood on the doorposts and the lintel. The children of Israel ate the passover lamb with unleavened bread (v. 8). In the Bible leaven denotes sin (1 Cor. 5:6, 8). Eating unleavened bread signifies enjoying the Lord&rsquo;s sinless life. The Lord died and shed His blood to wash away our sins so that we may eat Him as the bread and thus enjoy His sinless life. Hence, eating the passover lamb with unleavened bread signifies eating the Lord&rsquo;s flesh and drinking His blood. It is important to see that in John 6 there is a turn from the vegetable life&mdash;wheat bread&mdash;to animal flesh. Only the animal life can shed blood, which is needed to solve the problem of our sins so that we can enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Every time we come to enjoy the Lord and sense our sins, we must realize that the Lord is not only bread but also a slain lamb. His blood solved our problem of sin so that we could eat His flesh. We must be clear that when we eat and drink the Lord, we are enjoying the One who was slain, whose blood was shed, and whose life was given for us. He said that His flesh is true food and that His blood is true drink. By His death and the shedding of His blood, He accomplished redemption and solved the problem of sin. Now He can be our food and our supply.</p>
<p>The first thing that we sense whenever we come to enjoy the Lord is our need for the cleansing of His blood. If we enter into His presence in the afternoon, we need the cleansing of His blood, even though we were cleansed in the morning. When we come before Him again in the evening, we need the cleansing of His blood yet again. We can come forward with boldness to contact and enjoy the Lord because He died, shed His blood, and gave His body for us.</p>
<p>We should always remember that we are still fallen sinners and that we have a fallen nature. If the Lord were merely the bread of life and not the Lamb of God who shed His blood, sinners such as we would not have the way to eat Him as bread. Our sins can prevent us from enjoying Him, but we thank and praise the Lord that He is not only bread but that He is also the Lamb that was slain for us. His blood was separated from His flesh; now He can say to us, &ldquo;My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">THE RESULT OF EATING AND DRINKING THE LORD</h2>
<p>In John 6 the Lord also spoke of the result of eating His flesh and drinking His blood.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Eternal Life</h2>
<p>A person who eats the Lord&rsquo;s flesh and drinks His blood has eternal life; that is, he has the Lord&rsquo;s life (v. 54). When a person eats lamb, the element of the lamb enters into him. Likewise, when we eat the Lord, His element enters into us to be our eternal life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having an Abiding Union with the Lord</h2>
<p>A person who eats the Lord&rsquo;s flesh and drinks His blood abides in the Lord, and the Lord abides in him (v. 56). This indicates a union. Those who eat the Lord&rsquo;s flesh and drink His blood enter into a union with Him. They abide in the Lord, and He, in them. There is a union between a person and what he eats. A person who eats fish is joined to the fish, a person who eats chicken is joined to the chicken, and a person who eats beef is joined to the cow. Although these illustrations do not sound pleasant, the principle is correct. We are joined to the Lord by eating and drinking Him. &ldquo;He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in him&rdquo; (v. 56). We abide in the Lord, and He abides in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living because of the Lord</h2>
<p>A person who eats the Lord&rsquo;s flesh and drinks His blood lives because of the Lord. &ldquo;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (v. 57). A brother has the energy to give a message because he eats breakfast, lunch, and dinner. He lives because of the food he eats. If he did not eat for three days, he would not have the strength to give a message. Similarly, when we eat the Lord, we have His life, we are joined to Him, He abides in us as our supply, and we live because of Him.</p>
<p>Many years ago the Chinese greeted one another by asking, &ldquo;Have you eaten to your satisfaction?&rdquo; This is a provincial expression, but it is according to the principle of life. A person who does not eat will not have the energy to live or to work. A person who is satisfied has the means to live, because he lives by what he eats. As Christians, we should care not only for being satisfied physically but also for being satisfied in our spirit. We should ask one another, &ldquo;Have you fed your spirit?&rdquo; We must eat the Lord until our spirit is satisfied so that we may live because of the Lord.</p>
<p>Believing in the Lord and obtaining His life is once and for all. But in order to live by Him, we need to eat Him every day. This is a very practical matter. I am not concerned about profound doctrines, but I want to ask, &ldquo;Do you eat and drink the Lord until you are full every day?&rdquo; We should not focus on understanding many doctrines, but we need to know this one fundamental matter: the Lord is the bread of life, and we must eat Him and enjoy Him daily.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TURNING FROM THE FLESH TO THE SPIRIT AND<br />
FROM THE SPIRIT TO THE WORD</h2>
<p>John 6 also tells us to turn from the flesh to the Spirit. After the Lord said that His flesh is edible and His blood is drinkable, there is another turn in the first half of verse 63: &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing.&rdquo; This verse shows that the word <em>flesh</em> in verse 55 does not refer to the Lord&rsquo;s physical flesh. Physical flesh cannot give us the Lord&rsquo;s life; it cannot enable us to live because of the Lord, and thus, it profits nothing. The Spirit can give us the Lord&rsquo;s life and enable us to live because of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord went on to say, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (v. 63). In chapter 6 there are three turns: from bread to flesh, from flesh to the Spirit, and from the Spirit to the word. The Lord first said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life&rdquo; (v. 48). Then there is a turn: &ldquo;My flesh is true food&rdquo; (v. 55). This is followed by another turn: &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing&rdquo; (v. 63), which is followed by yet another turn: &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (v. 63). We need to know the three turns in this chapter so that we will know what it means to eat and enjoy the Lord. In order to eat and enjoy the Lord, we must first see that He is the bread of life. This bread is the flesh of the One who died and whose blood was shed. However, this is not physical flesh; it is in spirit. Furthermore, the spirit is embodied in His words. His words are spirit. Thus, there are three turns: from bread to the flesh, from the flesh to the Spirit, and from the Spirit to the word. We may also say that to touch the Word is to touch the Spirit, and to touch the Spirit is to eat the Lord&rsquo;s flesh, and to eat the Lord&rsquo;s flesh is to eat the bread of life, which is to receive the Lord as our life supply. In order to eat the Lord, we must pay close attention to the Spirit and to the Lord&rsquo;s words.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; 4:24; 6:63; 16:7, 13-15; 20:19-22</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2>
<p>The content of the Gospel of John can be considered as an amplified explanation of Genesis 2:8-10. In these verses God put man in the garden of Eden. In the middle of the garden there were the tree of life and the river of water of life for man to enjoy. The tree of life denotes Christ, and the river denotes the Spirit. The Gospel of John also speaks of God as a tree and as a river in order to be man&rsquo;s life and enjoyment. The Lord is a vine tree (15:1), and the Spirit is a river (7:38-39). Therefore, the Gospel of John is concerning God in Christ as the Spirit to be our life and life supply. The chorus of <em>Hymns,</em> #509 says, &ldquo;God is in Christ to be my supply, / God as the Spirit nourisheth me; / If upon Christ in spirit I feed, / Filled with His life I&rsquo;ll be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gospel of John begins with the Word and ends with the Spirit. Verse 1 of chapter 1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; In verse 22 of chapter 20 the Lord breathed into His disciples and said to them, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; In the beginning of this Gospel God is the eternal Word. At the end of this Gospel God is the Spirit who was breathed into man and received by man. God is both the Word and the Spirit. In verse 63 of chapter 6 the Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit.&rdquo; This shows the relationship between the Word and the Spirit; the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit. God wants to give Himself to us for our enjoyment not only in Christ but also in the Spirit and in the Word.</p>
<p>How can we eat and drink God? How can we touch God? In order to give me a loaf of bread, you would simply need to hand it to me, and I would take it. That is quite easy. But how can we give God to others? We cannot show them the Lord Jesus, because He is not visible. In order for people to understand and to know the Lord Jesus, they need the Word. We can know the Lord Jesus through the Word, which is the gospel. He is also the Word who became flesh (1:14), and all that He is and has done are now in the Word. His person and His work, including how He was crucified, shed His blood, was buried, resurrected, and ascended, and all that He has obtained and attained are in the Word.</p>
<p>The Lord is also the Spirit. In Himself He is the Spirit and then the Word, but in our experience He is the Word and then the Spirit. The Word explains and reveals Him to us so that we may understand and know Him. The Spirit accomplishes within us what the Word has revealed and explained so that we may not only understand and know Him but also receive and enjoy Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD OF GOD BEING THE FOOD OF LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Man Needing to Live on the Word of God</h2>
<p>The Word of God is our spiritual life supply. Matthew 4:4 says, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.&rdquo; This is a quotation of Deuteronomy 8:3. God&rsquo;s words are more important than food. A man who lives only on physical food, not on God&rsquo;s Word, will not fulfill God&rsquo;s desire. It is not enough for a person to live on food; he must also live on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God. A proper person cannot live only on physical food; he must also feed on God&rsquo;s word. There is a great difference between those who feed on God&rsquo;s word and those who do not. Most people care for eating only the physical food. They neglect God&rsquo;s word, because they do not know that God&rsquo;s word is the food that man needs. The Lord Jesus&rsquo; words in Matthew 4:4 show that God&rsquo;s word is bread, our food.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus fasted for forty days, but He lived on the word of God (v. 2). He did not eat anything else. As a result, when the devil tempted Him to turn stones into loaves of bread in order to satisfy His hunger, He said, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.&rdquo; This verse indicates that the Lord did not need food in order to live. He needed every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.</p>
<p>When we are filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word, our spiritual sicknesses disappear. When we do not eat enough of His word and are spiritually malnourished, our sicknesses and problems return. As Christians, our problems are due to a lack of feeding on the word and being supplied by the word. When we eat and are filled with God&rsquo;s word, our problems are eliminated.</p>
<p>I can testify that when I am heavily burdened with problems or troubling matters and I eat God&rsquo;s word, the heavy burdens are lightened, the problems disappear, and I am comforted. It is often not enough for us to merely pray when we face problems; we must also eat God&rsquo;s word. If we would spend half an hour or more to eat and be filled with the word, we would be strengthened within, and our problems would be resolved. May we learn to eat the word. God is embodied in the word. When we eat Him, He will supply our needs. We should always remember that man cannot live on bread alone but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.</p><h2 class="head2">The Word of God Making Man Glad<br />
and Changing Man</h2>
<p>Jeremiah 15:16 says, &ldquo;Your words were found and I ate them, / And Your word became to me / The gladness and joy of my heart, / ...O Jehovah, God of hosts.&rdquo; When Jeremiah found God&rsquo;s words, he not only heard them, but he ate them as food. After he ate God&rsquo;s words, he was immediately supplied within and felt glad and joyful.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1948 I went to work in Foochow. After I finished giving a message, the saints gave me a glass of tangerine juice. Tangerine is a specialty of Foochow. As soon as I drank the juice, I was refreshed. For several weeks in Foochow I was very busy every day, and I was very tired. The tangerine juice that the saints gave me in the morning, at noon, and in the evening refreshed me. This impressed me with how much food and drink supply us. Likewise, when we eat the Lord&rsquo;s words, we are spiritually refreshed.</p>
<p>There is not one book in the world that has the ability to supply life. Only the Bible has such an ability because the words in the Bible convey the Spirit, and God is embodied in the word. Many believers have been supplied by the word of God. The word of God not only has the ability to supply man but can also change him completely. Just as the food we eat sustains our life, makes us healthy, and changes our constitution, so also the word not only gladdens and satisfies us but also gradually transforms us to the Lord&rsquo;s image.</p>
<p>Once a white man went to Africa and saw a native reading the Bible under a tree. The white man ridiculed the Bible and said that it was an outdated book of no value. The native looked at him and replied, while pointing to his own stomach, &ldquo;If it were not for this book, you would have already been in my stomach.&rdquo; Those natives were cannibals who were converted by the Bible. This shows that God&rsquo;s word is wonderful and powerful. A Christian who has believed in the Lord for years but has not had much transformation has not eaten enough of God&rsquo;s word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Speaking through Man</h2>
<p>Hebrews 1:1-2 says, &ldquo;God, having spoken of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son.&rdquo; God is pleased to speak through man. The words that God spoke through the prophets are the Old Testament. The words that God spoke through His Son are the New Testament. To this day God&rsquo;s Son is still speaking to us through the Spirit. Throughout the ages God has been a speaking God. He has not ceased speaking. This is His mercy, for when God does not speak, we do not have any way to know Him. God reveals Himself to us through His Word and supplies us with His word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Word Being Able<br />
to Supply Every Man&rsquo;s Need</h2>
<p>Hebrews 5:12-14 says, &ldquo;When because of the time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you what the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God are and have become those who have need of milk and not of solid food. For everyone who partakes of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness, for he is an infant; but solid food is for the full-grown, who because of practice have their faculties exercised for discriminating between both good and evil.&rdquo; <em>The oracles of God</em> refers to the words of God. All God&rsquo;s words are our food; some are like milk, and others are like solid food. If we are spiritually immature, that is, like children before God, God&rsquo;s word will be like milk to us. If we are spiritually grown, God&rsquo;s word will be solid food to us.</p>
<p>The Hebrew believers were spiritually immature; they were not full grown. Therefore, they could be given only milk to drink; they could not be given solid food to eat. The author of this book said that he could feed them only with the simple truths of God&rsquo;s word, but he could not supply them with profound truths.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 3:2 says, &ldquo;I gave you milk to drink, not solid food.&rdquo; Just as in Hebrews, in this verse both milk and solid food refer to God&rsquo;s word. The Corinthians could receive only milk, but they could not receive solid food. These verses prove that the word of God is food that can supply the needs of every kind of person.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:2 says, &ldquo;As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word.&rdquo; <em>Milk of the word</em> refers to God&rsquo;s word. This verse also shows that God&rsquo;s word is nourishing and digestible food, like milk, to the newly saved, who may eat of it and grow by it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A BALANCED ENJOYMENT</h2>
<p>God has given Himself to us as a tree and a river for our enjoyment. The tree of life is food for us to eat, and the river of water of life is living water for us to drink. We can eat God in His word and drink Him in the Spirit.</p>
<p>God is the Word. God is mysterious, incorporeal, intangible, and invisible. We cannot see Him, hear Him, smell Him, or taste Him. What we can perceive with our five senses is of no avail in relation to God. The way that God has prepared for us to know Him is by the Word. Every orthodox and proper word in the universe is an expression of God. Every proper and positive thing in the universe is also an expression of God. Thus, every positive and proper word that man can comprehend is out of God and explains God. God has been expressing Himself with words throughout the ages. The crucial points, principles, topics, and content that God has spoken throughout the ages are contained in the Bible. The Bible is God&rsquo;s Word. A person who wants to know God and touch God must come to the Bible. It is impossible to know God accurately without reading the Bible. A person cannot contact God without contacting the words in the Bible. God is the Word. Hence, man must read the Bible properly in order to know God, contact Him, and eat Him.</p>
<p>We can enjoy God through the Spirit. Everything created by God is balanced with two sides. God created man with a right foot and a left foot. Man also has two hands, two eyes, two ears, and two nostrils. Everything has two sides: a top and a bottom, a front and a back, a left and a right, and an inside and an outside. God wants man to enjoy Him as the Word and as the Spirit. The Word without the Spirit is dead letter. Therefore, God is the Word, and He is the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit and the Word cannot be separated. John 6:63 says, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit.&rdquo; During the exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt, a pillar of cloud was before them by day and a pillar of fire by night (Exo. 13:21-22). The pillar of fire and the pillar of cloud were not two things. At night this pillar shined like fire and was thus the pillar of fire. During the day it did not need to shine and was thus the pillar of cloud. The pillar of fire typifies the Word of God, and the pillar of cloud typifies the Spirit. God&rsquo;s Word is light and shines on us as a pillar of fire (Psa. 119:105, 130). The cloud is a symbol of the Spirit of God (Luke 1:35). The Holy Bible is the pillar of fire, and the Spirit is the pillar of cloud. Just as the pillar of fire and the pillar of cloud are one, so also the Bible and the Spirit are inseparable. The Bible that we read is in our hands, and the Spirit that we sense is within us. When the sense within is spoken forth, it is the word, and when this word enters into others, it becomes the Spirit. Without the Spirit, the Bible is dead, and without the Bible, the Holy Spirit is intangible. Without the Bible, the Spirit cannot be expressed. Without the Spirit, the words of the Bible are dry and dead; they cannot touch us.</p>
<p>We need to see that God is the Word and the Spirit and that He is in the Word and the Spirit. The Spirit and the Word are mingled and inseparable. It is difficult to say whether it is the Word that moves us or the Spirit who moves us. Under normal conditions the Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Word. Therefore, the Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit.&rdquo; The Bible conveys the Spirit, and the Spirit is the essence of the Bible. The greatest gifts that God has given to us are the Bible and the Spirit. God is the Word and also the Spirit. God is expressed in the Word and made real as the Spirit. Hence, we must learn to contact the Word and the Spirit with our spirit by reading the Bible and praying. Then we will enjoy God by eating and drinking Him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST BEING THE CENTER AND<br />
THE CONTENT OF THE WORD</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention is to give Himself to us for our enjoyment. Hence, He must be in the Word; otherwise, we would have no way to contact Him. The center and the content of the Word of God are Jesus Christ His Son. All the words that God has spoken have Christ as their center and the content.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE BEING THE EXPLANATION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Bible is the Word of God, and it is the explanation of Christ. The Lord Jesus said in John 5:39, &ldquo;You search the Scriptures,...and it is these that testify concerning Me.&rdquo; The function of the Bible is to testify concerning Christ. The Bible testifies concerning who Christ is, what is in Him, His being and His power, what He has done, what He will do, and what He wants us to receive.</p>
<p>Luke 24:27 says, &ldquo;Beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, He explained to them clearly in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.&rdquo; Verse 44 says, &ldquo;He said to them, These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all the things written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me must be fulfilled.&rdquo; The Lord spoke these words when He appeared to His disciples after His resurrection. The Law of Moses, the Prophets, and Psalms are the three sections of the Old Testament, that is, &ldquo;all the Scriptures&rdquo; in verse 27. This is the way that Jewish rabbis classify the sections of the Old Testament. The Lord said that the three major sections of the Old Testament speak concerning Him and must be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Verse 45 says that the Lord opened the minds of His disciples to understand the Scriptures. This shows that the Lord must open our mind in order for us to understand the Scriptures. Without Christ, we cannot understand the Scriptures. He is the key to the Scriptures. In other words, Christ is the only key that can open the Scriptures, because He is the center and the content of the Scriptures.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING GOD BECOMING EVERYTHING TO MAN</h2>
<p>On the one hand, the Christ who is the center and the content of the Scriptures is God. On the other hand, He is not only God, but He is God becoming everything to man. There is a difference between cooked rice and raw rice. Cooked rice is raw rice that has been boiled and is ready to be eaten. Before rice is cooked, it is still rice, but after it is boiled, it becomes cooked rice. This is the distinction between God and Christ. God can be likened to raw rice, and Christ can be likened to cooked rice. If God did not want us to eat Him, there would not be the need for Him to be embodied in Christ, just as raw rice would not need to be boiled if it were not for us to eat. After rice has been boiled and cooked, the raw rice cannot be found apart from the cooked rice. Thus, John 1:18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; This means that we cannot find God apart from Christ, just as when raw rice is boiled, we cannot find raw rice apart from cooked rice. Christ is God becoming our food, our &ldquo;cooked rice.&rdquo; If raw rice were not for us to eat, it would not need to be cooked. Likewise, if God were not for our enjoyment, He would not need to become the man Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Jews and Christians worship the same God, but there is a difference: Jews worship God apart from Christ, and Christians worship God in Christ. If we use our illustration, Jews eat raw rice, but Christians eat cooked rice. Although Jews worship the true, unique God who created the universe, they worship Him apart from Christ. Jews do not worship idols; they worship Jehovah, the Lord God who created heaven and earth and who is also the God of Abraham. Jews worship God apart from Christ. Christians also worship the unique, sovereign God of the universe, who is the God of Abraham, but they worship Him in Christ. We need to be clear concerning this difference.</p>
<p>We cannot deny that there is a God in the universe. Every human being must admit that there is a sovereign God in the universe. However, it is not easy for human beings to admit that the sovereign God is Jesus Christ. This is the difficulty we often encounter when we preach the gospel. The Jews, the chief priests, the scribes, and the Pharisees all believed in God when they crucified the Lord Jesus. The only charge they had against the Lord Jesus was that He called Himself God (Matt. 26:63-65; Mark 14:61-63; Luke 22:66-71). Even now, the Jews believe in God, but the God whom they believe in is not Christ. As a result, even though they believe in God, they cannot experience Him. God is objective to them, not subjective. In order for the objective God to become subjective to us, we must see that He is Christ. God is in Christ so that He can be our enjoyment. God must be in Christ in order for us to experience Him subjectively. Christ is God becoming everything to man.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Word of God and God</h2>
<p>John 1:1-2 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God.&rdquo; Verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; According to these verses, Christ is the Word of God. The Word that was in the beginning is Christ. If God did not have anything to do with man, He would not need to be the Word. If I go to a meeting but do not want to have anything to do with the saints, I do not need to say anything. However, if I intend to give a message, I will need to speak in order to express my inner feelings and intentions. Similarly, if God had nothing to do with man, He would not need to be the Word. God is the Word so that He can have a relationship with us, reveal Himself to us, appear to us, and declare and explain Himself to us so that we may know Him and have a relationship with Him. He must be the Word, and the Word is Christ. Christ is the Word of God. Christ is God coming to have a relationship with man.</p>
<p>Every thoughtful person can deduce that there is a God in the universe. However, neither Socrates in the West nor Confucius in the East knew God. These great philosophers could not know God, because they had neither seen nor heard the Word of God, Christ. Only those who have seen and heard Christ can know God Himself, for Christ is the Word of God. Socrates and Confucius were knowledgeable philosophers, but in matters concerning God, they knew less than any of our high-school brothers or sisters. Socrates did not know Christ, and Confucius did not know Christ; hence, they did not know God. But we know Christ; hence, we know God.</p>
<p>We must see that Christ as the Word of God explains and expresses God. A person who wants to know God should read the four Gospels. Then he will know the Lord Jesus who is God. The Christ who walked on the earth declared God. His declaration was a declaration of the likeness of God. God is so great, yet He is so lowly that He could wash men&rsquo;s feet (13:14). God is awesome, yet even little children could come to Him (Matt. 19:13; Mark 10:14). This is what Christ revealed. He is the Word of God, the manifestation of God.</p>
<p>According to John 1:1 and 2 and verse 14, Christ is also God. He is not only the Word of God, but He is also God Himself. When we touch the Word, we touch God. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God. Christ is the Word; hence, Christ is God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Embodiment of God and<br />
the Manifestation of God</h2>
<p>Christ is not only the Word of God and God; He is also the embodiment of God and the manifestation of God. John 1:14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh.&rdquo; This means that the Word became a man, Jesus the Nazarene. Some students may be afraid of their principal. If the principal were dressed as a common worker, the students would not be afraid of him and would speak with him, without realizing that he is the embodiment of the principal. This is an example of the Lord Jesus on earth. He did not care when He was reproved or humiliated by men. After His resurrection, He approached two disciples who were on their way down to Emmaus. The disciples said with condescension to the Lord, &ldquo;Do You alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem and not know the things which have taken place in it in these days?&rdquo; (Luke 24:18). They then told the Lord that their Teacher, Jesus the Nazarene, was crucified on the cross and placed in a tomb and that some had gone to His tomb and found it empty. The Lord Jesus behaved as though He did not know what they were saying and walked with them, listening to them. When they reached Emmaus, they constrained the Lord to stay with them. As He reclined at table with them, He took the loaf, blessed it, and broke it, and handed it to them. Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him as the Lord Jesus, but He disappeared (vv. 19-31). While they were unclear, the Lord walked with them. When they became clear, He disappeared.</p>
<p>Throughout human history there has been only one person who was the embodiment of God. This person was extraordinary and yet ordinary. On the one hand, He was so ordinary that it was hard for people to believe that He was the extraordinary God. On the other hand, He was so different that people had to confess that He was the extraordinary God. Jesus the Nazarene was ordinary. He was a carpenter who ate when He was hungry, drank when He was thirsty, slept when He was sleepy, and wept when He was grieved. He was an ordinary man. Yet He was the embodiment of God. Heaven and earth and all things came into being through Him (John 1:3). One day, while He walked as a weary man on the earth that He had created, He sat by a well, waiting patiently for a woman to come and draw water from the well so that He could ask her for something to drink (4:6-7). He was indeed ordinary. He was so ordinary that He wept (11:35). God, who was in the beginning, became a man who wept. This is inconceivable! God was embodied in a man.</p>
<p>Verse 18 of chapter 1 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; First Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;Great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh.&rdquo; These verses indicate that as the embodiment of God, Jesus the Nazarene declared God and manifested God in the flesh. When we read the Gospels, we must not forget that the Lord Jesus is a man and that He is the embodiment of God and the manifestation of God. Then every chapter of every book will be meaningful. He is a man, yet He is the embodiment and manifestation of God.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus came to the tomb of Lazarus and saw Mary and the Jews weeping, He also wept. The shortest verse in the whole Bible is &ldquo;Jesus wept&rdquo; (John 11:35). This shows that He is a man. But this man is the embodiment and manifestation of the great God. Therefore, the words <em>Jesus wept</em> are full of meaning. When we see a child weep, we do not take it to heart. If we were to see the president of our university weep, we would have some feeling. If we were to see the head of our nation weep, our feelings would certainly be touched. The person who stood in front of Lazarus&rsquo;s tomb wept. If we knew who He was and saw Him weep, we would be full of feeling. Regrettably, few people knew who He was that day, because He was embodied in a Nazarene.</p>
<p>We must remember that the Lord Jesus is the embodiment and manifestation of God. He could manifest God because He embodied God. He wept as the embodiment of God, washed His disciples&rsquo; feet as the embodiment of God, and was crucified as the embodiment of God. He is the Christ of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Mystery of God</h2>
<p>God is an indescribable mystery, but this mystery is in Christ. Christ is the mystery of God; He is the center of God. If we know Christ, we know the mystery of God, and if we have Christ, we can touch the center of God. Colossians 2:2 says, &ldquo;The mystery of God, Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Desiring Christ<br />
to Be Preeminent in All Things</h2>
<p>Once raw rice is boiled and becomes cooked rice, the raw rice exists only in the form of cooked rice; that is, the rice is available only as cooked rice. In other words, the cooked rice is preeminent. God is pleased to let His Son Christ be preeminent in all things. Since Christ is preeminent in all things, God is not associated with anything apart from Christ. Everything of God is also in Christ (v. 9). This shows the importance of Christ in God&rsquo;s intention and His plan. God has given everything to Christ so that we may enjoy Him. Colossians 1:18 says that Christ is the &ldquo;Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">All That Is of God Being in Christ</h2>
<p>All that God has is in Christ. Concerning Christ, the Son of God&rsquo;s love (v. 13), Colossians says, &ldquo;Who is the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation&rdquo; (v. 15); &ldquo;in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily&rdquo; (2:9); and &ldquo;in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden&rdquo; (v. 3). John 16:15 says, &ldquo;All that the Father has is Mine.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">All That God Is to Man Being in Christ</h2>
<p>All that God is to man is in Christ. God becomes our life in Christ, God becomes our light in Christ, God becomes our riches in Christ, God becomes our supply in Christ, and God becomes our comfort in Christ. Everything that God is, is in Christ. John 1:14 and 16 say, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality...For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.&rdquo; First Corinthians 1:24 says, &ldquo;To those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Giving Christ to Man</h2>
<p>John 3:16 says that God has given His Son Christ to man. First Corinthians 1:2 says that Christ is &ldquo;theirs and ours.&rdquo; Christ is ours; hence, we should rejoice and be merry. Verse 30 says, &ldquo;Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&rdquo; Christ being our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption indicates that He is our all. God does not give us things; rather, God has given us Christ so that He may be our all. This Christ who is everything to us is the center and the content of the Word of God. The Word of God reveals this glorious and rich Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST BEING THE CENTER AND<br />
THE CONTENT OF THE WORD</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING EVERYTHING</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that Christ is the center and the content of the Word of God. In this chapter we will use twelve points to show that as the center and the content of the Word of God, Christ is everything.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being Both God and Man</h2>
<p>God and man are the positive items in the universe. Christ is both God and man. We cannot know God unless we know Christ, and we cannot see a proper man unless we see Christ. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God.&rdquo; This verse speaks of Christ as the Word and as God. Romans 9:5 speaks of &ldquo;Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever,&rdquo; and 1 Timothy 2:5 says, &ldquo;The man Christ Jesus.&rdquo; These verses show that Christ is both God and man. The Lord Jesus is the eternal God. At a certain point in time, He, the eternal God, became flesh; that is, God entered into man (John 1:14). This person was both God and man. He then passed through death and resurrection and ascended into heaven. To this day, He is still a man in heaven. When Stephen was martyred, &ldquo;he looked intently into heaven and saw...Jesus standing at the right hand of God; and he said, Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God&rdquo; (Acts 7:55-56). According to 1 Timothy 3:16, God was manifested in the flesh. The word <em>flesh</em> refers to man. Hence, God&rsquo;s being manifested in the flesh is His being manifested in the man Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is God yet man, and He is man yet God. In Him God and man are joined together.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Father and the Son</h2>
<p>Christ is both God the Father and God the Son (John 14:9-10). The Father and the Son are not two separate persons. The Father is the source of the Son, and the Son is the expression of the Father. God hidden is the Father, and God expressed is the Son (1 Tim. 6:16; John 1:18); the two are in fact one. With human beings, a father and a son are two persons, but with Christ, He is both the Father and the Son. Therefore, He said that He and the Father are one (10:30). Isaiah 9:6 says that the Son who has been given to us is called the Eternal Father. The Son is the Eternal Father. This is exceedingly mysterious. It is incomprehensible and inexplicable.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Image of God and<br />
Having the Likeness of Man</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:15 says that Christ &ldquo;is the image of the invisible God.&rdquo; This means that when we see Christ, we see God. Apart from Christ we cannot know or even see God. Philippians 2:6-7 says, &ldquo;Who, existing in the form of God...emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men.&rdquo; This means that Christ also has the likeness of man. In Christ we see the condition of a normal man. In order to know Christ, we must see Him as the image of God and as the image of man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being Both the Creator and a Creature</h2>
<p>Christ is both the Creator and a creature. Colossians 1:15-16 says that He is &ldquo;the Firstborn of all creation, because in Him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him.&rdquo; Verse 16 says that Christ is the Creator, but verse 15 says that He is the Firstborn of all creation; that is, He is the first in creation, the first of all creatures. To become flesh is to become a man, and man is a creature. We cannot comprehend how Christ is not only a creature but also the Firstborn of all creation. He is the first creature. He existed first, and then God created man according to His image and likeness. This truth has caused many theological disputes. It is beyond what the human mind can comprehend, but we must accept Christ as both the Creator and a creature, according to the explicit words of the Bible.</p>
<p>If God were not for our enjoyment, there would not be a need for Him to be incarnated. God is in Christ. In order to be our enjoyment, that is, to have a relationship with us, His creatures, God was incarnated to be a man. He took the position of a creature. Hence, He is no longer only the Creator but also a creature. The person of Christ is very complicated. By Himself God is only the Creator; He is not a creature. However, when God was incarnated, He was still the Creator, but He became a creature. God in Christ has all the details related to being a creature as well as being the Firstborn of all creation.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Firstborn of All Creation</h2>
<p>Christ did not come into being after God created heaven and earth, the angels, and man. Before heaven and earth were, Christ is. Christ existed before heaven and earth were created. Therefore, Christ precedes all creation. He is the Firstborn, the first One, of all creation. As such, He has the first place in all creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Firstborn from the Dead</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:18 says, &ldquo;He is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things.&rdquo; First, Christ is the Head of the Body; He has the first place in the church. Second, He is the beginning of all things. Third, He is the Firstborn from the dead; He is the first to have resurrected from the dead. Therefore, He can have the first place in all things.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 15:20 says, &ldquo;Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.&rdquo; The word <em>firstfruits</em> shows that Christ was the first to resurrect from the dead. It is one thing for Christ to be the Firstborn of all creation, and it is another for Him to be the Firstborn from the dead. The word <em>creation</em> refers to that which was created. Christ is the first among God&rsquo;s creation. To resurrect from the dead means that the original creation died, was destroyed, and has come out of death, out of destruction. Christ is the first to have been raised out of death. Thus, Christ is the first in the original creation, and He is the first among those who have died and resurrected. Christ is the first in the old creation, and He is the first in the new creation. Christ is the first. There are only these two creations in the universe, and Christ is the first, the Firstborn, in both.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Head of the Church</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:18 says, &ldquo;He [Christ] is the Head of the Body.&rdquo; Since He is the Head, the church as His Body belongs to Him. Therefore, the church is upheld by Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Head over All Things</h2>
<p>Christ is not only the Head of the church but also the Head over all things. All creation takes Him as the Head. Ephesians 1:22 says that God &ldquo;gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being Lord</h2>
<p>Jesus is Lord of the universe. None of the founders of various religions have dared to call themselves Lord. Only Jesus, in whom Christians believe, is Lord. In the whole universe, only Christ is Lord. First Corinthians 8:6 says, &ldquo;To us there is...one Lord, Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Verse 3 of chapter 12 also says, &ldquo;No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Second Corinthians 4:5 says, &ldquo;We...preach...Christ Jesus as Lord.&rdquo; These verses declare that Christ is Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being All Things</h2>
<p>Colossians 3:11 says, &ldquo;Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; In this verse the word <em>all</em> can also be rendered &ldquo;all things.&rdquo; Since Christ is all things, He is all, and He is in all things. The sun speaks of Christ as our light, shining on us. Our need for food and drink speaks of Christ supplying us as our food and drink. Every positive thing in the universe speaks of Christ and declares the significance of Christ. Clothing speaks of Christ as our covering, and sleep speaks of Christ as our rest. We can comprehend the significance of Christ even by hearing birds sing and seeing flowers bloom. Every positive thing that we contact should turn us to Christ. Christ is in all things, and He is all things.</p>
<p>When a sister puts on her clothing, she should be able to say, &ldquo;Lord, I thank and praise You because You are my clothing. You cover my shame, and You are my beauty and glory.&rdquo; Every young sister likes to wear beautiful clothes. However, no matter what she wears, she should always say, &ldquo;Lord, You are my beauty and my adornment. You cover me more than these clothes do.&rdquo; This should be the prayer of every Christian.</p>
<p>When a brother eats a rich meal, he should say, &ldquo;Lord, You are my delicacy. May I enjoy You more than I enjoy food.&rdquo; Even when he goes boating, he should say, &ldquo;Lord, You are more secure than this boat; I will let You carry me through every wave.&rdquo; If we would know the Lord, we will discover that He is all things.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being in All Things</h2>
<p>Christ is all things, and He is also in all things (v. 11). This means that Christ is the reality of all things and that He is in all things. We can see Him in all things. We should appreciate this.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Filling All Things</h2>
<p>Christ is not only in all things, but He also fills all things. Ephesians 1:23 says that Christ is &ldquo;the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; It is one thing for Christ to be in all things and another for Him to fill all things. Christ is the One who fills all in all, and the church is His fullness, His expression.</p>
<p>There are some common elements in all things that signify aspects of Christ. The first common element is energy; there is energy in all things. For example, everything has atomic energy. The second common element involves principles; there are principles in all things. The third common element is an operating law; everything operates according to a law. The fourth common element is light; there is light in all things. These elements signify aspects of Christ. Christ is the energy, the principle, the law, and the light in all things. As the reality of all these elements, Christ fills all things.</p><h2 class="head1">ALL POSITIVE PERSONS, MATTERS, AND THINGS<br />
IN THE BIBLE<br />
SYMBOLIZING OR DENOTING CHRIST</h2>
<p>All positive persons, matters, and things in the Bible either symbolize or denote Christ. We will illustrate this with Genesis 1. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; We should see Christ in this verse. When God created the heavens and the earth, Christ created the heavens and the earth, for Christ is God (Heb. 1:2).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The earth became waste and emptiness, and darkness was on the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters&rdquo; (Gen. 1:2). The first half of this verse does not refer to Christ, because it describes a negative situation. The second half of the verse refers to Christ. The Spirit of God brooding upon the surface of the waters refers to Christ as the Spirit of life coming to produce life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God said, Let there be light; and there was light&rdquo; (v. 3). God&rsquo;s speaking is equal to Christ&rsquo;s speaking. What God spoke is the Word of God, and Christ is the Word of God. The speaker in this verse is God and Christ, and the words that were spoken are Christ. Light also signifies Christ (Matt. 4:16; John 8:12; 9:5)</p>
<p>&ldquo;God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day&rdquo; (Gen. 1:4-5). These verses speak of the separation of light from darkness. This refers to Christ separating the things of light from the things of darkness. The day is Christ, but the night is not Christ. Christ is light, and He is the day. Whoever has Christ has light and lives in the day. Whoever does not have Christ is in darkness and gropes in the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God said, Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters. And God made the expanse and separated the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse, and it was so. And God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day&rdquo; (vv. 6-8). The expanse in verse 6 is not positive. God saw things as good on every day of creation except for the second day. The expanse refers to the atmosphere, that is, the air that surrounds the earth. The air is not positive, because it is full of fallen angels; hence, the air does not refer to Christ. When Christ came, He separated the waters which were above the expanse from the waters which were under the expanse; that is, He separated the heavenly from the earthly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas; and God saw that it was good&rdquo; (vv. 9-10). The earth refers to Christ. A portion of the earth became the land of Canaan, which typifies Christ. The seas do not refer to Christ, for they are the dwelling place of demons and are therefore negative. According to Daniel 7:3 and Revelation 13:1, persons and matters that oppose God come up out of the sea. Therefore, God will eventually remove the sea, and it will be no more (Rev. 21:1).</p>
<p>Seas and the expanse are negative places, but the earth is a positive place. Dry land signifies Christ. Water in these verses represents death, but the earth represents life. The separation of the waters from the earth signifies the separation of death from life. This was a third separation. The first separation was the separation of light from darkness, the second was the separation of that which was above from that which was below, and the third was the separation of the waters from the earth. When the word of Christ reaches man, the Spirit operates within man to separate darkness from light, the earthly from the heavenly, and death from life. Then Christ will become the good land within man, and He will bring forth the riches of life.</p>
<p>The earth emerging from the waters also signifies Christ resurrecting from death to bring forth the riches of life. The earth came out of the waters on the third day, and Christ resurrected on the third day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God said, Let the earth sprout grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit according to their kind with their seed in them upon the earth; and it was so...And God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, a third day&rdquo; (Gen. 1:11-13). The earth refers to Christ, so the grass, herbs, and fruit trees that sprouted forth from the earth refer to the various riches of the divine life that issue from Christ. Therefore, we should see Christ in herbs and fruit trees. Christ is the grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died so as to bear much fruit (John 12:24). Christ is typified by the plant life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God said, Let there be light-bearers in the expanse of heaven to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years; and let them be light-bearers in the expanse of heaven to give light on the earth; and it was so. And God made the two great light-bearers, the greater light-bearer to rule the day and the lesser light-bearer to rule the night, and the stars. And God set them in the expanse of heaven to give light on the earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to separate the light from the darkness, and God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day&rdquo; (Gen. 1:14-19). We can see Christ in these verses. The sun denotes Christ. He is the Sun of righteousness and the rising sun (Mal. 4:2; Luke 1:78). The moon reflects the sun and refers to the church, for the church reflects Christ. The stars refer to those who are saved (Dan. 12:3; Rev. 1:20).</p>
<p>The light-bearers are heavenly. They are set in the expanse of heaven to give light to the earth. They are for signs and for seasons, for separating light from darkness, and for ruling over the day and the night. Christ and the church with the saints are heavenly light-bearers in a heavenly position, giving light to the whole earth, being for signs and for seasons, and separating day from night and light from darkness. This means that without Christ, the church, and the believers, everything in the universe is dark and confused. The Gregorian calendar is the Lord&rsquo;s calendar. Even those who oppose God and resist Christ have adopted the Gregorian calendar. Christ is the great light who establishes the days and the years. Only the church and the saints can bring seasons and feasts to the human race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living animals, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of heaven&rdquo; (Gen. 1:20). This also refers to Christ. Since water in this verse signifies death, letting the waters swarm with living animals is to bring forth life from death. This certainly refers to Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life. The birds that fly in the expanse refer to Christ in His ascended and transcendent life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God created the great sea creatures and every living animal that moves, with which the waters swarmed, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind; and God saw that it was good&rdquo; (v. 21). The creatures in the water signify the life of Christ that overcomes death, and the birds signify the life of Christ that transcends the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth. And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day&rdquo; (vv. 22-23). This refers to the resurrection life of Christ filling man and filling the earth. When we preach the gospel, the divine life is brought forth from death waters. According to God&rsquo;s view, people in the world are dead, but they are brought into life when they receive the gospel, just like the fish that swim in the sea. After they are saved, they are edified and grow in the church, just like birds that fly in the expanse and live in the heavenly realm. At this point, the life that overcomes death becomes the transcendent life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God said, Let the earth bring forth living animals according to their kind, cattle and creeping things and animals of the earth according to their kind; and it was so. And God made the animals of the earth according to their kind and the cattle according to their kind and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind, and God saw that it was good&rdquo; (vv. 24-25). Among the four living creatures in Ezekiel 1:10, the ox represents the cattle, and the eagle represents the birds. Creeping things, such as serpents and scorpions, are negative and refer to the devil and those who belong to him. The Lord Jesus gave His disciples &ldquo;authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions&rdquo; (Luke 10:19). To tread upon serpents and scorpions is to tread upon the devil and those who belong to him. None of the four living creatures have the face of a scorpion or a serpent, that is, of a creeping thing, because the creeping things are negative and do not denote Christ. Some animals are positive, and some animals are negative. The lion as the king of the beasts is positive and represents Christ (Rev. 5:5). Therefore, one of the four living creatures has the face of a lion, denoting Christ as the majestic and victorious King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth&rdquo; (Gen. 1:26). Christ is the image of God (Col. 1:15; Heb. 1:3). Hence, for God to make man according to His image was for Him to make man according to Christ. The Maker is Christ, God&rsquo;s image is Christ, and the man who was made signifies Christ. The man who was created was the first Adam, and Christ is last Adam (1 Cor. 15:45). Adam was the first man, and Christ is the second man (v. 47). God wanted man to have dominion over everything that He had created. This is spoken of in Psalm 8:4-8: &ldquo;What is mortal man, that You remember him, / And the son of man, that You visit him? / You have made Him a little lower than angels / And have crowned Him with glory and honor. / For You have caused Him to rule over the works of Your hands; / You have put all things under His feet: / All sheep and oxen, / As well as the beasts of the field, / The birds of heaven and the fish of the sea.&rdquo; Hebrews 2:6-8 applies this word to Christ&rsquo;s becoming a man and receiving all authority in heaven and on earth in order to exercise God&rsquo;s dominion in the universe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them&rdquo; (Gen. 1:27). The male life refers to Christ, and the female life refers to the church with the saints.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over every living thing that moves upon the earth&rdquo; (v. 28). We can see Christ and the church in this verse. Christ and the church will fill the earth and have dominion over the earth. God has not set the angels over the coming inhabited earth, but He has set Christ and those who are of Christ to fill the earth (Heb. 2:5-9; Eph. 1:22-23; Rom. 16:20).</p>
<p>&ldquo;God said, Behold, I have given you every herb that produces seed that is on the surface of all the earth and every tree which has fruit that produces seed; they shall be for you as food&rdquo; (Gen. 1:29). This verse refers to Christ and the riches in Christ. God has given all the riches in Christ to us as our food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To every animal of the earth and to every bird of heaven and to everything that creeps upon the earth, in which is a living soul, I have given every green herb for food; and it was so. And God saw everything that He had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day&rdquo; (vv. 30-31). This verse also refers to Christ. Everything God created in Christ was very good, and everything that was outside Christ was not good.</p>
<p>Genesis 1 shows that the Bible is full of the revelation of Christ and that Christ is the center of the Bible. If we read the Bible with this view, we will see that there are at least two hundred persons, matters, and things that denote Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING<br />
THE TRANSFIGURATION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Spirit is the transfiguration of Christ. In resurrection Christ was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit. Hence, the Spirit is Christ in another form. We can use the example of raw rice being boiled and becoming cooked rice. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three persons, and although the three are distinct, They are not separate but are one intrinsically. This mysterious God is described in a hymn: &ldquo;In person three, in substance all are one&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #608). Christ is God, and Christ is the Spirit. God is embodied in Christ, and Christ was transfigured in order to enter into us as the Spirit. We should be clear that the Spirit is the transfiguration of Christ.</p>
<p>In John 14:16-17 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus was with the disciples as their Comforter, but He asked the Father to give them another Comforter, the Spirit of reality, who would be with them forever. We know the Spirit because He abides with us and is in us. The Spirit operates in us, moves in us, guides us, and shines in us. He often goes against our feelings to correct us so that we would not do what others do and so that we would live an extraordinary life. We are not corrected by outward regulation but by the moving and operating of the living Spirit within us. Hence, we can know the Spirit. Such knowledge is not objective but subjective and spiritual.</p>
<p>Verse 18 says, &ldquo;I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.&rdquo; In this verse the Lord changed the pronoun from <em>He</em> in verse 17 to <em>I,</em> showing that the preceding <em>He,</em> the Spirit, is the succeeding <em>I,</em> Christ. Thus, the coming of the Spirit is the coming of Christ, and the Spirit being with the disciples is Christ not leaving them as orphans. The <em>I</em> is the <em>He,</em> and the <em>He</em> is the <em>I.</em> Verse 19 says, &ldquo;Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live.&rdquo; Here the Lord seemed to be saying that He would be killed and buried, but the disciples would still be able to see Him. This means that the Lord would resurrect and become the life-giving Spirit in order to live in the disciples; hence, He would live, and His disciples would also live. This fulfilled the word that He would be with His disciples. The Spirit who is in us to be with us is the Lord Jesus living in us. Verse 20 says, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; This means that as the Spirit, the Lord would have an intimate union with His disciples. They would be in Him, and He would be in them. When the Lord passed through death and resurrection, He changed His form. In resurrection Christ was transfigured from the flesh into the life-giving Spirit in order to enter into us as another Comforter and be with us so that we may live because of Him. The Spirit who entered into us is the Lord Jesus Christ who walked and lived among the disciples.</p>
<p>When I read the Gospels after my salvation, I envied Peter, James, and John because they were always with the Lord. I thought it would be a blessing to have lived with the Lord Jesus. Is it better to have the Lord&rsquo;s presence as Peter, James, and John did, or is it better to have His presence as we do today? If we could ask Peter, he might say that the Lord&rsquo;s presence after Pentecost was better than His presence when He walked on earth. We do not have the Lord&rsquo;s outward, visible presence, but we have His inward, invisible presence. Such a presence is more real, more intimate, and more wonderful than His outward presence. We have the Christ who was transfigured into the life-giving Spirit abiding in us.</p>
<p>John 20:19-22 says, &ldquo;When therefore it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and while the doors were shut where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them, Peace be to you. And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. The disciples therefore rejoiced at seeing the Lord. Then Jesus said to them again, Peace be to you; as the Father has sent Me, I also send you. And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord showed the disciples His hands and His side to prove that He had resurrected with a body. Then the Lord told the disciples that just as the Father had sent Him, that is, lived in Him to perfect Him, so also He was sending the disciples; that is, He was entering into the disciples to perfect them. After the Lord was transfigured into the Spirit, He entered into the disciples and was joined to the disciples. As a result, the sins they forgave, He forgave, and the sins they retained, He retained (v. 23). The Bible does not mention where the Lord went, because He was received into them as the Spirit. They received the resurrected Christ, because He had been transfigured to be the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE REALITY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>When we touch the Spirit, we touch Christ; when we contact the Spirit, we contact Christ. The Spirit is the reality of Christ. Christ is joy, peace, comfort, rest, life, and light, and the reality of joy, peace, comfort, rest, life, and light is the Spirit. The Spirit is the reality of all that Christ is; hence, the Spirit is the Spirit of reality. We can enjoy all that Christ is in a real way only by touching the Spirit.</p>
<p>John 16:13-15 says, &ldquo;When He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming. He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you. All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you.&rdquo; The Bible reveals at least two hundred items of the riches of Christ, but if these riches were not in the Spirit, they would be merely empty doctrines. We must touch the Spirit in order to enjoy Christ, because all of Christ is in the Spirit. All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ (Col. 2:9). All that the Father has is the Son&rsquo;s, and all that the Son has is received by the Spirit. Now the Spirit declares and reveals these riches to us by guiding us into all of Christ&rsquo;s reality. Therefore, the Spirit is the reality of Christ. We can touch the reality of all that Christ is only through the Spirit. Without the Spirit, we have no way to touch the reality of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Since the Spirit is the transfiguration of Christ and the reality of Christ, the Spirit is the Spirit of Christ. Romans 8:9 says, &ldquo;You are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.&rdquo; In this verse <em>the Spirit of God</em> and <em>the Spirit of Christ</em> are used interchangeably, indicating that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ. The Spirit of God who dwells in us is the Spirit of Christ, the transfiguration of Christ. When we have the Spirit of Christ, we have Christ, because the Spirit is Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE LORD SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:17-18 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit...But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; Verse 17 says that the Lord is the Spirit, meaning that the Lord and the Spirit are one; thus, the Spirit is also called the Lord Spirit. The Lord Spirit transforms the believers into the same image as the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING LIVING WATER</h2>
<p>John 7:38-39 says, &ldquo;Out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive.&rdquo; The Spirit who is within the believers is not only the reality of Christ. The Spirit is also living water for the believers to drink in order to quench their thirst. First Corinthians 12:13 says that we were all given to drink one Spirit. We can drink the Spirit. According to verse 4 of chapter 10, in the wilderness the Israelites drank the same spiritual drink, which is the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE ANOINTING OINTMENT</h2>
<p>The Spirit within us is living water and also the anointing ointment (1 John 2:27). On the one hand, the Spirit quenches our thirst because He is living water, and on the other hand, He soothes and refreshes us because He is the anointing.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BIBLE AND THE SPIRIT</h1>
<p>The beginning of the Bible shows that God is a tree and a river in order for man to eat, to drink, and to enjoy. However, in order for man to eat and drink God, He must be the Word and the Spirit. God is too mysterious for us to fathom; hence, we cannot touch or enjoy Him directly. We can know Him through His speaking to us. He explains Himself to us so that we may know and understand Him.</p>
<p>The Word enables us to know God but not to contact Him. Hence, God is not only the Word but also the Spirit. He is the Word in order to explain Himself to us, and He is the Spirit so that we may contact Him with our spirit. When we read His Word and contact Him with our spirit, what we understand in His Word enters our spirit. We enjoy God through His Word and the Spirit. His word is in the Bible; and He is the Spirit. Therefore, in this chapter we will fellowship concerning the Bible and the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Where can we find Christ? Christ is in the Bible. We must read the Bible in order to know Christ, and we must come to the Bible in order to touch Christ, for Christ is in the Bible. The Bible is the Word of God, and Christ is also the Word of God. The Bible is the written word, and Christ is the living Word. Without Christ, the living Word, as the content and reality of the Bible, the written word is dead letter and empty. Conversely, without the Bible, the written word, that describes and explains Christ, the living Word is intangible and difficult to apprehend. The Bible needs Christ as its content, and Christ needs the Bible as His revelation, His utterance. The Bible and Christ are inseparable.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said that He is the vine (John 15:5). Without the Bible, we would not know that He is the vine. We must read and know the Bible. Christ is the center, the content, the explanation, and the revelation of the Bible. Hence, if we do not read the Bible, we cannot know Christ. Some Christians have been saved for many years, but their knowledge of Christ is limited to the gospel that they heard at their salvation or to what their parents told them when they were young. Such a lack of knowledge concerning Christ is the result of not reading the Bible properly.</p>
<p>There are also Christians who spend a considerable amount of time reading the Bible, but they do not take Christ as its center. As a result, they see different things in the Bible. The kind of Bible a person has depends on the kind of person he is. For example, moralists see instructions and maxims in the Bible, men of letters see rhetoric, wives see a standard for their husbands to live by, and husbands see patterns for their wives to follow. Every person who reads the Bible has a pair of &ldquo;tinted glasses&rdquo;; thus, he sees things according to his concepts and does not see a revelation of Christ. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would see that Christ is both the center and the content of the entire Bible. We need a change in concept. We should have only one intention when we read the Bible, which is to seek, find, and know Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONTACTING THE SPIRIT IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Christ is the content of the Bible, and we can contact the Spirit with the Bible. We must not separate the Bible from the Spirit. The Bible is empty if we read it without our spirit. Many people in the world read the Bible and even commend the Bible, but they do not understand its content, because they do not contact the Spirit with their spirit when they read the Bible. In contrast, some elderly sisters, who are nearly illiterate, read the Bible slowly with their spirit and receive much inspiration and light. This proves that reading the Bible is a matter of the Spirit and that those who are not in the Spirit cannot understand the Bible. This was the case with the Pharisees, the scribes, and the teachers of the law (John 5:39). They were familiar with the Bible, but they did not understand its spiritual significance, because they were not contacting the Spirit.</p>
<p>Whether or not a person reads the Bible in the Spirit depends on whether he prays with his spirit. A brother who prays often in his spirit will pray when he reads the Bible. A brother who does not pray with his spirit will read the Bible entirely with his mind, and the Bible becomes dead letters to him. In order to know Christ, we must read the Bible. We must also pray in order to read the Bible with our spirit because Christ is the Spirit. Reading the Bible and praying is the way to enjoy God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TREE OF LIFE GROWING<br />
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE</h2>
<p>According to Revelation 22:1 and 2, the tree of life grows on both sides of the river of water of life. The tree of life refers to Christ and also to the Bible with Christ as its content. The river of water of life refers to the Spirit. Therefore, the Bible is life to us in the Spirit. God is rich and available for us to enjoy Him. The Bible is in our hands, and the Spirit is in us. Just as the tree of life grows alongside the river of water of life, we must not separate the Bible from the Spirit. We should let the Spirit move within us when we read the Bible. We should not ignore the Spirit when we read the Bible, nor should we focus on the Spirit while neglecting the Bible. We should focus on both the Bible and the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">READING THE BIBLE AND PRAYING</h2>
<p>We must read the Bible because it explains Christ, and we must pray when we read the Bible because the Bible is a matter of the Spirit. Hence, the simplest and most convenient way to enjoy God is through reading the Bible and praying. Every saint needs to establish a Bible-reading and praying life. It is beneficial to establish such a life while we are young. Such a life has eternal value because it enables us to enjoy our inexhaustible Christ daily.</p>
<p>We should be persistent to read the Bible and to pray. We cannot accomplish anything if we are impulsive. Here are four practical and effective ways to read the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Browsing</h2>
<p>To browse is to speed-read. Browsing can be compared to sightseeing. This is a general way to read the Bible. The more often we read the Bible this way, the better. The brothers can put one book from the Old Testament and one from the New Testament in their pocket so that they can read even while they ride to work.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Memorizing</h2>
<p>We should memorize the main points. When we read Genesis 1, we must remember that God restored the damaged universe and did a further work of creation in six days (1:2b&mdash;2:3). This is the main point. We should also have a general view of what He created on each day. Then we should select one or two important verses to memorize. For example, it would be beneficial to memorize Genesis 1:1, which says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth&rdquo; and verse 26, which says, &ldquo;God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Studying</h2>
<p>Studying is a way to read the Bible that is more time consuming and is not easy for students who are busy with schoolwork. The saints who can take the time should practice studying the Bible. There are many basic ways to study the Bible: by topics, words, prophecies, types, persons, or books.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Applying</h2>
<p>To apply the Bible is to take it as our food. This way involves reading and praying. To read and to pray is to digest what we read with prayer. We read the Bible, and we pray in the Spirit.</p>
<p>The way of memorizing can be incorporated into the other three ways. Browsing, studying, and reading with prayer can be done sequentially.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">READING THE BIBLE AND PRAYING</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will speak concerning reading the Bible and praying. Christ can be found in the Bible. We cannot know or touch Christ without the Bible. Furthermore, the Bible is a matter of the Spirit. We must pray with our spirit to touch the spiritual realities in the Spirit. Our reading of the Bible and praying must be in coordination. There are some basic points related to reading the Bible and praying.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BASIC CONCEPTS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Purpose of Reading the Bible<br />
Being to Seek Christ</h2>
<p>Every Bible reader should be clear that Christ is the center and the content of the Bible. Since the Bible is the explanation of Christ, we should seek Him when we read the Bible. The Bible also reveals Christ to us so that He would be our supply. Therefore, when we read the Bible, we should not merely seek to know about Christ; we should also seek to gain Christ as our supply. We do not want only knowledge or doctrines concerning Christ. We want the revelation of Christ, and we want to be supplied with Him through the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Focusing on Supply, Not on Teaching</h2>
<p>We should focus on being supplied by the Bible more than we focus on being taught by the Bible. It is undeniable that there are a considerable number of teachings in the Bible. We should pay proper attention to these teachings. However, our intention in reading the Bible should always be to receive a supply.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Center of Our Supply</h2>
<p>Christ is the center of our supply. The Bible can supply us in various ways because it is an all-inclusive book, but we should always take Christ as the center of our supply. When we read the Bible, our focus and intent should be to gain Christ as the center of our supply.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO PRACTICE</h2>
<p>Here are some practical points related to reading the Bible.</p>
<p>We should not read too fast or read too much. To receive a supply from the Bible, that is, to digest the Bible, is different from browsing, or speed-reading, mentioned in the previous chapter. If we read too fast or too much, it is unlikely that we will receive a sense from the Spirit, nor will we be able to absorb anything. Hence, when we come to the Bible to receive a supply, we should read slowly and contact the Spirit with our spirit. When we receive a spiritual sense from the Word, that is, sense the anointing in our spirit, we should pause and turn the spiritual sense, or anointing, into prayer. This is the way to use our spirit and absorb the supply of Christ in the Bible. After praying, we can continue to read. When we receive another sense in our spirit, we should again stop and pray. We should read and pray in this way until we are satisfied and filled in spirit.</p>
<p>We should not be pretentious when we pray; rather, our prayer should follow the sense of the Spirit. We do not need to worry about uttering complete sentences. We should pray in a spontaneous manner so that we cannot truly distinguish between our praying and our reading, for the two are incorporated into one. When we are concerned with our utterance or use set expressions, we will lose the sense of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Reading and praying can be practiced individually and in groups. The saints will receive more benefit if they can meet together regularly and practice reading and praying. The sense of the Spirit is richer when we read the Bible in groups. Furthermore, we are saved from peculiar practices and from falling into individual spirituality.</p>
<p>God intends to be our enjoyment through the tree of life, signifying Christ, and the river of water of life, signifying the Spirit. Christ is found in the Bible, and the Spirit is in our spirit. Reading the Bible and praying are the means for us to know Christ and contact the Spirit so that we can enjoy our bountifully rich God. This is God&rsquo;s intention for man, and this is the greatest blessing from God. May the young people begin now to practice reading the Bible and praying so that they can enjoy the riches of God.</p></body></html>
