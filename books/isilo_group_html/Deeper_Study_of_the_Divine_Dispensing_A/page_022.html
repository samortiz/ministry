Daily He is turning within us in a gentle and fine way. If you contact Him, you will receive the enjoyment. If you ignore Him, you will miss the enjoyment. Very few Christians see this matter. For this reason, we need to ask the Lord to enlighten our understanding and to turn our prayer, so that we will not beg in a poor way anymore. We must praise and thank Him, saying, &#8220;Lord, I thank You. You are the law of the Spirit of life, and You have entered into me and remained in me from the first day until now. You have never ceased &#8216;turning.&#8217; Lord, praise You, You are still operating in me today in many ways.&#8221; The Triune God is operating in us daily. This operation is a gentle, refined, and fine dispensing of Himself into all of us.<p>Tonight we have all eaten some food. When the food enters into us, there is an operation. This operation is our digestion, and this digestion is a law operating in our body. The goal of this law and this operation is to dispense the food bit by bit into our body so that the nutritious elements can be assimilated little by little by our body. The Lord told us clearly in the Gospel of John that He is the bread from heaven. When we eat of Him, there will be an operation within us, enabling us to live by Him (John 6:35, 50-51, 57-58). He also told us that He is the living water. We can drink of Him freely, and He will quench our thirst (John 4:14; 7:37). This also is an operation within us. This operation is His dispensing.<p>Furthermore, the Lord revealed to us that He is the holy breath, and that we can breathe Him in (John 20:22). This holy breath is the Holy Spirit, who also is the Triune God Himself. He continues to operate and to breathe out, in order that we can continually breathe in and enjoy Him. In this way, there is an organic union between Him and us, a union in which He continually dispenses and we continually receive. In the end, we will lack nothing and will grow in God&#8217;s life through the increase of His dispensing in us. Today, within every one of us there is such a law. The Triune God is not only our life, but He is also a law that is full of operations in order to continually dispense Himself into us.<h2 class=head2>Allowing the Law of the Spirit of Life to Operate</h2><p>Furthermore, Romans 8 tells us that there is another law within us, the law of sin and of death in our flesh. This law causes our body to become weak and to be powerless in carrying out the will of God. It also causes us to be strong and vigorous in doing things that offend God. This law is the law of sin, and it is also the law of death. When these two are added together, we become powerless in doing good and insensitive in doing evil. This law of sin and death is just Satan in our flesh. When man sinned, Satan entered into man. However, when we believe in the Lord, another law enters into us, which is the Triune God coming into us to be our life. This life is not in our flesh but in our spirit. Today, it is very easy for man to sin. As soon as the law of sin and of death works a little, man will spontaneously lie and deceive. Actually, it is not we who are doing these things; it is the law of sin and of death that is doing the work within us. In the same way, within us there is now another law, the law of the Spirit of life. This law is a person, the Triune God. He regulates within us day by day. We do not need to ask Him to help us. As long as He operates, everything will be well. He is not far from us; He is not high up in heaven. Rather, He is within us. For this reason, we must learn to hand ourselves over to Him and allow Him to be everything to us. He is life within us, and He is also a law within us.<p>We know that every life has its element, nature, capacity, effect, and form. In addition, every life can propagate. The peach tree has the element of the peach. Based on its element, it has its nature, and this nature produces a capacity. This capacity brings in an effect, which causes the peach tree to bring forth peaches. Moreover, the peaches bear a form, which determines their particular shape. In the same way, we human beings have the element, the nature, the capacity, the effect and the form of the human life. This is true not only with our physical life, but even with our spiritual life. If we allow the Triune God to carry out His refined and gentle dispensing within our tripartite being every day, we will grow and multiply by His growth within us.<p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Sib, Malaysia on October 27, 1990)<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>A Deeper Study of the Divine Dispensing &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
