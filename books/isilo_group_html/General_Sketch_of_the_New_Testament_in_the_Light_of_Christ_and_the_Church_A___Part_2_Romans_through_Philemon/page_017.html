Here we have the body, the soul, and the spirit. We must present our bodies, be transformed in our soul, and learn how to be fervent, that is, burning in spirit in order to function. By practicing these three steps, we have the real, practical experience of the Body life, the church life. The church life depends on our presenting our bodies in a definite way. It also depends on our being transformed in our soul by the renewing of the mind in order to understand God&#8217;s will in the entire universe, which is to have the church, the Body. In addition, it also depends on our being burning in our spirit to function as a member of His Body. If we do these things, then we will be in the practical experience of the Body life.<p>For the church life we need to present our bodies, be transformed in our soul, and be burning in spirit for our function in the Body. Our function is an important matter in Romans 12. Verse 4 says, &#8220;All the members do not have the same function,&#8221; and the following verses tell us how to function. Even to show mercy and to extend hospitality to others is a function (vv. 8, 13). To do these things indicates that we are active members, not inactive ones. If we are active members who function all the time, the Body life will be very practical. If we do not function but merely meet together again and again, we will not have a real and practical church life. The genuine and practical church life depends on the function of the members. Romans 12 is a chapter on the Body, but it is the Body in function.<h2 class=head2>God&#8217;s Will Being to Have the Body Life</h2><p>Romans 12:1-2 tells us to present our bodies a living sacrifice and be transformed by the renewing of the mind &#8220;that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect.&#8221; This verse speaks of &#8220;the&#8221; will of God; the King James Version renders it as &#8220;that&#8221; will of God. God does not have many wills but only one will. What is the one will? In speaking of the will of God, many Christians wrongly apply this verse. Strictly speaking, this verse indicates that the will of God is to have the church life. If we mean business with the Lord, present ourselves bodily to Him, and are willing to be transformed in our soul-our mind, emotion, and will-we will realize what God&#8217;s will is in this universe and on the earth. God&#8217;s will is nothing less than to have the church, that is, to have a Body for His Son. When we see this, we will sacrifice everything for it, because we will realize that this is the unique will.<p>The more we read these verses, the more we can realize that this is what they mean. By reading the entire context of Romans 12 we can realize what &#8220;the&#8221; will, or &#8220;that&#8221; will, of God is. It is to have the Body life, the church. This is the will of God. Of course the will of God includes other things, but all the other matters are secondary. The primary item of God&#8217;s will is the church. No matter how good we are or how many things we do, if we are not in the church, if we do not practice the church life and live for the church, we are not in the will of God. I say this with certainty; we will be outside of the will of God, even though we are doing something for God.<p>Although the things mentioned in chapters twelve through sixteen may be considered the &#8220;wills&#8221; of God, the Body life is the foremost item. Chapters fourteen and fifteen tell us how to receive others, how to care for others, and how to avoid stumbling others, but all these matters are secondary. They depend on our practice of the church life. The first item that is revealed in chapters twelve through sixteen is the church, the Body, and all of the following items are supplementary to this will. Therefore, to prove what the will of God is, is to practice the church life. If we are proper members of the Body, acting and functioning in the church life, then we will have everything else. We will be persons in the will of God.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>General Sketch of the New Testament in the Light of Christ and the Church, A - Part 2: Romans through Philemon &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
