   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another matter is the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Those who know Christ according to outward appearance do not really know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The only real knowledge is the knowledge in reality.</S>

   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They seemed to know the Lord Jesus, but actually they did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Their knowledge was outward and superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who truly knew the Lord Jesus were the ones who touched the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Their knowledge was in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must consider a little more from the Bible concerning this point because this is a very basic experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, men knew Him in two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One was knowledge according to appearance, and the other was inward knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let us first consider the meaning of knowing Him according to outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Jews knew the Lord Jesus according to His outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They held on to their presumptuous attitude from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They said, "Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John 6:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They were very confident.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since they knew His father and mother, they thought that they knew Him as well.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Lord Jesus came into His own country, they said, "Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And are not His sisters here with us?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Mark 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They knew not only the Lord's parents, but His brothers and sisters as well.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But did they really know the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No, they did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although they knew the Lord's parents, they did not know the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although they knew the Lord's brothers and sisters, they did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They judged who the Lord was by His outward appearance, and they did not touch the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Another group of people knew the Lord a little deeper than the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But they still did not know Him in an inward way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the Lord was in Caesarea Philippi, He asked the disciples, "Who do men say that the Son of Man is?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They said, "Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets" Matt 16:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was much more advanced than the knowledge of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some said that the Lord was Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Elijah was a powerful prophet; he can be considered as a symbol of power.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus was indeed an Elijah; He was a most powerful prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Others said that the Lord was Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Jeremiah was a weeping prophet; he can be considered as a symbol of emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord Jesus was indeed a Jeremiah, one who was full of emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When He rebuked the hypocritical scribes and Pharisees, He repeated eight times, "Woe to you" 23:13-16, 23, 25, 27, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When He saw some selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers sitting there, He poured out the money of the moneychangers and overturned their tables John 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was truly an Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When He was with the tax collectors and the sinners, He feasted with them Matt 9:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When He sat down in the house of Simon, He allowed a woman to weep over His feet Luke 7:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When He saw Mary weeping and the Jews who came with her also weeping, He sighed in His spirit, and wept also!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>John 11:33, 35 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was truly a Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But whether others called Him Elijah or Jeremiah, this knowledge was still outward knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The disciples' knowledge of the Lord Jesus in the beginning was outward knowledge; they did not have an inward knowledge of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Men like Thomas and Philip were with the Lord for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Humanly speaking, they should have known the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Yet they did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord clearly said, "Where I am going you know the way."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yet Thomas said to the Lord, "Lord, we do not know where You are going; how can we know the way?"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>John 14:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord clearly said, "If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But Philip said to Him, "Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Jesus that Thomas knew was only a Nazarene; Thomas did not know the Jesus of life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Jesus that Philip knew was only a Nazarene; Philip did not know that He was the embodiment of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although Philip and Thomas were with the Lord, their knowledge of Him was only outward; they did not touch the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although the disciples knew the Lord a little better than the Jews, they did not know what kind of Lord He was.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord was with them for a long time, but they still did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They saw the Lord with their own eyes, heard Him with their own ears, and touched Him with their own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But they still did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This shows us that in knowing the Lord, one needs an organ that is sharper than the outward eyes, clearer than the outward ears, and more sensitive than the outward hands.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>With Christ, there is a reality, and this reality cannot be discerned by outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>One day Peter had inward knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When the Lord asked, "Who do you say that I am?", Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Immediately, the Lord said, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens" Matt 16:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord meant, "You have been following Me for so long, yet your knowledge in the past was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, your knowledge today is a blessed one, because flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but My Father who is in the heavens has revealed it to you."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This knowledge was real.</S>
