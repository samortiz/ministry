   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>o Christ Acknowledging the Ignorant Israel</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eventually, Joseph acknowledged his ignorant brothers 45:1-4, 14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I believe that the time is near when Christ will acknowledge the ignorant nation of Israel Rom 11:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The acknowledgment of the United Nations does not mean anything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What counts is Christ's acknowledgment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The day is coming when Christ will tell the world, "Don't touch the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whoever touches her touches the apple of My eye.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Israelites are My brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>p Eventually Recognizing Christ</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Joseph's brothers eventually recognized him 45:15 , and the Israelites will eventually recognize Christ Zech 12:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Until they recognize Him, Christ will continue to deal with them patiently.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Recently I read that some Jewish scholars have begun to study the case of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It seems that these scholars are eager to learn more about who Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead of acknowledging the Jews now, Christ is giving them a further time to consider Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These Jewish scholars who are studying the case of Jesus admit that Christ has gained a great deal of credit for the Jewish people, for Christ came from the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was and still is a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If Christ had come out of your country, you certainly would be proud of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we keep all these points in mind as we follow the news in the Middle East, we shall be happy and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All that is happening today was foreshadowed in Joseph's dealing with his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In a sense, what we are seeing today is a motion picture of what has already taken place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even as I am speaking about these chapters in Genesis, the events foreshadowed in them are taking place in the Middle East.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What is happening today is the fulfillment of what is portrayed in this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Praise the Lord for His wisdom and patience!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He knows what He is doing with Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In not too long a time, Christ will make an open recognition of the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He will do this by descending from the heavens to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Savior out of Zion will come to the land of Israel and recognize the nation of Israel as His nation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now we come once again to a parenthesis covering certain matters on the line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I love the line of Joseph as a type of Christ, but, as far as I am concerned, the line of life is more practical.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The line of the type concerns Israel, but the line of life concerns you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although there were many clear indications of Joseph's identity, his brothers could not recognize him because of their blindness and preoccupations.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because his brothers were so blind and ignorant of him, Joseph was compelled to take a further step to reveal himself to them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Joseph must have prayed concerning his dealing with his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He did not deal with them according to his personal feelings or desires, but according to the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whatever Joseph did to his brothers was according to the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No one else could have had the patience Joseph had.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we have pointed out, it took twenty-two years for his dreams to be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After such a long period of time, Joseph had an intense desire to see his father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How could a man have had such patience?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How could he have been able to control his emotion, his love, and his desire to see his father?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Joseph's patience and self-control must have been of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the last test, at least one of Joseph's brothers, Judah, had improved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is indicated by the way he spoke to Joseph about taking care of their father and their youngest brother 44:18-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When Joseph's brothers sold him, they hated him and did not care for their father or youngest brother.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, they acted according to their hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the way Judah spoke to Joseph indicated that he cared about his father and his youngest brother.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This touched Joseph very deeply and convinced him that his brothers had learned their lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, immediately after this, Joseph acknowledged them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Prior to this time, the brothers were still learning the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The lessons were not completed until at least one among them had improved and had learned to care for his father and youngest brother.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Until that time, Joseph exercised great patience in testing his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In my opinion Joseph should have revealed himself to his brothers immediately after feasting with them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, he did not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Instead, he charged his steward to fill their sacks with grain and to return their money 44:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No doubt Joseph's brothers were happy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If I had been one of the brothers, I would have said to the others on the way back to Canaan, "What do you think about that ruler?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Why was he so nice to us?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He is the ruler of the whole earth and we are foreigners coming to buy food.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Yet he invited us to his home and feasted with us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He even gave Benjamin a portion five times greater than what he gave the rest of us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Moreover, he seated us according to our birth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What is this all about?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Who is this man?"</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I believe that Joseph expected his brothers to talk like this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He expected them to thoroughly consider him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But they were careless and they did not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There must have been certain features of Joseph's face that would have enabled them to recognize him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But his brothers were too blind to notice them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Suddenly, much to their surprise, the steward caught up with them and said, "Wherefore have ye repaid evil for good?"</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>44:4, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He then accused them of stealing Joseph's cup.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The brothers replied, "Wherefore saith my lord these words?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?"</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>44:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>According to Joseph's plan, the cup was found in Benjamin's sack 44:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This should have caused the brothers to wonder why that ruler in Egypt paid so much attention to their youngest brother.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Joseph's brothers were terrified.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As 44:13 says, "They rent their clothes, and loaded every man his ass, and returned to the city" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When they saw Joseph again, "they fell down before him on the ground" 44:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This also should have reminded them of Joseph's dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>However, they still did not understand what was happening to them.</S>
