   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. To Mingle God with Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>That God and Man May Be One</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The purpose of the incarnation is also to mingle God with man that God and man may be one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are not one with God merely by being in company with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why it is more meaningful to say that we and God are one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead of always saying that we are one with God, we should learn to say that we and God are one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But even to say that we and God are one is still not fully adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to say that we and God are one by being mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because of the wrong teaching of Eutyches in the fifth century, most Christian teachers dare not to say that God and man are mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Eutychians denied the distinctness and coexistence of Christ's divinity and humanity, and they asserted that the two natures were merged into one, resulting in a third nature being produced see Concerning the Person of Christ, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>10-11, published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But this teaching is in contradiction with the revelation of the Holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to see the wonderful truth in the Bible concerning the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to Leviticus 2:4, the fine flour mingled with oil as the meal offering is a type of Christ as the One who was a mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although oil and flour are mingled into one, they are still two in nature; they are not merged into one to become a third nature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus told us that He is the vine and we are the branches John 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We were born of God to be the branches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have been grafted into Christ Rom 11:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Grafting is a matter of mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the branches of one tree are grafted into another tree, the two become one not just by joining but by mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The two plants are mingled to become one plant.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In other words, the two lives are mingled to become one life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The meal offering in Leviticus 2:4 is made of fine flour mingled with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Two elements are mingled together to be one entity, but without a third element being produced.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The English word mingled means that two elements are combined together but that they remain distinguishable in their elements.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The meal offering is of two elements, the element of oil and the element of fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No third element is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The truth of mingling can also be seen in 1 Corinthians 6:17, which says that "he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates the mingling of the Lord as the Spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The divine Spirit dwells in our human spirit, and these two mingle together as one spirit.</S>
