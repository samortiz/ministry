   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ANNUAL TRAININGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I am very happy about these annual trainings because many truths were not put out according to inspiration, but according to the books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The speaking in a conference just depends upon the speaker s burden.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A series of messages are given to release that burden and all these messages cover certain points.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They do not, however, serve the purpose of educating the saints or building up the saints in the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To study our way through the books of the Bible, however, does not allow us to pick up our burden to put out something in the way of inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, it forces us and even regulates us in the line of the truth according to the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For instance, in Matthew there is the basic truth of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I do not believe that any conference speaker would pick up a burden with an inspiration to speak about the truth of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This would be very rare.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When you make a decision to cover all the books of the New Testament, though, you cannot avoid covering the truth in its entirety.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I must truthfully testify that if I had not been writing the notes on the books of the Bible, I would never have had an inspiration to give messages on the book of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I do not believe any burden would have come to me to give a conference concerning the books of Mark or James.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the first eleven years I was in the United States, all the messages I gave were concerning Christ, the Spirit, the human spirit, the ground of the church, and the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I even very rarely quoted anything from the book of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we came to Mark in the Life-study of the Bible, I was wondering what I was going to write.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I had no choice and I was forced to write something.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to my realization, however, the trainings on the Epistles of Peter, the Epistles of John, and the books of Mark and James were in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The best trainings were these trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The light came just by my being forced to write the notes on these books.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I was never so clear about 1 John as I was during the training on this book.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I still have a clear bird s-eye view of 1 John.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The subject of this book is the fellowship of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is divided into three parts: the fellowship of the divine life 1:1 2:11 , the teaching of the divine anointing 2:12-27 , and the virtues of the divine birth 2:28 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The virtues of the divine birth comprise three items: to practice the divine righteousness 2:28 3:10a , to practice the divine love 3:10b 5:3 , and to overcome the world, death, sin, the Devil, and idols 5:4-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a bird s-eye view of the wonderful book of 1 John.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to my consideration, the best of all the trainings we have had was the one on the book of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This exceeded all the others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If I was not compelled to get into Mark, I would have never touched it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This shows that we are partial in our studying of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are not balanced, but by studying the books of the Bible in a definite way we have no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every book is God-breathed so we must study them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE NEED TO BE EDUCATED</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>IN THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Despite all the trainings we have given covering the entire New Testament, I realize that still the saints in the Lord s recovery in the United States have not been helped to be so knowledgeable of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In other words, they have not been helped to come into the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I discovered that even many of the positive ones in the Lord s recovery cannot present the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For example, many of the saints in the Lord s recovery are not able to present the matter of sanctification clearly to people in a doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the saints in the Lord s recovery need to be those who preach the gospel, teach the truth, and minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I discovered that so many dear saints have the heart to do this, yet when they begin to preach, teach, or minister life, they have nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They have nothing as the gospel, the good news to impart something to others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They have the desire to teach the truth, but they do not have the materials constituted into their being to talk about.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many saints treasure the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They would tell people, We are standing on the church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you do not have this, you will be divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the other people ask what the church ground is, many of the saints have little to say.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The outsiders do not know what the ground of the church is, and neither do many of us know.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A person may be attending a denomination for twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Eventually he is not able to preach even a little of the gospel because he was not trained or raised up in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many have been sitting in the pews of denominations for every Sunday morning service for over twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Eventually, after twenty years they cannot teach people about one spiritual subject.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our concept when we were there in the denominations was that it was not our obligation to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That was not our duty, but that was the duty of the preachers or of the pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We never had the thought of being able to teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even in our homes we could not teach our own children.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We just encouraged them to go to the service.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This principle is nearly the same with us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Most of the saints have been sitting with us for years appreciating all the messages as a treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Through all the ministry of the Word they received the help point by point, but they are not capable in presenting the items of the truth to others.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must admit that here we have a great lack and a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I did say in the past that everyone can be an apostle, but if you do not have the knowledge of the biblical truths, how could you be an apostle?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Also, to be an elder you must be appointed by the divine truth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Until you have the knowledge of the divine truth you are not adequate or qualified to be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even the elders in most of the churches cannot present the truth adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must see that we are short in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If all of the approximately eight thousand saints in the Lord s recovery in the United States would be educated in this way, we would have eight thousand apostles preaching, teaching, and ministering the divine truths.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The actual situation, however, is not like this today, so I think we have to wake up.</S>
