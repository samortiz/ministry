In Revelation there are three main categories of overcomers that are included in the bride as the aggregate of the overcomers: the man-child, the firstfruits, and the late overcomers. All of these three categories as an aggregate form the bride of Christ.</P><P>According to Revelation 19:8, the bride is clothed in fine linen, which is the righteousnesses of the saints. The garment with which the bride is clothed is a wonderful garment. In our Christian life we should have two garments: one corresponds with the objective righteousness, which is for our salvation, and the other with the subjective righteousnesses, which are for our victory.</P><P>Our first garment is the garment of salvation that we receive when we first believe in the Lord. This is seen in Luke 15 with the prodigal son. When he came back to the Father, he was clothed with the best robe (v. 22), which typifies Christ as the God-satisfying righteousness to cover the penitent sinner. This is our objective righteousness that we receive when we believe in the Lord as referred to in 1 Corinthians 1:30.</P><P>But there is another garment that we need to experience which will qualify us to inherit the kingdom of the heavens to be in the wedding feast with the Lamb. This second garment is a garment of embroidered work by the Holy Spirit. In Psalm 45 the queen has two garments that each of us needs to have (vv. 13-14). First, she has a garment of wrought gold. This signifies Christ as our righteousness for us to be justified by God. The other garment that the queen wears is one of embroidered clothing. This is equivalent to the wedding garment.</P><P>Day by day we need to experience the embroidering of the Holy Spirit. This is the detailed, fine experience of Christ in our human life. When we cooperate with the Lord to love the Lord, we experience the indwelling Christ being lived out of us in our conduct. This living out of Christ becomes a garment to us that qualifies us to enter into the kingdom of the heavens, into the wedding feast of the Lamb. This garment is the overcoming and surpassing righteousness (Matt. 5:20) of the saints.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_064.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_066.html">Next</a> </body></html>
