<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1>
<p>On September 20 through 25, 1959, the church in Taipei held a gospel conference in a rented stadium. During this conference six messages were given by Witness Lee, and over the course of the conference more than four thousand three hundred people filled out name cards to indicate that they had received the Lord. Three weeks prior to the conference the entire church gathered several times. During these service meetings Witness Lee gave messages to help the saints to be proper persons to preach the gospel. In the week following the gospel conference four additional meetings on the truth of the gospel were held.</p>
<p>The first section of this book, chapters 1 through 13, is composed of notes from various messages related to the gospel conference. Chapters 1 through 3 consist of fellowship given in preparation for the gospel conference, chapters 4 through 9 contain the six gospel messages spoken during the conference, and chapters 10 through 13 contain the messages given after the conference on the truth of the gospel. The second section of this book, chapters 14 through 28, is composed of a series of gospel messages and of messages on perfecting the believers. The dates of these messages are unknown. Based on references included in chapters 17 and 24, this series of messages was probably given in 1949 or 1950. Since the messages in the second section are similar in nature to those in the first section, they have been compiled and published together.</p>
