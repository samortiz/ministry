   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Transformation is the result of sanctification and is related to man s soul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Transformation means that a substance changes in nature and form.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is an inward change in nature that causes an outward change in form.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A PROCESS OF METABOLISM</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This type of change is a metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not just an outward change, but a change in inward constitution as well as in external form.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This change occurs by the process of metabolism.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the process of metabolism an organic element filled with vitamins comes into our being and produces a chemical change in our organic life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This chemical reaction changes the constitution of our being from one form into another.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suppose that a person has a very pale complexion and that someone else, wishing to change his colorless complexion, applies some coloring to his skin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This, no doubt, produces an outward change, but it is not an organic change, a change in life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How then can a person truly have a colorful face?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By daily absorbing into his body healthy food with the necessary organic elements.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because your body is a living organism, when an organic substance enters into it a chemical compound is formed organically by the process of metabolism.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Gradually this inward process will change the coloration of your face.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This change is not outward; it is a change from within, a change resulting from the process of metabolism.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A NEW ELEMENT REPLACING THE OLD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the process of metabolism a new element is supplied to an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This new element replaces the old element and causes it to be discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, as the process of metabolism takes place within a living organism, something new is created within it to replace the old element, which is carried away.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Metabolism, therefore, includes three matters: first, the supplying of a new element; second, the replacing of the old element with this new element; and third, the discharge or the removal of the old element so that something new may be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through the process of sanctification, the new element of God s life is added into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This new element replaces our old, sinful and dead being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a continuation of God s salvation within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to be in this process from the day we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>IN OUR MIND, EMOTION, WILL</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From the moment we are regenerated in our spirit, it is the Lord s desire that this change of life continue by spreading into our soul, that our mind, our emotion, and our will may all be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our spirit is regenerated and changed, but our mind, emotion, and will are not transformed and still remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have Christ as life in our spirit, but we do not have Christ in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need Christ to continually expand from our spirit into our soul until every part of our soul is transformed into His image 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then we will think as He thinks, love as He loves, and choose as He chooses.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We will have the likeness of the Lord in our practical life, because our soul is thoroughly saturated with His divine elements.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>V. BY THE SPREADING OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What is the new element that brings about this inward change?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is Christ, the Triune God, the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At first this element is only in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is confined there, with no way to enter our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we do not allow Him to spread, our spirit becomes a prison to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need the teaching about transformation by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Spirit wants to spread into our soul, thus adding the new divine element to replace the self.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When this new element replacing the old is added to our soul, there will be a change in our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>BY BEHOLDING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>WITH AN UNVEILED FACE</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Second Corinthians 3:18 tells us that we may be transformed as we behold the Lord with an unveiled face.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means that we open up to pray to the Lord mainly to fellowship with Him, not to ask Him to do something for us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Don t let anything come in to veil and separate you from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When you open up to Him, He may say that the way you talked to your mother was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you would confess your sins to the Lord and say, Lord, forgive me, He will come into your soul to transform you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By staying open to Him all the time we can speed up the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We all need this process.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the progress of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Questions How is transformation a result of sanctification?</S>
