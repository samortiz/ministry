<h1 class="title">THE STEPS FOR THE PRACTICE<br />
OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 10:1-3, 5-7; 19:5, 9; Acts 2:46; 5:42; 1 Cor. 14:1, 4, 26, 31</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that the goal of the new way is to build up the Body of Christ. In the Body of Christ the emphasis is on organic function, not organizational work. This can be compared to our human body relying on the inward organic function of every member for its existence, not on outward organizational methods. The church as the Body of Christ is completely organic. Every believer is an organic member of this one Body and has an organic function. The God-ordained way, which God has revealed to us in the Bible, builds up the Body of Christ through the organic function of each one part.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will look at the four steps in the practice of the new way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL TO GAIN PEOPLE</h2>
<p>The first step in the practice of the new way is to preach the gospel. When we visit people to preach the gospel, we gain people for the Lord. We want people not merely to be saved; we want them to become building material for the Body of Christ. Hence, people need to repent, be regenerated, be transformed, and grow in the divine life. Regeneration, transformation, and growth in life are organic matters for the organic building.</p>
<p>Previously, when we wanted to preach the gospel, the church set a day for a big gospel meeting, and everyone passed out tracts and put up posters. All the brothers and sisters did their best to invite their friends, neighbors, classmates, and colleagues. We spent much energy to invite people to come hear the gospel, but we did not have good results. Such a method was not wrong, and it was not entirely useless. The Bible does record an incident when people were invited to listen to the gospel (Acts 10:21-24). However, if we read the New Testament carefully, we will see that the main way to preach the gospel is to go to the sinners.</p>
<p>The Lord wants us to be fishers of men (Matt. 4:19). This means that the evangelists are fishers of men. Where can we find fishermen who, instead of going to the rivers and oceans to catch fish, send out invitations asking the fish to come to them? The Lord Himself came down from heaven to seek man. He went from village to village and even visited people in their homes. Later He sent the twelve disciples to visit people (10:5; Luke 9:1-2), and He appointed seventy others and sent them out (10:1). The Lord Jesus sent them out as lambs in the midst of wolves (v. 3). It is not easy for a lamb to visit wolves. A lamb that visits wolves will not find it enjoyable but will encounter difficulty and even be reviled.</p>
<p>Those of us who visit people to preach the gospel have experienced meeting people who really were &ldquo;wolves,&rdquo; and they gave us trouble. However, sometimes the person who opens the door is happy to welcome us, and we know that this is a son of peace. He will receive the gospel and be baptized. The saints who knock on doors to preach the gospel have many stories about how they met such sons of peace.</p>
<p>There are now more than one thousand local churches on the earth, and most of them are practicing the new way of visiting people to preach the gospel. Since the second half of 1986, more than ten thousand people have been baptized because the saints visited them to preach the gospel. Some Roman Catholic congregations have been influenced by us, and now they are visiting people to preach the gospel. In the past, even though we invited twenty to thirty guests to hear the gospel, only two or three would actually come. Now when we spend two or three hours to knock on twenty to thirty doors, we are able to lead at least one person to salvation. This is a scientific method, and it is very effective. However, it is not that easy, because it requires us to pay a price and set aside our status.</p>
<p>When we speak the Lord&rsquo;s word to others, we must believe that the Holy Spirit is with us, and we must exercise our spirit. Some of the people we meet when we knock on doors are mean when they open the door, but after we speak with them, they not only repent, pray, and believe, but they also get baptized. Within a few minutes they are transformed from being a &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; to being a &ldquo;lamb.&rdquo; During the past year and a half several hundred people spent all their time to experiment with preaching the gospel by knocking on doors. As a result we have confirmed that this is the most practical and effective way.</p>
<p>The secret to our ability to go door to door and visit people with the gospel is that we must have thick skin. No matter how insulting people are to us, we should remain composed, and even if they curse us, we should not waiver. Before we go out, we must pray, thoroughly confess our sins to the Lord, and ask Him to cleanse us with His blood so that we can be filled with the Holy Spirit. In this way the Holy Spirit will be released, and we will be bold and full of authority. We will be able to announce to the heavens and the earth that we are preaching the gospel to sinners with the Lord Jesus Christ, and we will have the authority to command people to believe and be saved. We will even be able to command the demons to leave the houses that we are visiting, because the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you&rdquo; (Matt. 28:18-20). The Lord has given us the authority to go and disciple the nations by baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit and by teaching them. This is not a small matter.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the new way is proper. In order to preach the gospel to others, we must go to them. If we do not go, who will go? Whom can God send? God will not send the angels, because in the New Testament God did not become an angel; He became a man. God became flesh to live among men. If we are not willing to move, He has no way to reach people. Hence, we must bring salvation to people in their homes, just as the Lord Jesus brought salvation to the house of Zaccheus (Luke 19:1-10).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_055.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_057.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Crucial Matters for the Increase and Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 56</div><br></body></html>
