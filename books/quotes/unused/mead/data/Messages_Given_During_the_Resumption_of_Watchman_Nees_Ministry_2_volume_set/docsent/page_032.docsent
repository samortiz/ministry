   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN IMAGE AND THE TREE OF LIFE CONFERENCE 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:January 8, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Scripture Reading: Gen 1:27 IMAGE AND THE TREE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Genesis 1:27 mentions the word image.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This word is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible mentions image many times.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The main thing this word reveals to us is the relationship between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When many people think about salvation, they think about forgiveness of sins, the receiving of blessings, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But God did not create man just for him to receive blessings and to be forgiven of his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first thought God has with man is that He wants man to be like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first time the Bible mentions man and the creation of man, it mentions him having the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Genesis 2 mentions the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first chapter mentions image, and the second chapter mentions the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I hope that you will circle the words image and the tree of life with a red pen.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Image is something outside, whereas life is something inside.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First it speaks of the outside, and then it speaks of the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is like saying that you have the image of a Chinese outside, and you have the life of a Chinese inside.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without having God's life inside him, man cannot have God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Life is the content, and in this life there is God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When this life is expressed, we have God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I want to ask the brothers and sisters a question: Why do you believe in Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many people answer that it is because they have sinned, or that they were poor and suffering, and they needed something to depend on.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All of these are right answers, but this kind of understanding is too shallow and elementary.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In God's creation, the earth is the center of the heavens, and the garden of Eden is the center of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the midst of the garden, there was the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God put man in the center of the center.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He did not put man in the heavens, nor did He put man on the fringes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, He put man in the center.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this center, there was man, and there were the two trees.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Both trees speak of food.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The tree of life is a matter of food, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is also a matter of food.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We know that when food gets into a man, it becomes a part of him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I hope that tonight we will put aside matters such as heaven, hell, blessings, and sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Let us set our hearts on two things: image and the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE TREE OF LIFE BRINGING IN LIFE, WHEREAS</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>BRINGING IN DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Hebrew, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is composed of three words: knowledge, good, and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Life is simply life; it is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But God cannot say that evil is good, or that good is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Other than knowledge, good, and evil, there is still another thing, which is death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Good and evil bring in death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today, in order to gain God, we have to be pure.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The meaning of being pure is to have one thing only.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What we take into us is life, and what is lived out of us is the image.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If it is life for us all the way from the beginning to the end and we have nothing besides life, we are being pure.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When man joins himself to the knowledge of good and evil, he falls into death, and he becomes complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The tree of knowledge can be called the tree of good, and it can also be called the tree of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Humanly speaking, the tree of good and the tree of knowledge sound very nice, and the tree of evil and the tree of death sound very bad.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But in the whole universe, nothing other than life is according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everything outside of life is in the realm of knowledge, good, evil, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today, man thinks that good is life, and evil is death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When man touches evil, he touches death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But when he touches good, does he not touch death also?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When he touches knowledge, does he not touch death also?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I have to shout loudly that the result of good and knowledge is also death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If someone hates you, or he is proud, this is to be evil.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But if he loves you, and he is humble, this is to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the one hand, the Bible teaches us to love our parents and our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But on the other hand, Luke 14 tells us to hate our parents and our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God's intention has nothing to do with good and evil; it has to do with life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God has no intention for us to do evil, and He has no intention for us to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You cannot please God by doing evil, and you cannot please God by doing good, because both good and evil come from the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whether you are proud or humble, the source is the same, and the end is death.</S>
