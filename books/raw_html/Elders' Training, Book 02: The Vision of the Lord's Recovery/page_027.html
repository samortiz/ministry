<h2 class="head1">CHAPTERS SIX THROUGH TWENTY OF REVELATION</h2>
<p>Chapters six through twenty of Revelation are actually a parenthetical section because Revelation is a book on the church. The focus of the Bible is not the world situation. The focus of the Bible is Christ and the church. The first three chapters of Revelation are on the church, chapters four and five are on Christ, and the last two chapters are on the consummation of the church. Chapters six through twenty, though, are a section of God&rsquo;s governmental, universal administration to purify and clear up the entire universe by judging and eliminating all the negative things. The last enemy, death, will be dealt with along with Satan, who held it as might and who is cast into the lake of fire. After this, the entire universe is cleared up and becomes a new universe, a new heaven and a new earth. Revelation six through twenty is, therefore, a section on God&rsquo;s universal government to deal with His enemy and all the negative things.</p>
<p>Within this parenthetical section, the church and the saints are referred to seventeen times:</p>
<p>(1) In 6:9-11 the martyred souls who are still under the altar cried to the Lord. The cry of the martyred souls constitutes the fifth seal in Revelation and ushers in the sixth seal, which is the initial step of the great tribulation.</p>
<p>(2) In 7:9-17 is an innumerable multitude under the Lamb&rsquo;s overshadowing care. While the judgment of all the calamities is taking place, Christ will overshadow His redeemed ones.</p>
<p>(3) In 8:3-5 Christ is the High Priest offering all the suffering saints&rsquo; prayer, with His incense added, to God. God&rsquo;s answer to this prayer is to judge the rebellious world.</p>
<p>(4) 11:18 mentions the reward given to the Lord&rsquo;s slaves, the prophets, the saints, and those who fear His name. This reward will be given by the Lord to His faithful ones at His coming back.</p>
<p>(5) In 12:1-17 is the universal woman with the man-child. It is the man-child that causes the great dragon to be cast down from the heavens to the earth.</p>
<p>(6) In 13:7 the beast, the Antichrist, was allowed to war with the saints and to overcome them.</p>
<p>(7) The firstfruit of the believers before the great tribulation, the one hundred and forty-four thousand, is in 14:1-5.</p>
<p>(8) In 14:13 are the martyred saints in the great tribulation and their blessing.</p>
<p>(9) In 14:14-16 is the harvest of believers near the end of the great tribulation.</p>
<p>(10) In 15:2-4 are the martyrs who had been under Antichrist&rsquo;s persecution standing upon the glassy sea.</p>
<p>(11) During the tribulation there is a warning given to the remaining saints to keep their garments in 16:15.</p>
<p>(12) In 17:14 are those saints who were called and chosen and faithful. They were selected to be an army to fight Antichrist and the false prophet.</p>
<p>(13) In 18:4 the Lord calls His children, &ldquo;Come out of her, My people.&rdquo; To come out of her means to come out of both religious Babylon and material Babylon since Babylon the Great is twofold.</p>
<p>(14) In 19:7-9 is the Bride ready for Christ&rsquo;s wedding.</p>
<p>(15) Revelation 19:14 mentions the heavenly armies composed of the overcomers who will be the ready Bride.</p>
<p>(16) In 20:4 and 6 we see the co-kings of Christ in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>(17) Then the camp of the saints surrounded by the rebellious nations instigated by Satan is in 20:9.</p>
<p>These seventeen instances of the church in this parenthetical section need much study. If we would study these instances we would see something and have something new, solid, and basic to minister to the churches. This kind of study and ministry would encourage me. If we would study these instances, we would understand much more concerning God&rsquo;s economy related to the church and the saints. These seventeen instances are inserted into this parenthetical section. During this time, God will be carrying out His universal, governmental administration.</p>
