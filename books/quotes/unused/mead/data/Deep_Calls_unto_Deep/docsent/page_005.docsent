   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Let us also remember that if we display all our treasure, captivity cannot be averted.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Death and exposure go together, and spiritual dryness and exposure also go together.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even if we have to give a testimony, we must be like Paul, who boasted out of necessity "though indeed not expedient" 2 Cor 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Satan's attack often comes at the time a man is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Any kind of exposure opens us up to loss.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many people are healed of their sickness, and they testify for the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But many testimonies of healing are not for the glory of God but for the glory of one's own faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As a result, the sickness comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After these ones give their testimony once, they are attacked by the same thing again.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This shows us that God covers those who cover their roots, and God does not protect those who disclose their roots; they will be exposed to attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If God wants us to testify, we still have to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But there are many things that ought to be hidden away.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God protects what we hide before Him, and we enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The same applies to our work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By His grace and mercy God has accomplished something through us, but remember that what He has accomplished is not a matter for advertisement or material for propaganda.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we expose the work of God, we will find that the touch of death comes upon it immediately; and the loss will correspond to the extent to which we expose ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As soon as David numbered the children of Israel, death set in 2 Sam 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>May God deliver us from this kind of exposure.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whatever secrets we have with the Lord must be preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can only move according to God's instruction within us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only if He moves within us to reveal something, dare we reveal it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If He wants us to share some experience with a brother, we dare not withhold it, for that would be violating a law of the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One law of the members of the Body of Christ is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once we suppress this law, the flow stops.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must be positive, not negative, and minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if we are engrossed all day with ourselves and with our own things, this talkativeness and exposure opens us to assault from the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I trust we shall learn what the Body of Christ is and what the flow of life among the members is; but I trust we shall also learn the need for safeguarding the hidden part we have before the Lord, the experiences which are not known to others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No root should be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we extend ourselves deeper and take root downward, we will discover that "deep calls unto deep."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we can bring forth riches from the depths of our inner life, we will find that other lives will be deeply affected.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The minute our inner being is touched, others will receive help and be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They will know that there is something beyond their knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When deep touches deep, deep will respond to deep.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If our life has no depth, our superficial work will only affect other lives superficially.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We repeat yet again only "deep calls unto deep."</S>
