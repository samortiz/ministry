If you read it with insight and with the heavenly vision, you will discover that it begins with life and building
According to the further revelation of the Scriptures, especially Revelation 21, these precious materials are for God's building
In the last two chapters of Revelation, which are the last two chapters of the Bible, we see the building of the New Jerusalem
When we study John 14 we shall see that this denotes the building of God's eternal habitation, a building which has many abodes
The genuine experience of Christ as life is in the realization that Christ is God Himself dispensed into our being
When you eat the bread, it will be wrought into you, and when you drink the water, it will be dispensed into you
Do not put some artificial coloring on your face, but simply drink the heavenly wine and you will have a colorful complexion
Numerous times the young people have told me, 'O brother, in the brothers' house we have very little building'
At the end of the book of Revelation, God is in the center of the holy city, New Jerusalem, which is His enlargement
The proper building is the enlargement of God, the expansion of the Triune God, enabling God to express Himself in a corporate way
After creating man God placed him in front of the tree of life, indicating that He wanted man to take Him in as life
As we have already seen, the flow of the river from Eden brought forth gold, pearl, and onyx, which are materials for God's building
God used a rib from Adam to build a bride for him , which was a type of the building of the church and ultimately of the New Jerusalem
Before God built His corporate wife on this earth, Satan constructed his first counterfeit, the city of Enoch, named after Cain's son
The city of Enoch produced a culture that corrupted the whole of mankind, and that corruption brought in the judgment of the flood
All of the worldly people of the time were included in the city of Enoch, but Noah stood apart, building an ark for God's salvation
His tent and altar were miniatures of the tent and altar which the children of Israel later built for their worship of God
At Babel there was a tower, but with Abraham there was an altar; at Babel there was a city, but with Abraham there was a tent
While Abraham lived in the tent, his nephew fell into the city of Sodom which was another counterfeit building of Satan
Genesis 281819 says that Jacob took the stone that he had put for his pillow and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it
According to the Bible, the oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit, the third Person of the Godhead, reaching human beings
Whenever the Triune God reaches a human being through the Person of the Holy Spirit, that man will become a part of Bethel, the house of God
Have you noticed the alternation between the positive and the negative, between God's building and Satan's counterfeit?
In the midst of all the cities on the negative side we have the building of God's tabernacle on the positive side
After they were released from the bondage of Pharaoh they became Gods freed people being made by Gods mercy and grace a kingdom of priests
In opposition to the temple with its city, Jerusalem, Satan built the city of Babylon , which was a bigger counterfeit
By this we can see how Satan has been constantly frustrating and damaging God's building as His habitation on earth
Years after the destruction of the temple some of the Jewish people returned from their captivity and rebuilt the temple
Although the church is universally one, the local churches, as the expressions of the one universal church, are many
These two sides of Babylon are the greatest, the consummate, and the ultimate counterfeit of Satan in frustrating God's building
God's building, mainly, the building of the church, will consummate in the New Jerusalem, which is His ultimate building
John's ministry, the last ministry in the Bible and the ministry with which the Bible concludes, was a mending ministry of life
We have seen that the Bible is a book of life and building and that the Gospel of John is also focused on life and building
The Gospel of John reveals that in Christ, the Word of God, is life ; that He came that man may have life ; and that He Himself is life
Before His death His body in the flesh was the temple, and after His resurrection His resurrected body remained the temple of God
According to that chapter, all the believers will be built together as God's eternal habitation with so many abodes
Although no one has ever seen God through incarnation the only begotten Son of God has declared God to man in life light grace and reality
For the time being it is sufficient to remember that in the first section of John we see how God was brought into man and declared to man
In the first section He brought God into man; in the second section He passed through death and resurrection to bring man into God
In the beginning was the Word'; 'I am the light'; 'I am the life'-such statements are simple, but their meaning is profound
Do not think that Christ was a word with four letters; the Word here is an allegory, a figure, depicting what Christ means for God
To help you in this, we suggest that you read the Recovery Version of John, paying close attention to all the notes
The language of the Gospel of John is simple and brief, but this book is actually the most profound book in the Bible
The meaning of this phrase in John 1:1 is different, for it refers to eternity in the past without a beginning
The beginning in Genesis 1 starts from the time of creation, but the beginning in John 1 is before the time of creation
Those who preach Christianity without believing that Christ was God incarnated to be a man caused a large hole in the net
The Word is the definition, explanation, and expression of God; hence, it is God defined, explained, and expressed
If you want to appear mysterious, the best way to do it is to be silent, for the more silent you are, the more mysterious you become
Eventually, this Word is God Himself, not God hidden, concealed, and mysterious, but God defined, explained, and expressed
He was aware that some might argue with him, saying, 'He was with God and He was God, but He was probably not with God from the beginning
In this gospel He is 'without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life'
All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being'
What does it mean that all things came into being through Him and that apart from Him nothing has come into being?
Do not say that you are weak, for the more you say that you are weak, the weaker you become, simply because you say that you are weak
Being born of God by receiving His Word, we have God as our life, and this life becomes the light within us shining all the time
When we receive Him as the expression of God, He becomes our life, and this life becomes the light that shines within us
The word 'enlightens' in Greek is the same word used in the same way as in Ephesians 1:18; 3:9 and Hebrews 6:4; 10:32
Today, these receivers have become God's multiplication, and this multiplication has become the increase and corporate expression of God
Christ did not come in the flesh to declare God in the way of teachings, but in a way that was full of grace and reality
The brass serpent lifted up on a pole by Moses was a type of Christ being made in the likeness of the flesh of sin
Although that brass serpent was in the form of the serpent, it did not have the poisonous nature of the serpent
By His becoming flesh in this way, man was able to touch Him, participate in Him, and enjoy the fullness of God that was in Him
By being incarnated the Word not only brought God into humanity but also became a tabernacle to God to be Gods habitation on earth among men
According to the history in the Old Testament, there was among the people on earth a tabernacle, and in that tabernacle God was present
The Old Testament tabernacle was a type, a shadow, and a prefigure of the real tabernacle which was Christ Himself in the flesh
In the time of the New Testament, it was Jesus in the flesh who brought God to man that man might enjoy God's presence
Suddenly as He stood before three of His disciples the shekinah glory that was within Jesus was manifested shining over Peter James and John
Grace is not the gift of material things, nor just the gifts of spiritual things, but the gift of God Himself in Christ as our enjoyment
When you experience God as your strength, life, comfort, rest, power, righteousness, and holiness, that is grace
Christ declares the Father God in the way of enjoyment, day by day affording us a portion of the enjoyment of God
When God is enjoyed by us, we have enjoyment, that is, grace, and when we have this enjoyment, we realize the reality of God
Paul in the New Testament said that all things are dung , and Solomon declared that all things are vanity , without reality
The law makes demands upon man according to what God is, but grace supplies man with what God is to meet what God demands
No man can partake of God through the law, but grace is the enjoyment of God for man, and reality is the realization of God for man
Although we lack the adequate language to describe this, we may nevertheless know it, at least to some extent, from our experience
When we enjoy God in Christ as grace and apprehend Him in Christ as reality, we find how unsearchable are the riches of Christ
Through the incarnation of God in Christ, we can receive the riches of grace and reality out of His divine fullness
If your capacity is enlarged to eight hundred gallons, the fullness of God will fill up that measure to the brim
Verse 18 says, 'No one has ever seen God: the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
We know that this dear, only begotten of the Father is continually in the bosom of the Father to declare the Father
Christ is the expression of God in the same way that grace is the expression of love and reality is the expression of light
When we enjoy Christ as grace and reality, this enjoyment brings us into the bosom of the Father where we enjoy love and light
The Word is God expressed, life is God imparted, light is God shining, grace is God enjoyed, and reality is God realized, apprehended
Although no one has ever seen God, the Son of God has declared Him in the way of being the Word, life, light, grace, and reality
Christ declared, expressed, explained, and defined God by being incarnated as the Word with life, light, grace, and reality
The first eighteen verses of chapter one may be summarized with a few simple words: Word, God, life, light, grace, and reality
The dove is not only for regenerating, but also for transforming and uniting, which eventually result in the building of God's house
Since the house is the dwelling place and not the dweller, the dwelling is humanity and the dweller is divinity
In no other books is this matter so clearly revealed as in the writings of John, in his gospel, epistles, and revelation
As you read through the Gospel of John, you will discover that the greatest opposition against Christ came from religion
It was not Roman politics that sentenced the Lord Jesus to death, for the Roman politics under Pilate was too weak to do that
The religious concept is that of always looking to a great one such as the Messiah or to a great prophet such as Elijah
The religious people today, like the Pharisees and scribes and chief priests, are not for life; they are for a big movement, a great leader
Although they await a great religious leader who will stir them up, after such a leader comes and goes, they still remain in their deadness
Perhaps they said to John, 'Shall we go back to those who sent us and tell them that you said you were just a voice?
While the religionists were expecting a great leader, Jesus was recommended by John the Baptist as the little Lamb of God
Jesus did not come to be the great leader of a religious movement; He came to be the little Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world
The religious concept is that a great leader will come, but the divine economy is that a Lamb die to redeem man from sin
The Lamb, on the negative side, solves the problem of man's sin; the dove, on the positive side, brings God to man
The dove here signifies the Holy Spirit and is for life-giving, regenerating, anointing, transforming, uniting, and building
When we come to John 12, we shall see that the Lord Jesus likens Himself to something even smaller than a dove-a grain of wheat
A grain of wheat, which is full of life, is for the reproduction and propagation of life, for the multiplication in life
God's economy is to send His Son to be the Lamb with His Spirit as the dove to accomplish redemption and to impart life to man
In God's economy it is not a question of a movement, power, or a great leader; it is a matter of the Lamb with the dove
When John the Baptist said, 'Behold, the Lamb of God,' two of his disciples were drawn to Him, and John was very happy about it
The first was Andrew, and the second should be John, the writer of this gospel, although he was humble, not mentioning himself by name
The Lord referred to this word of His when He spoke to Peter in Matthew 16:18 about the building of the church
The significance of a stone is that it denotes a work of transformation to bring forth material for God's building
Philip found Nathanael and said, 'We have found Him of whom Moses in the law and prophets wrote, Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth'
Although the Lord did not do anything with Philip, He did something with Nathanael, speaking to him of Jacob's dream
There is a principle here and the principle is this: the Lord does not deal with the first, but always with the second
Nathanael recognized Him as the Son of God and addressed Him as such , but Christ said to Nathanael that He was the Son of Man
In eternity past Christ had only divinity, but in eternity future Christ will have both divinity and humanity forever
The only begotten Son of God is God's declaration, making Him known to all the people who enjoy God's fullness as grace and reality
The only begotten Son of God is unique and is for the declaration of God, making Him known to all who enjoy Him as grace and reality
Since we have redemption and are under the Spirit's anointing, we have no problem with sin and no shortage of life
Having been reborn, we are under the process of transformation, for the regenerating Spirit is now the transforming Spirit
He had declared, 'Behold, the Lamb of God,' and, as a result of this declaration, only two disciples followed the Lord Jesus
Acts 1 tells us that at the end of three and a half years of ministry the Lord had gained only one hundred twenty people
The Lord's way is not that of mushrooming growth, but of a seed that is sown into the ground and that needs time to grow
The ultimate consummation of God's work in the eternal future will simply be the actual existence of this habitation of God
We must abandon all religious concepts and take the divine concept which is Christ as the Lamb with the dove, the Redeemer with the Spirit
We must forget the religious concepts of trying to do good to please God and of attempting to do things for God
All who have been attracted to the Lamb of God with the dove will be transformed into stones for the house of God
We must have the vision that all we need is to be transformed and built together as the very house that God desires
God is seeking this and will accomplish it by His Son, who became the Son of Man as the heavenly ladder joining earth to heaven
Man will become His dwelling, and He will become man's dwelling-this is the eternal dwelling of God according to His eternal plan
In eternity future He will be God and man, the Son of God and the Son of Man, both divine and human, having divinity as well as humanity
It certainly was wonderful for Nathanael to realize that Jesus, a little man from Nazareth, was the Son of God
After we have received eternal life, we must further realize that this Jesus who is the Son of God is also the Son of Man
Praise the Lord that He is the Son of God for us to have life, and He is the Son of Man for God to have a dwelling place
Today God dwells in the heavens, but the heavens will not be His habitation for eternity in the new heaven and the new earth
The regenerated, transformed, uplifted, and built up humanity which will eventually become God's dwelling place
God will not dwell with a natural humanity, but with a regenerated, transformed, uplifted, and built up humanity
He is the Son of God to impart God into us as our life, and He is the Son of Man to be the very essence of the building of God's house
God is driving the car of His economy from the first section of eternity, through the bridge of time, into the last section of eternity
Once God has traveled from eternity past, through the bridge of time, and into eternity future, He will declare, 'Finished'!
Verse three says, 'All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being'
By His creation, God produced the heavens for the earth, the earth for man, and man with a spirit as a receiver to receive God as his life
Although many Christians say that it is sufficient to have a believing heart, Romans 10 makes it clear that we also need a mouth
They do not realize that the reason they are so weak is that they do not use their lips and their tongue to confess the name of the Lord
If every Christian would say, 'Lord Jesus,' continually, Satan would immediately be cast into the lake of fire
On this bridge called time, Christ as the Word of God, through whom all things were created, was incarnated as a man
Incarnation is not only to bring God into His creation but also to declare God to man in the Word in life in light in grace and in truth
In total, it is through these five things that God is fully declared to man in order that man may partake of and enjoy Him as everything
When He was raised from the dead, He left the old creation in the tomb and came out in resurrection as the head of the new creation
Firstly, we need to be regenerated; secondly, we need to be transformed; and thirdly, we need to be united for the building
Day by day, the little dove as the life-imparting Spirit speaks within you, rebuking you and touching your heart or conscience
Praise the Lord that we are not only undergoing the work of transformation, but are also in the process of building
Even if only a small number are completely processed, saturated, transformed, and built by and with Him, it will be sufficient
Nathanael, and all of us with him, will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man
After giving us such an all-inclusive introduction, John presents several cases to illustrate the matter of life
Although Jesus did a great many signs before His disciples , John selected not more than twelve of them to illustrate the matter of life
Beginning with the case of Nicodemus in chapter three and ending with the resurrection of Lazarus in chapter eleven nine cases are presented
Since Luke's purpose was to show that Jesus is the Savior of mankind, he selected the cases which prove that Jesus is the Savior
Another incident recorded only in Luke is that of the thief on the cross who asked the Lord to remember him when He came into His kingdom
In each of the nine cases recorded from chapters three through eleven, the principle is to change death into life
As the record of chapter eleven tells us, when the Lord Jesus learned that Lazarus was sick, He did not go to see him
Because he was full of death, the Lord told him that he needed to be born again that he might have the eternal life which is God Himself
Each incident illustrates the principle established in the event of changing water into wine-the principle of changing death into life
The next day John saw Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world'!
Again the next day John and two of his disciples were standing, and looking at Jesus as He walked, he said, Behold, the Lamb of God'!
Although the people of this earth, like reeds, are weak and fragile, yet the Lord came to them in resurrection
Regardless of how much pleasure you are enjoying, when your human life is ended, all your human enjoyment is also gone
Regardless of the kind of wedding you are in, when your human life runs out, your wedding is terminated and the enjoyment is over
The Lord Jesus foreknew that the wine would be exhausted, and He went to Cana to establish the principle of life, changing death into life
The Lord healed death in the human situation by turning it into life like the way Elisha healed the salt water by making it fresh
When the Lord came into the world, He came into a situation where human enjoyment existed, but was not lasting
The Jewish rites of purification with water signify religion's attempt to make people clean by certain dead practices
The ritual purification with water is outward, without life, but the Lord's changing death into life is from within and is full of life
When the Lord commanded the people to fill the six vessels with water, it indicated that the natural man is full of death
The first life, the human, created one, is an inferior life; the best life is the second life, the divine and everlasting one
Regardless of the kind of death situation we might be in, if we turn our case over to the Lord Jesus, He will change that death into life
All the miracles performed by the Lord Jesus as recorded in the Gospel of John were not only miracles but signs
Since this is the first sign, so the principle of life which is set forth in it can be applied to all of the other cases
She had been trying her best to enjoy the wine of human pleasures, but finally she felt only emptiness and death
The main points of the case of Lazarus, in principle, are the same as those of the first case, the marriage feast at Cana
In both cases the principle of life was exactly the same: the Lord came into both situations and changed death into life
The principle of life set forth in the incident of changing water into wine can be applied to every case throughout the Gospel of John
Verse 11 says that in this beginning of signs which Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, He manifested His glory and His disciples believed in Him
Mary, the mother of Jesus, here signifies the natural man, which has nothing to do with life and which must be subdued by the divine life
We need to wait until the death situation comes to the surface; then the Lord Jesus will come in to change death into life
We must believe that both of these cases were recorded for the purpose of signifying something beyond the mere account of historical events
In the incident of the Lord's changing water into wine, we saw the principle of life, that is, to change death into life
Now, in the case of the dealing with the temple, we see the goal, the purpose of life, that is, to build the house of God
John 2:12-22 shows two aspects of the Lord's dealing with the temple-the cleansing aspect and the building aspect
The Passover at that time was a remembrance of God's salvation through which remembrance the Jews worshipped God in their temple
Sometimes He uses someone common to purge you-such as your wife or husband, your parents or children, your employer or employees
We all have experienced the whip of cords which the Lord has made of common persons or ordinary things to purge us
He comes to cast out the sheep, oxen, and doves, and to overthrow the tables in order to bring confusion into the whole situation
Also parents who sincerely seek after the Lord and pray daily for their children sometimes suffer to see their children going astray
If your sons are like Peter and John and your daughter is like Mary, there would be no rushes available for the Lord to make a scourge
On the one hand you may daily enjoy the Lord as a feast but on the other hand the Lord will send a scourge a number of times to purge you
When He saw the corrupted situation within the temple, He could not tolerate it, but cleansed it, even with a whip
He could not suffer to see that the temple, His Father's house, was defiled, contaminated by the things of man's greed
We should not worry about the confusion that may exist in the church, for the Lord's Body, the church, is in the process of resurrection
Every time, after trouble damages the church, the church will be recovered and raised up in the newness of resurrection life
Do not try to understand the Bible merely according to the black and white letters, for if you do, you will find yourself in difficulty
In the New Testament, there are two ways of recording the Lord's resurrection-that God raised Him up and that He raised Himself up
As the sacrifice for sins He needed God to raise Him up as the One who is the giver of life He could lay down His life and take it up again
Since Satan realized that the physical body of Jesus was God's dwelling place on earth, he did his best to destroy that body
In a sense, Satan destroyed the Lord's physical body; in another sense, the Lord Jesus gave up His body to death
The body of Jesus that was destroyed on the cross was small and weak; the Body of Christ in resurrection is vast and powerful
Once a local church has been damaged and destroyed you can be assured that in resurrection it will become even larger than it was originally
Whenever a problem comes to the church, many brothers feel that they should immediately call a meeting and pray
When the Lord Jesus knew that the Jews were attempting to destroy Him, He did not pray, 'O Father, kill all these Jews
In the building up of the church, oftentimes people, like the Jews, will challenge us to see what miracles we can do
Today we are still within the three days because the Lord is still working for the building of His Body under the process of resurrection
A great part of the Lord's Body has already been raised, but there are still some members of His Body who are not yet raised
All the damage that the enemy does to the church simply offers the Lord the opportunity to enlarge His Body in resurrection
Let the enemy do whatever he can, for his work simply gives the Lord the opportunity to do His increasing work in resurrection
In John 2 the writer selected two events of the many things done by the Lord to show us the principle and the purpose of life
They know religion, but, because they are weak, they do not have the power to live out its standards or fulfill its regulations
Other people are hungry, craving for something to enjoy, while some are thirsting for something more than their human life can offer them
Finally, the last condition of all men is death, for they are in death and, at the same time, are on the road to death
You need the Lord as the bread of life to satisfy your hunger and you need the Lord's living water to quench your thirst
The case of the Samaritan woman, a sinful and unsatisfied woman, reveals how much the Lord can satisfy such a person with His living water
The case of the weak man who had been sick for thirty-eight years demonstrates the enlivening power of the Lord's life
In the case of the hungry multitude which needed something to feed on, the Lord presents Himself as the bread of life
In the case of the thirsty people, the Lord assures them that He can quench their thirst by the flowing river of living water
Without regeneration, it is impossible for anyone to partake of the deliverance from sin or to receive spiritual sight
We need to examine very carefully the first case, the case of Nicodemus, which reveals man's need for regeneration
Before we consider the case of Nicodemus, we need to realize that the Lord's commitment to man is not in miracles, but in life
The word 'But' in 3:1 indicates that the case of Nicodemus differs from the cases in the foregoing verses, 2:23-25
The case of Nicodemus, a case of life in regeneration, reveals that the Gospel of John is not for miraculous things, but only for life
That such an experienced, educated, and elderly man would come to see someone much younger than he indicates his humility
In His conversation with Nicodemus, the Lord revealed that regardless of how good we are, we still need regeneration
Regardless of the kind of human life we have, as long as we do not have the divine life, we need to be regenerated
Many Christians are not clear about this fact, thinking that regeneration is necessary simply because we are fallen and sinful
Regeneration is not any kind of outward improvement or cultivation; neither is it only a mere change or conversion without life
To be regenerated is to be born of God , and to be born of God is to have the life of God, that is, the eternal life
To be born anew is to be regenerated with the divine life, a life other than the human life received by natural birth
Although you may feel that you are good, yet you must admit that you do not have the life of God with His divine nature
Nicodemus was not on the line that would lead him to the New Jerusalem, but on the line that would take him to the lake of fire
When Nicodemus heard that he had to be born anew, he thought that this meant that he had to go back to his mother's womb and come out again
Even if you could be born anew in that way and be young again, after another sixty or seventy years you would be the same as you are now
Another interpretation a most terrible way of expounding this passage of Scripture is that the water refers to the mothers own birth water
If the Lord Jesus had spoken to Nicodemus with words that were not plain, He would have given him some sort of interpretation
After hearing this word of John's, the Pharisees probably discussed it among themselves, for, at that time, it was a new saying
Since the Pharisees were quite serious, after hearing such a word spoken by John the Baptist, they must have had a long talk about it
Water is the central sign of the ministry of John the Baptist, that is, to bury and terminate people of the old creation
These two main concepts, water and Spirit, when put together, are the whole concept of the matter of regeneration
It means to be terminated by John's ministry through water and to be germinated by Jesus' ministry through the Spirit
Whenever a person repents, confessing that he is a fallen being who is good for nothing, that is the acceptance of John's ministry
There is no need, of course, for John literally to be present, for his ministry is in the New Testament already
Following repentance, everyone must believe in the Lord Jesus and accept His ministry of life in order to be germinated
Everyone, whether he is good or bad, needs to be terminated through water and then germinated with the divine life
Regardless how many times a person could be born out of his mother's womb, he would still be flesh because flesh begets flesh
Regardless of how many times we could be born of our parents, we still would be a natural man with a natural life
In His creation God made us with a spirit for the purpose that one day we might exercise it to contact Him and to receive Him into our being
Simply open yourself up, forgetting what you are, and from deep within your spirit, call on the name of the Lord Jesus, believing in Him
In verse 6, the Lord said, 'That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit'
Spirit, our regenerated spirit, is our spiritual man, our new man, our inward, or inner man , born of God who is the Spirit
When we were born of our parents, we were born flesh; when we were born again of God the Spirit, we were born spirit
By regeneration, our dead spirit was not only quickened, made alive, but also imparted with the divine life of God by the Spirit
It becomes a mingled spirit-our human spirit mingled with God's divine Spirit, as Romans 8:16 says, 'The Spirit
Whatever we preach when we preach the gospel must be in the Spirit, for it is the Spirit that gives life to people in their spirit
It is difficult to understand thoroughly what regeneration is because it is a matter accomplished by, with, and in the Holy Spirit
The Lord told Nicodemus that the regenerated spirit, like the wind, is not physical and tangible, but invisible and spiritual
In the following verse, the Lord said that He is the One who descended out of heaven and who is still in heaven
Although you may be naturalized to be a citizen of a particular nation, you can never be naturalized into a kingdom
If a dog could be reborn with the life of a cat, that little dog would spontaneously be translated from the dog kingdom into the cat kingdom
Colossians 1:13 says that God 'delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love'
When we called on the name of the Lord, the divine Spirit came into us, regenerating us and causing us to be born into the kingdom of God
Many young people have come to me, asking about such things as smoking, attending the movies, eating, dressing, and marrying
If you were to try to teach a dog to bark, and if that dog could speak, he would say, 'I don't need your teachings
Moses prayed for them, and God showed Moses the way of salvation, telling him to make a serpent of brass and to put it upon a pole
The Lord was telling Nicodemus, 'Nicodemus, you appear to be a gentleman, but you must realize that you are actually a serpent
If you were to tell an unbeliever that he is not only a sinner, but also a serpent, he would be highly offended
The Lord Jesus, the best preacher, indicated a great deal by one brief sentence, telling Nicodemus that he was a serpent
Although Christians have heard many messages on the Lamb of God, they have not heard very many on the brass serpent as the type of Christ
Romans 8:3 says, 'God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh'
The body is something good created by God, but the flesh is something bad, being the body transmuted by the poison of the serpent
The Lords word in 314 implies that regardless of how good Nicodemus might have been outwardly he had the serpentine nature of Satan inwardly
When we do this, our sin is removed, our serpentine nature is dealt with, Satan is destroyed in us, and we have life eternal
His true condition is twofold: his nature has the poison of Satan within it and his position is under the condemnation of God
As far as our nature is concerned, we have the poisonous element of Satan, the devil, an element which makes us 'the children of the Devil'
Verse 17 says, 'For God did not send the Son into the world that He might judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him'
Regardless of how much we can work or how good our work may be, we cannot be saved and regenerated by our work
It is by faith in the Lord, by believing in the Lord, that we receive the forgiveness, the release from God's condemnation negatively
It is also by faith, by believing in the Lord, that we receive eternal life, the divine life of God, positively for our regeneration
After passing through death, by and in resurrection, the Lord has released His life and has become a life-giving Spirit
Now, in resurrection, He is the Spirit of life , with all the virtue of His redemptive work, waiting for us to believe in Him
It is by the way of believing in the Lord with His allinclusive redemptive work that we receive Gods life and are born of Him to be His sons
By believing in Him, we get into Him to be one with Him, to partake of Him, and to participate in all that He has accomplished for us
By believing into Him we are identified with Him in all that He is and in all that He has passed through accomplished attained and obtained
In order to save us, Christ, the Son of God, came firstly to be the light to enlighten man that man might be saved
In the Lord's conversation with him, it is implied that his seeking of knowledge was related to his serpentine nature
We all have to be turned from this line of knowledge to the line of life that we may receive the divine life for our enjoyment
Verse 22 says, 'After these things, Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea; and there He stayed with them and baptized'
If he had told all of his disciples to go to the Lord Jesus no longer accepting a following for himself there would have been no difficulty
The increase in verse 30 is the bride in verse 29, and the bride there is a living composition of all the regenerated people
Since our serpentine nature has been terminated and since we have been germinated with the divine life, we are all a part of the bride
All of the reborn people are the increase of Christ, and this increase is the bride which becomes the counterpart of Christ
Through regeneration we possess the divine life of God which is Christ Himself, thus becoming members of the corporate bride of Christ
Later, the same writer, in the book of Revelation, says that the bride of Christ, the bride of the Lamb, is the New Jerusalem
You must thank the Lord for another possibility: this once-born one may also be born again for the increase of Christ
Potentially, all of your children can be born again into the increase of Christ as well as into the increase of Adam
Eve could be the increase of Adam because she was constituted with the rib of Adam and became one flesh with Adam, a part of Adam
Many think that we are the same as they are because, according to their concept, every worker must maintain his following
Some translators have argued whether these words were spoken by John the Baptist, by the Lord Jesus, or by John, the writer of the gospel
By the Lords mercy we have come to see that these verses should be where they are because they continue what has transpired up to verse 30
He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him'
If you study the best manuscripts, you will see that it means that the Son gives the Spirit without measure to God's people
If He recalled the anointing, although we might try our best to pray, we would be unable to pray in a living way
If we have to arrange ahead of time for people to pray in a certain meeting, that is an organization, not the Body
There would be no need for someone to ask us to pray for two and a half hours, for that would be our doing, not the doing of the Head
If you read the book of Acts, you will see that in the early days of the church there were the Spirit and the Word
The more we let go of our following, the more the Bible will be open to us, and the more the anointing will be on the Body
Now is the time that the Lord is going to vindicate His way on the earth not only in this country but throughout the world
John chapter three has three main points: regeneration, the increase, which is the bride of Christ, and the all-inclusive Christ
All that He is and all that He does is for us to be saved and regenerated that we might be His bride as His increase
Otherwise, we shall remain poisoned by Satan and continue under the condemnation of God which will eventually bring His wrath to us
Formerly, we were serpents poisoned by Satan, the enemy of God, and condemned already under the judgment of God
Now, thank the Lord, by His death and resurrection, we have been saved and regenerated to be parts of His bride
The first case sets forth a man with superior attainments while the second sets forth a woman with dishonorable behavior
The Jewish religion was very sound, proper, real, and genuine, but the Samaritan's religion was false and very decadent
It is also interesting to note that the Lord talked with the man at night, but that He talked with the woman at midday
The place where the Lord talked with the man was in a house or a building, but He talked with the woman in the open air
Regardless of our success or attainments, there was a continual emptiness within, the sensation of having no satisfaction
We not only obtained God's salvation, but we also received the divine life, which immediately became our content
According to the custom in the Middle East, the women come to draw water in the late afternoon, not at noontime
Whenever anyone tries to be independent, he will be dissatisfied, because God created man inherently dependent
When the Lord Jesus was about to be betrayed and put to death, the sisters in the New Testament were stronger than the brothers
Your need to rely on others and your sense of dependence, weakness, and thirst for satisfaction all indicate that you are a woman
, the Assyrians captured Samaria and brought people from Babylon and other heathen countries to the cities of Samaria
So He came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph; and Jacob's well was there
Suppose the Lord was in a house at midnight and this woman came to speak to Him during the night, and the disciples saw it
In His sovereignty and wisdom, the Lord waited for the woman to come under the bright sunshine and in the open air
When the Lord and the Samaritan woman had finished their talk, the disciples returned and saw them, but they had nothing to say
The Lord Jesus went to the well, sent all of His disciples away, and sat by the well, waiting until the woman came
If you look back into your salvation, you will realize that, to some extent at least, the same principle was operating
When they returned with the food, they urged Him to eat, but He said, 'I have food to eat of which you have no knowledge'
The sinner was satisfied with the Savior's living water, and the Savior was satisfied with God's will in satisfying the sinner
In verses 9 through 14 we see the contrast between the emptiness of religion's tradition and the fullness of life's living water
Although religion considers its way to be the most prevailing, yet religion's 'water' never quenches the thirst of religious people
Although the Samaritan woman had had five husbands and was living with a man who was not her husband, she still was not satisfied
When the woman asked the Lord for the water, He did not rebuke her, telling her to repent and make a thorough confession of her sins
Do not talk vainly to people, but touch their conscience, not in the way of rebuking them, but in the way of unveiling them
He did not condemn her sinfulness as a sinner or legally make her repent and confess her sins practically as some evangelists would
Because the Lord's word about her husbands touched her conscience, she immediately changed the conversation to the matter of worship
Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father
To contact God the Spirit with her spirit is to drink the living water, and to drink the living water is to render real worship to God
In typology, the worship of God should be in the place chosen by God to set His habitation there , and with the offerings
The offerings typify Christ; Christ is the fulfillment and reality of all the offerings with which the people worshipped God
The Lord also said that now is the time for the true worshippers to worship God not only in their spirit, but also in reality
Now is the hour, or the age, in which we must worship God in our spirit as the unique place and with Christ as the reality
Suppose several brothers come together for the purpose of worshipping God, yet they do not exercise their spirit
What these brothers need to do is simply to exercise the spirit, praise the Lord, call upon His name, and see what He will do
The traditional way is to call a hymn and then, after the hymn has been sung, to offer a prayer to our Father in heaven
Eventually, such an offering will become food to the brother who gave the testimony and to all of the other worshippers
Whenever we exercise our human spirit to contact God, the living Spirit, we drink of Him as the living water in His Son, Jesus Christ
The Lord revealed to her three aspects about Himself: that He is the gift, the Giver, and the way to obtain the gift
In verse 10 He said, 'If you knew the gift of God,' indicating that the gift of God was the Lord Himself as life eternal
He also told her, 'You would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water,' showing that the Lord Himself is the Giver
Finally, by careful reading, we shall discover that the way for the woman to obtain the gift was to contact or drink the Giver Himself
The Lord can turn people in such a fast way because, just as He did in His creation, He calls things not being as being
Although the Samaritan woman was so immoral, low, and deep in sin, she was turned within a fraction of a second
If we are going to help others, we must first be satisfied with Christ in order to bring Christ as satisfaction to others
The Samaritan woman did not go to her people with the doctrine of Christ; she first gained Christ and then went to them with Christ
We know this by the fact that the woman gave up the well and her waterpot and ran into the city to tell about Christ
The Lord's food was to do the will of Him who sent Him, which means that His food was to save and satisfy sinners
The first time He said that if we receive Him, He will be a fountain, or a spring within us, bubbling up into eternal life
In other words, after you have been saved and satisfied with Christ, you must bring people to Christ unto eternal life
You must receive Christ unto eternal life for yourself; then you must bring others to receive Christ unto eternal life
They came to know God and also something concerning the Messiah, the Christ, although it was not very clear or thorough
The Samaritan woman did not go with the doctrine about Christ to her people; she first gained Christ and then went to them with Christ
Verse 39 says, 'Many of the Samaritans from that city believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified'
We must read these narratives as figurative statements and we must discover the spiritual significance of these signs
Cana is in Galilee, a despised place , which signifies the world of a low and mean condition where the weak and fragile people are
Since He is the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit in Romans 8:2 is called the Spirit of life, meaning that the divine Spirit is life
Although the royal official begged the Lord to come down and heal his son , the Lord simply spoke the word, and the boy was healed
Once the life-giving word has been transfused into us, whether or not we are conscious of it, we can never be the same
When dying people receive the word through believing and are healed with life, this, in principle, is changing death into life
The case of the healing of the son of the royal official signifies that there is no need for us to contact the Lord physically
Even though we do not have the Lord's physical presence, as long as we have His word and work, it is good enough, and nothing more is needed
No religion on earth is better than the Jewish religion, for it is the genuine and typical religion formed according to God's holy oracle
Religion is just you trying your best to worship God, to behave properly to please God, and to be a perfect person-all without Christ
Although everything may be good-you worship God according to the regulations and you behave yourself-it is all void of Christ
He was the One who came to be salvation, life, righteousness, holiness, redemption, glory, and everything to God's people
According to their realization, when Jesus said that He was the Son of God, He was speaking blasphemy, making Himself equal to God
Many religious people worship God and try their best to please Him, to behave themselves, and to make themselves perfect
The central point of this case, on the negative side, is to show the inadequacy of law-keeping in the typical religion
The Jews realize that, apart from keeping the law, they have no way to please God, to behave themselves, and to perfect themselves
Along with these seven items of Judaism, there was also the means of healing, because there was the healing pool of water
Whenever a chance is given for you to receive the benefits of this religion, you must have the strength to be first and the ability to walk
The porches, like a sheepfold, signify the law-keeping religion's shelter, and the number five denotes responsibility
The angel who stirred up the water signifies the agent through which the law, which could not give life, was given
The stirring up of the water to make people well signifies the practice of the law-keeping trying to make people perfect
By considering these aspects, we can see the situation of law-keeping, which is the major thing in the typical religion
He was filled with expectation when he saw the waters stirring, but it was impossible for him to get there in time
Because of the weakness of the flesh and because of the lack of life, it is impossible for man to keep the law
The impotent man had no joy, even on the joyful day of the feast , and he had no rest, even on the Sabbath day
We have seen that this case on the negative side exposes the inadequacy and vanity of the law-keeping religion
The holy city could not help the impotent man; neither could the holy temple, the Holy Scriptures, nor the holy days
The Jews then said to the one who was healed, It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to pick up your bed'
Religion's law-keeping did not bring rest to the man sick for thirty-eight years, but life's enlivening did it in one second
The religious people cared only for the ritual of Sabbath-keeping; they had no concern for the sick man's rest
There is no requirement with Christ, for when He comes to us, He speaks His living word so that we can hear His voice
When Christ enlivened this man with life, that religion persecuted Him, trying to quench life, because He did it on the Sabbath
The Lord is still the same, caring at any cost for people's life matters at the sacrifice of all religious rituals
They did not know that there was no rest for the Father and the Son as long as the poor sinners were not saved
While they were resting in keeping their Sabbath the Father and the Son were still working that the sinners might receive life and have rest
Although God's work in creation was finished , the Father and the Son were still working for redemption and building
Verse 21 says, 'For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wills'
In addition to the resurrection in the spirit which we saw in verse 25, verse 29 distinguishes two kinds of physical resurrections
The regeneration in our spirit is a resurrection made by the Lord Jesus with the divine life, which is Himself
When the Lord Jesus comes back, all His dead believers will be resurrected and will be taken up with the living believers to the air
The Jews at one time were joyful over John the Baptist, but they did not realize that he was only the witness of Christ
The Father testified concerning the Son, but they did not have His word abiding in them, for they did not believe the Son whom He sent
They even searched the Scriptures that testified of Him, but they failed to come to Him that they might have eternal life
We shall not only have the understanding of the black and white letters in our mentality, but also have the life in our spirit
It is possible to have the signs the manifestations the gifts and the knowledge of the Scriptures but not come to contact the Lord Himself
It is not the signs, the gifts, or even the Scriptures, but it is the Lord Himself who will enliven you and impart life into you
In the first case, we were good persons; in the second, sinful persons; in the third, dying persons; and in the fourth, impotent persons
By understanding these four cases, we can realize where we are and who we are, and we can know where the Lord is and who He is
The people in the former case are associated with the pool, and the people in the latter case are involved with the sea
The Apostle John was also brought to the transcendent position of a mountain when he saw the eternal vision concerning the New Jerusalem
If we are going to feed on Him, we must be transcendent above the Satan-corrupted world and above the God-created earth
The tree of life, belonging to the vegetable life, is good for producing and generating, but has no blood for redeeming
In chapter six of John we firstly have the barley loaf, which belongs to the vegetable life and is good for feeding
As we shall see, since man has fallen and needs redeeming as well as feeding, the Lord Jesus turned the bread into flesh
The five barley loaves signify that the Lord as the Creator added to the creatures bears the responsibility to feed us
Just as fish are not salty though they live in salt water so the Lord was not corrupted by Satan though He lived in the Satancorrupted world
Now we must ask, if the human race had never fallen, would Christ as our regenerating life still have been necessary?
As we have seen, before man fell, he ate only of the vegetable life , but after he fell, he also ate of the animal life
There is a song that says, 'How Great Thou Art,' but we have a sweeter song which praises the Lord for His smallness
If the Lord only became a great prophet and was enthroned as a great king, He never could have been a little piece of bread
In Matthew 15 we see that the Lord not only became the loaves, but also the crumbs, which are small fragments of a loaf
The Canaanite woman was not offended by the Lord's hard words and by the fact that He referred to her as a dog
Lord, You must realize that now You are not on the table but under the table, because the naughty children have cast You away
The twelve baskets left over signify the overflow of the riches of Christ's life supply, which fed people over one thousand times
In form, He is the five loaves and the two fishes, yet thousands and thousands of people have been eating Him for twenty centuries
By God's sovereign ordination, we all must marry-there is no escape-but everyone who is married finds himself in trouble
The Lord's concept concerning man toward God is that he believe in Him, that is, receive Him as the life and life supply
The bread of life is the life supply in the form of food, like the tree of life , which is also the life supply 'good for food'
To believe Him means to believe that He is true and real, but to believe into Him means to receive Him and be united with Him as one
They needed all of its blood to sprinkle on their door frames; therefore, the blood was completely separated from its flesh
On the one hand, His blood will redeem them from their sins; on the other hand, His flesh will supply them with life
On the one hand, He said that He was the bread of life; on the other hand, He said that He was the living bread
The proper way to study the Word is to investigate both phrases and determine the reason for the difference between them
The bread of life refers to the nature of the bread, which is life; the living bread refers to the condition of the bread, which is living
To eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us to be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life
When we receive Him as the crucified and resurrected Savior, the Spirit who gives life comes into us to impart eternal life to us
The Apostle Paul said that formerly some knew Christ in the flesh, but now they know Him in the flesh no longer
Before His death, when He was in the flesh, all He could do was be with and among His disciples, but He could not be in them
The fact that we get the Spirit when we call on the name of Jesus is a strong proof that the Lord Jesus is the Spirit today
The Spirit is living and real, but rather mysterious, intangible, and difficult for people to apprehend, but the words are substantial
When you receive the Word into you, the Word becomes the Spirit once more, and when you speak the Word out, it becomes the Spirit again
The resurrected Christ is the Spirit, the Spirit is the Word, the Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the resurrected Lord for us to enjoy
Now, day by day, we are participating in this wonderful, resurrected Christ as our food, life, and life-supply
If you receive the Word, you will have the Spirit within; if you have the Spirit within, then you have Christ as the inner supply of life
The human, religious concept is what the Jews asked in verse 28: 'What shall we do that we may work the works of God'?
After the Lord answered their question, the Jews retorted in verse 30, saying, 'What sign will you do that we may see and believe you?
According to the divine thought, there is nothing for us to do but to believe into Christ and receive Him into us day by day
Of course, we can say that we must worship and fear the Lord, trust and obey the Lord, pray and work for the Lord
We may use many other verbs to explain what we must do for the Lord, but we would be afraid to think that we should eat Him
Beside the tree of life in Genesis 2 there is the river of water, which is a portrait of the Lord bringing us the rivers of living water
Later in the Scriptures, the children of Israel, as they traveled through the wilderness, also had both food and water
In the Gospel of John the Lord also is the living bread and He offers the living water to satisfy the hunger and the thirst of the multitude
The Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the three Persons of the Triune God, are very much related to this matter of food and water
The first Person of the Triune God is the source of the second Person as the food, from whom the third Person flows out as the drink
The writer used figures and pictures as well as plain words because the matters of life are too deep, profound, mysterious, and abstract
In the scene of the feast of the Passover, the Lord presented Himself as the bread of life, which satisfies man's hunger
In the scene of the feast of Tabernacles, the Lord promised that He would flow forth the living water, which quenches man's thirst
The case of the feeding of the five thousand finds the people working to fill their hunger, but failing to be satisfied
If you read the verses concerning the Passover in Exodus 12, you will see that the Passover indicates or implies the beginning of life
In a sense, all of the young people are in the Passover, for their life has just begun and they have many high expectations
Although perhaps you have not yet graduated from college, you expect that after graduation you will be a professor, doctor, or attorney
Although you may be successful in your occupation or career, you must realize that it will all issue in thirst
In John 6 we have the beginning of life, which results in hunger; in John 7 we have the success and completion of life, which end in thirst
Many foreign students come to the rich country of the United States for an education, but in reality, they are simply hungry
When you made out your application for college, you were hungry, but after your graduation, you were still thirsty
When you were first married, you were hungry, but now, after you are married, you sense that you are still thirsty
They may rejoice and enjoy the produce that is in their hands, yet only the Lord has the living water to quench their thirst
On one hand, He is the bread of life while we are laboring; on the other hand, He supplies us with the living water while we are resting
The feast of Tabernacles reminded the people of their need of the eternal tabernacle with the river of life flowing in it
We all are pilgrims wandering in the wilderness, living in tents, and needing to drink living water out of the rock
In the tabernacle of the New Jerusalem there will be the river of water flowing continually to quench the thirst of God's elect
We are journeying toward our final goal-the eternal tabernacle of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth
Although the Lord is the eternal, infinite, unlimited God , He lived on earth as a man, limited even in the matter of time
There will be a last day for an article of clothing that you value; there will be a last day for your marriage
Finally, their labor was over, and all that was left for them to do was to come together and enjoy their harvest for seven days
While the people were being dismissed on the last day of the feast the Lord stood up and cried If anyone thirst let him come to Me and drink
If they would come and drink of Christ, they would have rivers of living water flowing out from within their innermost being
When He was crucified and resurrected, the living water flowed out of Him and into us in order to quench our thirst
The Lord Jesus said, 'He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water'
In 4:14 the Lord said that whoever drinks of the water that He gives us will have in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life
In chapter seven the Lord goes somewhat further, saying that anyone who drinks of Him will have the flow of the rivers of water of life
One river is the river of peace, and other rivers are joy, comfort, righteousness, life, holiness, love, patience, and humility
In the principle set forth in chapter two, this flowing of the rivers of living water is also the changing of death into life
Before the pure water passed all these stations such a wonderful drink was not yet although the pure water in the glass was there already
After a few minutes, you may feel the Spirit killing your temper, pride, selfishness, and other negative things
The killing effect of the death of Christ is not merely on the cross, for, if it were, it would not be prevailing for us
Although the Lord was born in Bethlehem, He was raised in Nazareth, a town that was despised by the people of that time
He grew up as a 'root out of dry ground,' having 'no form or comeliness,' 'no beauty that we should desire Him
Some comprehended Christ according to His outward appearance by taking the tree of knowledge resulting in death
Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was'?
In that little house in Bethany there was nothing-no priests, no priestly robes, no altar, no offerings, and no incense
We must learn to follow the Lord Jesus according to the inward reality and not according to the outward appearance
In the record of this gospel, nine cases have been selected to prove that the Lord Jesus is the life and the life supply to people
No chapter in the entire Bible covers the problem of sin as widely and thoroughly as does the eighth chapter of John
As we shall see, following this, in chapters nine and ten, the matter of blindness is dealt with in a thorough way
Islam is a counterfeit of Judaism, and the Koran, the Moslem Bible, is the counterfeit of the Old Testament and part of the New Testament
According to Buddhism, if you practice until you attain a certain degree of perfection, you can become a Buddha
There is on earth only one typical, genuine, and true religion, the religion formed by the Jews according to the Holy Word
And the Word was God,' 'I am the light of the world,' 'I am the bread of life,' 'I can give you living water'-only Jesus can say such things
At the time of John 8, Jehovah stood there in the form of a little man by the name of Jesus, which means Jehovah the Savior
When we say that the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, we mean primarily that He died there for our redemption and removed our sin
The Son of Man was lifted up as was the brass serpent not only to deal with sin, but also to deal with the serpent
John 12:31-32 indicates that when the Son of Man was lifted up, the ruler of this world, the devil, was judged and cast out
If He had said that they had to stone her to death, then He would have lost His position as the Savior and Redeemer
On the other hand, if He said that they should not stone her to death, then they would have said that He was breaking the law
They thought that the Lord Jesus would find it difficult to answer and that they had an excellent opportunity to catch Him
While the Pharisees were asking what should be done with such a woman the Lord Jesus might have written in big letters Who is without sin
The only One who is qualified and has the position to condemn you is the Lord Jesus Himself, for He is without any spot of sin
In order to deal with the sinful, serpentine nature of mankind, He had to be lifted up on the cross in the form of a serpent
In human history, there is only one Person who is able to come into us and be our life to encounter the serpentine nature within us
When a kind mother loses her temper toward her child, the child will be frightened because his mother looks like a demon
By the shining of the inner life and by the working of the divine element in our very being, we are set free from the slavery of sin
You must experience the living Jesus in you as the shining light and as the divine element that works inwardly
When we received Him, He became our life, and this life becomes the very light that brings us out of the darkness of sin
He was lifted up for the serpent-poisoned sinners in the form of a serpent in order to cast out the old serpent
There is only one way for Him to forgive sin, and that is by being the Son of Man and being crucified on the cross
If we will abide and continue in the Word of the Lord, we will also contact the source of life all of the time
It is not a matter of here or there; it is a matter in the spirit in which we can contact God, the tree of life
The Lord Jesus did not answer her with a yes or a no, but turned her to the human spirit to contact God, the tree of life
The principle is the same in chapter eight when the Pharisees brought a sinful woman and asked the Lord whether or not she should be stoned
The Lord answered them by saying, 'Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God might be manifested in him'
The first six cases reveal that the Lord as life is for regenerating, satisfying, healing, enlivening, feeding, and quenching
These three-sin, blindness, and death-are grouped together showing how the Lord is our life in dealing with the negative things
The first case is about the regeneration in the beginning of life, and the last is about resurrection after the end of life
In the last group of cases, sin is placed first among the negative things because sin is the origin of blindness and death
It seems that the Lord again did a sign purposely on the Sabbath day to expose the vanity of the rituals of religion
Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God might be manifested in him'
We have seen that the Lord in the Gospel of John never answers such questions with an answer of yes or no, right or wrong
While both yes and no belong to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, in this gospel the Lord comes to us as the tree of life
Perhaps we consider ourselves as free from the tree of knowledge, but even now we may still be mainly under its influence
In chapter nine the man was born blind, signifying that blindness is in the nature of a person when he is born
When He had said this, He spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed his eyes with the clay'
And if thy oblation be a meat offering baked in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil'
The fine flour typifies the humanity of the Lord Jesus, and the oil typifies the Holy Spirit, the divinity of the Lord Jesus
Figuratively speaking, the spittle is the Word, which is spirit and life, that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord
In other words, the clay received something that proceeded out of the mouth of the Lord and was mingled with it
If we do not obey the anointing of the Spirit of life, the anointing will become a veil that covers our eyes instead of opening them
In other words, you, the old man, the clay, must receive the Lord's Word as the spittle and be mingled with the Lord in His Word
The second step will follow-that is, after you have received the Lord in His Word, you will have the anointing
Brothers and sisters, even today if you are going to have the sight and be in the light, you must first receive the Lord in His Word
Even though you have been regenerated, you must receive the Lord in His Word and be mingled with Him more and more
You are still clay and you need the spittle out of the Lord's mouth, which signifies the very essence of the Lord Himself
The anointing will command you, as a man of clay, to be put into the water of death and stand in the position of a sent one
We will have the anointing of the Spirit of life within us, which will put us all into the position of being sent ones
The blind man who received his sight was cast out , meaning that he was excommunicated, ostracized, from the Jewish synagogue
Although he did not know adequately who Jesus was, he did believe that Jesus was someone special and he argued about this with the Pharisees
The Lord, as the shepherd, entered the sheepfold, saw a little, blind sheep, opened his eyes, and then led that sheep out of the sheepfold
The blind man, like the blind and lame people on the porches in chapter five, was kept on the law-keeping porch
The Lord said that He will give sight to those who cannot see, but that He will make blind those who claim to see
On the surface, it seems easy to understand, but actually it is not easy to understand this parable or allegory
Faith having come, we are no longer under a child-conductor; for you are all the sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus'
The law kept God's people under custody 'unto the faith,' which is better translated as 'for preparation to the faith'
In ancient times, the children of the rich, Jewish families were escorted to their schoolmaster by a trained slave
The law was responsible for the care and protection of God's chosen people and eventually it brought them to Christ
The blind man who was cast out of the Jewish synagogue and who came to the Lord Jesus is one of God's chosen people
Verse 9 says, 'I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture'
Christ is the door, not only for God's elect to enter into the custody of the law, as did Moses, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, etc
The Lord indicates in verse 9 that He is the door not only for God's chosen people to go in, but also for God's chosen people to go out
Christ is the door through whom the New Testament believers may come out of Judaism and come into Him as the pasture
He made it known that the pasture is now ready and that it was unnecessary for the sheep to remain in their fold
The shepherd takes all of the sheep out of the fold through Himself as the door and brings them to Himself as the pasture
Now, since Christ has come, all God's chosen people must come out of the law and come to Him to enjoy Him as their pasture
The disciples Peter, James, and John were also ones in the fold, but they came out of it to feed upon Christ as the pasture
After these Old Testament prophets, many people came into the law not through and for Christ, but by and for themselves
By feeding on the pasture, the sheep will enjoy the pasture as their abundant life supply, for the Lord is their abundant life
In verse 11 the Greek word is psuche, the same word for soul, which means the soulish life, that is, the human life
In order to be our Savior, He, as a man, laid down His human life to accomplish redemption for us that we might receive His zoe life
He laid down His human life in order that we, after being redeemed, might receive His zoe life, the eternal life
As long as we live by our human life, we will resemble a wild animal, perhaps a devouring lion or a wild horse
Both the Son's hand as the hand of power and the Father's hand as the hand of love are for the believers' protection
John the Baptist was absolutely separated out of Judaism because he lived in the wilderness which was outside of Jerusalem beyond the Jordan
The testimony of John the Baptist was simply that of urging people to come out of the fold and to enter the pasture
After John the Baptist's announcement of Christ, the Lord went into the fold in order to bring the sheep out of the fold
His going to the wilderness beyond Jordan was a sign of His coming out of Judaism and going to a place that was outside of Judaism
The testimony of the Old Testament was the sheepfold, but the testimony of the New Testament is Christ as the pasture
The sheep enjoy the pasture as the resting place, the food, the water, the life supply, and as everything else
You too must come out of the fold and go into the pasture-that is, you must come out of 'Judaism' and go to Christ alone
Christ is outside of all the Judaistic types of groups and in the place where John the Baptist testified of Him
If you are truly a sheep, you will tell people how you long to be out of the fold, because in it there is too much bondage and confinement
Christ, the very exit out of the fold, is the shepherd who leads you out of the fold and brings you to Himself who can be everything to you
Before going into the matter of Christ raising Lazarus from the dead, we must realize that the Gospel of John reveals two things
On the negative side, this book also shows that religion, even the Jewish religion of Judaism, is very much against Christ as life
He forsook the temple, the holy city, and all the good things of the Jewish religion and came to a new standing
Even in the first chapter of this Gospel we find an indication that religion takes the wrong way, a way other than the way of life
By this case we can see how the rules and regulations of religion are in opposition to the Lord as life to the needy
The religious scribes and Pharisees tried to trap the Lord by asking Him, in their religious way, how to deal with an adulterous woman
The Lord answered in the way of life, exposing their folly in holding on to their religion and silencing them with shame
The eyes of the blind man received sight, but the eyes of the Pharisees received blindness due to their opposition
The Jews thought that Jesus was very much against their religion because He broke the regulations of their religion
The Lord took the opportunity to tell them that Judaism was nothing other than a sheepfold which keeps the sheep for awhile
After the Lord went out of Jerusalem, He went to a home in Bethany of one brother and two sisters who loved Him very much
The brother, Lazarus, became seriously ill, and the sisters sent a message to the Lord, which means that they prayed to Him
Now, in chapter eleven, Christ as the resurrection life is unfolded, but, at the same time, human opinions are brought to the surface
Although there is no problem of religion in the church, there is nevertheless another kind of hindrance, the hindrance of human opinion
Whenever the responsible ones see such a death situation, they are troubled and say to the Lord, 'O Lord, isn't this Your church?
Surely the Lord knew that Lazarus was sick and He knew exactly how to handle the situation, even if they had not sent any news to Him
In a prayer meeting you may say, 'Lord, we move Your hand,' but the more you try to move His hand, the more His hand refuses to be moved
When the Lord did not want to go, they were puzzled, and when the Lord was about to go, they thought that it was not necessary to go
What devastating knowledge of fundamental teaching that frustrates people from enjoying the Lord's present resurrection life!
The Lord asked her if she believed that He would raise Lazarus up, and she said, 'I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God'
After Martha said that she believed the Lord to be the Christ, the Son of God, she went away and called her sister Mary
Those opinions plus the Jews' ignorance of the Lord's ability to raise Lazarus from the dead caused the Lord to groan again
Although the Lord is life to the people in the church, He meets a great number of human opinions from the people in the church
The Lord could have moved the stone from the cave and He could have removed the bandages from Lazarus, but He did not do it
In the church life, we must drop our opinions, submit to the Lord's word and work, and cooperate with His resurrection power
As leaders in the local churches, we may be busy praying and asking the Lord to do things according to our opinion
Countless opinions of those who love the Lord the most hinder the Lord from being resurrection life in the church
These nine cases are very meaningful because they show that the Lord as life starts with regeneration and ends with resurrection
By itself, life can only have existence, but resurrection can withstand any kind of attack, even the attack of death
Throughout the whole universe this will be the greatest victory, the victory that will testify that the Lord is the resurrection
The Lord is the One who comes to the church as the resurrection life, but there are two categories of hindrances
Although there may be nothing like religion among them, yet how much their human opinions stand in the Lord's way!
Let us remember that religion and opinion are the two main categories of frustration to the flow of the Lord as our life
If you consider the condition of the people in each case, you will discover that in every case they had nothing but death
According to the second chapter, the six waterpots, a type of humanity, were filled to the brim with the water of death
Why was it that the Lord waited for two days instead of going immediately upon receiving the news of Lazarus' sickness?
Strictly speaking, the Lord waited for two days because He would not only heal people; rather, He would enliven us
All of these sick people, after discovering their sickness, send the information about their sickness to the Lord
Just like Martha who said that Lazarus was sick, they also say that they are sick of a bad temper, of bad behavior, or of joking
When you realize that you are absolutely in death having nothing except the water of death within you then the Lord will come to enliven you
When you awake to the fact that you are dead, buried, and even stinking with bad odors, the Lord will then come to enliven you
Christianity acts contrary to this principle, for it is a religion that tries to improve people, reform them, and regulate their behavior
If we take Him in the Spirit and through the Word, we shall then be satisfied, enlightened, freed, and resurrected
Nothing can suppress us, nothing can restrict us, and nothing can imprison us because we are living in resurrection
As the information about His resurrection power is brought to the religious groups, such as Judaism, it will cause a reaction
The religious groups will simply become angry with the Lord and even make the decision to arrest Him and put Him to death
According to the Scriptures, we know that Christ is our Passover , but those religious folks were going to have another Passover
On one hand, the religious people wanted to keep the Passover; on the other hand, they wanted to eliminate the reality of the Passover
The news of it spread to the Pharisees, and the Pharisees, after hearing of it, considered the situation as very serious
The opposition of religion, the conspiracy that plans to kill or terminate you, will carry out God's eternal purpose
After this, in chapter twelve, this Gospel reveals the issue of Christ being life to man: the producing of the church
In chapter eleven the Jewish religionists even held a council on how to put the Lord to death because He had raised Lazarus from the dead
The Lord Jesus came to earth in His incarnation not to be a religious leader but to come into man and to be man's life
Whether that religion is Catholicism or Protestantism, as long as it is a religion it will not and cannot purely take the Lord as life
On the one hand, He was rejected by Judaism and gave it up; on the other hand, He obtained a home where He could stay and rest
Although there was nothing outwardly attractive about that little house, inwardly it was filled with feasting, resting, and satisfaction
Such a church in resurrection life is the place where the Lord can find rest and satisfaction with us and where we can feast with the Lord
According to Mark 14:3 the feast mentioned in John 12:2 was prepared for the Lord in the house of a leper named Simon
The church on earth may not be rich in material things; it should be rich with the enjoyment of the Lord in His presence
In the church life there should always be a feast that the Lord Himself can enjoy and that His people can enjoy with Him
The church is a place where the Lord Himself can enjoy being with His people and where His people can enjoy being with Him
The church is a place where the Lord and His people come together to feast with one another and to enjoy one another
The best way and the only way for you to understand what we are doing is to come here and stay for two and a half years
Whenever the number of sisters in a church is smaller than the number of brothers, that church may not be so living
If you look into a situation where the number of sisters is greater than the number of brothers, you will find that that church is living
In the church service, the first function needed is to serve by doing certain things, by taking care of certain practical affairs
It gives people the feeling of resurrection power, the manifestation of resurrection life, and the enjoyment of the Lord as life
She represents the dear ones who love the Lord very much and who pour out what they hold most precious upon the Lord
When you come into a local church, the first thing that you should smell is the loving ointment poured out upon the Lord Jesus
It is not simply that Mary loved the Lord, but that she poured out her best upon the Lord, and this becomes a sign of the proper church life
Once a brother who was very living said to me, 'Brother, in the church some are Marthas and only a very few are a Lazarus
If we are truly practicing the church life, we must have the service, the testimony, and the love toward the Lord
In the real church life, the service to the Lord is rendered, the testimony of the Lord is seen, and the love toward the Lord is poured out
It is quite comforting that even in the little church established directly by the Lord Jesus Himself, there was such a black spot
The Jewish priests took counsel that they might kill Lazarus who testified to the resurrection power of the Lord
The stronger we are in bearing testimony of the Lord as life to us, the more the religious people will be provoked to anger with us
If there were no church in your locality, the hearts and the attitudes of men toward the Lord would be hidden and concealed
The living testimony of the church always causes people to believe in the Lord and brings people into the church life
The increase of the church must depend upon the church's living testimony, not only upon the preaching of the gospel
The best preaching of the gospel that makes the church to increase is our living testimony of experiencing the Lord as our life
Not only is the church a test and an exposure of people, but the Lord Himself is a test to all the people around Him
Because the Lord had raised Lazarus from the dead, a great crowd of the Jews highly esteemed Him and warmly welcomed Him
They welcomed Him by shouting, 'Hosanna, blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel'!
He is a grain of wheat, and there is no other way for that grain of wheat to increase except for it to fall into the ground and die
Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it will simply remain one grain and will never produce anything
The way for the church to come into being and to increase is not by human glory; it is by the death of the cross
She was not sent by any mission but went there by faith settling in a little town named Pagoda very close to Brother Watchman Nees hometown
Eventually he was nearly the only one who kept going to her, presenting himself to her as an offering for her rebukes
After a certain period of time had passed he would feel the need for further rebuking and would go to her for another rebuke and she did it
She did not have much that anyone could inherit except a Bible containing many notes, which she willed to Brother Nee
Nee on the contrary used to tell us that the work is not a matter of the endeavor of outward activity but of the outflow of the inner life
Today we see the issue of Brother Nee's ministry: many churches produced in the Lord's recovery throughout the world
Although Brother Nee has gone to be with the Lord, his ministry is still prevailing and his work continues to go on
What kind of increase do you expect to have-artificial flowers produced by outward labor or genuine flowers produced by life?
In one aspect, the Lord's death was a falling into the ground as revealed in verse 24; in another aspect, it was a lifting up on the tree
The many grains produced by His falling into the ground are the 'all men' drawn by His being lifted up on the tree
In chapter twelve of John the Lord's death is revealed not as the redeeming death but as the producing, generating death
In verse 23 the Lord said, 'The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified,' and in verse 28 He prayed, 'Father, glorify Your name'
God's divine element was confined in His flesh, just as the life element of a grain of wheat is confined within its shell
In verse 31 the Lord declared, 'Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out'
On the cross the Lord as the Son of Man was lifted up in the form of the serpent , that is, 'in the likeness of the flesh of sin'
Through His death on the cross 'in the likeness of the flesh of sin,' the Lord destroyed Satan, who is in man's flesh
If we do not know this Gospel, we may know the Lord as life, but we simply will not know the Lord as life in all its detailed aspects
If we want to know the Lord as life in detail, we must understand the Gospel of John, which unveils life in one picture after another
In 3:14 the Lord Jesus said that He had to be lifted up on the cross as the brass serpent was lifted up on a pole by Moses
In the second aspect He was the brass serpent that destroyed the old serpent as well as the serpentine nature within us
The one death of the Lord Jesus had these three aspects: the redeeming aspect, the Satan-destroying aspect, and the life-releasing aspect
When He was nailed to the cross, He was the Lamb of God bearing our sins and shedding His blood for our redemption
When Christ was on the cross, He was the Lamb, He was in the form of the serpent, and He was also a grain of wheat
The divine life has been imparted into us, and we are now the many grains that have been produced out of that one grain
If we want to bring the church into existence, to glorify God, and to deal with Satan, there is no other way than the death of the cross
No matter how much people welcome us or how they welcome us, we must realize that the more they welcome us, the more we must die
We as the many grains must lose our soul-life through death that we may enjoy the eternal life in resurrection
The many grains need to be crushed and ground into flour, into powder, that they may be blended together and become the bread
Regardless of how much the Lord as life worked in wonders, miracles, and signs, the religious people would not go along with Him
The Lord is the arm of God to do things and to deliver, but no one in the religious world could recognize this arm
After this declaration, for the remainder of the Gospel of John, the Lord has nothing to do with the religious people
Whoever sees Him sees God, and whoever receives Him receives God because He is the manifestation of God to man
Beginning with chapter thirteen, the Lord is continually with His disciples, no longer having anything to do with the Jewish people
The third discloses that the religious people will not go along with the Lord no matter how much He as life does for them in the signs
Probably all Christians know that such a chapter about the Lord's washing of the disciples' feet exists in the Gospels
If it is not made legalistic, then these occasions of showing love to one another by washing one another's feet are all right
He was transfigured from the expression of God in the flesh into the Spirit so that He could come into us as life
In the first part of John's Gospel the Lord comes to bring God into us, and in the last part the Lord goes to bring us into God
Without this, the Lord's love toward us would not have been to the uttermost but would have fallen short of our need
It was because He knew 'that the Father had given all into His hands, and that He had come forth from God and was going to God'
The Father had given the disciples, and the Lord had brought God into them, but now He was going to leave them
By His coming forth from God and His bringing God into them, a relationship between the disciples and God in Him came into existence
Foot-washing is the washing away from the feet of all the dirt that frustrates the fellowship of the relationship between God and man
What the Lord did in washing the disciples' feet was to keep His disciples in the relationship with God in Him
If the Lord had remained in all that He was in His virtues and attributes, He would have been unable to wash His disciples' feet
The Lord came through incarnation to bring God into us and He went through death and resurrection to bring us into God
As far as our spirit is concerned, God has been brought into us by the Lord's coming, and we have been brought into God by the Lord's going
In our spirit we have been joined to something heavenly, spiritual, and eternal, but in our body we are still on the earth
Although we have the divine life and have become the church, we are still living in this fallen flesh on the earth
In the ancient days of Judea, the people went almost everywhere by walking, by contacting the earth with their feet
When the guests were invited to a feast where they fellowshipped with one another, they had to wash their feet before the fellowship
They did not sit at the table like we do, with chairs or benches; rather, they reclined on the floor with their legs outstretched
Since this is a sign, the significance of foot-washing is that it is for fellowship with the Lord and with one another
If you just come and stretch out your feet without washing, the fellowship between you and others will be hindered
Today we must realize that the Lord is eager to wash and keep us clean from the dirt that we gather from our contact with the earth
Even as you are driving down the street on the way to the meeting, your eyes may accidentally see something that causes you to become dirty
For things that are sinful we need the cleansing of the blood, but for things that are dirty and not sinful we need the spiritual washing
Suppose a wife, out of concern for her husband's health, wants him to wear a topcoat when he does not really need one
You need another kind of washing, not the washing by the blood, but the washing by the Spirit, the living Word, and the inner life
Even if we say nothing and try to learn the lesson of the cross, we still find that our fellowship becomes dead
Some of them are quite living, and others are not at all living because they have become dirtied and their spirits are down
All the brothers have become dirty simply because they have lived together for a length of time without having the proper foot-washing
If we do not have a pleasant spirit yet we pretend to be pleasant in our words, the situation will become worse
The Lord washes our feet by the working of the Holy Spirit, by the enlightening of the Word, and by the operating of the inner law of life
After one week's accumulation of the earthly touch, do you feel the need of the washing when you come to the Lord's table on the Lord's Day?
We need not only the foot-washing that is exercised directly by the Lord Himself but also the mutual foot-washing of one another
Whenever we brothers come together for fellowship and prayer, we need to minister the spiritual foot-washing to one another
If the Lord had maintained the expression of His virtues and attributes, He would have been unable to wash the feet of the disciples
To lay aside your garments means to humble yourself, to empty yourself, to take something off of you and to strip something from you
When they come together, they look down on others, thinking that the others have never seen a heavenly vision or known anything spiritual
Whenever we come together with the saints, on the contrary, we must take off our garments and forget our attainments
We should not come to each other in the uniform of a policeman; otherwise, we shall be fearful and scared of one another
Eventually, you will rebuke the offending brother, and the result will be a quarrel, for he will deny that he did anything to offend you
Brothers, when we come together, we must not only lay aside our attainments, but we must also be bound and be willing to lose our liberty
As a leading one, an elder in the church life, you cannot avoid touching certain situations and speaking to certain people
Be assured that no one who comes to you is clean, for the clean ones will never come, because they do not have problems
Some sisters with problems will come to you again and again, not leaving you until they have caused you to be angry with them
If we are full of the lifewater we shall wash one anothers feet simply by being with them without having any intention of washing their feet
We have seen that the Gospel of John is altogether a book of life and that everything in it is related to life
It is not merely a physical practice that is carried out, as in some Christian groups, at every Holy Communion service
Without it, the church life cannot be maintained, because the fellowship will have been damaged by the earthly touch
We need the spiritual foot-washing to cleanse us from the earthly touch and to keep our spiritual fellowship in a good condition
We do not talk about it and we do not use this term, but there has been the reality of foot-washing in the water of life constantly
Foot-washing is very, very important because the fellowship with the Lord and with one another can never be maintained without it
The daily foot-washing definitely needs to be exercised by the Lord Himself on the one hand and by all the saints on the other
Before the Lord washed the disciples' feet, the devil had already put into Judas's heart that he should betray the Lord
From the very beginning, he was not in the fellowship with the Lord and he could never have been in it regardless of how much he was washed
For Him to be glorified was to have His divine element released from within His humanity through death and resurrection
God the Father was to be glorified in the Son's glorification, that is, He had His divine element released in the Son
God the Father was to be glorified in the Son in this way, and He would also glorify the Son in Himself and He would do it immediately
At that time, the Lord was ready to suffer the death of the cross, but His disciples were not yet equipped to follow Him in His suffering
The Lord told Peter that he could not follow Him then , because Peter had not yet received Him as the resurrection life
He was willing to remain in this fellowship with the Lord, but he failed by denying the Lord three times when the Lord was being tried
To remain in the fellowship of the Lord maintained by the foot-washing requires the strength of resurrection life
The Lord's coming brings God into us by incarnation, and the Lord's going brings us into God through His death and resurrection
Although He spoke about being in them as life, as yet He was only with and among them; He was not yet able to get into them
Lord, You say that You are the life and that You have come that we might have life and might have it abundantly
In a very detailed way, these three chapters unfold that Christ, as the indwelling life, is for the building of God's habitation
In 14:1-6 we see Jesus going through death and Christ coming in resurrection to bring us, the believers, into the Father
It refers to Jesus' going through death and Christ coming in resurrection to bring the believers into the Father
According to the natural concept, the Lord's going meant that He was leaving the disciples in order to go some place else
Now, by the help of the Holy Spirit, we have found the correct meaning: the Lord was going by death and resurrection
Immediately after the Lord said this, Thomas replied, 'Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can we know the way'?
It seems that there was an argument, with the Lord saying that His disciples knew the way and with Thomas saying that they did not know it
What do You mean when You say that You are the way, the reality, and the life, and that no one comes to the Father except through You?
The Lord was going to the Father, and His intention was to bring His disciples into the divine person of the Father
The purpose of His going to the Father was to bring us into the Father, just like the purpose of His coming was to bring God into man
In verse 1 the Lord said to His disciples, 'Let not your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe also in Me'
On the other hand, the Lord was not the flesh but the very God, and with God there are not the elements of time and space
In 3:13 He said, 'No one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven'
Because He told the disciples that He was going, and they had the human thought that His going meant that He was leaving them
If they believed in God, they also had to believe in Him because He was the same as the God who is always present
It is not a matter of believing the fact objectively; it is a matter of the subjective believing that brings us into God
The temple is a type, a figure, of the body of Jesus , which, as we have seen, has in resurrection been enlarged into the Body of Christ
Since the temple is the type of the body of Jesus, the body of Jesus is the tabernacle , the temple, for God's dwelling place on earth
We should not take this phrase in 14:2 to have a different meaning from the same phrase found in 2:16, for that would be illogical
The second time that this phrase is used in the same Gospel it must have the same definition as the first time it is used
In chapter two the Father's house is eventually the Body of Christ, and in chapter fourteen it must also be the Body of Christ
Now we have the proper interpretation of the phrase My Father's house: it is the Body of Christ, that is, the church
In the Epistles the revelation that the Body of Christ is the church and that the church is the house of God is fully developed
While so many Christians desire to go to heaven, God desires to come down from heaven and dwell with man on the earth
In Old Testament times God's building was with the children of Israel and was typified by the tabernacle and the temple
In the Old Testament we have the tabernacle and the temple, and in the New Testament we have the church as God's temple
We know this because the names of the twelve tribes of Israel and the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb will be there
If we put these two portions of the Word together, we shall see that the preparing a place is just the building of the church
As we have seen, in all the universe God has only one building-the building of His living habitation with His redeemed people
All of the separating elements the obstacles of sin sins the world the devil death the flesh the self and the old man must be abolished
He dealt with sin, sins, the world, the prince of this world, the flesh, the self, the old man, and even death
Before He was crucified, there were many obstacles, many frustrations, that hindered our going into the Father
By His death and resurrection, the Lord cut and prepared the way and paved the highway that can bring any person into God immediately
By His death and resurrection the Lord has not only opened the way into God but also prepared a standing for us before and in God
Since the Lord has gone through the cross and has been raised from the dead we know that we have a position before God and a standing in God
The Chinese version of the Bible even adopted the phrase the heavenly mansion for heaven in its translation of Hebrews 9:24 and 1 Peter 3:22
Throughout the whole New Testament the central thought is that after we have been saved and regenerated we are in God and in Christ
Anyone who does not have the standing, a place, in God does not have a place in the Body of Christ, which is God's habitation
He went to the cross and there He was cut and processed, not only into slices, but into watermelon juice good for drinking
For the Lord to receive His disciples to Himself was to put them into Himself, as is indicated by the words you in Me in verse 20
After His death and resurrection all the disciples got into the Father, just as the Lord was and is in the Father
Since the way is a living person, so the place to which the Lord brings us must also be a living person, God the Father Himself
If the Lord is going to be our way, He must be our reality, and if He is going to be our reality, He must be our life
By having Him as life, we have Him as our reality, and by having Him as our reality, we have Him as our way into the Father
The Son is the embodiment and expression of the Father , and the Spirit is the reality and realization of the Son
The Father in the Son is expressed among the believers, and the Son as the Spirit is realized in the believers
On the one hand it means that the Father and the Son are just one and on the other hand that They are still two
Although sometimes, for our speaking and understanding, we use the word person, we should not press this term too far into tritheism
If you have seen the Son, you have seen the Father because the Father is embodied in the Son to be seen among the believers
In our limited understanding, the Son is the Son, the Father is the Father, and the two are distinctly separate one from the other
We have to take the mystery of the Trinity according to the Lord's definite and clear word, not according to our suppositions
A son is given, yet His name is called the everlasting Father, just as a child is born, yet He is called the mighty God
Praise the Lord that the Bible tells us that the Son is called the Father just as the Bible tells us that the child is called the mighty God
When the Son was there with the disciples to express the Father, He was able only to be among them, but He was unable to be in them
Since He was the embodiment of the Father in the flesh, He was among the disciples to express the Father and to be seen by them
He came in the flesh to be among us, but He had to be transfigured into the Spirit before He could come into us
In verse 16 the Lord said, 'I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever'
The Greek word for Comforter paracletos anglicized paraclete means one alongside who takes care of our case our affairs and all of our needs
Today we have both the Lord Jesus in the heavens and the Spirit within us as our Paraclete, who takes care of our case
It was not until the Lord passed through death and was glorified in resurrection that this Spirit was brought to the disciples
After the resurrection of Christ, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ
The very 'He' who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17 becomes the very 'I' who is the Lord Himself in verse 18
Today some Christians accuse us of being heretical because we believe and teach that the Lord Jesus is the Spirit
By the mercy and the grace of the Lord, we do not care for any traditional concepts but only for the pure word of the Bible
After becoming in His resurrection the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of reality, He is now able to abide not only with us but also in us
On the day of resurrection the disciples were to know that the Lord was in the Father that the disciples were in Him and that He was in them
We need to see that verse 17 says that the Spirit will be in us and that verse 20 says that the Son will be in us
By being in us and by bringing us into the Father, the Lord can build us together as one in the Triune God to be His eternal abode
By these two sections of John 14 we can see that the Trinity of the Godhead is for dispensing the Triune God into us
The Lord's promise of the Spirit here in John 14 is different from the Father's promise of the Spirit in Luke 24:49
On the day of Pentecost the Spirit was the Spirit of power, but here, in the book of John, the Spirit is the Spirit of life
Since Acts is a book on the work of preaching and since this preaching needs power, in Acts we have the Spirit of power as the blowing wind
In John 14:16 we see the Lord's promise, for He said, 'I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter'
Fifty days later, on the day of Pentecost, the Father's promise of the Spirit of power in Luke 24 was fulfilled
In the past, God's building was with Israel, today it is with the church, and ultimately it will consummate in the New Jerusalem
He wants to spread from our spirit to our soul and even into our body , until our whole being is fully saturated and possessed by Him
The more we allow Him to saturate and possess us, the more He will accomplish His building in, through, and among us
Eventually, in this age He will have local churches in different localities as the expression of this building
Please be impressed that the abode is found in chapter fourteen and that the abiding is found in chapter fifteen
Nearly all Christians talk about the abiding in John 15 without realizing where the abode is, where it comes from, or how it is formed
The abode is found in the foregoing chapter, chapter fourteen, and it is formed by the Triune God dispensing Himself into the believers
Without the Son, the Father cannot be seen, but with the Son, the Father is embodied, manifested, expressed, and seen among men
Before the Lord was processed in this way, the Spirit was 'not yet' , but after this process, the Spirit of life is here
By this dispensing we all can know that the Son is in the Father, that we are in the Son, and that the Son is in us
Due to the fact that we are still in a situation with so many negative things, most of the time this living Christ speaks just one word-no
If we keep the Lord's commandments, we shall be loved by the Father and the Son, and the Son will manifest Himself to us
Tell me, according to your experience, when the Lord spoke the word 'no' to you and you obeyed Him, what was the result?
Although He indwells you, whether or not He appears or disappears from your inner sense depends on whether or not you listen to His words
In the whole Gospel of John there are only two requirements: the first is to believe in Him, and the second is to love Him
When the Lord says that the Father and Son will come to the believer, this does not mean that They are far away from the lover of Jesus
In the way that the Father and the Son will take the lover of Jesus as Their abode and that the believer will be an abode to Them
According to your realization at the time you had no problem with any believer and you were ready to forgive every brothers or sisters fault
When the Spirit comes from the source, it does not mean that He leaves the source but that He comes with the source
The Spirit came after the Lord's resurrection to remind the disciples of all the things that the Lord had told them before His crucifixion
When the disciples called on the name of the Son, they received the Spirit who reminded them of what the Son had told them before His death
The disciples did so at the risk of losing their lives or, at the very least, of losing the way to earn their living
Since the disciples were under the fear of the opposing and persecuting religion, the Lord told them that in Him they had peace
Regardless of the opposition, persecution, rumors, and bad names given to us by religion, the Lord Jesus within us is our life and our peace
By His death the Lord has taken away sin, sins, the self, the old man, the flesh, the world, the prince of the world, and death
By His resurrection He is now the Spirit, and as the Spirit He comes into us and brings us into union with God
The more we love the Lord, the more the Triune God will come to us, make His home with us, and make a mutual abode with us
Most Christians are very familiar with John 15, a wonderful chapter about the Lord as the vine and us as the branches
He is living within us, waiting for us to cooperate with Him that He might reveal and manifest Himself to us more and more
In other words, the Father has a divine plan, an eternal purpose, and He wants to accomplish the intention behind His purpose
He is the source, the founder, and the first one to accomplish certain things according to His mind and purpose
All that the Father is all that the Father has all the riches of the Fathers divine life and all the fullness of the Godhead are in the vine
Everything that God the Father is and has is for the center, is embodied in the center, and is expressed through the center
Whatever God the Father is in the Son and whatever He has centralized in the Son will be realized by the Spirit
All that God the Father is and has is centralized and embodied in God the Son, and all of this is realized in God the Spirit
In other words, God the Father as the source is embodied in God the Son as the center who is now realized as God the Spirit as the reality
In 15:1-11 we see that the vine and the branches are an organism to glorify the Father by expressing the riches of the divine life
It is exactly what we have said in Message Thirty-two-the mutual abode, the mingling of divinity with humanity
By this clear picture we can see that we are the branching out of the tree, for the branches are the branching out of the vine tree
If you were to cut off the branches, you would have just a bare tree without branches, and there would be no branching out of the vine
It means to have the intent, the content, the inner life, and the inner riches released from within and expressed
When the vine tree bears clusters of grapes, that is the time when the riches of the divine life are expressed
We may take as an illustration of this definition of the church the example of the wood used in making furniture
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
In Colossians 2:9 we see the Son as the embodiment of the Godhead, and in John 1:18 we see Him as the declaration, the manifestation, of God
A vine is not noted for its blossoms or its materials; it is noted for its manifestation of the riches of life
The Lord is not life for people to appreciate as blossoms; neither is He life to be used as some kind of material
As we have already pointed out, whatever God the Father is, has, and can do has all been embodied in the vine tree
The branches, the believers in the Son, are for the expression of the Son with the Father through the fruit-bearing
It is not just preaching or soul-winning; it must be fruit-bearing by the overflow of the riches of the inner life
Apparently, each one of them bears fruit separately; actually, all of them bear fruit corporately in one tree and with one life
In verse 2 the Lord said of the Father that 'every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it, that it may bear more fruit'
The way to cause these branches to bear fruit is to cut away the old part of the branches and let new sprouts come out
To be cast out is not to lose our salvation; it is to be cut off from the enjoyment of the riches of the life of the vine tree
Many Christians today cannot have the expression of the Son with the Father because they are branches that have been cut off from the vine
The divine purpose of God the Father in cultivating the Son as the vine tree is to express the fullness of the Godhead
As we pointed out in the last message, if we are to abide in the vine, we must see the fact that we are the branches in the vine
Once we see the fact that we are branches in the vine, we need to maintain the fellowship between us and the vine
A little disobedience, a sin, or even a sinful thought can be the insulation that separates us from the riches of the vine
If we do not condemn such things but hold on to them, they will insulate us from the rich supply of the vine tree
While Christ's abiding is gradually spreading within us, there is something within that restricts this abiding Christ
Oh, how we need to keep our fellowship with Him and be willing to allow Him to take more ground and to expand within us!
Please keep in mind that we must take care of two things-not to have any insulation and not to have any limitation
Since we are the branches to the Lord and the Lord is the vine to us, we must abide in Him and let Him abide in us
If we do keep it, we shall absorb all of the riches of His fullness, of His life, and have an overflow of life for fruit-bearing
In verses 4 and 5 the Lord tells us that He abides in us, but in verse 7 He changes the wording a little to say that His words abide in us
During the Passover the Jews always slew the lamb, sprinkled its blood on the doorpost, and fed upon its flesh
It needs to be substantial instead of spiritual, available instead of mysterious, and profitable instead of doctrinal
We know that the Lord is the vine, that we are the branches, and that if we abide in Him He will certainly abide in us
When we received His word, we actually received the Lord Himself because the Lord is in His word and He Himself is the Word
According to the same principle, if we want to allow the Lord to abide in us, we must let His words abide in us
According to our experience, if we keep ourselves in the fellowship of the Lord, we have rhema within from the Lord all of the time
Perhaps you are thinking about a certain matter that you want to do today, but again something within you tells you not to do it
If we say that we are going to abide in Christ and let Christ abide in us, certainly we must deal with both kinds of words
We must read these sixty-six books word by word because all of the words express, explain, and define our mysterious Lord
The outer logos and the inner rhema always correspond with each other, and many times the inner rhema interprets the outer logos
Perhaps you read the written logos in the morning but fail to understand it or to apply it to yourself in a living way
While you are working, the Spirit anoints you from within with the word, giving you the right meaning and even the right emphasis
In verse 7 the Lord said, 'If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall come to pass to you'
When we abide in the Lord and let His words abide in us, we are actually one with Him, and He is working within us
The prayer in verse 7 is related to the fruit-bearing and the glorification of the Father mentioned in verse 8
When the Father's divine life is expressed in the fruit-bearing of the organism of the vine and the branches, He is glorified
When we utter this in prayer and act, live, and walk according to what we pray, God is expressed and glorified
For the sake of the abiding we must take care of the Lord's word in two aspects-the inward word and the outward word
The Lord will express Himself through this living word, and we will know the Lord's will, intention, desire, and thought
It is not good for some people to read the Scriptures too much, for it is like stuffing themselves with too much food
We need to pray with and over the Word sentence by sentence clause by clause phrase by phrase and even word by word digesting what we read
If we pray over the words that we read, the spiritual nourishment will come forth, and we shall be nourished and strengthened in the spirit
When you say amen and keep His words, you get into His love, having the sweet sensation that He is so dear, precious, and lovely to you
Out of this fellowship we shall have some prayer in the spirit which will be the expression of the living Lord dwelling within us
Out of this intimate, intense abiding, clusters of fruit will be produced because we have been filled with all of the Lord's riches of life
We have covered the first part of John 15, verses 1 through 11, which shows the relationship between us and the Lord
In this part of the chapter we see that the branches should love one another to express the divine life in fruit-bearing
Because they are the Lord's friends, the branches can know the Father's desire that He be expressed in a corporate Body
To ask in the Lord's name requires us to abide in the Lord and to let Him and His words abide in us that we may actually be one with Him
We need to love one another in the Lord's life, the divine life, in the Lord's love, and in His commission of fruit-bearing
Having different sources of life, different conditions, or different goals will separate us and prevent us from loving one another
We must love one another in the divine life with the divine love and for the purpose of bearing much fruit that the Father may be glorified
Religion, as a part of Satan's world system, hates the branches of the divine organism for the expression of the Triune God
The purpose behind the enemy's cosmic system is to oppose the church as the organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ
As branches who have been chosen out of the world, we should have nothing to do with the satanic system of religion
For the church to be the organism for the expression of the Triune God, we have to be separated from any kind of religion
The Lord told His disciples that if they were willing to follow Him in the way of life, they must be ready to suffer persecution
The Lord was telling His disciples that because of Him the religious people would persecute and even kill them
In the eyes of the Lord, the religious system, as part of Satan's system, is the world that will hate the disciples
Because the religious people do not know the Father who is the source of the Lord, they hate the Lord's true followers
In 14:26 he says that the Father will send the Spirit; now in 15:26 he says that the Lord Himself will send the Spirit
Regardless of who it is who sends the Spirit, the Spirit is always sent with the Father and in the name of the Son
When the Spirit comes from the source, it does not mean that He leaves the source but that the source comes with Him
In verse 2 the Lord said, 'An hour is coming when everyone who kills you will think that he is offering service to God'
Because we take this very God as our life and abode and make ourselves God's abode, these religious people threaten to kill us
If the Roman Catholic Church and the denominations do not persecute you, then you must realize that you are wrong
In the Gospel of John the Lord spoke several times about the world, by which, in particular, He meant the religious world
As we come to chapter sixteen, we must remember the main principles that the Lord dealt with in the previous chapters
The second main principle is that the Lord went through death that He might return in resurrection as the Spirit of reality
If we have only the teachings, doctrines, and letters about the Lord without the Spirit, we do not have the reality
Some revelation and heavenly vision are needed before the eyes of our spirit, heart, and mind can be opened to see this mystery
In verse 8 the Lord said of the Spirit that He will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment
Righteousness is related to Christ because righteousness comes from Christ and even is the resurrected Christ Himself
Let us now look in more detail at each of these three main items, beginning with the matter of convicting the world concerning sin
Today people usually say that they were born in a certain country, but they must also realize that they were born in sin
In verse 9 the Lord said that the Spirit would convict the world concerning sin 'because they do not believe in Me'
If people wish to remain in Adam, it means that they want to remain in the old realm and not move into the new realm, which is Christ
He came in the flesh and even died in the form of a serpent on the cross to fulfill God's righteous requirements
The Father has been fully satisfied with the Lord's redemptive death on the cross and has accepted Him in His resurrection
As the resurrected One, He is in us to live for us a life that can be justified by God and is always acceptable to God
Justification includes the fact that God has resurrected Christ, accepted Him, and that He has been satisfied with His redemptive death
Since He Himself was to become our righteousness , it was prophesied in Jeremiah 23:6 that He would be called 'the Lord our righteousness'
In verse 11 the Lord said that the Spirit will convince the world 'concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged'
Satan, the devil, is the author of sin, the origin of death, the father of all sinners, and the ruler of the world
On the cross the Lord as the Son of Man was lifted up in the form of the serpent , that is, 'in the likeness of the flesh of sin'
Through His death on the cross in the likeness of the flesh of sin, the Lord destroyed Satan, who is in man's flesh
If we are unwilling to be translated from Adam into Christ, we must be warned that we shall share the judgment with Satan
In other words, you were born in Adam, but God's intention is to take you out of Adam and translate you into Christ
If you are willing to be translated from Adam into Christ, you will be saved, having nothing to do with the judgment
The work of the Holy Spirit involves these three items, and every time we preach the gospel we must tell people about them
Nee told me Witness hardly anyone has seen that in John 16811 sin is related to Adam righteousness to Christ and judgment to Satan
The second category of the Spirit's work is to glorify the Son by revealing Him with the fullness of the Father to the believers
Whatever the Son is, has, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained will all be fully wrought into us through the Spirit
The Spirit of reality does not guide the believers into the doctrine concerning Christ but into all the reality of Christ
The Father's fullness is the Son's fullness, and the Father's life and nature are also the Son's life and nature
In verse 14 speaking of the Spirit of reality the Lord said He shall glorify Me for He shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you
All that the Father is and has is the Son's and all that the Son is and has obtained has been received by the Spirit
In verses 14 and 15 the Lord said that the Spirit of reality 'shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you'
God the Father is the source and the essence of life, and the Son is the embodiment and expression of this life
Without the Spirit as the realization and application, everything may be real, but it is not available or applicable
He does not do it by teaching you about Christ as humility, but by directly revealing Christ as humility to you
There will be no Jewish, Greek, American, British, Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, or any other kind of expression
As the Spirit glorifies the Son with the Father, the Triune God is wrought into and mingled with the believers
When the Spirit of reality comes, He will guide us into the full reality of Christ and mingle us with the Triune God
The more the Son is revealed to us with the fullness of the Father, the more experience we shall have of the Son
In verses 16 through 24 we see a point which is rather difficult to understand: the Son was to be born in resurrection as a newborn child
The Lord had told His disciples that He would be killed and that this would make the world happy but the disciples sorrowful
In those three days, the disciples did suffer the travail of the birth of Christ in resurrection to be born as the Son of God
Psalm 2:7, which is quoted in both Acts 13:33 and Hebrews 1:5, prophesied that Christ would be begotten as the Son of God in resurrection
Before His death and resurrection He was the Son of God in humanity, but His human part was not the Son of God
Before the Lord's death and resurrection He was the Son of God; yet whenever people saw Him, they could still ask, 'Who is this man?
As a mother is happy when she sees her newborn child, so the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord on the day of resurrection
In verse 16 the Lord had said to them, 'A little while and you shall behold Me no longer, and again a little while and you shall see Me'
Whosesoever sins you forgive, their sins have been forgiven them; and whosesoever sins you retain, they have been retained'
What we loose shall be loosed by the Lord, and what we bind shall be bound by the Lord, because in the Spirit we are one with Him
Be sure that when you say, 'I bind,' you are in the Spirit, for if you are not in the Spirit, it will not work
What we bind, the Lord will bind; what we loose, the Lord will loose; and what we ask, the Father will give us in the Lord's name
At that time, the Lord made clear to the disciples that He had come out from God the Father, and they believed it
They no longer pray indirectly to the Father through the Son; they pray directly to the Father in the Son because they are one with Him
The life, nature, substance, essence, and all the fullness of the Triune God have been wrought into the vine tree
If we read John 14 through 17 carefully, we shall realize that these four chapters have a very specific flavor in utterance and composition
Although the whole Bible undoubtedly is God-breathed, these four chapters have a special taste, a special flavor, that no one can imitate
Although you may not understand these chapters, if you are in the spirit as you read them, you will sense the divine flavor
We must worship Him for the message He gave before His death, and we must worship Him for His concluding prayer
The first aspect of this central thought is that the Lord Jesus, the Son of God, was sent by the Father to be among us
When the Holy Spirit comes into us, He comes as the Spirit of reality to make the Lord Jesus real to us in every respect
The main point of the Lord's message in John 14 through 16 was that the Son may be glorified so that the Father may be glorified in the Son
The Lord Jesus is the very image of the invisible God , which means that He is the very expression of the invisible God
The blossoming is the glorification of the seed, for it is by blossoming that the seed is glorified, that is, expressed
After the Lord became flesh, He expressed God to some extent, but the glory of God, the glory of all His attributes, was hidden in His flesh
His divine element was confined in His humanity, just as God's shekinah glory was concealed within the tabernacle
Before He uttered this prayer, He had predicted that He would be glorified and that the Father would be glorified in His glorification
The Lord's resurrection was not the complete fulfillment of His prayer; it was just the first step in the fulfillment of this prayer
If we say that we are coming together to exhibit Christ, it means that we are glorifying Christ and making Him manifested
When the Lord is manifested and glorified through us, the Father is also glorified in the Lord at the same time
You need to stay in the church's living room enjoying the beauty of the divine life expressed in that particular church
We need to look at the beauty of the church life, for the church life is the second stage of the glorification of the Triune God
We must believe that every local church, as long as it is proper, has a certain amount of the beauty of the divine life
Through the holy city the Son will be fully expressed in glory, and God will also be glorified in Him for eternity
Look at the picture of the New Jerusalem: it is a vessel to express Christ, to make God expressed through Christ
The city, composed of all the redeemed ones, has the names of the twelve tribes of Israel and the names of the twelve apostles
The twelve tribes represent all the saints of the Old Testament, and the twelve apostles represent all the saints of the New Testament
When the lamp is manifested and glorified through the wall of the city, the light in the lamp is also glorified
Immediately afterward, Brother Nee offered a prayer in which he said, 'Praise the Lord that the church is not weak
By His resurrection, the Lord Jesus has been manifested and glorified, and by this glorification the Father has also been glorified
At that time, all the redeemed ones of both the Old and New Testament will be composed together as the complete expression of the Triune God
The Lord participates in the divine glory, not separately by Himself, but along with the Father, for He and the Father are one
The Lord, by praying this way, indicates His person, His deity, showing that He is the same as the Father in the divine glory
The Father could never be glorified apart from the Son, because the Father has entrusted all that He is and has to the Son
The Son is glorified along with the Father with the glory that the Father gave Him before the foundation of the world
Verse 2 says, 'Even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, that He may give eternal life to all You have given Him'
The Lord created man, exercised His authority over man, and redeemed some of them for the purpose of giving them eternal life
In other words, the Lord must first create, then rule over, redeem, and finally give life to a chosen group of people
If you have seen this, your view, attitude, and concept will all be changed, not only concerning yourself but also concerning all the saints
If you have seen this, you will love every saint, because every dear saint is a gift selected by the Father and given to the Son
In verse 3 the Lord said, 'And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ'
Since we have the divine life, we do not need to be taught to know God, for the function of the divine life is to know God and Christ
The first part, verses 1 through 5, gives us the subject of the prayer, and the second part, verses 6 through 24, deals with oneness
Sometimes, however, it is not even a piling up; it is a matter of one person who is far away from another, saying, 'We are one'
The oneness today often is not even a shaking hands over the fence, but a begging of people who are far away from one another
As the father of a family is the very source and origin of life, so the name Father reveals the Father as the source of life
Although a man may be quite young, as long as he becomes a father with a source of life, he has some propagation
After getting married, this man's life, which is the father's life as the source of a family, begins to be propagated
Of the Father, who is the source of life and who is for the propagation and multiplication of life, many sons are born to express Him
We have seen that this concluding prayer is the confirmation and strengthening of the foregoing message in chapters fourteen through sixteen
In that message we saw the propagation of life and the multiplication of life for the expression of the Triune God
Now we have the same points in this concluding prayer: the Father is propagating, bringing forth, many sons for His expression
In verse 6 the Lord said to the Father, 'I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world'
It was not until the second chapter of Genesis, when God was about to establish a relationship with man, that He revealed the name Jehovah
While the names God and Jehovah are fully revealed in the Old Testament, the name Father is not fully revealed
The Old Testament does not unfold the revelation that God is a begetting Father who will regenerate countless persons
In the book of Matthew the Lord taught His disciples to call God Father, saying, 'Our Father who is in the heavens'
Throughout the world, little children use a double title, such as Papa, or Mama, when addressing their parents
When Brother Nee asked him why he called his wife's father Papa reluctantly, he said, 'Because he is not my father'
As the Son is one with the Father , so He came and worked in the Father's name, that is, in the Father's reality
As the Son is one with the Father, so, when He was with the believers, He manifested the Father to them in what the Father is
It is much more difficult for an adopted son to know his father than it is for a son who is actually born with a certain man's life
Since the Father's life has been imparted into us, spontaneously the Father is made known to us by life, not by teaching
The Father's words are not mainly for teaching or instruction; they are mainly for imparting life into the believers
The Lord came to reveal to His disciples that God is the Father, the source of life, who intends to bring forth countless sons
Although they may be unhappy with one another and may desire to separate, the life of their father within them joins them together
If the Father's children allow their mentality to overcome and overshadow their inner life, they will be divided
Any person in a local church who considers himself quite smart in his mentality will be a main cause of division
Many brothers in the flesh love one another, not according to the outward condition but according to their inward blood
Although we sometimes fought with each other, whenever someone tried to injure us, we were immediately united because we were of one blood
The first aspect of oneness, which is the building up of the believers, is the oneness in the Father's name by His divine life
The first ground and reason for our oneness is that we all are sons of God having the same divine life and that God is the Father of us all
When we are one in the Father's name by the Father's life, enjoying the Father together, we shall have the Lord's joy made full in us
After we have been born again as the children of God, we must be separated from the world by the holy word of the Lord
Once we have been separated from the world by the holy word, we shall be centralized to realize genuine oneness
The Lord has given the believers two kinds of words: the logos, the constant word , and the rhema, the instant word
The more we are nourished, saturated, and permeated with the Lord's constant or instant word, the holier we become
The evil one is the devil, and the world is an evil system arranged systematically and ruled by the devil, Satan
Some Christians only see this much regarding sanctification; they do not see the matter of dispositional sanctification
As far as the Lord Himself was concerned, He could have met with the Samaritan woman, who was an immoral person, at any place and at anytime
It is not right for any young preacher to contact a woman privately at night because there is too much temptation there
After we have been sanctified, separated from the world by the holy word, we shall enjoy the Triune God and be one in Him
The oneness in the Triune God through sanctification by the holy word is the second aspect of the believers' oneness
In this aspect of oneness, the believers who have been separated from the world unto God enjoy the Triune God as the factor of their oneness
Both the divine life and the holy word are necessary for having the genuine oneness which results in the true building up of the church
The glory which God gave to the Son is the life and nature of God which make the Son the expression and manifestation of God
As the many sons, we have the divine sonship with the divine life and nature to express the Father in the Son with all of His fullness
On the one hand, we have been sanctified from so many worldly places and worldly things and have come home to the Father's house
Once we were separated into various worldly places, but now, having come home, we may still have trouble with the self
After we have been regenerated, we must be sanctified, and after we have been sanctified, we must be glorified
There are three grounds or steps of the oneness of the believers: regeneration, sanctification, and glorification
We may have the divine life and be separated from the world through the holy word and still not be shining with God's glory
Now we see that our oneness has a goal-to express God the Father in His fullness, even during this dark age on this corrupted earth
We must live by this glorious divine life so that we may be absolutely perfected in the very glory of the divine life
The third aspect of the believers' oneness is the oneness in the divine glory for the corporate expression of the Triune God
The ultimate oneness of the believers is in the eternal life by the holy word and in the divine glory to express the Triune God for eternity
The latter part of verse 23 says, 'That the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me'
The Father has loved the Son in that He has given the Son His life, His nature, His fullness, and His glory to express Him
Not many of us appreciate this love, the love in giving us the Father's life, nature, fullness, and glory to express Him
If the Son's believers are to be with Him where He is, they must be with Him in the divine glory to express the Father
The Father is righteous in loving the Son and His believers, giving His glory both to the Son and to His believers
The Father has revealed everything concerning life to the Lord Jesus and to His believers because the Lord and His believers know the Father
The Father is righteous in His discernment, for by His righteous judgment He reveals to us the matters of life
The words, 'Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You' , are the subject of this prayer
Verse 11 says, 'Holy Father, keep them in Your name which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are'
Since the glory which the Father has given to the Son has been given to us by the Son, genuine oneness is in the divine glory
Glory is the sonship given to the Son by the Father with the Father's divine life and nature to express the Father in His fullness
Today we all have the sonship with the Father's life and nature to express the Father in all His fullness in the Son
The Lord was in the divine glory and prayed that all whom the Father had given Him would also be with Him in glory
According to this concept, in 'the sweet by-and-by' the glory will shine and we all shall come into that shining and be in glory
Being with the Lord in glory and beholding His glory are not for 'the sweet by-and-by'; we may experience them today
The Son has the sonship with the divine life and the divine nature to express the Father, and we also have this
By this we see that real oneness is in the Triune God through the process of the death and resurrection of the Son
The last stage, the glorification of the Triune God, is simply the manifestation of the Triune God, that is, the glory of sonship
Are you simply one in life or do you have the higher oneness in sanctification or the highest oneness in the glorification of the Triune God
Finally, you need to realize the crucifixion of the cross in order to live in the glorification of the Triune God
You must deny yourself live in the manifestation of the Triune God and be perfected into the oneness of the glorification of the Triune God
By this we can see that the temple or the tabernacle was not only God's dwelling place but also the dwelling place of those who loved God
The number six, as the number of the six stone water pots in John 2, signifies man who was created on the sixth day
The first day of the week, following the seven days of the previous week, is the eighth day and signifies a new beginning
The number eight signifies a new beginning in resurrection, and the number forty-eight signifies humanity in resurrection
In the church there is the need of humanity, but this should be the resurrected humanity, not the natural humanity
The gold overlaying the forty-eight boards in the tabernacle signifies the divine essence with the divine glory
Upon the overlaying gold were the golden rings, and within the golden rings were the golden uniting bars that united the forty-eight boards
In order to be built together, many pieces are not only put together but are fitly framed together to form one unit
If the gold was removed from the forty-eight boards, the oneness would have been lost, and the forty-eight boards would have fallen apart
The gold overlaid the boards, on the overlaying gold were the golden rings, and within the golden rings were the golden uniting bars
It is in the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine glory, not in the humanity, that all the 'boards' are one
Although we are the boards in resurrection this resurrected humanity is not the uniting factor the uniting factor is the divinity the gold
Eventually we like the fortyeight boards in the tabernacle do not express ourselves but the glory of the Triune God as typified by the gold
Some Christians say that every local church should be distinct, being different from all the other local churches
In their negativeness, some of those seven churches were different from the others, but in their positiveness, they were all the same
According to those who hold this opinion, each side of the wall should express something unique, something different from the others
All four sides of the New Jerusalem have the same expression-the expression of jasper, the glorious appearance of God
In the New Testament, the distinction between the churches is not on the positive side but on the negative side
The saints in Jerusalem even convinced Paul to pay the charge for purification in the Jewish religious way, but God did not agree with that
We have one Bible, we believe in one God, we have the same one Jesus Christ as our Savior, and we all enjoy Him as our life to express God
Following this, the writer gives a record showing how the Lord was crucified, went into death, and came out of death in resurrection
Although He was not forced or compelled to die, He was willing to die because He had come to impart Himself to us as life
The Lord did not hide but willingly offered Himself to be processed, delivering Himself to the people who were to put Him to death
The Lord took this as an opportunity to be glorified , that is, to be multiplied through death and resurrection
Another indication of the Lord's willingness to die was that the people did not discover Him but that He came to them
The soldiers were the political ones, and the deputies from the chief priests and Pharisees were the religious ones
If He had been unwilling to die, no one could have captured Him, for He could have frightened everyone and caused them to fall to the ground
While the Lord was handing Himself over to the people, He took good care of His disciples in a very easy manner
His willingness to die was also proved by the incident of Peter's cutting off the right ear of Malchus, the slave of the high priest
The Lord told him to sheath his sword because He had come to fulfill the purpose of the Father, which was to give Himself as life to others
The Lord was not forced to die; He willingly delivered Himself to death so that He could release His life to bring forth much fruit
When the Lord knew that the religious with the political ones were coming to arrest Him and put Him to death, He was not fearful
In the face of death, He took care of His disciples in an easy manner telling His arrestors to let His disciples go
In every scene depicted in these two chapters, the Lord was at ease; He was neither moved nor influenced by the fear of death
Troubles were heaped upon Him during that time of suffering, yet the record discloses that He was always composed
According to the type, before the Passover lamb was killed, it had to be examined to determine whether or not it had any blemish
While the high priest was examining and judging the Lord, the high priest was being judged by the Lord in His dignity
While the Passover lamb was being examined, the examiner was being examined by Him, and the blemishes of the examiner were exposed
They put the lamb on the cross, tying two of the lamb's legs to the foot of the cross and fastening the outstretched legs to the crossbar
Not long before the crucifixion of Christ, the Roman government adopted crucifixion as the method of executing criminals
When the Lord was brought before Pilate, again it seemed that Pilate judged Him, but eventually He judged Pilate
Politics did not take the initiative; it was religion which took the initiative, utilizing the power of dark politics
After being sentenced unjustly, He was crucified at Golgotha , which, in Latin, is Calvary and means the Place of the Skull
At Golgotha, 'they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on this side and one on that, and Jesus in the middle'
According to God's sovereignty, the Lord was killed by mankind represented by Hebrew religion, Roman politics, and Greek culture
The Hebrew represented Hebrew religion, the Latin represented Roman politics, and the Greek represented Greek culture
While Jesus was being crucified He saw His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing by and He said to His mother Woman behold your son
As we have seen, the first word spoken by the Lord on the cross was, 'Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing'
In Luke 23:43 the Lord said to one of the two thieves crucified with Him, 'Today you shall be with Me in Paradise'
Here, in 19:26-27, the Lord said to His mother, 'Behold, your son,' and to His disciple, 'Behold, your mother'
These words indicate the union of life, because John's Gospel testifies that the Lord is life imparted into His believers
According to John's record, Jesus was crucified for the transfer of life, for the imparting of His life into His disciples
Through this transfer of life, one of His disciples could be His mother's son, and His mother could be this disciple's mother
The Gospel of John is not a gospel of salvation but a gospel of life that is transferred into all the believers
How could the Lord's mother become the mother of His disciple, and how could His disciple become the son of His mother?
By His death, the Lord imparted Himself to John the disciple, who was united to and identified with the Lord by the divine life
Although we may be as sinful as the thief, we too can be redeemed from the curse and go immediately to be with the Lord in Paradise
In John the Lord Jesus died to release and impart Himself as life into the disciples, thus making all the disciples identified with Him
A vessel full of vinegar was lying there; so they put a sponge full of vinegar on hyssop and brought it to His mouth'
At the last minute, after everything had been accomplished, He declared to the whole universe, 'It is finished'!
Rather, it provided a contrast which proved strongly that He was life versus death, a life which could not be affected by death in any way
In other words the Lord is the very expression of God imparting Himself to us as life meeting all our needs and mingling God with us as one
John 19:34 says, 'But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water'
The words spoken by the Lord on the cross in Luke 2334 Father forgive them and in Matthew 2746 My God My God why have You forsaken Me
The flowing water and the unbroken bone mentioned by John in verses 34 and 36 are signs of the Lord's life-imparting death
The blood was typified by the blood of the Passover lamb , and the water by the water that flowed out of the smitten rock
The Jews, not wanting the bodies to remain on the cross on the Sabbath, asked Pilate that their legs might be broken
In other words, the church came out of the resurrection life, the unbroken life, the incorruptible life of Christ
If one of the Lord's bones could be broken, it would mean that the Lord's resurrection life could be hurt and broken by death
According to this principle, the first mention of an item in the Bible determines its meaning throughout the Scriptures
Eve is a type of the church, Adam is a type of Christ, and the bone is a type of the resurrection life of Christ
The unbroken bone of the Lord Jesus indicates that He is the resurrection life which cannot be broken by death
Although the Lord's resurrection life was not broken, He Himself was broken that His divine life might be released
While the record of the other three Gospels is mainly for redemption, the record in the Gospel of John is mainly for the release of life
The blood was for the purchase of the church, whereas the water, signifying the eternal life, was for the producing of the church
On the negative side, Christ's death removed our sins; on the positive side, it imparted the divine life into us
As we believe in Him today, our sins are removed by His redemptive death, and eternal life is imparted into us by His life-imparting death
Since His divine life was not only released out of Him but also imparted into us, His death was the life-imparting death
Suppose a sinner comes to the Lord and believes on Him as the Lamb of God who died on the cross for his sins shedding His blood for his sins
We have seen that the blood signifies the redemptive aspect of Christ's death and that the water signifies the life-imparting aspect
We are becoming clearer that this is the main aspect of the Lord's death and that the redemptive aspect is supplementary
After the Lord accomplished His redemptive and life-imparting death, His situation of suffering immediately changed into an honorable one
As the resurrection life, He could not be broken; but for the purpose of releasing Himself as life, He was broken
The record in the Gospel of John regarding the Lord's resurrection is different from that in the other three Gospels
John 20 and 21 are written from this point of view, showing how the Lord was released by His death and imparted into us by His resurrection
The main purpose of these two chapters is that, after and by His resurrection, the Lord will come into us and be one with us
The purpose of the Lord's incarnation as a man was that He might impart Himself into many people and reproduce many sons of God
He was the only begotten Son of God, but God needed the reproduction and the multiplication of His only begotten Son
The only way in which the only begotten Son of God could be reproduced and multiplied was by death and resurrection
As we have seen the entire Gospel of John points in this directiontoward the reproduction and multiplication of the only begotten Son of God
For this purpose, the only begotten Son of God had to be released through death and imparted into us through resurrection
Have you ever noticed the type in the Old Testament which indicated that the Lord would resurrect on the first day of the week?
In these verses in Leviticus 23 the term the first day of the week is not used instead another term is usedthe morrow after the sabbath
The firstfruits of the harvest were offered to the Lord 'on the morrow after the sabbath,' meaning the first day of the following week
Since the Lord resurrected from the dead as the firstfruit of the harvest, when was the firstfruit of the harvest offered to God?
They were born naturally and had to cut off their old nature and have a new nature which lives by the resurrection life
It is God's intention that His people put off the old nature and put on the new nature that they might live in the resurrection life
By His all-inclusive death, Christ terminated the old creation, which had been completed in six days plus one Sabbath day
The day of the Lord's resurrection was prophesied as being 'this day' in Psalm 2:7, which is quoted in Acts 13:33 and Hebrews 1:5
It should also be pointed out that the Lord was not only resurrected on the first day of the week, but also during the first part of the day
The resurrection of the Lord is the beginning of a new day because He resurrected early in the morning of the first day
He went into the tomb with something of the old creation, indicating that the old creation was brought into the tomb by His burial
All the things which were cast off from the Lords resurrected body and left in His tomb signify the old creation which He wore into the tomb
In this universe there is such a wonderful, all-inclusive tomb where our old man has been buried and still remains
Who took the linen cloths and the handkerchief from off the Lord Jesus, and who folded the handkerchief and left it in a good order?
Lazarus needed help to be released from his burial cloths because he was the resurrected one, not the resurrecting One
If the angels had removed the wrappings, it would have meant that the Lord was unable to rise up from the dead Himself
He did not run excitedly away from the tomb like a kidnap victim who hurriedly flees after he has been released
Being very much at ease, the Lord removed the wrappings, folded the handkerchief, and put them in a good order
Eventually, what they provided the Lord out of their love for Him became a solid and substantial testimony of His resurrection
There were two sides of the testimony of the Lord's resurrection, one from man on earth and the other from the angels in heaven
Praise the Lord that both man and angels, earth and heaven, are a testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus
Although the Lord's resurrection had been accomplished, the discovery of it required the seeking of His disciples
The spiritual discovery, the spiritual revelation, the spiritual vision, depends very much upon seeking the Lord
John, who might have been younger than Peter, outran Peter and arrived at the tomb first, but, for some reason, he did not go in
The brothers are really the brothers because they are clearer in the mind and find it easier to believe the fact than the sisters do
The two brothers saw the empty tomb, the linen cloths, and the napkin, and were very clear that the Lord must have been resurrected
Although they saw the fact, realized it, and believed in it objectively, they did not have the experience subjectively
In the same principle, you may have the fact of the Lord's resurrection but fail to experience the resurrected Lord
As an illustration, Abraham represents the doctrine of faith or the truth of faith, but Sarah represents the experience of obedience
Peter and John believed in the fact of the Lord's resurrection objectively, but Mary experienced it subjectively
While a few definitely have the revelation of the Lord's resurrection, they only have the revelation, not the experience
In many instances, we brothers just hold the facts with faith, but we do not have the experiences like the sisters do
He also told her that He was going to the Father and that the Father was not only His Father and His God but also their Father and their God
At first, she did not recognize the Lord, but eventually, after the Lord had called her by name, she did recognize Him
Do you realize that at this very moment the Lord is here, but we do not realize it and it has not been revealed?
The resurrection of Christ was not only discovered by the seeking ones but also testified to by the angels sent from God
As the linen cloths and the napkin were the testimony from man's side, the angels were the testimony from God's side
On the day of resurrection, early in the morning, He ascended to satisfy the Father, and late in the evening He returned to the disciples
The freshness of His resurrection must first be for the Fathers enjoyment as the firstfruit of the harvest was in type brought first to God
We come to one of the greatest points in the Gospel of John, a point which not many Christians have seen clearly
Through His resurrection His disciples have been regenerated with the divine life released by His lifeimparting death as indicated in 1224
By the resurrection of Christ, the disciples became the brothers of the Lord because they now had the same life as the Lord
The Lord regenerated them by His resurrection, and thus they were no longer merely disciples and friends but also His brothers
The 'many brothers' are those who have been regenerated through His resurrection with the divine life released by His life-imparting death
Christ's many brothers as the 'many sons' of the Father are the 'church' to be a corporate expression of God the Father in the Son
The many brothers are the propagation of the Father's life and the multiplication of the Son in the divine life
The One 'for whom are all things and through whom are all things' is the Father, and the Author of salvation is the Son
Now, because both He and we are of the same source and have the same life with the same nature, He is not ashamed to call us brothers
The first section, comprising chapters one through thirteen, unveils the eternal Word incarnated coming to bring God into man
Mary, however, could only see Him; she could not touch Him because the freshness of His resurrection was reserved for the Father
In His appearing to Mary, the Lord unfolded the revelation of the issue of His resurrection-the 'brothers' and the 'Father'
After He appeared in resurrection to His seeker, He secretly ascended to the Father on the day of resurrection
According to the Old Testament the harvest was taken to the barn but the firstfruits were always brought into the temple as a wave offering
The firstfruits of resurrection were not only the Lord Himself, but also the others who had been raised from the dead
Christ ascended to the heavens with a resurrected body, and now, in John 20, He comes back to the disciples also with a resurrected body
Our limited mentality cannot comprehend it, but it is a fact, and we must receive it according to the divine revelation
Now the disciples saw the newborn 'child' , who was the resurrected Lord born in His resurrection as the Son of God
Never forget that the eternal Word took two steps: the step to become flesh and the step to become the life-giving Spirit
In chapter twenty, this wonderful One took another step, the step of resurrection, to become the life-giving Spirit
Chapters twenty and twenty-one prove that He is the resurrection in the midst of the old creation, the natural life
The old creation, the natural life, is the contrast to Him as the resurrection, of which the Spirit is the reality
The Holy Spirit in verse 22 is the Spirit expected in 7:39 and promised in 14:16-17, 26; 15:26; and 16:7-8, 13
The Lord's breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter
All that the Lord had spoken to them in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen is fulfilled at this very moment
Now, after a little while, the disciples saw the Lord again, fulfilling what He had spoken in chapters fourteen through sixteen
The Lord reminded the disciples of the Father's promise after His resurrection, close to the time of His public ascension
Everybody agrees that this promise of the Father of being 'clothed with power from on high' was fulfilled in Acts 2
The promise in John 14, 15, and 16, however, is not the Father's promise of power but the Son's promise of the Comforter
Before He reminded the disciples of the Father's promise, the promise of the Comforter made in John had already been fulfilled
After His resurrection, close to the time of His public ascension, the Lord reminded the disciples to wait for the Father's promise of power
The fulfillment on the day of resurrection was the promise of the Holy Spirit as the life and the truth, the reality
If we read the Bible carefully, we shall see that the Spirit is firstly the Spirit of life and secondly the Spirit of power
As 'the last Adam' in the flesh, through the process of death and resurrection, He 'became a life-giving Spirit'
It is as the Spirit that He was received into His believers and flowed out of them as 'rivers of living water'
The Son is the embodiment of the Father with His fullness , and the Spirit is the realization, the reality, of the Son with His fullness
After His resurrection it became the Spirit of the glorified man Jesus, having both the divine element and the human element
One day, He was incarnated as a man and lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, passing through the experiences of human life
After passing through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, what a God He has become!
Now He is God not only with divinity but also with humanity, human living, the all-inclusive crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
Praise Him that after His resurrection, He became the life in resurrection which is the Spirit of the glorified Jesus
In the first step of incarnation, He took the form of the flesh with the blood for accomplishing redemption for us
In the second step of resurrection, He was transfigured into the form of the Spirit for imparting Himself into us as our life
In John's line, the Spirit is likened to the breath of life breathed into the disciples and abiding in them as their life
We see that the Lord gave His disciples the authority to represent Him in forgiving people, granting them the authority to bind and loose
When we are in the Holy Spirit and filled with the Holy Spirit, we have the authority to decide whether or not a person is forgiven by God
To declare the Father's name is to make the Father known to the disciples as the source of life that they might partake of His divine nature
To praise the Father in the church is to praise the Father in the praising of His believers in the church meetings
In the mornings we should have the morning watch personally and individually, but in the evenings we must come to the church meetings
Do not be proud of your wonderful experiences during morning watch, and do not say that morning watch by itself is good enough
The morning watch cannot replace the evening meeting, and the evening meeting cannot be a substitute for the morning watch
After the resurrection, the Lord is the Spirit and is with us as the Spirit at any time, at any place, and under every circumstance
The Lord is always with us; the only difference is that sometimes we sense His presence and sometimes we do not
Since He has accomplished everything, He has made Himself one with the disciples, and they are now one with Him
The gathering of the disciples here may be considered as the second meeting of the church held with the Lord's presence before Pentecost
As we shall see, the Lord came this time purposely for Thomas, coming directly to him to meet him and to deal with him
He ascended secretly to the Father, presenting the freshness of His resurrection to the Father for the Father's satisfaction
Now the Lord appeared to deal with this unbelieving disciple by pointing to the prints of His death remaining in His resurrected body
The Lord not only appeared to deal with the unbelief of Thomas but also to train the disciples to believe without seeing
Because the Lord's presence in resurrection today is not a visible presence but rather an invisible presence, we must believe without seeing
We must practice believing without seeing because the Lord's presence now is not like it was when He was in the flesh
According to Acts 1:3-4, the Lord stayed with the disciples for forty days to train them to realize and to practice His invisible presence
These verses indicate that the purpose of John's Gospel is to testify that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of God
It is the life and nature of God which we have received and which make us the sons of God for the expression of God
In other words, Christ is the Son of God who has the life and nature of God and who is the very manifestation of God
By His death and resurrection, the Lord released Himself and imparted Himself into us so as to make us exactly the same as He is
He is the very expression and manifestation of God, and He has made us to be the expression and manifestation of God
Now we are the expression and the manifestation of God because the Son of God has been imparted into us and is now within us
God's eternal purpose is simply to work Himself into us, mingling Himself with us so that we may become His expression and manifestation
By His resurrection He multiplied Himself, and after His resurrection He revealed to Mary that the disciples were now His brothers
Throughout the whole universe and among the entire human race, there was only one Person who was the very image and manifestation of God
They have been committed with the divine, heavenly mission to do something on this earth whereby they can express and manifest God
By the end of chapter twenty, the Lord has come back as the Spirit to be with the disciples and to be everything to them
We have been committed with the heavenly commission, but we still must provide food for our eating and our living
We cannot always just sit here, praising the Lord and shouting, 'Hallelujah, everything is wonderful, heavenly, divine, and eternal!
We have the life and the nature of God, we have the glory of God, and we are the representatives and manifestation of God'!
We need to understand the reason for having chapter twenty-one after chapter twenty, for having an additional chapter after the conclusion
In 21:1-11, the Lord moved with the disciples to the sea, manifesting Himself again to them at the sea of Tiberias
He will not go with you to the theater to give you peace, but to trouble you, to stir you up, and to tell you to leave that place
For the sake of their weakness, He sometimes manifested His presence in order to strengthen their faith in Him
The Lord manifested Himself to the disciples in chapter twenty-one to train them, especially Peter, to live by faith in Him
The Lord had told them to wait in Jerusalem for the day when they would all be clothed with heavenly power from on high
In verse 3 we are told that the disciples 'went forth and got into the boat, and that night they caught nothing'
The miracle of catching no fish was a lesson to Peter and the other disciples, and it is a lesson for us today
If it is not according to the Lords will and we go out on our own all the fish might be frightened away sovereignly being kept away from us
Since we have been regenerated and the Lord has committed to us a divine, heavenly mission, we must walk according to His will
Verses 4 and 5 say, 'Now as the morning was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus
By this miracle their eyes were opened, and the 'disciple whom Jesus loved said then to Peter, It is the Lord'!
When the disciples got out onto the land, 'they saw a fire of coals laid there, and fish lying on it and bread'
The Lord performed this miracle to teach the disciples that under His will they will find fish at any place, even on the land
Without these fish, even on the land where the fish were not, the Lord had prepared fish and even bread for them
On the one hand, he had some fish in his hand cooked by the Lord; on the other hand, he looked at the multitude of fish in the net
We must seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and then the Lord will add the practical supply to us
The Lord appeared to them and told them to cast the net on the right side of the boat, and they caught a multitude of fish
Those fish were unnecessary, however, because the Lord had already prepared some fish, as well as some bread, for them to eat
The third miracle was that without the fish caught from the sea, some fish and some bread had already been prepared on the land
The lesson the disciples learned here was that they must take care of the Lord's commission and trust in the Lord for their living
If we are in the Lord's will and under His will, He will prepare a living for us even in the impossible places
If we take the natural way and go to the sea, that is, to the world, to find employment for our living, we shall be faced with failure
There are three aspects of the Lord as the Shepherd: the good Shepherd , the great Shepherd , and the chief Shepherd
When the Lord spoke to Peter in 211517 He did not call him Peter which was his regenerated name the new name of his regenerated person
Because Peter was still a natural person, the Lord asked him, 'Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these'?
Peter's strength was dealt with in two ways: in his denying the Lord and in his taking the lead to backslide from the Lord's call
When Abraham was in Canaan, he also was tested by the same problem and went down to Egypt because of the famine
In the same principle, Peter and the other disciples went to the sea to fish, being tested by the lack of food
When Peter betrayed the Lord, denying Him to His face three times, it meant that the Lord had taken His hand off him for a while
Because Peter was so strong, having too much confidence in himself, the Lord was forced to temporarily remove His hand
Perhaps Peter thought that he had reason to do this because, at that point, he had not seen the supply of the Lord
It is quite meaningful that, in front of all the other disciples, the Lord asked Peter, 'Do you love Me more than these'?
The Lord's action was very meaningful, for now, having a fire to remind Peter, He seemed to be saying, 'Peter, do you remember that fire?
He is a soft, meek, and broken person, a man who has truly learned the lesson of being tested and broken by the Lord
After restoring Peter's love toward Him, the Lord Jesus charged him, saying, 'Feed My lambs,' 'Shepherd My sheep,' and 'Feed My sheep'
The first twenty chapters of the Gospel of John stress the matter of believing in the Son that we may have life
Lamb-feeding is by the nourishing with the riches of the inner life, and sheep-shepherding is for the building of the church
According to John 10, the Lord laid down His soulish life that His sheep might have His divine life and be brought together as one flock
Finally, in 1 Peter 5, Peter, as one of the elders, charges the elders to care for the sheep by feeding and shepherding them
In 21:15 the Lord said, 'Feed My lambs'; in 21:16, He said, 'Shepherd My sheep'; and in 21:17, He said, 'Feed My sheep'
While we are serving the Lord today, we must not only care for His sheep, but also feed them with spiritual food
If the Lord has committed to us the burden of His flock, we must be sure to do two things-to feed them and to care for them
After the Lord told Peter to follow Him, Peter turned to John and said to Jesus, 'Lord, and what about this man'?
The Lord was telling Peter that what would happen to John was none of his business and that he had to follow Him
By following the Lord in this way, we shall accomplish the Lord's purpose to feed His lambs and to feed and shepherd His sheep
In verse 23 the Lord indicated that some of His believers would follow Him to death and that some would remain, would live until He comes
We must also realize that we must suffer and sacrifice for the Lord's testimony, following Him even unto death
He will continue with us invisibly, meeting, moving, living, working, and walking with us, until He comes visibly
Although we have completed our life-study of the Gospel of John, we still need to see something more as a conclusion to all these chapters
We have seen that John's Gospel is divided into two parts: chapters one through thirteen and chapters fourteen through twenty-one
In other words the first part reveals that the Lord is the manifestation of God who came to man brought God to man and mingled God with man
By His death and resurrection, the Lord not only went back to God from man; He also went to God with man and brought man into God
These chapters are a history of a man, a real man of flesh and blood, a man named Jesus who lived on earth and manifested God
When the Lord Jesus lived on earth as a man, He did not live by the life of man; He lived by another life, the life of God
In these seventeen chapters we do not see a human life lived out through this man; rather, we see a divine life lived out through Him
If we would divide this Gospel into three parts, the second part would consist of chapters eighteen and nineteen
In these two chapters we see a picture of how the Lord was arrested, brought to trial, sentenced to death, and crucified on the cross
Knowing that His captors would come to the garden to seize Him, He went there deliberately for the purpose of being arrested
When the Lord Jesus asked those who came to arrest Him whom they were seeking and they answered, 'Jesus the Nazarene,' He said, 'I am'
Through man, God is manifested; through death, life is manifested; through the Holy Spirit, resurrection is manifested
Even if God is only life, it is still rather difficult for us to have a real relationship of fellowship with Him
After His resurrection, the Lord came into His disciples and breathed into them, saying, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
According to the last book of John, the book of Revelation, the issue is the churches, the temple, and the city
The book of Revelation mentions the churches , the temple , and the city , which are different aspects of God's building
If we would realize the presence of the Lord, we must see that He is not only in heaven but also in the midst of the seven churches
In Revelation 3:12 we are told that if we realize the Lord's presence, we shall be overcomers and pillars in the temple of God
Three names are written on the pillar mentioned in Revelation 312 the name of God the name of the New Jerusalem and the new name of the Lord
The new name of the Lord is written on this pillar because it has become the new manifestation of the Lord Himself
In the morning, we should seek the Lord personally in the morning watch, but in the evening, we must attend the church meetings
In addition to seeking the Lord, believing in Him, and attending the church meetings, we must also trust the Lord for our living
Remember the Lord's promise: 'Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you'
The Lord seemed to tell him, 'Peter, you must follow Me, work for Me, feed and shepherd My sheep, and build up the church'
Why must we learn the lesson of forsaking our natural strength, our natural cleverness, and our natural wisdom?
The Lord needs our heart to love Him so that we may cooperate with Him and give Him the opportunity to be our life
We shall experience that the Lord is not only God in man but also life in death and resurrection in the Spirit
The fact that Christ is the vine and we are the branches of this vine clearly indicates that we are part of Christ
We have been told that God was our Creator, the object of our worship, and that we, the creatures, had to worship Him
The inner content of the divine focus is that God is not only our Creator and the object of our worship, but that He is life
Ultimately, God is not the object of our worship; He is life and He desires to grow in an organic body so that He may be expressed
Now He is not only the Creator and Redeemer-He is the very pneuma, the life-giving Spirit, for us to contact Him
God does not care for our concepts; He wants to be the life growing within us that He may be expressed through us
We have seen that according to John 15 the preaching of the gospel is the overflow of life for the bearing of fruit
When the Lord was crucified, He was not only the Lamb to accomplish redemption; He was also in the form of the serpent
In His death He was not only in the form of the Lamb and the serpent, but also in the form of a grain of wheat
The Lord's breathing into His disciples indicates that this mysterious One, the all-inclusive One, had come into them
In this Gospel we have both the gate through which we can enter the organism and the way to experience this organism
Worshipping God by our spirit and in our spirit is the real drinking of the living water, which is God Himself
In verse 48 the Lord said, 'I am the bread of life,' and in verse 57 He said, 'He who eats Me shall also live because of Me'
The way is not only to drink God as the living water, but also to eat Christ, the embodiment of God, as the living bread
On the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles Jesus stood and cried out, saying, 'If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink
As we are with our relatives, neighbors, colleagues, and friends, we must have this kind of living and be this kind of person
Recently a sister shared about meeting a woman in an airport and spontaneously testifying to her of her rich supply in Christ
