   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR THE SUBJECTIVE ASPECT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF BEING IN CHRIST Date: October 19, 1936, evening</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Kulangsu</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scripture Reading: Rom 6:3-11 OUT OF ADAM AND INTO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's salvation is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, He did not do anything in us to accomplish His salvation; everything was done in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ has accomplished everything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The only way for man to be saved is to be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not need to ask God to do anything in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As long as we are in Christ, everything that Christ has accomplished will be realized in us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is God's way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let me ask a question: How did we enter into Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is God who has put us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Strictly speaking, we must come out of Adam before we can get into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, I must get out of this room before I can go into the next room.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must have an exit before we can have an entry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, we get out of Adam, and then we get into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>GETTING INTO ADAM THROUGH BIRTH</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>AND GETTING OUT OF ADAM THROUGH DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order to know how to get out of Adam, we must first know how we got into Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John 3:6 says, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Who are the ones who are in the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They are those who are born of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As soon as we were born, we were in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The life which we inherited from our parents is an Adamic life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After so many generations, the human life is still the Adamic life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since we entered Adam through birth, how do we get out of Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suppose I entered this room facing the east.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order to go out, I only need to turn around and walk toward the west.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since we entered Adam through birth, we have no other exit except through death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once we die, we terminate our standing in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thank God that He has delivered us out of Adam by bringing us through death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>DEATH BEING THE ONLY WAY TO GET OUT OF ADAM</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Adam we can do nothing but sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Death is the grand deliverance by which we are delivered from the bondage of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A man may be bound by many things, but everything is over as soon as he dies.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The same principle applies in the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Romans 6:7 says, "For he who has died is justified from sin."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After a man has died, he can no longer sin; consequently, he is free from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A dead man is one whose thoughts, will, temper, and evil deeds are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There was a man in Australia who was sentenced to death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He committed such serious crimes that the judge handed down one hundred and eighty verdicts of death against him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, he only needed to die once.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then he could sin no more.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A man can be a drug addict, robber, murderer, or hardened criminal, but everything is over as soon as he dies.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He will no longer sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The biblical principle is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once a Christian dies, everything is over with him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The way we enter Adam is through birth, and the way we exit Adam is through death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once we die, we are delivered from Adam's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have the way now.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But how can we take this way?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are born into Adam and have become a part of him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today if we want to get out of Adam, we have to die.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once we die, we will be delivered from Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But how can we die?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How can we be freed from Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The way to salvation is death, the way to victory is death, and the way to be freed from Adam is also death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The question today is, how can we die?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How can we back up this "car" to its original place?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Can we die by ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>No. There is no way for us to die by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The way of death has been prepared by God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we believe in Him, we die in Christ and are freed from Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>How wonderful it is to be in Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we are in Christ, we die.</S>
