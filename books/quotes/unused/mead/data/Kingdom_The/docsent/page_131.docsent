   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Forgiving Others</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Matthew 18 we see a third aspect of the proper church life the little children living at home are quick and ready to forgive others.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Peter considered that forgiving his brother seven times was sufficient, but the word of the Lord Jesus was "seventy times seven."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That indicates forgiving endlessly, continually ready to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If someone offends you in the morning, you need to forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If he offends you again at noon, you need to forgive him then.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If he offends you tomorrow, the next day, and the day following, you will need to forgive him every time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus did not speak in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What does it mean to forgive?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To forgive is to forget.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you cannot forget, it means that you have never forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once a brother came to me saying, "Brother, let me tell you what a certain person did to me..He really offended me, but I forgave him."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Immediately I told this brother, "Your forgiveness is quite different from the forgiveness in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible says that to forgive is to forget.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You say that you have forgiven your brother, but you remember everything well enough to repeat it to me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that you have not forgiven your brother because you have not forgotten the offense."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When God forgives us, He forgets.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although God is omniscient and omnipotent, He is able to forget.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He simply cannot recall our failures and transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once He forgives them, He forgets them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the local churches the problems always concern this matter of forgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, when we first come together to practice the church life, everyone and everything is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After a while, although everyone is nice, some friction gradually arises.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Unintentionally, you offend me and I offend you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sometimes you look at my countenance and feel that I am not happy with you, and sometimes I listen to your voice and think that you are not pleased with me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These things happen again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, we need the forgiving grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to forgive all and to forget all.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever we forgive and forget, we have new life in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By forgetting all of the frictions, failures, and offenses, we become new.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church becomes a new church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Otherwise, our church will become an old wrinkled church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When a person becomes old he develops wrinkles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you visit a church that has been in existence for ten years, you can see wrinkles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What are the wrinkles?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They are the unwillingness to forgive and forget.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Apparently, you are willing to forgive; actually, you are unwilling to forget.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This unwillingness to forget the failures of others produces many wrinkles.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, the church becomes an old church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we will forgive by forgetting, every wrinkle will be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every day the church will be a new church with no oldness, failures, transgressions, or offenses because all of these things have been mutually forgotten.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This must be applied to your family life and especially to your marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You need to forgive your wife day by day and hour by hour.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that you forget all that your dear wife has done to you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you forget all the offenses, your wife will always be lovable and you will have a good family life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, if you remember even a few things that she has done to you, immediately she will cease to be lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You need to forgive and forget.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Matthew 18 reveals the practical way to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this chapter we need to be converted and to become humble little children.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to depend on others, and we need to forgive and forget.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we practice these things, we will have a very living church.</S>
