Christ lives in us that we may have one life and one living with Him. Thus we can walk in Him and enjoy His riches, just as the children of Israel lived and walked in the good land and enjoyed all its rich produce. Christ eventually is realized as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit; hence, to walk in Him is to walk in the all-inclusive Spirit. Christ&#8217;s living in us also enables us to be saved in His life. He desires to save us in His life to the extent that we are sanctified, transformed, and conformed to the image of Him as God&#8217;s Son, and are completely delivered from our old man, our self, and our natural life. He also enables us to live by Him by our eating Him as the bread of life. Christ is not only life but also the bread of life to us. As we receive Him continuously into us so that He is assimilated by our regenerated new man in the way of life, He brings us the eternal life that we may live because of Him. He also causes us to live with Him and to live Him. This is not only to live a sanctified, spiritual, and victorious life, but to live a person, to live a life that is Christ Himself. He also causes us to have Him formed in us, that is, to have Him fully grown in us to be the constituents of our entire being so that every part of our being will bear His form, His image. He also enables us to magnify Him, that is, to display to the entire universe that the Christ who lives in us and whom we live is unlimited.<h2 class=head3>QUESTIONS</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly state the significance of Christ&#8217;s living in us.</li><li>Briefly explain how that to walk in Christ is to walk in the Spirit.</li><li>Briefly explain how Christ in us enables us to be saved in His life.</li><li>What is the significance of living Christ?
