<p class="bold">WEEK 7 — DAY 1</p><h2 class="uhead1">Scripture Reading</h2><p class="black">Lev. 25:55 &nbsp;For the children of Israel are My servants; they are My servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; I am Jehovah your God.</p><p class="black">Rom. 12:1, 2, 11 &nbsp;I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice…which is your reasonable service. …Be transformed by the renewing of the mind. …Be burning in spirit, serving the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">Serving the Lord</h2><h2 class="head1">Who Are the Servants of God?</h2><p>Who are the servants of God?…The Bible tells us that all of God’s redeemed ones are servants of God. Every child of God is a servant of God. In Leviticus 25:55 God says, “For the children of Israel are My servants; they are My servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt; I am Jehovah your God.” This tells us clearly that as long as a person was an Israelite and was brought out of Egypt, he was a servant of God. Not only were Moses and Joshua the servants of God, but all the Israelites who were led out of Egypt were the servants of God as well. As long as we are saved and as long as we are children of God, we are servants of God. We need two kinds of understanding about the blood of the Lord, and we need two kinds of knowledge about the Lord Himself. The blood of the Lord Jesus washes away our sins. At the same time, His blood also purchases us. The Lord Jesus is our Savior. At the same time, He is also our Lord. We have to see that Jesus is our Lord and we are His servants; we are purchased by His blood.<sup>184</sup></p><h2 class="head1">The Motive of Serving the Lord</h2><p>When a believer receives the life of God, he has the disposition to serve God; his nature wants to serve God.<sup>185</sup> The more [he] receives grace and is led by the Lord, the more he is delighted to serve the Lord. A saved person wishes to serve the Lord, not out of others’ encouragement or compelling, but out of an inward motive. This motive is his love for the Lord. His love for the Lord constrains him and impels him to serve the Lord. [Exodus 21:5] describes a slave in the Old Testament who, due to his love for his master, would not go out free at the end of his days of slavery; he would rather be a slave to serve his beloved master. This typifies the New Testament believer who should love the Lord and serve Him in the same manner.<sup>186</sup></p><p>Exodus 21:6 speaks of the slave being brought to the door or to the doorpost. In ancient times slaves were to stand by the doorpost waiting for the master’s orders. Instead of doing anything on their own, they were to act only according to the word of the master. Today our position as slaves of Christ should also be at the doorpost. Furthermore, in 21:6 we are told that the master bored his slave’s ear through with an awl. This indicates that the slave’s ear was opened to listen to the master.</p><p>As those who believe in Christ, we all must be His slaves. We should say, “O Lord, I love You. Even if I have the freedom to go out, I do not want to leave. I love You, I love Your church, and I love Your children.” On the one hand, we may testify of how enjoyable and glorious the church life is. On the other hand, in the church life we all must become slaves.<sup>187</sup></p><p>[Moreover, in Romans 12:1], the apostle Paul exhorts us to present our bodies as a living sacrifice to serve God. His exhorting us is through the compassions of God, proving that God’s compassions, which are out of God’s love, should be our motive in serving God, stirring us up to love God and to serve Him.</p><h2 class="head1">Serving the Lord with Our Whole Being </h2><p>Our entire being is of three parts: spirit, soul, and body [1 Thes. 5:23]. To serve the Lord with our whole being means that the spirit, soul, and body all participate in the service of the Lord. First, we must present our bodies to the Lord [Rom. 12:1]; second, the mind, the main part of our soul, must be renewed and transformed [v. 2]; third, our spirit must be burning [v. 11].<sup>188</sup></p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
