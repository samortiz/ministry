   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Letter from Sister Chien Sin-sien</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>on Her Journey</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To my beloved Sister X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I greet you from my wandering journey.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have not yet been discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I left Hankow last year on December 27 and arrived in Ch'ang-sha on January 6.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I waited on the boat for several days while we were waiting for orders.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We finally left for Siang-Tan on the morning of the tenth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We had to stay on the boat for several days because the director of the Hunan-Kweilin Railroad had gone to Hankow, so there was no one there to give orders.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yesterday, I was finally able to move to a hospital temporarily one established by the China Inland Mission .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Perhaps I will be assigned to work in the region of Kweilin, but nothing has been decided.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The future is in God's sovereign hand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I was on a private boat on this journey, so there were many hidden dangers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thank and praise our God, He preserved us and brought us safely through.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>My father and mother are in Soochow, and I still do not have any news of them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I do not know whether or not they are alive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I think about it, my heart grieves!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But then I think that perhaps it is the Lord's will that I experience Matthew 8:22.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I only want God to gain something.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am willing to care for nothing and pass through what He wants me to go through.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, I am weak; I can only pray that God Himself keeps me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>May God completely gain me so that I may glorify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We will probably be here for two weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We will notify you of our future itinerary.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Peace in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Please greet Miss Chang for me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sisters Chang, Tsou, Lin, and Lee all send their greetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From a weak little one in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Chien Sin-sien</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>January 15</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This letter was sent from Hunan-Kweichow Railway Clinic of the Hwei Jing Hospital, Hsiang T'an.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>An Isolated Brother</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brother X:</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I will begin by saying that I used to be a student of the arts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I did not believe in the Lord Jesus until 1931.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After believing into the Lord, I dropped everything and became a full-time preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The X Church sent me to the X Seminary.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then I transferred to the X Seminary of the X denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because of difficulties with a teacher, I was X from school and returned to my old home with the comforting of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I preached the gospel on the one hand and took up some jobs to maintain my living on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>During that time, I gained the light of the truth and knew that what I believed was not complete and that my direction was in error.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, I left the X denomination in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am a loner by nature, but sometimes I thought that I did not have one real brother or sister by my side, and I felt sad.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At the same time, I was too weak.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It did not matter how hard I worked, there was never any fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even my wife went the opposite direction from me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In these circumstances, I cried many times.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It was probably Brother Liu Ai-wu in Ch'ang-sha who sent several copies of The Open Door to Brother Feng Hsien-luh in Ch'ang-Teh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brother Feng passed on a copy to me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I wiped away the tears that were blurring my eyes after I read it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>My heart was jumping for joy!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Praise God!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I know His good pleasure!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He wanted to have a way He has had it for some time now to allow many of His lonely children to fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am writing you joyfully to tell you and all the brothers and sisters that I am still here.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I am pitiful, and I hope that you can come help me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>My questions are: 1 If I am the only one here, how do I meet?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>2 If I cannot eat the bread and drink the cup, what should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>3 I want to work, but how should I start?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>4 How can I get in contact with brothers and sisters in other localities?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I will only ask these four questions now.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I will ask you the rest at another time.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Peace.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Your brother,</S>
