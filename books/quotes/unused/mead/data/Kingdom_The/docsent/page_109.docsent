   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE PRINCIPLES OF THE KINGDOM 3 Scripture Reading: Matt 12:1-8, 15-21, 28, 38-42; 16:1, 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Chapter twelve of Matthew reveals some further principles concerning the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Have you ever noticed the first few words of chapter twelve?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It begins with the words, "At that time."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The same phrase is used in 11:25, which begins by saying, "At that time Jesus answered..."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is the time referred to in Matthew 12:1?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The phrase, "At that time," means the time when the Lord Jesus revealed the way to enter the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the original manuscripts of the Bible, there were no chapters, verses, paragraphs, or punctuation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, chapters eleven and twelve were not divided.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"At that time" the Lord Jesus answered and prayed to the Father, and "at that time" He brought His disciples into the grain fields.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The words, "At that time," may be small words, but they indicate something very important.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At that time the Lord Jesus revealed to His disciples the way to find rest and to enjoy Him as rest in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In chapter nine we have the way to enjoy the Lord as our feast; in chapters eleven and twelve we have the way to enjoy Him as our rest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some may consider that the matter of enjoying the Lord should be found in John, the book of life, and not in Matthew, the book of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the kingdom is also a matter of enjoyment, and this enjoyment is just the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not think that the Lord Jesus as the kingdom is only a matter of authority and kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No the Lord Jesus as the kingdom is also a matter of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you have not experienced Him as your enjoyment, you cannot be in the kingdom to the fullest extent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We will have the full enjoyment of the Lord Jesus by realizing that we have Him as the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more we realize Him as our kingdom life, the more we will enjoy Him as the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we have little enjoyment of Christ, we will have little experience of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the same way, if we have no rest, neither will we have much experience of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose there were no government, rule, or law in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do you think it would be possible to rest in this country?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There would be no rest; instead, there would be constant turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Likewise, true rest comes out of experiencing the Lord Jesus as our kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we honor, realize, and partake of Him as our kingdom life, we enjoy Him as rest.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is not only our feast, but also our rest.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Both the feast and the rest are found in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although we may think that the feast and rest are only related to life, they are also found in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>ENJOYMENT IN THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many of us can testify that we have found such enjoyment in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have enjoyed so many feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Also, when we came into the church life, we realized that we had come home.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What is home?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is the place of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many Christians who were seeking the Lord very much were simply wandering aimlessly before they came into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, once they came into the church life, they had the feeling that they were home.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I can never forget that during the years of 1969 and 1970, the testimonies in nearly every meeting were about this matter of finding a home in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In those years one of the favorite songs had these words: "We are home!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are home!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are home!"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the local church we have the feast and we have the rest because the local church is the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord is here not only as life, but also as the kingdom life.</S>
