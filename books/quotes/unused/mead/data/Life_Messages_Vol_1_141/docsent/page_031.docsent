   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT ABIDING DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before we consider an Old Testament picture of the Spirit and its relationship to our abiding in Christ, we shall answer some questions based on the previous two messages.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I don't understand the difference between growing Christ and producing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We stressed that the Father wants us to live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Living Christ is the beginning and is somewhat general.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By living Him we grow Him; this is the second step.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Producing Christ comes out of growing Him and is the fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To produce Christ is to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While I was growing up, I lived near a vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the fall the vine would be heavily laden with grapes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When winter came, the branches would be severely cut back.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the springtime those sparse branches would begin living the vine and then growing the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Day by day I would see them growing and spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, fall would return and the branches would bear fruit, that is, produce the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There was much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This process illustrates the difference between growing Christ and producing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How can you tell when your heart is condemning you and when Satan condemns you?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to distinguish between God's condemnation and the enemy's accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God condemns, the enemy accuses.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we have something wrong or sinful, both the condemnation and the accusation will be present.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In such a case there is no need to distinguish between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Just confess and get the matter cleared up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"Lord, I am wrong in this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How I thank You that You have enlightened me regarding it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I regret it, and I repent and confess, asking You to forgive me."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then right away exercise your faith to take the Word, which says that if we confess, the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses 1 John 1:7, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Next, turn your confession to praise and thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"Thank You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Praise You for the cleansing of the blood."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If something still comes to bother you after such a confession and thanksgiving, that is Satan's accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To differentiate between it and God's condemnation is now easy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Say to the enemy, "Get behind me, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I refuse to listen to you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The blood has cleansed me."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I do not have the vision of the vine and the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Should I pray for this vision, or is it something that will be worked out in time?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we use the term vision, we do not mean the strange seeing of something that the Pentecostalists refer to as a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not expect that while you are studying or praying over John 15, you will see before you a vine with some branches, one of which even has your name on it!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If such a vision appears to you, reject it as demonic.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first time I went to a Pentecostal meeting was with Brother Nee, who had been invited to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I had been in Christianity for many years, but I had never before seen such shocking behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One fell over, another was laughing hysterically, another was in the corner claiming to see a vision, and some older women kept jumping in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It was wild.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They talked about seeing a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A few years later, I was serving the Lord in Tientsin, China's largest port, some two and a half hours from Peking, the capital.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Among us was an elderly sister, the wife of a medical doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>She became involved in the Pentecostal movement.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever she prayed, she would roll on the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In time, she saw a vision of an old man with a white beard.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Eventually, every time she prayed, she saw this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The old man would come, gaze at her, and then disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We warned her to be careful, but Pentecostalists are so subjective they trust implicitly in their experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>She would not heed us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At first she was happy about her vision, but after some time it began to trouble her.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then she became sick and was bedridden for a long period.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>During her illness, that old man often appeared to her.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>She became quite disturbed and again referred her case to us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We told her the old man was a demon, which she must reject.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It was hard for her to believe our word and to reject the demon, but we prayed for her.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord eventually gained the victory, and the demon left.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Such is a Pentecostal vision.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In our dictionary, however, "vision" does not mean this!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Rather, it is a seeing without any Pentecostal vision.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As you read John 15, for example, you are so deeply impressed within that you can no longer be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Before, you were engaged in making plans and carrying out activities.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now, whenever you turn to what you had been doing so easily before, you have the sense, "No, this is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is activity."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You try to keep on making your plans, but the sense comes, "This is not the branch living the vine, growing the vine, and producing the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is not life."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you are getting this kind of reaction within you, you may be assured that you have the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Formerly you may have enjoyed your work and even boasted about it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Now the sense of pleasure is gone, and a bothering has come, causing you to reduce, even stop, what you have been doing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Every spiritual seeing has this effect.</S>
