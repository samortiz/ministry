   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Father is the source of our salvation, so Paul said, "the love of God."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ the Son's coming is for the accomplishment of salvation and our full enjoyment of God, so he said, "the grace of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit whom Christ became is the transmission into us of all that the Father is and all that Christ has accomplished; thus Paul called this "the fellowship of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The whole Triune God is working in oneness to dispense His Being into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eventually, our spirit and soul and body will be saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Second Corinthians 13:14, then, is strong proof that God is triune for our experience, not just for teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul did not just say, "The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Yes, he mentioned the Trinity, but as grace, love, and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is very experiential and shows God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But how do we experience and enjoy His dispensing?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And what should be the result?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the church, everyone is encouraged to read God's Word, pray, and call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That is absolutely right; but you should always remember that God's dispensing is for producing His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our reading, praying, and calling should affect our lives at home and at school.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our enjoyment is not just for ourselves; it is for God to be lived out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What does it mean for God to be lived out and expressed through us?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Consider righteousness, for example.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is absolutely right and honest in everything He does.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What about us?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In ourselves we are not righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose you bought something at the store and by mistake the checker did not charge you enough money.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Most young people today would never say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In fact, they would be so happy to have saved some money.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But that is unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That is the expression of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You might say that it was the store's fault or that they charge too much anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those excuses just show how much you love your money and how unrighteous you are.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, to keep that money is the same as stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Suppose at that time you prayed: "Lord, I know I should say something, but I can't.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Lord Jesus, I am not righteous but You are I just turn to You."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After praying like that do you think you could keep the extra money?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No, you would pay the proper amount.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That is the Triune God lived out of you as righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In yourself you would just walk out of the store happily, but by turning to the Lord you allow Him to dispense Himself into you so you could pay the money.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You take in more of the righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The people in the world express unrighteousness, but because of experiencing God's dispensing you express God as righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God's goal is a group of people that are full of Him so they can express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church should have the highest expression in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should express everything that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God is love; He loves even His enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God is forgiving; He forgives the worst sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But we cannot even love our own brother or sister, nor can we forgive the smallest sin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>So day by day we need to experience and enjoy the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to pray, call on His name, and read the Word so that He could dispense more of Himself into us so that we could express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is so wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is so experiential.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is so enjoyable.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His goal is to make us His sons that we may be members of the Body of Christ to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He can reach His goal through this type of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hallelujah for the dispensing of our Triune God!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Praise the Lord for the goal of God's full salvation!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>QUESTIONS Use 2 Corinthians 13:14 to write a prophesy concerning the enjoyment of the Triune God.</S>
