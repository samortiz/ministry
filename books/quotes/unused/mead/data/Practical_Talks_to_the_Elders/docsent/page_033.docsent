   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is God s ordained way for Christians to have a meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is one church, one city.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The meeting that is set up must keep the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To set up a meeting which does not keep the oneness is to increase division and confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is confusion?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Anything that is done contrary to God s ordained way is confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The only thing that keeps us from confusion is the way ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I feel the churches in the recovery should accept a commission to sound the trumpet, declaring to those in darkness that division is not only unscriptural but altogether abominable.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A division is an abomination in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some may argue, saying, Why do you condemn us?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We love the Lord, we preach the gospel, we study the Bible, and we try to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can answer, Why do you do so many things to please God, yet you do not care about being one?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You may mention John 17:21, That they all may be one, and Ephesians 4:1-3, where the first item in a walk worthy of God is to keep the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to study John 17:21-23 and Ephesians 4:1-6, and we need to train the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Perhaps in the prayer meeting we can take fifteen minutes to teach the saints how to sound the trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the Lord s table we can take a half hour to train the saints to speak on the oneness of the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We ourselves need to learn to sound the trumpet, and we need to train all the saints to do so too.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not be so quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should be watchmen, alerting people, not letting them sleep so peacefully.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are many ways to do this, such as passing out tracts and making phone calls to those we know.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In addition, to support what we say, we need a life that is the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should live a life that is of the highest standard.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then, even though our words are rejected outwardly, inwardly those who reject will respect us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They will recognize that our words carry weight, that we have a living testimony, that we are the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church in a locality should be shining.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is this shining that will convince those who would otherwise reject.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Isaiah says, Ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not silence, and give him no rest 62:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are to bother the Lord, praying, calling on Him, asking Him to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Just as we give the Lord no peace, so we should give those in the divisions no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I surely would like it if, after one month s time, the entire Chinese community is discussing among themselves the matter of the oneness and the matter of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I felt sad when I was in Houston.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Chinese there seem to be living in a backward country.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is dark; the spirituality is low.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They seem to have no idea about spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church should be shining, trumpeting, speaking out, so that they have no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you ask about the Spanish-speaking and the English-speaking, I would say this should be true of them too.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brothers, we have the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have the light.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And we have the capital: the Spirit, the life, the church, and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why are we so silent?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should live Christ before others, and every day we should preach the truth to them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can tell them, You need Christ; you need to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After a time they may be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we just keep silent, the darkness will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we rise up and sound the trumpet of the truth, the light will spread and the darkness will be scattered.</S>
