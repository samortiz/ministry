   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE EIGHTEEN THE MIXED EXPRESSIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE PSALMIST'S SENTIMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN HIS ENJOYMENT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN GOD'S HOUSE 6 Scripture Reading: Psa 40 41</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we have come to Psalms 40 and 41, the final two psalms in Book One of the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In these psalms we can again see the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in his enjoyment of God in God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>XVI.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>IN HIS SUFFERING OF HIS ENEMIES</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>AND THE RECOMPENSE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>WHICH HE EXPECTED FOR THEM</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Psalms 40 and 41 show us the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in his suffering of his enemies and the recompense which he expected for them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No doubt, when David wrote these two psalms he was under the persecution and mistreatment of his enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because of his suffering, he wanted to see his enemies recompensed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the New Testament, however, the Lord Jesus told us that we should love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us Matt 5:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This shows that David's prayer to recompense his enemies is not according to the divine concept.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A. Waiting on Jehovah for His Deliverance</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>David waited on Jehovah for His deliverance Psa 40:1-5, 11, 13, 16-17; 41:1-2, 10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 41:10 David said, "But You, O Jehovah, be gracious to me and raise me up/That I may recompense them."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>David was praising God for God's deliverance and looking to God for His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not wrong, but it was wrong to ask Jehovah to raise him up that he might recompense his enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I hope that all of us can see this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do you believe God is happy to see His children ask Him to raise them up that they might recompense their enemies?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is why we say that what is written in many of the psalms is a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verses 11-12 David said, "By this I know that You delight in me,/That my enemy has not shouted in triumph over me./And as for me, You uphold me in my integrity,/And You set me before Your face forever."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>David indicated that he would know that Jehovah delighted in him if Jehovah raised him up so that he could recompense his enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He also asked God not to let his enemies shout over him triumphantly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the light of the New Testament revelation, we can see that this is absolutely according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>David also said that God upheld him in his integrity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He should have said that he was upheld in God's mercy, in God's compassions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, we do not have any integrity before God.</S>
