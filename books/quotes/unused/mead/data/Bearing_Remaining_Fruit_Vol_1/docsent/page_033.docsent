   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE USE OF LIFE LESSONS 1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to perfect the home meetings, we should first learn to teach people how to sing hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Life Lessons, which was compiled for the perfecting of the home meetings, a suitable hymn is included in each lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we go to the home meetings, the first thing we should do is to teach the attendants to sing those hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE RHYME AND RHYTHM OF HYMNS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some among us may be willing to bear the burden to compose some new hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For this, we should have some basic knowledge about hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, we need to know about the rhyme of hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To maintain a proper rhyme, the long lines have to rhyme with the long ones and the short lines with the short.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In some hymns, the first line can rhyme with the second, while in other hymns this is not possible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sometimes the first line has to rhyme with the third, and the second with the fourth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to pay much attention to this because the initial emphasis of a hymn lies in its rhyme.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Chinese poetry is very concerned with the four phonetic tones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, when a long poem is put to a tune, there should not be such a concern for tones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since a hymn is a poem for singing, we do not need to care for the tones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As long as the words with the four tones are rhymed, it will be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Another concern for the hymns is rhythm.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The tempo and rhythm should correspond with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Putting lyrics to a tune is based on these two considerations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The rhythm of Chinese poems is according to the Chinese writing style.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, a ten-syllable sentence pattern can be in the combination of five and five or of four and six.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The four-six pattern can be changed to six and four or five groups of two.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These are all patterns that fit a ten-syllable sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Four and six, six and four, and five groups of two are all even-numbered patterns.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, the pattern of five and five is odd, so it cannot be put together with one of the even-numbered patterns.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, in the Chinese supplemental hymnal, the first line of stanza 1 of hymn #835 reads, What mercy that my eyes have seen the true God!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This sentence consists of eleven syllables arranged in a four-seven pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What mercy that my eyes have seen is four groups of two syllables, and the sentence ends with another three syllables.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The following line of the hymn says, What grace that I can freely have salvation!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This perfectly matches the pattern of the first sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such a hymn is rhythmic and pleasant to our ears.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This demonstrates that a hymn must have a proper rhythm.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With these points in mind, we will not compose hymns with strange combinations of mismatched rhythm, such as putting a three-five pattern together with a four-four pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hymns, #1080 is one that has a good rhythm.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Stanza 1 reads, What profit all the labor here?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>/ There s nothing new for you and me!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>/ Remember not the former things, / They re all vanity!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These lines are in a three-five pattern in Chinese, and the tune and rhythm are well-matched.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The last stanza says, Remember God in days of youth!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>/ Fear Him, and such will be your gain!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>/ With Him you will be satisfied, / For He is not vain!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although the first three lines are composed of eight syllables, in Chinese they all are in the pattern of three and five, not four and four.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This provides a consistency in the rhythm.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>BEING STEADFAST IN DOOR-KNOCKING</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>AND HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you are the one out of every four saints who is willing to go door-knocking and visiting, you should consecrate the Lord s Day to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then during the week you should offer three evenings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since you have joined the army, you should set aside your time; otherwise, you should not join.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The three evenings during the week all have different purposes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The first evening is to be trained in how to knock on doors, lead a home meeting, and use and teach from Life Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then having learned this, you should set aside two evenings to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One and a half evenings should be devoted to leading home meetings, and the remaining half evening should be used for door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You should not do too much door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We may compare this to having children.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you give birth to too many children, you will not be able to raise them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, you should not stop begetting; you should continue to beget, but you should raise up the ones whom you have begotten.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After two or three years you can beget two more and raise them gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In this way, life will propagate continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Never practice this out of a momentary excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do not act only when you feel like doing it and then become cold when the excitement subsides.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is not the way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You must be steadfast until the Lord comes.</S>
