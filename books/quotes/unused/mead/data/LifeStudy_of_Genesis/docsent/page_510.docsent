   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE NINETY BEING TRANSFORMED 10</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After remaining in Bethel for quite a long time, Jacob journeyed on from there 35:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Apparently, this journey away from Bethel was not a positive move.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But Jacob's leaving Bethel does not mean that he left the house of God; it means that he was going on in his spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although he had come to Bethel, had stayed there, and had done certain things there, he still had to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have seen that Genesis is a book of seeds and pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to understand the significance of all these seeds and pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The picture of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is a portrait of our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The experience of these three men is a picture of the spiritual life of one person following the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>6 Deeper and More Personal Dealings a The Death of Rachel</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As Jacob was journeying on from Bethel, he experienced a very deep and personal dealing: his beloved wife, Rachel, died as she was giving birth to Jacob's last son, Benjamin 35:16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This experience was a matter related to both death and birth, a matter of both loss and gain.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jacob lost Rachel and gained Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you had to make the choice, would you prefer to keep the mother or to gain the son?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The popular Christian concept is to have both the mother and the son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in the divine economy, if you would gain the last son, you must let go of the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without loss there can be no gain, and without death there can be no birth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Birth comes out of death, for apart from death there is no resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If Rachel had not died, Benjamin could never have come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rachel represents Jacob's natural choice.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although Jacob had four wives, only Rachel was the natural and original choice according to the desire of Jacob's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was forced to accept Leah and also constrained to take the two maids, Bilhah and Zilpah.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But Leah and the two maids were not the choice of Jacob's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you read Genesis carefully, you will see that Jacob's heart was absolutely set on Rachel; he had no heart for the other three.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Recall what Jacob did when he feared an attack of Esau and his men.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He put the two handmaids and their children at the front, followed by Leah and her children in the middle, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear 33:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The fact that Jacob placed Rachel and Joseph at the rear to protect them in case of attack reveals that Jacob's heart was set on Rachel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everything in the Bible is purposeful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The death of Rachel is recorded here in chapter thirty-five with a definite purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As Jacob was taking his journey, he must have been joyful knowing that Rachel was pregnant again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Perhaps he expected his beloved wife to give him another boy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But as Rachel was giving birth to her second child, she died, and Jacob's natural choice, the desire of his heart, was taken away from him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before the experience at Bethel, God tolerated Jacob's natural choice, allowing him to have his heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But after the experience at Bethel, his natural choice was taken from him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many of us can testify that before we experienced the church life, we still had our natural concept, natural choice, and natural desire.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God even bestowed His blessing upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Consider, for example, the birth of Rachel's first child, Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When Joseph was born, Jacob was very happy and might have said, "This is God's blessing upon the desire of my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has blessed my choice."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, after his experience at Bethel, Jacob lost his natural choice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After you experience the church life, your natural choice must be left behind.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before you came into the church, you still had your natural choice, and God tolerated it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But after experiencing the church life to a certain extent, God will tolerate it no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I hope that this will not frighten the young people and cause them to draw back from the experience at Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When they hear about this, some may say, "If this will happen, I will never come to Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, I will stay on the other side of Bethel and go no further.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then I will not lose my natural choice."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yes, after you have had some experience at Bethel, you will lose your natural choice, but you will gain Benjamin, who is a type of Christ.</S>
