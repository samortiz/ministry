   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING BY THE LORD DAILY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I would like to encourage the young brothers and sisters to pay attention to the crucial matter of taking Christ as life after our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have not believed in a religion or accepted a philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have received the life-giving Spirit who is real and living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The One who bore our sins and was crucified on the cross two thousand years ago wants to be our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He has ascended to the throne in the heavens, and He is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This Jesus is our Savior and Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is also the Spirit who is real and living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He lives in our spirit in order to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the most important matter after we are saved is to daily live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Contacting the Lord, Breathing Him In,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>and Reading the Word of God</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first thing that we should do every morning when we wake up is to contact the Lord and call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should do this not only in the morning, but we should do this throughout the day, just as we breathe continually.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must take God as our life all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should also read the Bible, the word of God, which is the truth, daily.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The words in the Bible are different from philosophy and from the teachings of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Philosophy and the teachings of Confucius are beneficial to society, but they are merely doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In contrast, the Bible as God s word gives a thorough explanation of God who is also hidden in the word as the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we read the Bible every day, we contact God through His word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, we receive not only doctrine but the truth, the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Contacting God to Receive Reality</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ephesians 5:22-25 says that wives should be subject to their husbands and that husbands should love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is a pity that most Christians, including many pastors, misunderstand submission and love in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When my wife and I were married, the pastor who married us asked me, Will you love her?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then he asked my wife-to-be, Will you be subject to him?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this situation everyone must respond, I will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everyone must follow the ritual because it is a ceremony.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although we nod our head in agreement, it does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ephesians 5 is based on chapter 3, which says, That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God v. 19 . Chapter 5 repeats this in verse 18: Be filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be filled in spirit is to be filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we are filled unto the fullness of God, we can overflow with obedience, submission, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Husbands often resolve to control their temper, maintain a proper attitude, and love their wife as the weaker vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Wives also make resolutions to submit to their husband.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our resolutions often last for only three hours, and then they become ineffective.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every wife wants to be a submissive, dutiful wife and a loving mother who is gentle, obedient, and sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, the wife is often not soft; rather, she is hard, like a piece of marble.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In such a situation we need to call, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After calling on the Lord, we will be filled within, and we will have submission and love.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Being Earnest in Our Education</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>and Studying the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although the students in Taiwan are very busy with their school work, I encourage them to work hard, because once they are over twenty-five years old, it will be difficult for them to further their education.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They should do their best to spend all their time to study before they turn twenty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Around 1976 I discovered that most of the young brothers in the United States had an erroneous concept.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They thought that as long as they loved the Lord and were spiritual, it was sufficient to mow lawns and clean swimming pools for a living.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I was strong to correct that kind of erroneous concept.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I thank the Lord that after my speaking many young people had a change in attitude, and by 1980 many of them had obtained higher degrees as a result of that message.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A sister testified to me that she became a certified nurse because of that encouraging word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There are numerous testimonies of this kind.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, I encourage you to be earnest in your studies and get the best grades.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, you should not study diligently and neglect the Lord and the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You must cultivate the habit of daily praying for at least five minutes in the morning and reading the Word for ten minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is not difficult; everyone can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Young people should not love their bed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is more profitable to rise ten minutes earlier than it is to rise ten minutes later.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Sleeping an extra ten minutes does not necessarily make you stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Seven hours of sleep is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the matter of studying the truth, I would like to recommend the Recovery Version of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The young people, especially the newly saved ones, should study the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you want to refer to the English edition, I encourage you to purchase the Recovery Version in English for reference and comparison.</S>
