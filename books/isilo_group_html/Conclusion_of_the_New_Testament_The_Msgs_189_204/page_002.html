In the remaining messages we shall cover three corporate persons: the church, the kingdom, and the New Jerusalem. The church is a corporate person. The kingdom also is a corporate person. According to chapter two of Daniel, Christ, the heavenly stone, will eventually become a great mountain filling the entire earth. This is the kingdom as the increase of Christ. The New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will also be a corporate person. First we shall consider the church and then the kingdom and the New Jerusalem.<h2 class=head1>I. THE HIDDEN MYSTERY IN GOD&#8217;S ETERNAL ECONOMY</h2><p>The first matter we shall consider concerning the church is the hidden mystery in God&#8217;s eternal economy. In this universe there is a hidden mystery, a mystery hidden in God. This hidden mystery is in God&#8217;s eternal economy. Here we have two crucial words-mystery and economy-modified respectively by the adjectives &#8220;hidden&#8221; and &#8220;eternal.&#8221; Hence, in the New Testament we have the hidden mystery and the eternal economy.<p>In revealing the divine things, Paul, under the inspiration of the Spirit, uses the word &#8220;economy&#8221; in his writings. The English word economy is an anglicized form of the Greek word oikonomia. Some dictionaries define oikonomia as a dispensation, a special arrangement, a plan with a purpose. These definitions are correct. However, if we know only this much concerning oikonomia, we shall not know the deep and complete significance of this Greek word.<p>If we would understand the meaning of oikonomia, we need to realize that this Greek word is composed of two words-oikos, meaning house or household, and nomos, meaning law. Economy, therefore, is a &#8220;house law,&#8221; a household administration. God&#8217;s household is His house, His dwelling place. This means that God&#8217;s dwelling place is His family, His household. This household has an economy, a household law. Here &#8220;law&#8221; means regulations, and these regulations refer to a household administration. In order to have a household administration, an administration in your house or family, there surely is the need for a particular arrangement. Such an arrangement is a house law.<p>In using the word oikonomia, a word that denotes a household administration, Paul was implying that God, who made this oikonomia, has the intention to have a house, a household, a family. In eternity past God was alone. He was triune-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-yet He, the one God, was alone. However, God&#8217;s oikonomia, His household arrangement, implies that in eternity past He intended to have a household, for without a household, He cannot have an administration. Furthermore, without a household God would not be able to carry out a plan. In order for God to carry out His plan in His household administration, He needs a household, a family. This is the reason Ephesians 1:5 reveals that, before the foundation of the world. God the Father predestinated us unto sonship. This predestination was with the intention of having sons. Therefore, God&#8217;s original intention was to have sons. The book of Romans tells us that, in Christ&#8217;s redemption, God has made many sinners into sons of God. These sons are the many brothers of Christ, God&#8217;s unique, only-begotten Son. From this we can see that God intends to have many sons to form His household through which He can carry out His eternal oikonomia.<p>In this oikonomia, which is eternal and of God, a mystery was hidden. What is a mystery? We may say that a mystery is a mysterious story. A mystery, a mysterious story, was hidden in the eternal God and in His eternal oikonomia. As we shall see, this mystery, this mysterious story, is the church.<p>Today the word &#8220;church&#8221; is very common. But when Paul comes to the revelation of the church, he uses certain mysterious expressions. He calls the church a mystery, even a hidden mystery. This mystery is hidden in God&#8217;s household arrangement. In eternity past, God the Father had a household arrangement, and in that arrangement a mystery was hidden.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 189-204) &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
