(The millennium consists of two parts: one is the kingdom of the heavens and the other, the kingdom of Messiah. The kingdom of the heavens pertains to the Lord's relationship with the believers, which is spiritual; whereas the kingdom of Messiah pertains to the Lord's relationship with the Jews, which is physical.) Does Matthew 3:2 speak of the kingdom of the heavens as the kingdom of Messiah? It begins by saying "Repent." This is the first word spoken in relation to the kingdom of the heavens. Therefore, it shows that the kingdom of the heavens is not physical but spiritual and heavenly. The kingdom of Messiah will rule the nations with an iron rod, and it will not be concerned with the matter of repentance. Moreover, the kingdom of Messiah will come with power and great glory. However, 3:3 says, "Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight His paths." This means to prepare the hearts of men and turn them to Jehovah.</P><P>Verses 4-12: This section is a word spoken by John and, of course, is related to the drawing near of the kingdom of the heavens. From this portion we see the nature of the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>(1) It has nothing to do with the Jews: "Do not presume to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as our father" (v. 9). (2) It must be an organized entity whereby people can flee from the coming wrath (v. 7). (3) It requires holy and righteous conduct (v. 8). (4) Whoever does not have a relationship with the kingdom of the heavens will be cast into the fire (v. 10). (5) For people to be baptized is for them to believe in the One who is coming (v. 11). Hence, believing in the Lord is the initiation. (6) How is this Christ related to the kingdom of the heavens? (a) At the beginning of the kingdom of the heavens He baptizes people in the Holy Spirit, and (b) at the end of the kingdom of the heavens He will baptize people with fire (vv. 11-12).</P><P>There is a great difference between the kingdom of the heavens and the kingdom of Messiah, and the proof is as follows:</P><P>Matthew 13:11 says that the kingdom of the heavens is a mystery, which was not understood by men but is now revealed.</P><P>In 13:16-17 we see that the truth concerning the kingdom of the heavens is not in the Old Testament. Therefore, the prophets of old could not see or hear it. In 13:35 it says, "I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world." The things hidden from the foundation of the world are the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens. By this we can see that before this time no one knew about the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens. However, the kingdom of Messiah was known to men such as Balaam, Isaiah, and Daniel.</P><P>When does the kingdom of the heavens begin? From Matthew 13:24 and 30 we see that it begins with the sowing of wheat and ends with the harvest. Therefore, the kingdom of the heavens is this age. In Matthew 16:13-19, "this rock" in verse 18 refers to Peter's confession earlier in this portion. Verse 19 mentions "the keys of the kingdom of the heavens." Here, in the original language "keys" is plural, and they are for opening the doors. These keys were used to open the doors on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius to bring in the Jews and the Gentiles. By this we can see that the church and the kingdom of the heavens begin at the same time. The building of the church was at Pentecost. The kingdom of the heavens is related to men, whereas the church is related to the Lord. It is the Lord who gives life. The church receives position and grace. The church is our position, whereas the kingdom of the heavens is our responsibility.</P><div align="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="400"><tr><td width="50%"><p class="bold" style="text-align:center">The Kingdom<br>of the Heavens</p></td><td width="50%"><p class="bold" style="text-align:center">The Church</p></td></tr><tr><td>Related to men</td><td>Related to the Lord</td></tr><tr><td>Referring to discipline</td><td>Referring to life-giving</td></tr><tr><td>Concerning responsibility</td><td>Concerning position and grace</td></tr></table></div><P>According to its nature, the work of John the Baptist is definitely of grace. The message preached by John concerning the Lord is as follows: (1) John 1:29: "the Lamb of God" and (2) Matthew 3:11: "He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire." One is concerned with the Lord's bearing our sins, and the other is related to the Lord's baptizing in the Holy Spirit and judging the unbelievers in the future. In Luke 1:67-79, Zachariah's prophecies include the following: "to give knowledge of salvation to His people by the forgiveness of their sins" and "to guide our feet into the way of peace." This is the message that John would preach later on. Matthew 21:32 mentions "the way of righteousness"; this is in contrast to "the way of peace" mentioned in Luke 1:79. John tells people to (1) repent and (2) be baptized; this is in contrast to what the Lord does, which are: (1) to bear people's sins and (2) to baptize people in the Holy Spirit and fire.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 15: Study on Matthew &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
