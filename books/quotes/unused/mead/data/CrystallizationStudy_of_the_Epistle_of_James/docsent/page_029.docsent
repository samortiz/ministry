   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>JAMES NOT SAYING ANYTHING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ABOUT THE MANY MARVELOUS ASPECTS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF CHRIST STRESSED IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Except in James 1:1 and 2:1 where the title Christ is mentioned, James does not say anything further about the many marvelous aspects of Christ as the New Testament teaching stresses.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead, he uplifts and exalts the law with six kinds of particular terms: the word of truth, the implanted word, the perfect law, the law of freedom, the royal law, and the law that all believers have to keep.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>James was a lover, exalter, and promoter of the law, but Paul was different.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Colossians, a book of only four chapters, he exalted Christ as the preeminent One in the old and new creations 1:15-18 and as the embodiment of the Triune God 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hymns, #189 is a marvelous song on the Christ unveiled in Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we want to point out some of the marvelous aspects of Christ stressed in the teaching of the New Testament which cannot be seen in the book of James.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A. The All-inclusive Christ, Who Fills All in All</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Ephesians Paul spoke of the all-inclusive Christ, who fills all in all Eph 1:23; 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>B. The Unsearchable Riches of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul also spoke of the unsearchable riches of Christ Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>C. The Embodiment of the Fullness Of God</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Colossians tells us that Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of God 2:9; 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>D. God's Allotted Portion to the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>as the Good Land for Us to Walk In, That Is,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>to Live, to Walk, and to Have Our Being in Him</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is God's allotted portion to the saints, just as the good land was God's allotted portion to Israel Col 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The good land is a type of Christ allotted to us as our portion for us to live, walk, work, and move in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is the land to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>See Hymns, #1164-#1169 on Christ as the good land.</S>
