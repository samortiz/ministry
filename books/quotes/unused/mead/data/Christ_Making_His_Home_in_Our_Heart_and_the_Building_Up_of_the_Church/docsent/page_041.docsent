   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GLORY OF JEHOVAH FILLING THE TABERNACLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All saved ones can testify that God s presence is in the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Of course, we also have God s presence when we pray and when we read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, we know that those experiences cannot equal the presence of God that we experience in the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we pray, we have the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, when the church gathers together to pray, we experience the glory of Jehovah filling the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes we do not remember the message we heard in a meeting, but we know that we touched the presence of God, and thus the glory of Jehovah filled our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After a meeting we often sense that the world has no power over us and that sin has lost its ground in us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, we are able to live in the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then after two or three days, we gather again for another meeting, and again we see something glorious and touch something real.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This kind of experience does not happen only in the large meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We often have such experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the condition of the church is normal, the church is full of the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then even if there are no meetings, we can still sense that the saints have been built up to be the glorious house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church has an atmosphere that causes people to sense that God is present.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, if someone is seeking God, we should be bold to say, Go to the meetings of the church!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Christians meet together in the Lord s name, the people who go into their midst meet God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This happens not only in the large meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even when three or five saints gather together to speak for God, people sense that God is in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a wonderful condition, because the glory of Jehovah fills our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Raising Up of the Tabernacle The Standing of the Boards</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Exodus the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle after the tabernacle was raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The erecting of the tabernacle depended upon one crucial matter the standing of the boards.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The tabernacle had a total of forty-eight boards: twenty boards on the south, twenty boards on the north, six boards on the west, and two boards for the corners in the rear 26:18, 20, 22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Each board was ten cubits in length and one and a half cubits in width vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The forty-eight boards had to stand and also be united.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The boards were able to stand firm because each board had two tenons, and under each tenon was a socket, which was made of a talent of silver vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>17, 19, 21, 24-25; 38:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Under the two tenons of each board there were two sockets, and each socket had a hole to contain a tenon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this way the boards were able to stand firm.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The silver sockets are very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Silver signifies the work of Christ s redemption, and the sockets signify stability for standing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can stand firm before God because of Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The redemption of Christ is our foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is the solid base for our standing in God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are standing firmly on the foundation of Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Uniting of the Boards</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not only were the boards standing; they were also united.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The tabernacle was erected by means of the standing and uniting of the boards.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once the tabernacle was erected, it became God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A house cannot be called a house until it is built.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Piles of wood and stone are merely materials; they are not yet a house.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only when the materials are standing and joined will they become a house.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The glory of God filled the tabernacle because the tabernacle was built up.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This shows that God s glory will be in the midst of God s children when they are built up.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The building does not involve individuals but all God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They are joined together not by human organization but by God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God s life and nature join God s children together.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Every board was one and a half cubits in width.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The numbers three and five are basic numbers related to God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Genesis 6 contains the record of the building of the ark by Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The ark was three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high v. 15 . The basic numbers of these dimensions are three and five.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The dimensions of the tabernacle are also composed of these basic numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For instance, there were ten curtains divided into two sets of five Exo 26:1, 3 , and the depth of the tabernacle was thirty cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Both the curtains and the depth of the tabernacle contain the basic numbers of three and five.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Concerning the standing boards, the length of each board was ten cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Ten is a multiple of five.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For example, the ten virgins consisted of five who were foolish and five who were prudent Matt 25:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, ten cubits is made up of two sets of five.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Each board was one and a half cubits wide, which is half of three.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This means that a board is not a complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is similar to a couple.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Neither a husband nor a wife is a complete unit; they are halves.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Only when the husband and the wife are joined together can they be a complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need to see that as boards, none of us is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You are one and a half cubits, and I am one and a half cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We need to be matched with another to make a complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The number of the boards in the tabernacle was not an odd number but an even number: twenty boards on the south, twenty on the north, six in the rear, and two extra boards for the corners.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All the boards were coupled; they were matched with others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is wonderful that three and five are the basic numbers in God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This indicates that we are not complete units.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We are one and a half cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We are only half a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We need a brother or a sister to match us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the tabernacle no one can stand alone; all are in twos.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There were not twenty-one boards nor were there nineteen boards.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>There were twenty boards, six boards, and two boards.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>All the boards were in pairs.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This means that we cannot stand alone.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We need to be matched with another board.</S>
