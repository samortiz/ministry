<P>Recent statistics show that over the last twenty-two years, from 1964 to 1986, the membership of the Roman Catholic Church has increased by only .62 percent annually while that of the Southern Baptist denomination has increased by only 1.38 percent annually. A recent article said that since the mid sixties, the mainline denominations have collectively lost more than 4,778,000 members. These statistics show us that the traditional, unscriptural way of preaching the gospel does not work well over the long run.</P><P>We have to consider the situation in our locality. How much has the church in our locality increased over the years? Where is the increase? We all need to wake up. We need to be wise and sober. We need the increase, and the Lord Jesus needs the increase. Many people have been saved through big gospel campaigns throughout the years, but where are these ones today? Christianity is full of activities, but where is the remaining increase? Where is the real result?</P><P>We must take the God-ordained way to spread the gospel. We should be afraid of the poverty of increase in our locality. We need to wake up and endeavor to gain people for the Lord's kingdom. All of us have to give an account at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10). We should go first to our "Jerusalem." Then we should stir up the seeking ones in our locality to go out to visit people with the gospel.</P><P>In the past we were wasting our time by taking an unscriptural way. Because of this, we have been delaying the Lord's coming back. Are we satisfied with our present situation and condition? Do we think that we will be approved by the Lord when He comes? We all need to be desperate to bear fruit for the Father's glorification (John 15:8).</P><P>I also hope that one out of twenty in every church would be a full-timer. The full-timers should use their time to visit people for the spread of the gospel. They can also use their time to learn the truths and to pray. I believe that the issue of this will be marvelous. I hope that one out of twenty can serve the Lord full-time and that one out of four in the churches can be raised up to preach the gospel regularly in the God-ordained way. If this can be realized, I believe that we can have a solid increase of one hundred percent yearly. We can gain the solid increase, but we have to labor desperately, not in a loose way.</P><P>If all the Christians on earth would do this, I believe that within one or two years the entire earth would be "Christianized." We all need to wake up. We should forget about the fa√ßade of having big meetings with a good speaker. A number of us have been doing this for years, but what has been the result? Why would we not change our way? We should not waste our time and delay the Lord's coming back.</P><P>I have seen a vision, and I believe it will come to pass that the church life in all the cities will be practiced in many homes. Regularly, the church life will be going on in all the homes, and the entire church can also come together with everyone functioning. That will be wonderful. We have to realize that every home is a station for the Lord. The Lord can do many things through a home as His station. Every home can be a station of the gospel, a station of the truth, a station of life, and a station of the church life. The members of this home can be preachers of the gospel. We need to reconsider our way. We should go back to our localities to practice preaching the gospel according to the God-ordained way, and then we should train the faithful ones who have the way and the burden.</P>
