<P>I realized that initially it might be a suffering to have such a change. Seemingly we may not make that much profit at the beginning, but we will lay a good foundation so that we can make an unlimited profit in the future. I have the full assurance that the God-ordained way, the biblical way (according to Acts 2:46, Acts 5:42, and 1 Corinthians 14) works. This new way is insured by God's Word and will not suffer loss eventually.</P><P>The number one thing in my heart since 1984 has been to overthrow the system of one man speaking and the rest listening. We need to drop that old way and pick up the God-ordained, scriptural, new way. We need to have an absolute change to meetings of mutuality and to the home meetings. The basic factor for our meetings is that we need to meet in our homes. This is in the Bible, and this is God's ordained way.</P><P>Many of us can testify that at the beginning of our church life experience, when we were meeting in the homes, we increased rather quickly. But once we began to concentrate our meeting life in the meeting hall, our rate of increase gradually declined. To have the home meetings is not an easy task. The way of having big congregations is somewhat easy, but to have home meetings in every believer's home is a difficult job. If we have the home meetings, we will receive the benefit. We all have to drop our old way and pick up the new way.</P><P>In the new way, we have to learn how to go to every believer's home to have a meeting in each home. This is not an easy work. On the one hand, to work for the Lord we have to go to the people who can be considered as producing soil. On the other hand, we have to learn to recover those who have backslidden. Where there is a will, there is a way. If we would set our will to visit people with much prayer, the Lord will honor our will because this is His will. We will experience the Lord's blessing if we cooperate with Him to visit others.</P><P>The elders and co-workers also need to learn how to use the positive ones among us who are desirous to serve and burdened to function. We need to visit people with these ones as helpers. Eventually, we can assign the whole burden of the home meetings to these helpers. Concerning these things, we are still in the laboratory. We are still in the experimental stage. We need many experiences in the lab. We need to find out the most prevailing way to build up a Christian meeting in each member's home if possible. We have to endeavor to do this.</P>
