   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because the Godhead comprises the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, it would not be correct to say that the fullness of the Godhead includes only God the Son and not also God the Father and God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since the Godhead comprises the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the fullness of the Godhead must be the fullness of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was one with the Father 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He had no work, no will, no word, no glory, and no ambition for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As such a one, Christ expressed only the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He did not express Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was the Son, yet He expressed the Father.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates that in the beloved Son we participate in the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This fullness is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The more we experience and enjoy this fullness, the more we realize that it is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we participate in the fullness of the Godhead, we become the fullness of the Triune God, which is the expression of the processed Triune God.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to John 1:16, the fullness of God came with Christ, who is the embodiment of God's fullness Col 2:9; 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>With Christ, the expression was an individual matter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This expression, therefore, needed to be enlarged, to be expanded from an individual matter to a corporate matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church today is to be the fullness, the expression, of the Triune God in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the church the Triune God is not expressed through an individual; He is expressed corporately through the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we participate in the fullness of the Godhead embodied in the Son, we become the corporate fullness, the corporate expression, of the Triune God.</S>
