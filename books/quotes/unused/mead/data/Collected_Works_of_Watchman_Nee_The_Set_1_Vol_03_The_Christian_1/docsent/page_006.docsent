   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE ORIGINAL WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE CAUSE OF ITS DESOLATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Later, after an unknown period of time, the earth which was originally good became waste and empty, without any life whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God then rose up to recreate the world; He restored the desolate world in six days.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the next chapter we will study the work of the six days.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now we will consider why the world became desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How could God allow the work of His hands to be destroyed?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why did such a catastrophe come upon the once beautiful earth?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is probably no other reason besides sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The question we are considering has no perfectly clear explanation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nevertheless, we can find many shimmering lights in the Word of God which will enlighten us concerning this question and which will enable us to have a little more understanding concerning the former world and the cause of its desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only the Word of God can guide us and our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The understanding of His Word, regardless of the question being discussed, always brings us edification.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The greatest vanity is the reasonings in man's mind which do not rest on the foundation of God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although in reading Genesis 3 we cannot find Satan's name, we all know that the serpent was Satan's vessel and perhaps was even the embodiment of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Revelation 12:9 says, "And the great dragon was cast down, the ancient serpent, he who is called the Devil and Satan, he who deceives the whole inhabited earth."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Genesis 1 gives no record of the creation of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Where did he come from?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, we can see many evil spirits in both the Old and New Testaments; we meet them even more frequently in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Where did they come from?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We also do not see the creation of angels in the six days of work in Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Where, then, did the angels who are frequently mentioned in the Bible come from?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These questions are all related to our subject.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since the creation of the angels and the other supernatural beings is not recorded in Genesis 1, which covers the work of God during six days, we know that they were not created during that time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since they were not created within these six days, when were they created?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The only explanation is that they were creatures of the former world the original, perfect world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the fossil remains clearly show, not only were disease and death inseparable companions of sin then prevalent among the living creatures of the earth, but even ferocity and slaughter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And the fact proves that these remains have nothing to do with our world; since the Bible declares that all things made by God during the Six Days were very good, and that no evil was in them till Adam sinned...Since, then, the fossil remains are those of creatures anterior to Adam, and yet show evident tokens of disease, death, and mutual destruction, they must have belonged to another world and have a sin-stained history of their own, a history which ended in the ruin of themselves and their habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>G. H. Pember, Earth's Earliest Ages, 1942, reprinted 1975, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>34-35.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By reading Jeremiah 4:23-26, we see the reason why the earth became waste and emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 26 says that it was due to "His Jehovah's burning anger."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why was the Lord so angry?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was probably because of the sin of the creatures at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Isaiah 24:1 says that "Jehovah now makes the earth desolate."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why would the Lord destroy the earth of His original creation?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Judging from the history of our own world, we can answer that it was probably because of the sin of the earth's inhabitants which forced God to judge them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have said before that when we read Genesis, we do not see the origin of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As we look into the cause of earth's desolation in the beginning, our mind will naturally think "an enemy has done this" Matt 13:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Other than attributing the cause to Satan, it seems that we cannot find any other clues in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We will study a portion of the Bible which seems to tell us the origin of God's enemy and thereby we may know the condition of the former world and the cause of its becoming desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Let us now read Ezekiel 28:1-19.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These nineteen verses are divided into two sections: 1 verses 1-10 concern the prophet's warning to the prince of Tyrus, and 2 verses 11-19 concern the prophet's lamentations upon the king of Tyrus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The first section, a word to the prince of Tyrus, is easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was exalted with pride, considered himself God, and thought that he was wiser than Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Due to his progress in commerce, he became puffed up.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore God punished him, causing him to be slain and destroyed by the terrible of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Soon after this prophecy, Nebuchadnezzar of the Chaldeans came and destroyed Tyre.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Josephus believed that the prince of Tyrus was Ithobalus, who was called Ithobaal II in the history of the Phoenicians.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since we know that this prophecy has already been fulfilled, it is not difficult for us to interpret verses 1 through 10.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But when we read on from verses 11 through 19, we find many places that we do not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Since this portion of the Word is very much related to the subject which we are studying now, we quote the text in full:</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord God; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>28:11-19 .</S>
