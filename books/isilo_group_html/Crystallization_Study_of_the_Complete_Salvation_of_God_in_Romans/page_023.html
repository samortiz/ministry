In the Apostle Paul's Setting Up a Pattern</H2><P>Finally, we see how Paul set up a pattern of living the church life for the living of the Body life (15:14&#151;16:27). The first item in the pattern of one who is reigning in life is the preaching of the gospel. When we are under the ruling of the divine life, we will spontaneously preach the gospel. It is by our reigning in life that we preach the gospel.</P><P> Paul first preached the gospel to the Gentiles (15:14-24) and then brought them into the fellowship of the Body of Christ with the Jewish churches through their giving in love to provide for the necessities of the saints in Jerusalem (vv. 25-33). This was to bring the two into the fellowship of the one Body.</P><P>Paul by his recommendations and greetings in 16:1-24 is blending together many saints and many churches under his ministry for the practical living of the Body of Christ in the universal fellowship of the Body. In verses 17 through 19 Paul was very strict with the divisive and dissenting ones who make divisions, without compromise or yielding. In chapter fourteen Paul was liberal and gracious regarding the receiving of the believers, but here he is unyielding and resolute in saying that we must turn away from those who are dissenting, who make divisions, and who make causes of stumbling. The purpose in both cases is the preserving of the Body of Christ that we may have the normal church life. Today there is the need for all the believers who have received the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness to practice the life restriction and limitation in the divine life.</P><P>Paul afforded the God of peace a situation in which He will crush Satan under the feet of the churches by the saints' enjoyment of the grace of Christ in the blending and the universal fellowship of the Body (16:20). Hence, Paul was carrying out, based upon the righteousness of God and through man's obedience of faith (1:17), the mystery kept in silence in the times of the ages, concerning the complete salvation of God in the preaching of the complete gospel of God (1:1), in the fulfillment of the eternal economy of God for the glory to the only wise God through Jesus Christ(16:25-27). In the conclusion of this book, the glory to the consummated God indicates that the consummated God is glorified in the humanity of the glorified church under its reigning in life in the fulfillment of the eternal economy of God in carrying out His mystery hidden in the ages.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>Crystallization-Study of the Complete Salvation of God in Romans &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
