   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE RECOVERY OF AUTHORITY Co-workers' Meeting Date: April 14, 1948, morning</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speakers: Watchman Nee and Witness Lee OPEN TO RECEIVE THE SUPPLY OF THE MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brother Nee: In the past there were many things that we could not say or do, because we were not open to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When over twenty brothers recently handed themselves over to us, I told them that now I was not afraid even to take off my hat to ask for money from others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a man has handed himself over, his position changes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is the need for a certain degree of openness before there can be the capacity to receive a certain kind of word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first need today among the co-workers is to learn to be open.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What we did last night referring to the comments by the co-workers, see chapter eight can only be done when there is openness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are some things that we can say; there are other things that we cannot say.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is a question of position.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is a question of whether or not a person has the position to say certain kinds of words.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is also a question of motive and relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When you want to say something, you have to check whether your motive is right.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You also must ask what kind of relationship you have with your listener.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Different relationships mean that our words have to be different.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In addition, we have to speak in love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without love, we cannot speak honest words.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have been nodding our heads and patting each other on the back for over ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet there are still many things that we dare not open up to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We dare not speak about these things ourselves, and others dare not speak about them either.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Outsiders may not know about these problems, but we have been clear about them for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We know that there are some things that we cannot say or that are hard to say.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The problem today is that the members do not want to receive the supply from others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once a member refuses to receive the supply, all ministries stop.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When some people come across difficulties, they refuse to receive the supply from others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, they will only accept exhortations and supplies from those who are three miles away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To have to say something under such circumstances does not even touch the surface of the issue; much less can there be any deep or open words.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The need today is for us to put ourselves under the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a man sees the Body, he will not be hurt or caused to stumble.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is needed among the brothers and sisters is not friendship, cordiality, or tactfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>None of these things exists in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Among us in the past, we had the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yet it could not flow out even though the supply was present.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the coming days we have to look to God for mercy.</S>
