   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If we want to discover these two aspects of the truth in the Bible, we can find several hundred verses which show the subjective aspect of the truth as well as the objective aspect of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we can grasp these two aspects, we are able to grasp the tracks in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A train has two tracks on which to run.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If there is only one track, the train will derail.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With two tracks, the train can move ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both the objective and subjective aspects of the truth need our attention.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Emphasizing each aspect equally will render us the greatest help.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I do not want to preach any theology here.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, I would like to speak a little on the practical side.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For the time being, I will briefly mention the major accomplishments of Christ on the objective side as well as the work of the Holy Spirit on the subjective side.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First of all, Christ's death on the cross for our sins and for us is the kernel of the objective truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When a person touches the Bible, he will see Christ's death, Christ's redemption, and how Christ was made a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once you open the Bible, you will see these things, unless you do not read it at all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He hung on the tree to personally bear our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This matter was accomplished on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He has borne your sins, my sins, and the sins of so many people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These are the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the Lord Jesus has borne your sins, my sins, and the sins of all the people in the world, then why are all the people not saved?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why is it that some of the ones who have believed in the Lord and who we know are saved do not have the joy of salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why are they grieved over their sins?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are grieved because they always see the subjective side of how inwardly sinful, filthy, and unclean they still are.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Consequently, they do not see how they can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to know that all that Christ has accomplished is on the objective side and cannot be found on the subjective side.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a lamp is on this side, how can you find it on the other side?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What the Lord accomplished at Golgotha was not accomplished in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we search within ourselves, we will never find it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although I cannot find Christ's dying for us within, can it be found on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If Christ's death for us can be found on the cross, then we can declare, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ has borne my sins; I am saved."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever our faith latches on to the objective things, the Holy Spirit will infuse power into our inner being and will cause us to have the peace of forgiveness and the joy of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we try to find the death of Christ on the subjective side, we will never be able to find it because this is not God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God first gave His Son to man, and then He gave the Holy Spirit to man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The giving of the Holy Spirit follows the giving of God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ came first, then the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What the Holy Spirit is doing is to complete in us what the Lord has accomplished on His side.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The book of Hebrews tells us that faith is like an anchor, secure and firm, which brings us within the veil Heb 6:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Suppose we are on a ship with a very large anchor.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If it is always kept on the ship, what use is this anchor?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The anchor should be cast into the water to keep the ship from rocking; it should not be kept on the ship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is how faith should operate.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Faith never comes from believing in ourselves; faith comes from casting our anchor in the Lord Jesus, casting from our side to His side.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever something on the objective side is grasped by us, the subjective side becomes secure in us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose a ship with an anchor on board is rocking incessantly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Will fastening and putting more anchors on the ship cause it to steady?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even if the ship had larger anchors or was filled with anchors, it would still rock unsteadily.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The ship will only become steady when the anchor is cast into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more we look at ourselves, the more disappointed we will become.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we cast our faith upon the cross of the Lord Jesus, we will be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must be secure on the other side before we can be secure on our side; the order cannot be reversed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The correct way is to take the objective aspect as the starting point and then have the subjective aspect as the issue.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we only emphasize Christ's accomplishment on the cross without caring for what the Holy Spirit wants to do in us, we will never be able to have the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Similarly, if we only emphasize the Holy Spirit within us without caring for Christ's accomplishment on the cross, the result will be futile.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For example, in the matter of being crucified with Christ, is it we who crucify ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No. Romans 6:6 tells us, "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves." We do not do the crucifying; our old man was crucified with Christ when He was crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is an objective truth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our eyes must be on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It would be terrible if we were to crucify ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even though we see our wretchedness, we are not able to crucify it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The biggest mistake believers make is to say, "Even though the Bible says I have died with Christ, when I look at myself, I realize that I am still so hard-hearted.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is very easy for me to lose my temper; I am still so bad and not good."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We are crucified with Him, but the more we try, the less we die.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are wrong because we are starting from our end. We should remember that Christ is the real beginning to everything.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The real death is not seeing ourselves dead; when Christ died, we also died with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Only when the anchor is cast is it effectual.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Faith is efficacious only when it is cast in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If our eyes are always on ourselves, we cannot be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our pretense to be dead is a fake death, and we have no way to put ourselves to death.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have already died with Christ on the cross; this was accomplished by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>On the objective side Christ has died, and we have also died.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Romans 8:13 says, "For if you live according to the flesh, you must die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This verse runs parallel to Romans 6:6, which speaks of being crucified with Christ; this verse speaks of putting to death the practices of the body by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Crucifixion was accomplished by Christ, whereas the putting to death is done by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I believe that I have been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>For this I can say, "Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When Christ died, my old man was crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Today, on the subjective side, the Spirit will bring up a matter and tell you that this matter has been crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Will you follow the speaking of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If you say you are willing, the matter will be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Then the next day the Spirit will bring up another matter and tell you that it has been crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Are you willing to go along with His speaking?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If you agree, another matter will be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Spirit will say, "Your temper has been crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You do not need to lose your temper."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If you say, "I am willing not to lose my temper," then the Spirit will give you the power not to lose your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The Spirit will then say that your pride has been crucified and that you can be freed from your pride.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If you agree with not being proud, the Spirit will give you the power not to be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If you are willing to go along with the Spirit in one matter after another, the Spirit will fulfill His work in you.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If you only depend on yourself to suppress your anger, you will find that even gritting your teeth will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You must first see the accomplishment of Christ's death on the objective side before the Spirit will carry out that death in you.</S>
