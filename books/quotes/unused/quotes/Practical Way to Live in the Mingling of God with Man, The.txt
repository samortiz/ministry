Among the sixtysix books of the Bible it is this book that gives us a clear picture of the Christian life from its beginning to its maturity
As a result, this man has become a person who is full of joy and boasts because of the hope of the glory of God
When we realize that we are in Adam and therefore have sin and death, we also realize that we have been baptized into Christ
Although the fourth stage of the Christian life, seen in Romans 6, is a glorious one, the fifth stage, seen in chapter 7, is sorrowful
In this fifth stage we see a man who strives and struggles to do good, to keep the law of God, and to please God by himself
The reason for your sorrow will be that when you are trying to do good, you will in effect be 'running away' from Christ
When we rejoice that we are in Christ, the enemy often comes and subtly asks us whether or not we are in Christ
Whenever you are trying to do good, you have to realize you are contacting the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
What the Lord asks us to do is not to do good but to follow Him, that is, to walk according to the Spirit, who is in our spirit
Many Christians think that doing good is synonymous with following the Holy Spirit and walking according to the Spirit
A Christian is not someone who tries to do something; a Christian is a person who always enjoys and experiences Christ
The seventh stage of the Christian life as shown to us in Romans is the Lord's arranging all things to work together for our good
Romans 82829 says And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God to those who are called according to His purpose
In those who are in this stage, we will be able to recognize the image, glory, expression, and manifestation of Christ
In this stage we realize that we are no longer independent and individual persons but are instead members of the Body of Christ
From the time we have this realization onward, we can never be independent or individualistic, because we are members of the Body
In the sixth stage this person comes to know and realize that there is nothing left for him to do but to walk according to the Spirit
As such, we must experience and enjoy Christ and walk, live, act, and work in the Body of Christ as His many members
We learned that when we realize the glorious fact that we are in Christ and Christ is in us, we will automatically be normal Christians
It is impossible to experience God without Christ; outside of Christ, we can never contact God in a practical way
God put everything of Himself into Christ, made Christ everything in His purpose, and gave Him the first place
It is one thing to say that Christ is unsearchably rich; it is quite another to actually experience this Christ
They know that Christ is food and drink to them, and they know that they are in Christ and that Christ is in them
After eating the meats, fruits, and vegetables of America, he is, in a strict sense, a constitution of American food
The Scriptures tell us clearly that immediately after God created man, He presented Himself to man in the form of the tree of life
God's eternal intention is to make Himself food to us so that He can be eaten and digested by us and thereby be mingled with us
As long as we have the radio waves, we have the message, because the radio waves contain the message and bring it to us
Because we are regenerated, we possess two different kinds of lives-the natural life and Christ Himself as life
Many times we can tell just by the way a person thinks that his mind is full of Christ and that Christ occupies his mind
Whatever a man who has Christ formed within him chooses or decides, we sense that with him is the presence of Christ
Our heart is a composition of the three parts of our soul-the mind, emotion, and will-plus one part of our spirit, the conscience
It is not enough for us to declare how glorious it is that we are in Christ and how sweet it is that Christ is in us
We have to realize that Christ wants to make His home in every part of our heart; this will give Him the ground to occupy our whole being
In Matthew 16:24-25 the Lord Jesus says, 'If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me
For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it'
At that point, all the parts of our heart will be full of Christ, and we will have the mind, emotion, and will of Christ
When you love something or someone, remember that you have Christ living in you, and deny your self, rejecting your natural emotion
We have to reject our self and let Christ occupy our entire being, thereby allowing Him to make His home in our hearts completely
When Christ is formed in us, whenever we think, love, or decide, we will have the image of Christ and bear the expression of Christ
Spontaneously Christ will be magnified through us, and our life, being, and doing will be an expression, a manifestation, of Christ
As we have seen, enjoying Christ as food and drink is vital to the practical experience of Christ in a daily way
Although praying is the main way to drink Christ, we drink Him any time that we exercise our spirit to contact the Holy Spirit
Surely they were trying to understand how the Lord could give them His flesh so that He could be eaten by them
Day by day we have to learn how to experience and enjoy Christ by contacting the word and praying in our spirit
When we learn this, we will experience the Lord's energizing power, by which we can live, think, love, choose, and act
The breakfast that we eat every morning is the strengthening and energizing power within us by which we can live throughout the day
Such a life of eating and drinking Christ is a life of enjoying and experiencing Christ as everything to us in a practical way
Among Christians today the term mingling, particularly as it relates to the mingling of God with man, is rarely used
In the Scriptures oil signifies the Holy Spirit of God, and fine flour signifies the human nature-particularly that of Christ
God's intention, however, is not mainly that He would be worshipped by man; His intention is that man would take Him as food
Although it is true that the Lord's word here bears some symbolic meaning, the word eat is very strong and definite in its meaning
Not only so, in chapters 4 and 7, the Lord tells us that if we are thirsty, we can come to Him and drink Him as the living water
If you do not see the mingling of God with man, it will be difficult for you to understand the mystery of the Scriptures
Without being mingled with God, we can never enjoy God's love in a subjective way, and we can never share God's love with others
According to the Jews, God is merely God ; Christians believe that this God is not only God but also God incarnated to be a man
The Lord Jesus Christ is a man who, on the day of His ascension, was exalted to heaven and established by God to be the Lord
Incarnation brought divinity into humanity and made them one entity, but neither divinity nor humanity was changed in nature
After Adam was formed of the dust of the earth, he was only a creature of God-he was not the mingling of God with man
If Adam and Eve had eaten of the tree of life, which was the manifestation of God, they would have been mingled with God
Satan came in, frustrated man from eating of the tree of life, and seduced him to take the tree of the knowledge of good and evil instead
Unless the requirements of God's glory, holiness, and righteousness were met, the way for man to touch God as life would remain closed
The separation between God and fallen man is typified also by the veil that separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies in the temple
Because He opened the living way, we can boldly come forward in the blood of Jesus to contact God as our life directly
Consequently, when God as the Spirit flows into us, He flows into our spirit and mingles with our spirit as one spirit
The key to all the parables, types, prophecies, admonitions, teachings, doctrines, and truths in the Bible is the mingling of God with man
The temple itself, humanity, is the container, and the One who comes into the temple to dwell there, God Himself, is the content
In order to participate practically in the mingling of God with man, we must know how to exercise our spirit and deny our soul-life
Genuine spirituality and the mingling of God with man can be realized by us only in the spirit; it cannot be realized in the soul
Most Christians are taught and trained to exercise their mind; rarely are they taught how to exercise their spirit
As a result, although people may understand doctrines, they may not know how to enter into the experience of these doctrines in their spirit
The exercise of the spirit is not mere doctrine; it is the practical way to eat and drink Christ and thus be mingled with God
In our daily life we constantly encounter situations that expose our need to deny the self and exercise the spirit
If you and the American brother are in the self and have to coordinate to do something, there will be friction
In your emotion, you will not be happy with the other brother, and in your mind, you will not agree with some of the things he does
It is one thing to imitate Christ; it is another thing entirely for this very Jesus to come into us, mingle with us, and be our life
The real Christian life is one of mingling with Christ by both exercising our spirit to eat and drink Him and denying the self
The Bible also tells us that after the death and resurrection of Christ, God had many sons, with Christ as the Firstborn among them
These messages, teachings, and books stressed mainly negative matters, such as how to overcome sin, pride, hatred, and falsehood
As Christians, we constantly remember that we should not sin, that we should be humble, and that we should not do anything wrong
Because we are so accustomed to our 'oil lamp,' that is, our old life, we forget to apply Christ in our daily living
In other words, although we have been regenerated in our spirit, we still remain in the old life and forget to live by Christ
Our being transformed is more vital than our being sanctified, for unless we are transformed, we cannot be sanctified
Although we have been regenerated in our spirit, the remainder of our being-primarily our mind, emotion, and will-has yet to be transformed
We are certain that our spirit is regenerated, but are we as confident that our mind, emotion, and will have been transformed?
The Scriptures tell us that the heart includes all the parts of the soul-the mind, emotion, and the will -plus the conscience
We have to love Christ with our whole heart, offer our heart to Him, and let Him take over our whole heart so that He may dwell in it
We have to love the Lord with our whole heart, offer our whole heart to Him, and give up our mind, emotion, and will to Him
As those who are regenerated, we have to learn that we cannot go along with our own mind, emotion, and will, for they are old and natural
Although it seems that in their times of prayer they are in the spirit, after their prayer, they are in the natural mind, emotion, and will
If you are going to experience Christ the first lesson you have to learn is that of rejecting and denying your natural mind emotion and will
If you deny the natural mind, emotion, and will, the Holy Spirit within your spirit will take over these parts of your being
To be a Christian is to live a life in which we do not live by the mind, emotion, and will, but instead live by Christ in the spirit
If we go along with our emotion, we must give up Christ; if we go along with Christ, we must give up our emotion
As such, whenever you are going to do something, you must first check to see whether it is according to Christ or according to your emotion
Do not pray that the Lord will help you overcome your temper; pray rather that you will go along with the Lord and give up your emotion
Our only need is to practice going along with Christ, denying our mind, emotion, and will, and giving our heart wholly to Christ
We are transformed by practicing to always go along with Christ and always deny our natural mind, emotion, and will
Every day, moment by moment, we need only to practice one thing-denying our mind, emotion, and will to go along with the indwelling Christ
It is not enough for us simply to praise the Lord that He is our life, for we still have our natural mind, natural emotion, and natural will
We must learn the lesson of giving up the mind, emotion, and will to go along with the spirit, where Christ lives
Having been regenerated in our spirit, our need is to go along with our spirit and to forget, deny, and reject our mind, emotion, and will
Ephesians 3:19 says, 'And to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God'
For us to be filled unto all the fullness of God means that we are filled to overflowing with all the riches of Christ
To be filled unto all the fullness of God is to be filled with the riches of Christ to the point that we express His riches
When it comes to health, we would do well to not be overly anxious about germs and simply increase our intake of vitamins
While that may be true, in a deeper and more important sense, we need Christ to fill us until we are full of Him
If the Lord would open our eyes and give us the heavenly vision in full, we would realize that Christ is our perfection and completeness
Even if we as vessels are clean, pure, and entirely victorious over sins and the world, if we are devoid of Christ, we are still empty
In reality, our need is not for various things, regardless of how spiritual they may be; our need is simply Christ
Not only do we need to see that we are empty vessels; we also need to see what kind of vessel we are in the first place
In Psalm 51 David said, 'Behold, You delight in truth in the inward parts; / And in the hidden part You would make known wisdom to me'
The hidden part must be the spirit-composed of the conscience, fellowship, and intuition -for it is the most hidden part within us
As we vessels consider our complicated being, we must ask ourselves how much of Christ we have in our inward parts
In the Bible, we are told that we should have the mind of Christ and that Christ should make His home in our hearts
If it is without Christ, our heart-though it may be pure, clean, right, and good-is short of Christ and is thus empty and not perfect
My burden is to help you realize that Christ is our completeness and perfection and that we are made full in Him
Your entire inner being-the inward parts and the hidden part-have to be filled with Christ in order for you to be made complete
Although the Bible does speak of morality we must realize that the Bibles central point is Christ who fills us and in whom we are made full
It should be clear that the Bible speaks mainly of Christ filling us, making us full of Him, and then flowing out of us
Even if we asked him to take up the knife again, he would reply that since his hands are full of better things, he would not'
It is because we are not filled with Christ but are filled with other matters that we need to receive this kind of fellowship
When we find that this is our case, we simply have to come to Christ and tell Him that we are full of things other than Him
The more we pray to the Lord in this way, the more He will occupy our entire heart and make our heart a home for Himself
If there is the need to love others, the overflow of Christ from within our being will be the love toward others
If we give in to Satan's temptation to be humble and loving in ourselves, we will be defeated by him immediately
Because we know that the Gospel of John deals much with life, the Spirit mentioned in this book must be the Spirit of life
From this passage, we can realize that the Spirit mentioned here is the living water which we can drink and which can be within us
To put on power, or to be clothed with power, refers to the Holy Spirit coming upon the disciples as the Spirit of power in Acts 1:8
On the evening of His resurrection, Jesus came to the disciples and breathed into them, telling them to receive the Holy Spirit
The symbols of the living water and the breath are both spoken of in the Gospel of John, which deals with the matter of life
In the Gospel of John, in which the Spirit is mainly the Spirit of life, the symbols of the Spirit of life are breath and living water
In the books by Luke, however-the Gospel of Luke and Acts-the Spirit as the Spirit of power is symbolized by clothing and wind
It is not sufficient to be clothed by the Spirit of power; our desperate need is to be filled with the Spirit of life
From the verses related to His birth, we know that this does not mean that before His water baptism He did not have the Holy Spirit
Within, He had already been filled with the Holy Spirit, yet in order to minister, He needed to be equipped with the Spirit of power without
Today we have to realize that we need the two aspects of the work of the Holy Spirit-the inner aspect and the outer aspect
The inner aspect is to be filled with the Spirit of life, and the outer aspect is to be equipped with the Spirit of power
Answer: The things which are above are the heavenly things, including the ascended Christ and all things pertaining to Him
After creating man, the first thing God did in relation to man was not to take care of man's work but to take care of man's eating
Because we can do nothing without first eating, eating is of primary importance and must consequently be our first priority
