<p>Third, there is a difference between being spiritual and mental. Many spiritual things are in man's spirit as well as in his mind. It is not easy to know whether a man is in the spirit or in the mind simply by the words he says or the terms he uses. Two men can use the same words and terms, but their source is different. Many people have never been dealt with in their mind. If a man speaks from his mind, others will only touch his mind. If a man speaks from his spirit, others will touch his spirit. The content of the two speakings is different. If we are trained and experienced in our spirit, we will know whether a man is speaking from his spirit or from his mind as soon as he opens his mouth. If a man's word is from the spirit, we will touch the spirit immediately. If a man's word is from the mind, we will only touch the mind. If spiritual things remain purely in the mind, they will be nothing but theories, and they will not be of any spiritual worth. If a man's spiritual life depends only on mental knowledge, he has nothing but vanity; he does not have any spiritual reality. We should never allow our living to be directed by our mind.</p><p>The discernment of whether one's speaking is from the spirit or the natural mind is one of the most elementary and initial lessons in spiritual judgment. If a man cannot differentiate between the spirit or the natural mind, he does not have the ability to make spiritual judgments. Failure to make such a discernment is a big flaw. Wherever we work, we have to learn to have such a discernment. We should know immediately whether a man's spirit is released or whether his natural mind is released. Words that come from the spirit are entirely different from words that issue from the natural mind. When I was in Shanghai some brothers always remarked, "Brother So-and-so really preaches well. He even preaches the same way as we do." When I went and listened to the preaching myself, I found that the words were all coming from the speaker's natural mind. At other times I would hear reports about wonderful preachings elsewhere. When I checked on those reports, I also touched nothing but the exercise of the natural mind. Some words are from the natural mind, and some words are from the spirit. The nature of the two kinds of words is different. We should not be deceived by the superficial appearance of the word. A young man may think that he can say the same thing an elderly man says and even say it better, but the words from the elderly man come out of his spirit, while the words from the young man come out of his mind. The two are different in nature. If we cannot differentiate between the two, we will be deceived easily. If a man retains God's word merely in his memory and has never learned anything in his spirit, his words may have much content, but his spirit is empty. This speaking is vain. A worker must learn to tell the difference between these two things.</p><p>Fourth, there is a difference between things that issue from the natural life and things that issue from the spiritual life. When we deal with a brother or when we listen to a testimony, we have to exercise our spirit to sense his condition before God. We can jot down on a piece of paper the kind of person he is according to his natural attributes and the kind of person he is spiritually. As soon as he opens his mouth, we can tell whether he is clever, quick, lazy, muddled, impatient, sloppy, humorous, jovial, talkative, naughty, or inaccurate. Every person bears certain characteristics; it is not easy for a man to hide his characteristics. If we have the time, we can write down the characteristics of every person in a notebook. A man cannot hide his self for too long. In the beginning he may be able to bridle himself, but in the end his self will be exposed. Once a man opens his mouth, his characteristics will be manifested. When a man speaks to us, we can ignore his first few words because these words are always spoken under conscious restraint. But after a while, the speaker's self will be fully exposed. Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks (Matt. 12:34).</p><p>After we have discerned his natural traits, we can go on to examine his condition before the Lord. Perhaps his temper has been dealt with by the Lord. Or perhaps his speech, attitude, or self-love have been dealt with. Some may have gone through experiences in their environment and may have picked up some lessons with respect to trust for material needs. We will find out what God has done in them in life. From their testimonies, we can tell how much they have learned, how much of God has been constituted into them, and how much God has operated in them. All these are edifications in life. We have to know a person's natural life as well as his spiritual life. We have to observe the kind of person he is in his natural state. We also have to observe how much he has been built up in life. We have to observe how his spirit blends in with his natural characteristics. This last point requires particular skill in discernment. Even those who are able to discern this may not know what prescription to give for its cure. Some people are quick in their mind, yet they have also experienced much discipline from the Spirit. Should this quickness be condemned? The answer depends on whether or not this natural trait frustrates them from a proper Christian walk. We have to learn to exercise our judgment. We have to know men's condition before we can give them the proper guidance.</p><p>Fifth, there is the difference between the spirit and the emotion. We have to know what is of the spirit and what is of the emotion. It is easy to distinguish the spirit from the natural mind, but not as easy to distinguish the spirit from the emotion. It is hard to tell at which point a man's spirit is released and at which point his emotion is released. Difficult as this is, we have to learn the distinction. Some speak according to their spirit, while others speak according to their emotion. Like the soul, the spirit also has knowledge and feelings. The knowledge of the spirit, however, is different from the knowledge of the natural mind. If a man's knowledge comes from his natural mind, others will sense nothing of his spirit. If his knowledge comes from his spirit, it will strike a response in others. They will be able to say "amen" and will feel an inner peace. If a man speaks according to his natural mind, his words may be right, but others will not have a pleasant reaction. If a man speaks from his spirit, his words will always bring comfort and joy to others. His spirit will be released, and others' spirits will respond. However, it is not easy to know those who speak according to their emotion. When a man's spirit is released, it is released through and with the emotion. This is the reason it is hard to tell whether a person is speaking by his emotion or whether his spirit is speaking through the emotion. When the spirit of some people is released with their thoughts, the audience is conscious only of the spirit, not the mind. However, when a man releases his spirit with his emotion, others will touch a combination of both. They will sense a mixture of the spirit with the emotion. They will sense the presence of the spirit, but they will also sense the presence of the emotion. Therefore, it is hard to separate the spirit from the emotion. It is very easy for us to confuse the emotion with the spirit.</p><p>How can we differentiate between the spirit and the emotion? It is not easy to explain this process, but I will try. I may not be able to do a good job. Please bear with me. When a man's spirit is released, it is released with his emotion. If his emotion and spirit are in harmony with each other, the release of the spirit will strike a response in us, and we will sense that this release is pure, gentle, and firm. But when a man's spirit is released through his emotion and the two are not in harmony with each other, the result will be an intrusion of the emotion; others will not sense his spirit. His emotion will contaminate his spirit and defile it. When there is only the release of the emotion, without the release of the spirit, this release will be a kind of defilement. Whenever we have such a sense of defilement, it means that the spirit and emotion are not in harmony. When the two are in harmony, we will respond with joy and an "amen." If there is only the release of the emotion without the spirit, we feel defiled and wronged; there is an inward rejection of such intrusion. We have to give special attention to the discernment of this matter.</p>
