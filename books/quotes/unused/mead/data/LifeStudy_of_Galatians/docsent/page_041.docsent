   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HEARING OF FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE MEETINGS OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Faith was not to be found in the Old Testament; it came with Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Christ came, grace came, and faith came also.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Faith has come to replace law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, as believers in Christ, we are hearers, not workers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the church meetings we gather together for the hearing of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who do not attend the meetings cut themselves off from opportunities for the hearing of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we are cut off from the hearing, we are also cut off from the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not stay away from the meetings because you think you will simply hear the same things over and over again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to eat breakfast every morning even though we may eat the same thing almost every day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we refuse to eat because the food is the same, we shall not receive our necessary supply of food.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the same principle, we need to attend the church meetings in order to receive God s supply.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can testify that it makes a great difference whether or not we come to the meetings for the hearing of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Time and time again, we may hear of Christ and the church, of Christ s death and resurrection, and of how Christ has been processed to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But each time we hear these things, we receive the supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, a proper Christian meeting is a hearing meeting, a meeting for the hearing of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who speak in the church meetings should also be hearers, for they also hear the very things they are speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those of us who speak in the church can testify that the more we speak, the more we hear.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A proper speaker speaks first to himself and then to others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you do not speak to yourself first, your speaking is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we are genuine speakers, we should be the first to enjoy our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Meeting by meeting we come together for the hearing of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This faith is the appreciation, receiving, and accepting of God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through faith we are joined to God s grace, we partake of God s grace, and we enjoy God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we have pointed out again and again, this grace is the Triune God processed to become our enjoyment and everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>GOD S INTENTION IN HIS ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How wrong the Galatian believers were to turn back to the law!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God does not want us to be workers of law; He wants us to be hearers of His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we hear His grace, grace spontaneously becomes our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Before faith came, God used the law to keep us, hold us, and retain us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But now that faith has come, we no longer need the law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With the law there is no enjoyment, no grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But with faith there is an abundance of enjoyment, for faith is related to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today we experience the hearing of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By this hearing of faith we continually receive the supply of the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the revelation in the book of Galatians, God s New Testament economy is not that we strive in the flesh to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this matter the Judaizers had altogether missed the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No genuine believers in Christ should be distracted by such folly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In His New Testament economy God intends to make us hearers of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This faith is the reflection of the Triune God processed to become our all-inclusive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God desires that we become those who continually hear the faith which reflects His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Grace is nothing less than the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit to be our life and our everything so that we may enjoy Him in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through this enjoyment we become one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We become a universal and eternal entity to express His marvelous divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the revelation contained in the depths of this book.</S>
