        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE OPERATION OF GOD IN MAN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; 14:9-10, 16-18; Eph. 3:17a, 19b; Phil. 2:13; 1 John 3:24</h1>
<p>Christians should seek to gain God more than any other matter or thing. In this chapter we will consider the meaning of gaining God and how God enters into man and operates in man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEANING OF GAINING GOD</h2>
<p>To gain God is deeper and more subjective than merely to believe in His existence or to fear Him. Many thoughtful people believe that God exists and even fear Him, but God is not in them. To believe in God is not merely to believe that He exists, nor is it merely to fear Him. To believe in God is to gain Him subjectively in one&rsquo;s spirit. When a person believes in God, he opens his heart to receive God and to let God enter into him and dwell in his spirit. Hence, he can be joined and mingled with God, and God can become his element. When we let God enter into us to be our life and nature and even our being, we are joined to Him as one. This is the meaning of being a Christian. Every Christian should know that God desires man to gain Him.</p>
<p>Let us use a glass of water as an example. Merely believing that this glass contains water cannot quench your thirst, nor can you receive the water merely by holding the glass in your hand. The water must enter into you and become a part of you. The way to receive, to gain, the water is to drink it, that is, to let the water enter into you, mingle with you, and become a part of you. This principle also applies to food. We must take food in by eating it so that it can become a part of us. The food that we eat is not separate from us. This is the way to receive food.</p>
<p>Similarly, to gain God does not refer merely to believing in Him or fearing Him objectively. To gain God is to receive Him into us subjectively, that is, to let Him be our life and nature and to let Him mingle with us until He becomes our element. Then His thoughts will be our thoughts, His emotions will be our emotions, His preferences will be our preferences, and His inclinations will be our inclinations. This is what it means to gain God.</p>
<p>Some people say that Christianity is elusive and impractical because it speaks only of heaven and hell, which are in the future. My response to these people is that most preachers are inaccurate in their preaching of the gospel because they do not tell people that the gospel is for people to gain God. God came out of eternity and entered into time to be our life so that He and we can live together as one in reality. Religion is not more practical than the Christian faith, nor is philosophy more real than God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>If we know God and His salvation, we will know that He wants to enter into us so that He can supply us as our life and power. We do not have the power to resist sins, to do good deeds, to honor our parents, or to love our spouse. He is in us to be our power to resist sins, to do good deeds, to honor our parents, and to love our spouse. He is the power that bears us, not merely for us to be excellent persons but to be persons who are filled with God, that is, to be God-men. Then the people whom we contact will sense not only goodness; they will sense God. When they contact us, they will have an indescribable feeling of comfort and sweetness, which is God as our element. This is what it means for a Christian to gain God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY FOR GOD TO ENTER INTO MAN</h2>
<p>How does man gain God, and how does God enter into man? How can the noble, great, glorious, and holy God enter into a lowly, small, and filthy man?</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Word Becoming Flesh</h2>
<p>In order for God to enter into man, the Word became flesh. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,&rdquo; and verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; The Word is God. At a certain point in time the Word, who is God, became flesh and tabernacled among men. The person who was incarnated is the Lord. He is the Word who became flesh. He became a man with the purpose of bringing God to man.</p>
<p>Not only did God dwell in Jesus Christ; Jesus Christ was God. The people who touched, contacted, and received the Lord Jesus touched, contacted, and received God, because Jesus Christ is God. God became a man and tabernacled in this man. Hence, those who believe in Jesus Christ and receive Him also receive God. God gives Himself to men in the person of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>If I want to give a brother some water to drink, I cannot carry the water in my two palms to him. I must use a glass as a means to contain the water. When the brother receives the glass, he receives the water. God cannot enter into us directly. In order for us to receive Him, He must give Himself to us in and through Christ. Hence, God became flesh and is embodied in Christ. When we receive Christ, we gain Him, and at the same time we also gain God, because Christ is God. This is what it means to believe in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Believing in the Lord Jesus Christ is to receive Him and to obtain God. When we receive Christ, we gain God because God is in Christ. God can enter into us, and we can gain Him through Christ.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
