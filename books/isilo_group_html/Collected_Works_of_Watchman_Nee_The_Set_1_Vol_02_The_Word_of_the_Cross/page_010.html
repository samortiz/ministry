We are very willing to get rid of the evil things in the self. However, our frequent problem is that we think we should keep the good things of the self. In the sight of God, the self is totally corrupted and deeply affected by the fall of Adam. According to God, He cannot heal the life of the self, nor can He remedy it. There is no other way but to crucify it with Christ on the cross. The world is willing to let everything go and is willing even to sacrifice its own money and time, yet it finds it too difficult to deny the self and to crucify it. We always consider that the self is not all bad. This is the human viewpoint. Of course, the natural man has no intention of retaining only its goodness. However, unconsciously and unwittingly, one keeps the good part of the self and puts the evil part of the self to death. Little do we realize that the self is either totally alive or totally dead. If the good part of the self is kept alive, there is no guarantee that the evil part of the self will be dead. Therefore, believers have a serious lesson to learn here. They have to be willing to crucify with Christ both the good and the evil parts of their self. Many people's natural self is honest by birth. Some are very patient, and some are loving. It is very hard for those people to put all their self to death. Subconsciously, they keep their honesty, patience, and love and let the other wrong things be crucified with the Lord. These believers must be taught by God to realize that they themselves are not trustworthy. Only then will they submit themselves to the Lord. We can learn a lesson from Peter on this point. Before he experienced the death and resurrection of Christ and the filling of the Holy Spirit, he truly thought that his love toward the Lord was right. However, was his promise to die with the Lord carried out? Peter's failure was caused by his total trust in himself; he trusted in his own goodness. Yet he did not realize this. After all, it is difficult to realize the self. We should trust in God's evaluation of ourselves and should put the self on the cross.</P><P>If we consider God's evaluation of the world, we will be more sure about this fact. God said, "There is none righteous, not even one" (Rom. 3:10). To the world, is there really none righteous? There are quite a few righteous persons according to the world's point of view! The reason God considers none righteous is that all their righteousness is produced by themselves. The self is deeply cultivated by Adam's nature. "Does the spring, out of the same opening, gush forth the sweet and the bitter?" (James 3:11). Man thinks that he has what the world approves as righteousness. Yet, "because they were ignorant of God's righteousness and sought to establish their own righteousness, they were not subject to the righteousness of God" (Rom. 10:3). The self-righteous ones are not righteous. They are also sinners destined to perdition. Only those who receive the entire person of the Lord Jesus are the righteous ones.</P><P>We can look into another portion of the Word which tells us how the goodness of the self-life should be put to death before one can bring forth good fruit. This passage, however, deals more with the self-life than with the self itself.</P><P>"Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit" (John 12:24). The Lord is speaking to His believers. His word is a calling. "If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me" (v. 26). After He spoke the words in verse 24, He did not leave us in darkness, but He continued by explaining, "He who loves his soul-life loses it [i.e., in eternity bears no fruit]; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it [i.e., not be barren] unto eternal life [in the original, the spiritual life]" (v. 25). The teaching here is that the self-life should be put to death.</P><P>Life is very precious. One can suffer the loss of everything except life. Yet here is a call for us to lose our life. Our self- life is endowed to us by birth; it is legitimate and is good. Yet here the Lord requires that we put it to death.</P><P>What is this life? This is a natural life, a life that we have in common with all animals, a life with mobility. Our intellect, love, and emotions are all dominated by this life. Every faculty of our body is controlled by this life. Every part of our being is controlled by this life. Although it is not wrong to exercise our intellect, love, and emotions, this dominating life, this life which comes by our natural birth, is not a spiritual life. Unless the spiritual life becomes the expression and the motivating power of all the faculties of the believers, a believer will "lose" his life, that is, he will never bear fruit.</P><P>This self-life is beautiful and attractive. Our Lord uses wheat as an illustration. The exterior shell of a grain of wheat is very attractive. Its color is golden yellow. Although it is beautiful, it is useless if it remains merely a grain. It must be separated from (or go together with) its companions and fall into the ground-a dark, hidden, suffering place-and die there. When it dies, it will lose its beauty and all it has. It will no longer be an object of man's praise as before.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 02: The Word of the Cross &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
