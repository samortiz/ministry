<h2 class=head3>b. To Fight against Antichrist and the False Prophet and Their Armies, and Destroy Them</h2><p>The heavenly armies following the Lord will fight against Antichrist and the false prophet and their armies and destroy them. Revelation 19:19 speaks of Christ’s enemies: “I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war with Him who sits on the horse and with His army.” Christ’s enemies are the beast, Antichrist (undoubtedly including his associate, the false prophet), and the kings of the earth and their armies. The kings of the earth especially include the ten kings under Antichrist (Rev. 17:12-14), and the armies include the two hundred million cavalry troops from the rising of the sun (Rev. 9:16; 16:12). Christ and His armies will defeat Antichrist and his armies. Revelation 19:20 says, “The beast was seized, and with him the false prophet.…These two were cast alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone.” Antichrist and the false prophet will be the first to perish in the lake of fire. All the rest will be killed “with the sword which proceeds out of the mouth of Him who sits on the horse” (v. 21). This is Christ as the King of kings and the Lord of lords with His armies defeating Antichrist, the false prophet, and their armies.<h2 class=head3>c. At Armageddon</h2><p>Antichrist and his false prophet and their armies will be the strongest people against God, fighting directly with God. God Himself in Christ as His embodiment will come with all His chosen and faithful ones to fight physically against Antichrist, the false prophet, and their armies. This will take place at Armageddon. Revelation 16:14 says, “They are spirits of demons, doing signs, which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth, to gather them to the war of the great day of God the Almighty.” By means of the signs they perform, these spirits of demons will gather the kings of the inhabited earth for war. Verse 16 says, “They gathered them to the place which in Hebrew is called, Armageddon.” At the end of the great tribulation, three unclean spirits out of the mouths of Satan, Antichrist, and the false prophet (v. 13) will go forth to stir up the rulers of the whole inhabited earth and gather their forces, including the two hundred million cavalry mentioned in Revelation 9:14-16, to the war at Armageddon, which will be the last war among mankind before the millennium. In that war Satan’s intention will be to destroy Israel (Zech. 14:2) and to fight against Christ and His army. For this he will use all rebellious mankind (Rev. 17:12-14; 19:11-19). Christ and His chosen overcomers will defeat and destroy them all (Rev. 19:20-21; Zech. 14:3,12-15; 12:4, 9) at Armageddon and save the nation of Israel (Zech. 12:3-8; 14:4-5; Joel 3:14-17). This is the treading of the winepress recorded in Revelation 14:17-20, Isaiah 63:1-6, and Joel 3:9-13.
