<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Concerning the Preaching of the Gospel</H2><P>Are we serious about the preaching of the gospel? In Swatow you have three hundred people meeting here. If everyone would bring one person to the Lord per year, in ten years there will be one hundred fifty thousand people saved. This means that in ten years the whole of Swatow will be saved. Our gospel work is wrong today. We need the Lord's mercy. It is difficult for an old tree to bear new fruit. The older a tree becomes, the thicker its bark is. But a young tree can bear much fruit. Among us, the new ones grow much faster than the old ones. This exposes our unfaithfulness. How many gospel tracts have we passed out today? How many people have you invited to the gospel meetings? In the matter of gospel preaching, we cannot be a person who only talks but who does not do anything.</P><P>You may say that you have preached the gospel. But how many times have you passed out gospel tracts? How many times have you posted gospel posters, and how many times have you preached in the open? How many times have you given books away to people? How many times have you written letters to others exhorting them to believe in the Lord? Do not say that you are concerned about having false believers. Even if they believe in a false way, you can still bring them in. We have to have a love for the sinners. Only this love is the real love.</P><P>Once Moody was standing in the rain without an umbrella. Others thought that he was crazy, but he told them, "I am doing this to show you something. You say that I am foolish. Actually you are more foolish than I am. One day when God's judgment comes, the fire from heaven will shower down. If you do not believe in the Lord, one day you will suffer punishment." Moody also told others that he preached to at least one person a day. One night, he was in his bed already and remembered that he had not preached to anyone that day. Immediately, he got up and went out to the street. There he met a policeman, and he preached to him. The next day the policeman asked around and found out that the one who was preaching to him was Moody. Later he visited Moody and was saved through him. Today we have to drive out fallen Christianity, and we have to chase away the dead pulpits. The real work today is one that revolutionizes a person.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Concerning Material Offerings</H2><P>How much have we done with respect to the matter of material offerings? Do we offer according to a budget? What is our budget every week? If you walk on the street today, you can see many advertisements, but you do not find one gospel advertisement. The reason for this is that men have not offered up themselves thoroughly enough. When a person comes to the meeting hall, he comes only to attend a service, and there is no real consecration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Concerning Supplications</H2><P>In the matter of making supplications for others, how many times have you dealt seriously with the Lord? How many of your prayers have been answered? How many times have you prayed for the servants of God? How many times have you visited the sick? How many poor brothers have received your help?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Concerning the Services</H2><P>In the matter of the services, have we taken them up in a serious way. Have you ever mopped the floor of the meeting hall? Have you ever cleaned the windows, the doors, and the chairs of the meeting hall? You cannot expect the angels to come and do these things for you. Many jobs require the brothers and sisters to do them together. Do not be so spiritual. We have to learn the proper lessons in the practical services before we can learn the lessons in the spiritual matters. I wish that we did not have any hired laborers here, and that every work would be taken up by the brothers and sisters themselves. This is more precious in the eyes of the Lord. The brothers and sisters in Chefoo all gave themselves to serve this way.</P>
