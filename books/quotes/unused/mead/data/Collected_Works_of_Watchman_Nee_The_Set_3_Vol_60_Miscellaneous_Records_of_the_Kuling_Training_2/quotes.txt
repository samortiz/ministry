[3]  CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION 2 Date: Morning, July 2, 1948
[4]  Brother James Yen: If a man is depressed, discouraged, and bound, is it because his outward man is not broken?
[5]  First, when a man acts according to his outer man, he does not need to exercise his spirit.
[6]  Question: How can we be thorough in dealing with the ten or more lessons you have given concerning the character of the Lord's worker?
[7]  As ministers of God's word, we should not only release God's word when we speak, but also we should release His light spontaneously when we speak.
[8]  Be a Person Who Has a Capacity for Light
[9]  In order to give others light, we must first be those who have met the light.
[10]  For this reason, we must not only learn to dispense light, but receive light.
[11]  Those who prophesy speak on what they see and know all along, but when someone beside him receives a "revelation," that is, when he receives something specific from God at that instant, the one who is prophesying should be quiet and allow the one who has received a revelation to speak vv.
[12]  Place: Kuling NOT BEING SUBJECTIVE IN LISTENING TO OTHERS
[13]  Question: What are the particular things we have to know concerning listening to others?
[14]  Once a person refuses to take his proper position, there will be confusion in the church.
[15]  If all the brothers and sisters say that you should not do a certain thing, yet you insist on doing it, you are taking the way of the Gentiles; you are not a person living in the church.
[16]  The reminding of the Holy Spirit is when the Holy Spirit reveals to us a second time what we have seen.
[17]  When we break the bread, we must not only recognize the Lord as the Savior, but also we must have a fresh vision of the picture of His salvation.
[18]  Question: In the course of our work, what should we do when we encounter idle talk?
[19]  Answer: One basic training a worker of the Lord must go through is to ignore idle talk.
[20]  Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow."
[21]  As God performs a special work of breaking and tearing down our outer man, we will be clear about the dividing of our soul from our spirit.
[22]  Question: What does it mean to release the spirit, and what does it mean to be free from self-consciousness?
[23]  Answer: When we speak for God, our spirit rises up.
[24]  Question: What is the meaning of the terms "a word of wisdom" and "a word of knowledge" in 1 Corinthians 12:8?
[25]  Answer: First Corinthians 12:8 says, "For to one through the Spirit a word of wisdom is given, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit."
[26]  CONCERNING BEING CLOSED God Closing What He Has Given
[27]  When God chooses a man to be a minister, and his revelation reaches a certain height, he will become the ministry of the word in that age.
[28]  If this person becomes proud and begins to interpret God's word by himself, God will seal him up, and he will not see any more light.
[29]  God presents the gospel to man in different ways.
[30]  In preaching the gospel we have to follow these ways to present the good news to men effectively.
[31]  Those who have had experience in preaching the gospel, as well as those who are about to launch into this work, should pray to God to show them one of these ways.
[32]  Many people are afraid that they will have to give up the pleasures and enjoyment of the world once they believe in the Lord.
[33]  Next let us take a look at the three positive subjects.
[34]  In preaching the negative subjects, we only have to touch them briefly and give others a deep impression of these things.
[35]  We only need to touch sin, judgment, and the world briefly, but we can come back again and again to the positive subjects such as the love of God.
[36]  God is not unwilling to give His life to man or to save man, but man is unwilling to accept what God gives!
[37]  It is when man's heart turns to God and touches Him.
[38]  As long as some people turn their heart to the Lord and call on Him with their mouth, they are saved even though they are not clear about the gospel.
[39]  The subject of our discussion this time is how the gospel is accomplished in the sinner, rather than how God accomplishes His work through the gospel.
[40]  Once we are clear how the gospel is accomplished in the sinner, we will know how to preach the gospel.
[41]  If a sinner has a subjective grasp of how he is saved at the time he receives the gospel, he will know how to convey the same gospel to others.
[42]  If the Spirit does not come, we cannot be saved even though the Lord Jesus has accomplished redemption and God is ready to receive us.
[43]  She was full of gratitude to the Lord for the forgiveness she received.
[44]  In Luke 18:13-14 the Lord said, "But the tax collector, standing at a distance, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be propitiated to me, the sinner!
[45]  John 8:3-11 speaks of the salvation of a woman spared of her judgment.
[46]  She was a sinful woman, and there was no question that she should be condemned.
[47]  Yet the Lord said to those who caught her, "He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her."
[48]  When he said at the end, "Through His name everyone who believes into Him will receive forgiveness of sins," the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard the gospel v. 44 . In preaching the gospel, all that one has to do is to bring the sinner to God; there is no need to insist that they understand too much of the teaching concerning salvation.
[49]  Place: Kuling BASED ON THE LORD AS A FRIEND TO SINNERS Not Needing Very Much Truth for Salvation,
[50]  In the previous message, we saw from the New Testament that many people were saved without being very clear about the gospel truths.
[51]  Because of the influence of tradition, many gospel preachers think that they need a great deal of truth and a thorough and lucid presentation of the gospel that addresses the entire range of human problems before men can be saved.
[52]  In our preaching of the gospel, we should always exercise ourselves to discern how much truth a person needs before his heart will turn to God for salvation.
[53]  JESUS BEING A FRIEND OF SINNERS Friendship Being an Extraordinary Relationship
[54]  The Bible says that Jesus is a friend of sinners Matt 11:19 .
[55]  No matter what kind of sin a person has committed, no matter what kind of person he is, he can come to the Lord because the Lord is a friend of sinners.
[56]  Place: Kuling CREATING A DESIRE IN MAN'S HEART Salvation Being Realized When a Man's Heart Reaches Out to Touch the Lord
[57]  We have covered the things that happen to a sinner when he receives salvation.
[58]  A man is saved by reaching out his heart to touch the Lord.
[59]  When he exercises a sincere heart to touch the Lord, he is saved.
[60]  We have said that a man is saved when his heart reaches out to touch the Lord, but what is the heart?
[61]  Romans 1:21 says that the mind of an unbeliever is darkened and vain in reasonings.
[62]  He is an ignorant and foolish man as far as salvation is concerned.
[63]  Since this is the condition of the sinners we are dealing with in our preaching, how can we turn their ignorance into enlightenment and their darkened thoughts into light?
[64]  In Matthew 13:15 the Lord said, "For the heart of this people has become fat, and with their ears they have heard heavily, and their eyes they have closed, lest they perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and they turn around, and I will heal them."
[65]  We must realize that man's entire heart is darkened with respect to salvation.
[66]  It is impossible for such a heart to believe in the Lord.
[67]  Before the Holy Spirit operates on our gospel friends, it is impossible for them to believe in the Lord.
[68]  In order for a sinner to receive salvation, the first thing we have to do is to create a place for God within his heart with the words of the gospel.
[69]  Man's heart is deceitful above all things; it is altogether in darkness and in opposition to God.
[70]  In preaching the gospel to the Samaritan woman, the Lord did not first show her the gospel or her own sin.
[71]  In learning to preach the gospel, we have to pay attention to two things.
[72]  Second, we have to understand the sinner's heart, that is, we have to understand the condition of those whom we are preaching the gospel to.
[73]  We should consider how sinners dwelt in darkness and sin, how the Lord preached the gospel to them, and how they were touched.
[74]  We have to pay attention to how the Lord dealt with sinners and how men received the Lord.
[75]  When we preach the gospel, we have to visualize these different kinds of sinners before our eyes and consider how we can turn them.
[76]  A man should study the Bible, but he should also study man's heart.
[77]  Luke 4:18-19 says, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to announce the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to send away in release those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord."
[78]  Here the Lord pointed out the two kinds of people His gospel is directed toward: those who have need and those who sin.
[79]  For those who understand the gospel but who are not saved, our preaching should awaken a sense of sin in them because they are more prone to have a feeling of sin.
[80]  In preaching the gospel to them, we have to first plant within them a sense of their offenses against God, not just a sense of sin per se.
[81]  Therefore to preach the gospel in China, we must not only help men have a sense of sin but must show them that they have offended the living God.
[82]  Let us now consider a few ways to create in man a sense of need.
[83]  He has defeated the devil, the one who has the might of death v. 14 . Those who believe in Him are released from death; they will no longer be under the slavery of death v. 15 . They can boldly declare, "Where, O death, is your sting?" 1 Cor 15:55 . We should tell them that the Lord Jesus has removed the taste of death.
[84]  HOW TO CREATE IN MAN A SENSE OF SIN
[85]  Another way to preach the gospel is to create a sense of sin in man.
[86]  We need to consider a few ways to preach about this matter.
[87]  In order for our preaching to create a sense of sin in an unbeliever, we have to show him the power of sin.
[88]  A man may feel that pride is his sin, but he may not feel that his pride is a transgression against God.
[89]  To an ordinary man, sinning is one thing and transgressing against God is another.
[90]  When we sin against a brother, we are transgressing against God.
[91]  The Bible shows us that David committed the sin of adultery and murder, but he realized that he had transgressed against God Himself.
[92]  If a man only has the sense of sin without a realization that he is transgressing against God, he is not qualified to be called a Christian.
[93]  Those who do not know God only consider sin to be sin; they do not know that it is a transgression against God.
[94]  When a sinner has a deep consciousness of sin, he realizes that sin is not only sin but a transgression against God.
[95]  In preaching the gospel, we have to bring the listeners to realize that they have not only sinned but that they also have transgressed against God through their sins.
[96]  Place: Kuling THINGS THAT AN AWAKENED SINNER SHOULD DO
[97]  How much truth should an awakened sinner understand, and what should he do in order to receive salvation?
[98]  The first thing we should do after a sinner is awakened is to show him the gift of God.
[99]  John 4:10 says, "If you knew the gift of God...you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water."
[100]  If we drag on with our preaching, however, we may not be able to push him to the Lord.
[101]  If we show them Matthew 11:28 instead, telling them that all those who are burdened can come to Him for rest, we are doing a foolish thing even though we are relating Scriptures to them.
[102]  He thinks that God cannot give anything for free, that man must do something and behave in certain ways before he can please God and earn His gift.
[103]  As far as we are concerned, we are not His children until He begets us, but as far as God's love is concerned, God treats all human beings like His own children, whether or not they are saved.
[104]  On God's side there is no problem being man's Father; the problem is on the sinner's side.
[105]  God is eager to dispense His grace to the world, but He is held back by man's sin.
[106]  Sin hinders God from dispensing His grace to man.
[107]  Isaiah 59:1-2 says, "Behold, Jehovah's hand is not so short that it cannot save; / Nor is His ear so heavy that it cannot hear.
[108]  / But your iniquities have become a separation / Between you and your God, / And your sins have hidden His face / From you so that He does not hear."
[109]  He meant that we have to feel the sins of the sinners; we have to feel as if their sins are our sins, and that together we have offended the Lord and rejected Him.
[110]  When we reach this point, a sinner will ask, "What should I do to be saved?"
[111]  First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
[112]  Although this verse is for Christians, in principle anyone who confesses his sins to God will receive His forgiveness.
[113]  After a man confesses his sins and reads God's Word, he has to believe in his heart.
[114]  Believing is trusting that God has done what He said He would do in His Word.
[115]  Faith means that a sinner believes that God has acted according to His word and has forgiven our sins through the blood of His Son and has washed away our unrighteousnesses.
[116]  The faith that we are speaking of here is not a general faith in the work that the Lord has accomplished but a faith that turns God's Word into accomplished facts immediately.
[117]  We can read Romans 10:9-10 and 13 to him, which says, "If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; for with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation....For whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.'"
[118]  The common concept is that these two things are very different, that is, that we are responsible for the condition of salvation while God is responsible for the result of salvation.
[119]  A man must be saved before he can be part of God's people, and he must be part of God's people before he is qualified to live the life of a child of God.
[120]  Read Acts 5:31-32 again: "This One God has exalted to His right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.
[121]  And we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him."
[122]  Here it clearly says that forgiveness and repentance are both given by God.
[123]  Man has a wrong concept; he thinks that repentance is something he does, while forgiveness is something God gives.
[124]  Second Peter 1:1 says, "Simon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have been allotted faith equally precious as ours in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ."
[125]  Here, however, it does not say that we offer our faith to God, but that God offers faith to us.
[126]  John 17:3 says, "This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ."
[127]  However, Matthew 11:27 says, "No one fully knows the Son except the Father."
[128]  For a man to know Jesus Christ, he must first have the revelation of the Father.
[129]  A man must come to the Son to receive life, but only those to whom the Father has chosen to reveal Himself will know the Son, and only those who know the Son will come to the Lord.
[130]  Do we know the Lord and then come to Him, or do we come to Him and then know Him?
[131]  Do we come to the Lord to receive eternal life, or do we receive eternal life to come to the Lord?
[132]  CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT HOW TO PREACH THE GOSPEL 9 Date: September 2, 1948
[133]  Question: What should we do when we encounter a person who does not want to accept salvation readily?
[134]  As long as a sinner exercises faith to touch the Lord, he receives grace, and once the Lord grants grace to a man, he is saved.
[135]  CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE A FEW THINGS THAT A WORKER
[136]  OF THE LORD SHOULD REMEMBER Date: July 23, 1948
[137]  I feel that we should let the brothers and sisters know as soon as possible about the way ahead of them.
[138]  If you do not have a clear guidance from the Lord, you should let us know as soon as possible.
[139]  There is the need for an immediate start in Wenchow.
[140]  Peking-Tientsin, Canton, and Swatow Hakka can wait for one or two months; they can join together to boost Wenchow first.
[141]  We can gather the brothers and sisters who have a heart to serve in Wenchow, train them for two or three weeks, and then send them out to different places for the work after the training.
[142]  We have to share with them the things we have seen in Kuling.
[143]  As for the translation of the New Testament, I think we need at least four different versions.
[144]  The first is a paraphrase version, in which we use our own words to express the text.
[145]  This is not a word-for-word translation, and its emphasis is on the overall meaning of the text.
[146]  CHAPTER FORTY-ONE HOW TO MANAGE AFFAIRS Date:September 13, 1948
[147]  In order to be a worker of the Lord, the first thing we have to learn is to manage affairs in a proper way.
[148]  Those who cannot manage affairs can never work for the Lord.
[149]  Second, before we touch any matter, we have to know that it is God who has placed us there, and that we have to put our heart to the task.
[150]  Fourth, in addition to being mindful of possible problems that one may encounter and counting the cost, one has to make constant decisions.
[151]  He has to be clear in his mind as to how he should place the right people in the right place, and what they should do.
[152]  For example, if we are going to leave the mountain now, we have to find out how many people need to leave on sedan chairs and how many chairs we now have.
[153]  Explaining things clearly and making the assignments is not enough.
[154]  Others should not only understand what to do, but they must also be given the opportunity to practice and make trial runs.
[155]  In the conversion of the three thousand and the five thousand in Acts 2 and 4 and in the outpouring of the Spirit in the house of Cornelius, the Bible does not say anything about the laying on of hands.
[156]  My position among God's children is quite unique and exceptional.
[157]  The churches and God's children have to bear the responsibility for such uniqueness.
[158]  Here we are training those who are already on the way, who are involved in the work, and who are taking some responsibility in the church.
[159]  CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR A TALK WITH THE CO-WORKERS Date:October 1948
[160]  Place:Brother Nee's home, Foochow OUR ATTITUDE TOWARD GOD'S CHILDREN
[161]  In the Shanghai Concession the area ceded to foreign powers and in Hong Kong a British colony , a foreign man can be deported for committing certain crimes.
[162]  If a Chinese commits the same crime on Chinese soil, he cannot be treated the same way because he is standing on different ground.
[163]  A person often measures the value of something according to the amount of knowledge he has of it.
[164]  Before a person believes in the Lord this is especially true with poor people , the daily thoughts that plague him are for his daily necessities.
[165]  But as soon as a person believes in the Lord, he turns to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.
[166]  Matthew 16:26 says, "For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life?"
[167]  Job 22:23-28 says, "If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up./If you put injustice far away from your tents,/And place your gold nuggets in the dust/And your gold of Ophir in the stones of the brooks,/Then the Almighty will be your gold nuggets/And precious silver to you./For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty,/And you will lift up your countenance to God./You will pray to Him, and He will hear you;/And you will repay your vows./You will also decree something, and it will be established for you;/And light will shine on your ways."
[168]  If we are tested at such a critical juncture, and we are asked to choose between gold nuggets, the gold of Ophir, the precious silver, and Jehovah, which one will we choose?
[169]  CHAPTER FORTY-SIX DEALING WITH TEMPER SALVATION EFFECTING A CHANGE
[170]  After a man is saved, he should experience a definite change in his disposition as well as in his conduct.
[171]  If a man has been a Christian for many years and yet has not experienced any change in his temper, he will lose his testimony before the Gentiles and the church.
[172]  We have to tell new ones that the Bible does not pay much attention to temper because temper is not a sickness; it is merely a symptom of a sickness.
[173]  When we lose our temper, we may think of this verse, but it does not do us any good because this verse deals with the root of the sickness, not the symptom.
[174]  The fourth expression of the self is a love for material things.
[175]  Some people not only love themselves; they love material things.
[176]  CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN HOW TO DISTRIBUTE TRACTS THE IMPORTANCE OF DISTRIBUTING TRACTS
[177]  Today we will consider the matter of distributing tracts.
[178]  First, we have to know the importance of distributing tracts.
[179]  The third advantage of tracts is that they are not intimidated by human factors or the surrounding atmosphere.
[180]  In large and well-prepared gospel meetings, a preacher can stand on the podium to speak solemnly of such serious subjects as sin and judgment.
[181]  But if he gives out a tract which says, "We are all sinners, and we have all sinned before God; we all need Jesus," the other party can more easily receive it.
[182]  The seventh advantage of tracts is that they enable all believers to function.
[183]  God has given to the church apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.
[184]  After realizing the importance of tract distribution, we have to consider the methods of passing out tracts.
[185]  We have to pray 1 that God would bless those who receive the tracts; 2 that God would not allow the tracts to be destroyed; 3 that God would allow the tracts to be passed along; 4 that God would save everyone whose hand has touched the tract; and 5 that God would extend the days of the tracts.
[186]  CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT FORGIVING OUR BROTHER Scripture Reading: Matt 18:21-35
[187]  Today we will consider the matter of offense and forgiveness among Christians.
[188]  After we have believed in the Lord, we have to settle one question: What should we do when a brother has sinned against us?
[189]  In Matthew 18:21-22 the Lord Jesus told us that if a brother sins against us, we must not only forgive him once but seventy times seven times.
[190]  Matthew 18:21 says, "Then Peter came and said to Him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him?
[191]  After He answered Peter, the Lord went on with a parable in verses 23 through 27: "For this reason the kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who desired to settle accounts with his slaves.
[192]  And when he began to settle them, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.
[193]  But since he did not have the means to repay, the master commanded him to be sold, as well as his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment to be made.
[194]  The gospel is God granting salvation to man according to His own pleasure; it is God bestowing His abundant mercy and forgiveness upon the sinner.
[195]  After a person is saved, he has to deal with the matter of his country.
[196]  Although this is a secular issue, it is very important to the individual walk of a Christian.
[197]  The Gospel of Luke tells us of two brothers who came to the Lord for help in dividing their possessions, but the Lord refused to do it 12:13-14 .
[198]  A CHRISTIAN'S POSITION ON EARTH In the Kingdom of His Beloved
[199]  Just as Christ maintained His position on earth, a Christian should do the same.
[200]  Everything the Lord avoided in this world should be avoided by Christians, and everything that the Lord partook of in this world should be shared by Christians.
[201]  THE STATE AND THE EXISTING POLITICAL SYSTEM Not Becoming Rulers
[202]  A Christian should not be a ruler on this earth.
[203]  A Christian should have only one goal, which is to maintain his spiritual walk and to uphold God's grace in this age.
[204]  The Lord shows us through His commandments that a Christian should act in grace, not according to righteousness.
[205]  There is a basic difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament in the matter of going to war.
[206]  CHAPTER FIFTY WAITING FOR THE LORD'S RETURN Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:7; 1 Thes 1:9-10; Phil 3:20; Titus 2:11-13 THE SCRIPTURAL TEACHING
[207]  According to the Scriptural teaching, the Lord came once in the flesh; He died for us on the cross to satisfy God's righteousness and then resurrected and ascended to be our High Priest.
[208]  He is now interceding for us before God and acting on our behalf as our Executor and Guarantor.
[209]  The Old Testament says that when the Lord comes back again there will be no more sin on earth Isa 2:11 .
[210]  The Lord Himself said, "I go to prepare a place for you....I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, so that where I am you also may be" John 14:2b, 3 .
[211]  Acts 1:11 says that when the Lord was taken up to heaven, two angels declared, "This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you beheld Him going into heaven."
[212]  In His first coming, the Lord became flesh and was crucified on the cross for man's sin, giving man the power to overcome sin and to draw near to God.
[213]  Man receives the power of life, but this power is only half of the story, because he is only delivered from sin.
[214]  The life that he has received is a life that delivers, but it does not deal with sin itself; sin itself has not been annihilated.
[215]  Hence, we can say that the first coming of the Lord liberates us, that is, we are liberated from sin.
[216]  This world has many fundamental problems that man cannot solve.
[217]  They can only be resolved when the Lord comes again.
[218]  Sixth, when the Lord comes back, He will deal with all the establishments that induce man to sin.
[219]  On the one hand, man sins because he has a sinful nature within him.
[220]  CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE MARTYRDOM Scripture Reading:Rev 2 3 THE CHURCH IN SMYRNA
[221]  Revelation is a book given by the Lord Jesus "to His slaves" 1:1 .
[222]  If a new one asks why there must be martyrdom, we should tell him that the world hates the Lord for no reason John 15:25 .
[223]  Matthew 10:22 tells us that believers will be hated by men because of the Lord's name.
[224]  In Acts 20:24 Paul said, "I consider my life of no account as if precious to myself, in order that I may finish my course and the ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus to solemnly testify of the gospel of the grace of God."
[225]  Ignatius accepted the gospel after hearing it from John in Antioch.
[226]  He was put into prison for preaching it to the Roman emperor.
[227]  Persecutions from the Roman Catholic Church A Graduate from Cambridge University
[228]  When he was about to give up his last breath, he shouted, "Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus," and committed his soul to the Lord.
[229]  When this brother was brought before the judge, the judge tried to persuade him to recant his faith.
[230]  But he said to the judge, "I have told you all that I wanted to say.
[231]  His friends tried to persuade him to change his decision, but he said, "I cannot change what I have said.
[232]  And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and of those who had not worshipped the beast nor his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years."
[233]  It tells us that "the Holy Church charges all men to reserve a special place of worship for Mary"; a man can receive many things from Mary which he cannot receive from God, because as Chapter VIII, Section I says, "Mary delivers her Clients from Hell."
[234]  Chapter VI, Section III says that Mary is a Messenger of peace, that she is a "Peace-maker between Sinners and God....Many times we receive answer to our prayer quicker by invoking Mary's name than by invoking Jesus' name....She is our salvation, our life, our hope, our counselor, our hiding place, and our trust."
[235]  The book mentions a story: A little bird was once taught to say the words "sea gulls" and was told that these words mean "all hail Mary."
[236]  Revelation 17:6 says, "And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus."
[237]  It is a gruesome thing to drink human blood until one is drunk, but this is the very characteristic of the Roman Catholic Church.
[238]  In 1848 someone discovered a great building in the city of Rome which was full of human bones.
[239]  In Revelation 2:9 the Lord says, "I know your tribulation and poverty but you are rich and the slander from those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan."
[240]  One of the sufferings of the church in Smyrna is the slander from those who call themselves Jews.
[241]  According to Romans 2:28-29 and John 8:39-47, all those who believe in the Lord Jesus sincerely from their heart are the true Jews.
[242]  The Judaizers are those who have come into the church but have not genuinely believed in the Lord and His salvation.
[243]  First, we have to realize that God did not give the law to the Gentiles; He only gave it to the nation of Israel.
[244]  Psalm 147:19-20 says, "He declares His word to Jacob,/His statutes and His ordinances to Israel./He has not dealt so with any other nation;/And as for His ordinances, they have not known them."
[245]  Concerning the Gentiles, Romans 2:14 in the New Testament says that the "Gentiles, who have no law, do by nature the things of the law, these, though they have no law, are a law to themselves."
[246]  Some new believers may ask, "Since the law is a bondage to man, why did God give this law to man in the first place?"
[247]  First, we have to realize that the law is not God's original thought; it was added later.
[248]  Verse 17 says, "A covenant previously ratified by God, the law, having come four hundred and thirty years after, does not annul so as to make the promise of none effect."
[249]  Some ask, "It is true that we are saved by Christ and not by the law.
[250]  But after we are saved, should we not keep the law?"
[251]  In verse 8 Paul spoke a strong word: "If even we or an angel out of heaven should announce to you a gospel beyond that which we have announced to you, let him be accursed."
[252]  After we receive the new life, we should realize that the righteousness of the law can be ours without trying to keep the law.
[253]  Romans 8:4 says, "That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit."
[254]  Since we have received life in the spirit, we do not need to gain the righteousness of the law through keeping the law.
[255]  Galatians 4:9 says, "But now, having come to know God, or rather having been known by God, how is it that you turn again to the weak and poor elements, to which you desire to be enslaved yet again?"
[256]  Romans 7:4 says, "So then, my brothers, you also have been made dead to the law through the body of Christ so that you might be joined to another, to Him who has been raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God."
[257]  In Colossians 2:13-14 he said, "And you, though dead in your offenses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our offenses; wiping out the handwriting in ordinances, which was against us, which was contrary to us; and He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross."
[258]  One cannot say that both those who commit adultery and those who do not commit adultery are all right, and that those who commit it commit it to the Lord and those who do not commit it do not commit it to the Lord.
[259]  CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR THE JUDAIZERS 2 THE JUDAIZERS' ERROR
[260]  CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE THE JUDAIZERS 3 THE JUDAIZERS' ERRONEOUS CONCEPT
[261]  In summary there are three basic errors with the Judaizers.
[262]  In the epistle to the church in Thyatira in Revelation, there is a self-proclaimed prophetess called Jezebel.
[263]  The Church teaches that a man can wash away his sins and receive the Lord through baptism, but the Bible says that a man receives baptism only after he has received the Lord.
[264]  Third, the Roman Catholic Church believes in the absolute power of the priest to forgive sins.
[265]  It bases its teaching on John 20:23: "Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whosever sins you retain, they are retained."
[266]  Concerning the sacrament, the same council quoted Philippians 2 which says that the Lord Jesus was obedient unto death, even the death of the cross v. 8 . The Catholic Church declares that in the holy mass, the Lord's obedience is so extraordinary that He becomes not only obedient to the Father but to men as well.
[267]  He is willing to come down from heaven and to remain on the altar in obedience to man.
[268]  It says that in the sacrament, the Lord lies still and allows men to carry Him to the righteous as well as to the sinners.
[269]  Actually, when the Lord said that His flesh is food, He was referring to receiving His life, not to the bread in His supper.
[270]  I would like to fellowship some concerning our work and service.
