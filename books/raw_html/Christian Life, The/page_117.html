<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>X. THE ANOINTING SPIRIT&#151;THE COMPOUND SPIRIT<br>WITH ALL HIS INGREDIENTS (ELEMENTS)<br>BECOMING THE ANOINTING OINTMENT<br>FOR THE ANOINTING OF ALL THE THINGS<br>AND PERSONS THAT ARE OF GOD AND FOR GOD</H2><P>It was with the compound ointment that the tabernacle and all its utensils and Aaron and all the priests were anointed (Exo. 30:26-33). Psalm 133 refers to this anointing ointment. Isaiah 61:1 says, "The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon Me,/Because the Lord hath anointed Me...." In Luke 4:18 the Lord Jesus quoted this verse, showing that the anointing of Christ was by the Spirit. This can help us to realize that the anointing ointment signifies the anointing Spirit. Second Corinthians 1:21 says that God has anointed us, and 1 John 2:20 and 27 say that we all have received the divine anointing, the all-inclusive anointing, which teaches us in everything. The compound Spirit with all His ingredients (elements) becomes the anointing ointment for the anointing of all the things and persons that are of God and for God. The tabernacle with its furniture and the priests were of God and for God, so they were all anointed. Today the church with the saints has been anointed by this compound Spirit.</P><P>By all this we can see that the compound ointment in Exodus 30 is a type of the compound Spirit. God as the Spirit is typified by the one hin of olive oil, and this God has been compounded with Christ's divinity, humanity, with His death and its sweet effectiveness, and with His resurrection and its fragrant power. Today all these elements are in the compound Spirit. When we are filled with the Spirit, we have the deep feeling that we have been crucified. Furthermore, when we are filled with the Spirit, we have the deep feeling that we are resurrected. This tells us that within the filling Spirit are Christ's death and Christ's resurrection.</P><P>The Spirit today is an all-inclusive drink (1 Cor. 12:13; 10:4). This can be compared to a drink composed of water, tea, lemon, honey, and salt. This drink is a "compound" drink, a compound of five elements. When we drink this all-inclusive drink, we receive the elements of water, tea, lemon, honey, and salt. Likewise, when we drink the all-inclusive Spirit, we receive all of His elements into our being. This all-inclusive Spirit is God processed and consummated. He is the consummated Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God.</P>
