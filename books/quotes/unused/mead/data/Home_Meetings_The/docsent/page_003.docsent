   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY OF TODAY S CHRISTIANITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The God-ordained way lasted a very short time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Right after the departure of all the apostles, this way began to wane and by the second century, according to my knowledge of church history, was altogether given up.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church by the second century picked up the congregational way according to the worldly way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As a result they needed the big evangelists.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They formed monasteries, ancient seminaries, to train people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today Christianity s existence depends upon the seminaries.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without the seminaries, where could they get preachers?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There would be no place to get the people trained to preach or teach.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then all these trained and taught preachers and teachers became the clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then through clergy, hierarchy has been built up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is today s organized Christianity, and this is the organizational way of today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all hate hierarchy and reject the clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But unconsciously even today to some extent clergy creeps in among us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am afraid that even while we have been talking about meeting in the homes we do not have a meeting in every home but rather in a selected way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some might have said already, We don t have that many big speakers, do we?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To have a big hall with a big number of people coming together with a big speaker is the Christianity way to worship God today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They do not see how the home meetings are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This God-invented way was altogether lost by Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Zinzendorf, three centuries ago, began to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was quite good in a sense.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But Zinzendorf did not say anything about the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then after Zinzendorf, one century later, the Brethren were raised up in England.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They paid much attention to the way to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They wrote books on this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I was young I was with them for seven and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I never heard the term home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every week I attended five meetings among them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the time I went to that one meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They only met in that one meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They never met in any other s home.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord in these days has shown us the lack, the loss, and the damage we have been suffering by missing the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The big speakers with big congregations could only bring in people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no way for the big congregations to build up the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>BUILDING THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THROUGH THE SMALL GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The way to build the church may be illustrated by the building of this hall.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we built this hall I gave a rough design and the brothers made the drawings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every day in the early morning, I was watching and observing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One brother was the purchaser.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He collected all the materials.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Trucks of materials came.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we had only one brother to collect and pile up all the materials on the ground for nine years, they would be ruined.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To collect the materials is one thing, but to get all the materials built together is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Look at this building today.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this hall you cannot see one individual piece of material.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You can only see one building.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Another brother was directing every group.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At that time we had over eighty full-timers whom this brother formed into groups.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One group made the stairway, and a group of sisters sanded the handrails on the stairway.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They were all grouped together to do a certain part for the building and eventually to put all the pieces together.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now we are enjoying the building.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the early days of the church life, when the apostles were first raised up by the Lord, they built the church in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was very quick.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The church in Jerusalem was built up.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Acts 9:31 says, So the church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being built up.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In a short time they were all built up.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Could we say that all the churches in the U.S.A. have been built up?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You cannot say that we have been built up because we have never taken the building way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What is the building way?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Small groups!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Home meetings!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The big speakers are useful.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Peter was useful.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Peter spoke to the big congregations and his speaking brought in thousands of people.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But that was only one side.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There was another side.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They met in their homes, in their houses, from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There was no time for them to train preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There was no time for them to learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They had heard only one message and that message was their New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>On the day of Pentecost their New Testament was so short, just one message given by Peter in Acts 2.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But everybody heard that, everybody learned of that, and everybody spoke that.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>On the day Peter spoke the message they all got baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then I believe that night they went back home and began to meet, repeating what they had heard from Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I believe this shows that everybody can teach and everybody can preach.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you open up your home for meetings, you will feel there are some things there that need to be cleared up.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, if you do not open up your home, you will leave those things there, maybe for three years.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You will come to the big congregations without any feeling about those black, dark things.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you would open up your home, you would consider before you lose your temper with your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You would think that after half an hour all the saints will come to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is just something on the negative side, but there are a lot of benefits, a lot of blessings, on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When saints come into your home they all come in with God; they all come in with Christ; they all come in with a lot of prayer to bless your home.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>One will step in and say, Lord, bless this home.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>And another one will say, Bless this family.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Lord, remember them all.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Lord will answer the prayers, and there will be much blessing for you.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>You may say you are so weak, but if you will open up your home, many will come in who are not so weak.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You may be poor, but those who come are rich.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The home meeting will rescue you, strengthen you, and enrich you.</S>
