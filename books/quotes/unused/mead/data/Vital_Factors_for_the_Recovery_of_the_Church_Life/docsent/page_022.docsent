   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The All-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ Imparting Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Spirit who is operating in us is the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ, and He is operating in us in seven ways.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, He is within us imparting His divine life to us 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He imparts His divine life into our being in the same way that water flows through a garden hose.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The more water we use, the more water flows into the hose.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is a bountiful supply of water which flows out without our effort; we simply turn on the water hose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Likewise, in order to receive the supply of the Spirit, you simply need to turn to the operating Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He will flow in you as the divine life and impart life into you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Bearing the Fruit of Virtues</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Second, the Spirit bears in us the fruit of all human and divine virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Galatians 5:22-23 says that the Spirit within us is bearing many kinds of divine virtues, such as love, joy, and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All these divine and human virtues are brought forth by this life-imparting Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Freeing the Believers from the Bondage</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>of Dead Letters</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This Spirit also sets us free from dead letters and from dead knowledge 2 Cor 3:6, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Apart from the Spirit within us we may know many doctrines, but in a dead way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more we learn doctrine in a dead way, the more we become bound by dead knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only the Spirit can set us free from dead knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Freeing the Believers from the</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Law of Sin and of Death</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the same time, this life-giving Spirit sets us free from the law of sin and of death Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In our sinful nature there is a law, a natural power, of sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By ourselves we are unable to deal with it, but when we give ourselves to the Spirit, the life-giving Spirit sets us free from this binding law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Transforming the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>into the Image of Christ from Glory to Glory</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This Spirit also transforms us into the image of Christ from glory to glory 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whether we are good or bad, our being is still natural.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Anything that is natural is of no worth to God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, we all need to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To be transformed is not merely to change our character outwardly; it is to be changed in life by the divine element from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a metabolic change in which the old things are being discharged and all the new elements are being added.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all are now undergoing this kind of metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The life-giving Spirit is changing us, transforming us from within, not merely to correct us, but to change us metabolically with His divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we are being transformed into the same image of the Lord from glory to glory, that is, from one level of glory to another.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church life should be filled with this kind of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Renewing the Believers for the New Man</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The life-giving Spirit is also renewing us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because we all were born in the old creation, we all are old regardless of our age.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even little children are old.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we need the divine life, a new life with a new element.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This life-giving Spirit is now renewing us with the divine life and with the divine essence Rom 12:2; Eph 4:23-24; Col 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Building the Believers Together to Be the Habitation of God</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Finally, the Spirit is building us together to be the habitation of God Eph 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we are being transformed and renewed, spontaneously we are being built together to be the habitation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This habitation is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church life is simply all the saints built up by the renewing Spirit to be God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>With the Bountiful Supply of the Unsearchable Riches of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For this seven-fold operation of the Spirit, there is always in this Spirit the full, bountiful supply of the unsearchable riches of Christ Phil 1:19; Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not say that we cannot make it, that we are weak, or that we have many shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should forget about all this and realize what the Spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are weak, but the Spirit is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are poor, but He is rich.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we cooperate with Him, He supplies us with all His bountiful supply.</S>
