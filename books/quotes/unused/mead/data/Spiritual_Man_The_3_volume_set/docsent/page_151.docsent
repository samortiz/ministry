   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INTUITION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The body has its senses, and the spirit also has its senses.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The spirit dwells in the body and has a very close relationship with the body; nevertheless, it is completely different from the body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The body has various senses, but a spiritual man can detect that which is beyond his physical senses.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is another sense in the innermost part of his being which can rejoice, grieve, fear, approve, condemn, determine, and discern.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These are the senses of the spirit which are distinct from the senses of the soul expressed through the body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The senses and functions of the spirit can be seen from the following verses:</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"The spirit is willing" Matt 26:41 .</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"His spirit was provoked within him as he beheld that the city was full of idols" Acts 17:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"This man was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in spirit" Acts 18:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Paul purposed in his spirit" Acts 19:21 .</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Burning in spirit" Rom 12:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"For who among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man which is in him?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1 Cor 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"I will sing with the spirit" 1 Cor 14:15 .</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"Your love in the Spirit" Col 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now we can see how keen the sense of man's spirit is and how numerous its functions are.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible does not say man's heart senses and functions in this way, but his spirit does sense or function in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must read the above verses very carefully to realize that the human spirit possesses all these functions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After thoroughly reading them, we will see that the functions and senses of the human spirit are as inclusive as those of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whether it is thoughts, decisions, or feelings, as long as it is something that the soul has, the spirit has it also.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This shows us how important it is to learn to distinguish the spiritual from the soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As a believer passes through the deep work of the cross and Holy Spirit, he gradually becomes experienced and knows what is of the soul and what is of the spirit.</S>
