   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we thank You for Your mercy and for Your grace.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Lord, without Your mercy, we could not have gone on up to this day.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Lord, we need Your forgiveness, Your washing away of all our dirt and defects with Your blood.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Lord, we can stand here before You not on our perfection but on the blood that overcomes the accuser.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We trust in Your mercy, and we trust in Your blood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, this morning give us another chance for fellowship that we would be open to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are open to You.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, come and fellowship with us, and grant us Your fellowship that we may have the freedom to fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, give us understanding and save us from any kind of misunderstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, give us a clear word, a clear understanding, and a clear receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>May nothing be stumbling.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, save us from making mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is so easy for us to make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lord, in our being there is the capacity to always make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We trust in You to deliver us that we may learn how to reject, how to deny, ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I hope that you would keep the outline of this message in front of you, hanging it on your wall or standing it on your desk.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You should read it once a day for a month.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the previous message we covered the first part of my word of love.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In that part we covered four matters: ambition, pride, self-justification and exposing others failures and defects, and not conforming to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To conform to the death of Christ relates to the self, the natural man, and the disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must deny our self, condemn our natural life, and forget about our disposition by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Self, the natural life or the natural man, and disposition by birth are like three evil brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all have our own disposition by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One person may have been born a quick person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His quickness is his disposition, and his quick disposition is by his birth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He did not learn it; he was simply born that way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Another person may be a slow person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He also did not learn his slowness from others; his slow disposition is by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the fourth gopher.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These four gophers ambition, pride, self-justification, and the self, that is, the natural man in our disposition by birth are destroying us every day.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have realized this through many years of experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have been with the saints, serving the Lord since He raised me up to speak for Him in 1932.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At that time, a little church was raised up through me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I could not reject my responsibility to take care of that church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>So from that year, sixty-four years ago, I began to be with the serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In these sixty-four years I have seen many things, I have gone through many things, I have experienced many things, and I have suffered quite much.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I have suffered from others ambition, pride, self-justification, self, natural man, and disposition by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our history spans not only sixty-four years but nearly two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have experienced some things myself, and I have come to know the same things through my study of church history and the biographies and autobiographies of spiritual giants.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nearly all the biographies are helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I read George M ller s autobiography.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Actually, that is his daily diary, the daily record of his living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is a very helpful book, and I received much help from it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I also read the biography of Hudson Taylor, which was written by his daughter-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That also was very helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, all the biographies and autobiographies are small windows through which I can see these four gophers ambition, pride, self-justification, and the biggest one, our natural man, our self involved with our natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The outcome of all these four gophers is division.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These, not other things, are the real sources of all the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hudson Taylor was a young missionary sent to China.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He was working in Ningpo in the Chekiang province along the coast.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After returning to England, as he was sitting by the seashore looking toward the east, he could not forget China.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>While he was sitting and praying, the Lord burdened him to go back to China, but not to the coast.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Nearly all the missions in China were only along the coast.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord burdened him to go inland, to the interior.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>That was wonderful, but Hudson Taylor still had his defects.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He declared and proclaimed that the churches established by his missionaries were not denominational; therefore, they did not have a name.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>That was true, but they still called themselves the churches of the China Inland Mission.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all have defects.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Martin Luther was great, but his defect was also great.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At first he was a hero, but eventually he was not a hero.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He was afraid of persecution by the Catholic Church, so he relied upon the king of Germany.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>That defect initiated the beginning of the so-called national churches, the churches of a nation, especially in Northern Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There are the Church of Germany, the Church of Denmark, the Church of Sweden, the Church of Norway, the Church of England, and the Church of Holland.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All those national churches take their king or queen as the head of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The head of the Church of England today is the queen.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Strictly speaking, whether you are Chinese, American, or German, to be an Episcopalian is to be a British subject.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Today in Germany every citizen has to pay a church tax to the government.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Luther, a great hero, made a great mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I saw all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Among us, Brother Nee took the lead to read all these books.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He exhaustively collected all the church histories, autobiographies, and biographies of the spiritual giants.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In this way, he collected all the views and could make a conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I received much help from Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I also have personally been in many situations, contacting the saints, both the saints in the denominations and the saints in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I have seen a good number of Chinese preachers who gained a name, who became famous, and many of them came into the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>On the one hand, they knew that the recovery had the truth, and they were right according to the truths that the recovery holds.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>On the other hand, these four gophers destroyed them, and not one has remained.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Some remained for a period of time, but eventually they all left.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The history among us proves that those who became somewhat capable, possessing a certain spiritual capacity, eventually became a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Soon after I first came to this country, we held the first summer training on the matter of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>A certain brother who was a traveling Southern Baptist preacher came to every meeting to listen to the messages.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He was convinced and, in a sense, was captivated.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He left the Southern Baptist Church and came among us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It was he who first brought me to Texas in 1963.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The doors in Texas were opened through him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The first meetings we held there were in the small town of Tyler.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>There were about five hundred people who came to listen to me, including some leading ones, and they accepted my teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>They said, This is right.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We must be this kind of local church.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I stayed there for a short time, and while I was in New York, they called me and asked me to return.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They said, We have many here who are ready to meet as the local church, and we do not know how to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Please come to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I went back to them, and I stayed in the home of a rich man, whose wife was very eloquent and active in loving the Lord, but eventually I realized that they were not the ones who could take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The first group of people the Lord Jesus called did not have doctoral degrees; they were not like Nicodemus.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>According to the record of the New Testament, Nicodemus is mentioned only three times.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He was probably not among the one hundred twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The first three of the twelve apostles Peter, John, and James were Galilean fishermen.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Eventually, the one who brought me to Texas only stayed with us for six years, from 1963 to 1969.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>In 1969 he wanted to start his own way, using my teachings, especially from The Tree of Life.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Even though he started his own way, he still came occasionally to Elden Hall to pick up our outlines and to see what I was putting out.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I gave him a small warning, but that was all.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>He is still active today.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>I have seen many such things.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Now you have been brought into the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We thank the Lord for this, but if you do not cooperate with the Lord to deal with ambition, pride, and self-justification, and if you are not conformed to the death of Christ, the outcome among us will be division.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In 1964 in Los Angeles we met several different groups of people.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>One was a Pentecostal group, and one was an inner-life group that followed the teaching of T. Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>After they heard my messages, the leaders of these groups implored me, saying, Brother Lee, now we realize the way we should take.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Let us come together to practice the Body life according to Romans 12.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>I said that this was wonderful, but if they were to practice Romans 12, they should not forget Romans 14.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>That was the first time this word on this subject issued forth from my mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>I told them that if anyone wants to practice Romans 12 concerning the Body of Christ, they have to be reminded of Romans 14.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>In Romans 14 Paul was very liberal.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>According to Paul, we must receive all believers, whether they keep the Sabbath, the seventh day, or the Lord s Day, and regardless of what kind of food they eat, whether they are vegetarian or eat meat.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We must receive them because God has received them.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>This is to be very general.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>They said, We will do it.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We will be general.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Therefore, we started to meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Afterward, I had to go to New York to attend an interview with the immigration office for my permanent residence, and when I returned, some of them came to me.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>One said, Brother Lee, a certain young sister in our meeting plays the tambourine.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>I cannot take that.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>This brother said that he approved of playing the piano.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>I asked him, In the eyes of God what is the difference between a piano and a tambourine?</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>He admitted that there is no difference.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>I said, If you can accept the piano, why can t you accept the tambourine?</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>One by one others came to me in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Generally speaking, there have been only two or three occasions of rebellion among us, but in actuality, there have been many.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>One brother who was very close to me often traveled with me, and he opened his home to me as if it were my own.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>However, when I began to have the life-study trainings in which I released thirty messages, he became dissenting.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>He could not agree with this way.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>He started to have the Lord s table with young children, serving them the table in his home, and he claimed that his way was the right way to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Eventually, he also gave up the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>I have seen many things like this.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Now you can see why I want to give you this word of love.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>You must beware of four things: ambition, pride, self-justification, and the self, the natural man, the disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Every human being is a self-justifying person.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>We only know to justify ourselves; it is very hard to recognize others perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>We were all born this way, but we must not let this gopher remain within us.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>We must reject our self-justification.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>This is the first group of problems in the church life.</S>
