   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AN EXAMPLE OF PERFECTING THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Here is a practical example.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>During the years that I served in the church in Chefoo, I devoted my attention, my heart, and my time to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My home was next door to the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every morning I went to the hall at eight and worked on various things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I went home at noon for lunch and a brief rest and then returned to the hall.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before the evening meeting I went home for dinner, after which I returned to the meeting hall and stayed there until ten o clock at night.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I did this seven days a week without any holidays.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nevertheless, none of the church affairs were in my hand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>During the Sino-Japanese War, I was arrested and put into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After my release from prison, I contracted a serious illness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I was bedridden for more than a year in Chefoo, and later I left Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I was able to leave because nothing was in my hand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There was nothing for me to hand over to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>During that time one brother was a deacon, and another brother was learning to be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every day we were together to work on the saints and do things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, we were able to perfect the saints and produce some useful ones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every Monday, beginning from eight in the morning, we trained the saints who did visitations, and sometimes the training would last until three o clock in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Three groups of saints did visitations: elders, deacons, and co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We came together with these saints, not to discuss things but to study how to visit the other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, a co-worker would say that he was burdened for a brother who met with us but was having problems.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We would then study the situation of the brother to know how best to handle it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We also considered who would be the most suitable person to handle the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This meeting lasted from eight in the morning until three in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These elders, deacons, and co-workers received practical perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There was a brother in the church in Chefoo who was the director of a hospital run by the Presbyterian denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He had a heart for the Lord and occasionally came to the meetings, but he had not yet taken this way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We had a burden for him and considered when to visit him, how to visit him, who should visit him, and what to say to him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We considered all these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>During that time we learned much concerning how to visit the saints, and the Lord s presence was with us in that training.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One brother had a burden for this director and visited him often.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On two different occasions the brother suggested that we visit the director, but we did not feel that it was the right time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After a period of time he suggested that we visit the director again, and we all responded positively and felt to visit the director that afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This time of fellowship was wonderful, and we saw the practical operation of the Holy Spirit in our fellowship concerning the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We also decided who should go.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Everyone felt that two brothers and I should go.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I had never contacted the director before, but the fellowship was that I should be one of the brothers to visit him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Something wonderful indeed took place that day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The assistant to the director was also a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we came to the hospital, this assistant told us that we had come at the right time because the director had a dream the night before in which he saw me drawing a picture of an ear on a blackboard.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The director was deeply impressed by this dream, and all morning long he considered the dream and hoped that the Lord would send Brother Lee to him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>So when the assistant told him that two brothers and I were there to visit him, he was excited.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we met him, he told us of his dream.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Based on Job, I explained that our ears were made to listen to God s words 33:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all realized that the Lord had sent me to open the director s ear so that he might hear the Lord s words.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The next Lord s Day he came to participate in the table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The meeting was filled with praises, and the atmosphere was very high.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In that meeting the brother had a turn, and he has taken this way ever since then.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The elders and co-workers need to spend time and make an effort to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is convenient to do things by ourselves, but mothers know that patience and time are needed to teach children to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The effort we make is not in vain, because apprentices are produced, and the saints are perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Regrettably, we have not been willing to take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We always look for a quick and easy way and avoid the difficult aspect of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Most of us take the easy way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some do not know how to teach others, because they themselves never learned.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It takes time and effort to teach; it also takes time and effort to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are not desperate to have a spirit of learning, and as a result, we have learned things in a shallow way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In order to learn, we must study.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is easy to perform routine tasks, but specialized tasks require learning.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our specialized task is to learn how to work with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Working with the saints is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The co-workers have been serving together for many years and are able to give messages on any topic.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, in order to give a message that touches the saints, they must make an effort.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This principle applies to everything we do.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A person who is casual in running a business will not make any profit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In order to make a profit, he must make an effort.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The co-workers are serving diligently but with little result.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If they want results, they must resolve to learn and make an effort to teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When the co-workers can perfect the saints to be elders or deacons, there will be results.</S>
