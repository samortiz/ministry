<h1 class="title">SECTION I</h1><h1 class=title>The Divine Dispensing of the Divine Trinity and Its Results</h1><h1 class=msg>CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</h1><h1 class="title">OUTLINE AND SCRIPTURE READING</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The Divine Trinity—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The Father expressed in the Son—the Son being the embodiment of the Father—John 14:8-11.<br><br>	John 14:8-11<br>	Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us. (9) Jesus said to him, Am I so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father. How is it that you say, Show us the Father? (10) Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works. (11) Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me; but if not, believe Me because of the works themselves.</li>	<li>The Son realized as the Spirit—the Spirit being the reality of the Son—John 14:16-20.<br><br>	John 14:16-20<br>	And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; (17) even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you. (18) I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you. (19) Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you shall live also. (20) In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.</li>	</ol></li><li>The accomplishment of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The Triune God becoming the flesh, dispensing Himself as grace and reality to man—John 1:1, 14, 16.<br><br>	John 1:1<br>	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br><br>	John 1:14<br>	And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us…full of grace and reality.<br><br>	John 1:16<br>	For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.</li>	<li>The Triune God dispensing the Son as eternal life to His believers—John 3:16.<br><br>	John 3:16<br>	For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.</li>	<li>The Son dying to release the divine life and to dispense it to all the members of His Body—John 12:24.<br><br>	John 12:24<br>	Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</li>	<li>The Son resurrecting to be transfigured as the Spirit to be the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, that the Triune God may be dispensed into the believers—John 20:8-9, 19, 22.<br><br>	John 20:8-9<br>	Then therefore the other disciple also, who came first to the tomb, entered, and he saw and believed. (9) For as yet they did not know the Scripture, that He must rise from among the dead.<br><br>	John 20:19<br>	When therefore it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them, Peace be to you.<br><br>	John 20:22<br>	And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.</li>	<li>The Son being above all, inheriting all, and being sent from God to speak God’s word, and dispensing the Spirit without measure—John 3:31-36.<br><br>	John 3:31-36<br>	He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth is of the earth and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all. (32) What He has seen and heard, of this He testifies, and no one receives His testimony. (33) He who receives His testimony has sealed that God is true. (34) For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for He gives the Spirit not by measure. (35) The Father loves the Son, and has given all into His hand. (36) He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.</li>	</ol></li></ol>
