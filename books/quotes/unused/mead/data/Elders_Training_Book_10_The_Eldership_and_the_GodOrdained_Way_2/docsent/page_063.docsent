   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Practical Truth</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This kind of great effort and promotion should be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To unite the saints and the churches around a certain leader and organization is to build up a hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There has never been such a thing in the Lord's recovery from its beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, this does not mean that there is no need for a proper leadership under the Lord that brings the divine revelation to the Lord's people and keeps the Lord's interest from suffering the damage of confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the New Testament revelation, in the church the elders take the lead Heb 13:24; Rom 12:8 , and in the ministry Peter took the lead in the Lord's work among the Jews Gal 2:7b , and Paul took the lead in the Lord's work among the Gentiles Gal 2:7a; Rom 11:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without the proper leadership under the Lord, the kingdom of God on the earth today would become an anarchy.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Dissenting Accusation</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>the Pressuring of All the Saints and the Churches to Conform to the Ministry in Full Uniformity</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"There has been much pressure with full expectation that all the saints and the churches will conform to the burden of the ministry and be identical with one another in full uniformity of practice, to carry it out."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Practical Truth</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Surely, to have any kind of uniformity is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, to have intentional differences among the churches also is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The problem lies in the matter of what vision we are under and what motive we have.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Dissenting Accusation</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>the Writing of the Letter by the Elders concerning the One Accord</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"In February 1986 there was an elders' training in Anaheim....At the end of that training, the brothers wrote a letter which, with perhaps two or three exceptions, we all signed....At the present time and for the past year and a half, we have regretted very much that we signed that letter, and even more, that such a letter was ever written.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no precedent of that in the Word; furthermore, there is no scriptural basis for the contents of such a letter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We agreed in that letter that we would be identical with all the churches, that we would follow the ministry absolutely, and that we realized Brother Lee's leading was indispensable to our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then, at the bottom of the letter we said that all these things were according to the teaching of the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But those things are not according to the teaching of the Word, and we regret very much that we subscribed to them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I want to state publicly and make it clear that I would retract my signature."</S>
