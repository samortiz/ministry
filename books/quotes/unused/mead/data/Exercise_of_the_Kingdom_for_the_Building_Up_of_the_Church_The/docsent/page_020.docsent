   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR NEED FOR ENJOYMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s intention in His creation of man was that man would take Him in and express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Taking in God and expressing God should be man s joy and amusement.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man s happiness and entertainment must be God Himself, and this is not an objective God, but a subjective God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To take God in and to live God out is man s joy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not blame people for desiring amusement, for God created man with the need for enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The reason we hunger for food day by day is that we were created with the need to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is impossible to be filled up once with food and never to be hungry again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No, we must eat afresh every day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God created us in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the same principle, God created man with the need for amusement.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But our amusement must be God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because people have lost God, they seek entertainment by going to the movies, theater, and various sporting events.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They have not found the fulfillment of their need for entertainment in God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God Himself is the unique fulfillment of our need for entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE LOSING AND SAVING OF THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the amusements people seek outside of God are for the satisfaction of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When they listen to music or enjoy certain sports, they are happy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many in Hong Kong like to play Mah-Jongg.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To them, that is the best entertainment and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Any Christian who still plays Mah-Jongg is one who is saving his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Anyone who has been regenerated in his spirit but still plays Mah-Jongg will eventually lose his soul at the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For him to refrain from playing Mah-Jongg is to cause his soul to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, such a Christian needs to lose his soul in the matter of playing Mah-Jongg.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If he does not lose it now, he will lose it when the Lord comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord will say to him, Because you saved your soul so much, now you must lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now we can understand that what the Bible means by losing the soul is for the soul to lose its enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Moreover, to save the soul is to preserve the soul in its enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If man had expressed God on earth, God would have been able to recover the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then both man and God would have enjoyed the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God would have been happy, and we would have been happy also.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, man did not cooperate with God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, God did not have a way to recover the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, He Himself has even been rejected by the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When He came in the flesh, He was rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This present age, the age of the church, is the age of the world s rejection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because Christ has been rejected, at present He has no joy on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As His followers, we share His destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our destiny as followers of the Lord Jesus is not to be welcomed by this world; instead, it is to be rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, this age is not the time for us to have enjoyment for our soul; it is the time for us to lose this enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the Lord Jesus comes back, that will be the time for Him to enjoy the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Satan will be bound, Christ will recover the earth, and the entire earth will be under His reign.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At that time Christ will enjoy the earth, and all His followers will participate in this enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the meaning of Matthew 25:21 and 23, both of which say, Well done, good and faithful slave; you were faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things; enter into the joy of your lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This will take place during the millennium when the Lord Jesus will reclaim the earth and enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By repossessing the earth, the Lord will have enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then He will ask His followers, His partners, to enter into His joy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This will be the saving of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to have the enjoyment in the coming age, we need to pay the price in this age by losing our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to say, Lord, for Your sake I don t want to have so much pleasure or amusement.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE LOVE OF THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After speaking of denying the self, taking up the cross, and losing the soul, the Lord referred to the world, saying, For what shall a man be profited if he should gain the whole world, but forfeit his soul-life?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul-life?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Matt 16:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>People love the world simply because it gives amusement to their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They love good clothing, fine cars, and worldly amusements because they bring enjoyment to the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But for the Lord s sake, for the gospel s sake, and for His testimony s sake, we need to be willing to lose the enjoyment of the soul in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Are you willing to lose your soulish enjoyment for the Lord s sake?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The reason people love the world is that they want to maintain the enjoyment of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Throughout the world there is the enjoyment of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The reason people study to earn a degree is to have a better life, and a better life means more enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Others work to earn a promotion in their job that they may have more money for more enjoyment of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When the Lord Jesus came, He lost His soul, that is, He gave up all His soulish enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He lost the enjoyment of His soul in this age so that He might gain His soul in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As we have seen, in the coming age the Lord Jesus will enjoy the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At that time He will invite us, His partners, to share in this enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need to wait patiently for the coming enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you keep the enjoyment in your soul today, you will lose the enjoyment to come.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When some hear this, they may say, My economy is practical.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I care for the present, not for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The choice is yours.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you prefer to have your enjoyment today, you are free to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But if you save your soul in this age, be assured that you will lose it when the Lord comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He will tell you that because you have enjoyed your soul so much, now is the time for you to lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Which do you choose to lose your soul today and gain it tomorrow, or to gain it today and lose it tomorrow?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we could gain the whole world, it would still not be worthwhile to gain it at the cost of losing our soul.</S>
