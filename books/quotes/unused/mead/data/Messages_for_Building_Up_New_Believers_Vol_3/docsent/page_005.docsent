   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Not Having the Element of Chance</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in Recreation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Fourth, all recreation must involve skill.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It must not involve games of chance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may say that the only kind of recreation that is proper is that which involves pure skill and nothing of chance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Any recreation that involves both skill and chance is a kind of gambling, not recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If an activity involves only chance and has nothing to do with skill, it is gambling, and Christians should turn away from it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Anything that involves chance is a kind of gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christian recreation should involve only skill; it should not have any element of chance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A game of dice is altogether a matter of chance; a Christian should never engage in this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is altogether gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Young people can play chess, because chess is a matter of skill, not a game of chance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are two kinds of recreation: One involves skill, and the other involves chance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A game of dice involves one s luck.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, it is a game of chance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A Christian must not engage in any kind of gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some love to play mahjong before they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That is gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It involves a little skill plus a good element of chance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A Christian can play only with skill, not with anything that involves chance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He cannot even have games that depend partly on skill and partly on chance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Mahjong is a game of chance, even when it does not involve any money.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It gives the player a kind of hope, a kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He hopes that chance will be on his side.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This kind of hope is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Mahjong is wrong even when no betting is involved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Billiards involve skill.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even though there are wins and losses, there is nothing wrong with the game itself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, when money is involved, it is wrong; it becomes a kind of gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can say that some games are a kind of gambling in themselves, while others are not.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, one can take a game that does not involve gambling and turn it into a kind of gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is another matter altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even something as harmless as a meal can become a kind of gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Throwing dice is a gambling game in itself, even though money is not involved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A Christian should not engage in this kind of game.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As Christians, we have principles that govern our judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we say that we can do something or we cannot do certain things, we are guided by principles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is right to play a game that involves skill, and it is wrong to play something that involves chance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Any kind of game that involves skill is permissible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But any game that depends on chance is not permissible; it is a kind of gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moreover, we should not touch anything that the world would consider a kind of gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must have our principles.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must find out what gambling is and what games of chance are.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Anything that involves chance is gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some brothers ask whether hunting, fishing, and keeping birds is permissible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the Bible, hunting began from Nimrod Gen 10:8-9 , and the Lord did not seem to like it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Fishing is permissible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once you are clear about the principle, you will know what to do with many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In conclusion, it is right if it involves skill only, and it is wrong if chance is involved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Gambling is completely out of the question.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One would have to be very fallen to ask whether it is permissible for a Christian to gamble.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some birds can be kept because they have been domesticated for years and are like house pets; they would not live if they were freed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But we must free those that can survive by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There are domestic pigeons as well as wild pigeons.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We can apply the same principles to these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>E. Recreation Meeting One s Need</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Fifth, our recreation must meet our need.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have a certain recreation because we have a certain need.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not have any recreation without having the need for it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many brothers are so busy that they think they have no need for recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Other brothers have nothing to do all day long, and they think about recreation all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Those who have a genuine need for diversion do not feel the need for it, while those who do not need diversion think that they have a need for it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We do not need to tell everyone about the need for diversion.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do not like to grant license to God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We do not want to give a blanket endorsement for any kind of recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What we want to tell God s children is to judge for themselves whether they have such a need.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The principle is always to live for the Lord and to recognize that all our time is His.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Life is measured by time.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Life is not time itself, but it is measured by time.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A man cannot waste his time on everything and then find that he has no more time for God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To waste an hour of time is to waste an hour of one s life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>To waste two hours of time is to waste two hours of one s life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If you take an hour for recreation, that hour must eventually be of benefit to you in your work.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If there is not the need for this hour, the recreation is a waste of your time.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To waste your time is to waste your life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we can spend an hour more for the Lord, we can reap one more hour of results.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we spend an hour on recreation, and this recreation can enhance our work, it is an investment, not a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Hence, diversion is based on need.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It can also be based on the advice of elderly brothers or the instruction of doctors.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Sometimes an elderly brother may advise you to take some diversion because he can sense a buildup of tension within you.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>At other times a doctor may advise you against certain activities and warn you of dire consequences.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Recreation is to take care of need, not for the sake of play.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I have my own kinds of recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I participate in recreation not for the sake of recreation, but for the sake of enhancing my work.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>A busy person may need recreation, or he may not need it.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The general rule is that recreation is for those who have the need for it.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Those who do not need it are not obligated to have it.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We realize that young people need recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We can see the need for our teen-agers to have recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Some parents do not have such a need, so they think that their children have no such need.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>However, depriving children of recreational activity will drive them down the road to evil.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We have to recognize their need even though we may not be altogether certain of our own need.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The principle is that recreation is for those who need it; those who do not need it can live without it.</S>
