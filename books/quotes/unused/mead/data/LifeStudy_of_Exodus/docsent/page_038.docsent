   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ELEVEN THE PURPOSE OF GOD S CALLING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Moses is a type of God s called ones today.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not think, as many do, that Moses is vastly superior to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most Christians regard Moses as the highest servant of God in the Old Testament and Paul as the highest in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Comparing themselves with Moses and Paul, they have a very low estimate of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This attitude is mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s calling of us is the same in principle as His calling of Moses and Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What Moses experienced in type, Paul experienced in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today both the type and the reality should be our experience also.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Life-study of Ephesians we pointed out that all the saints can be perfected to do the work of apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Just as a mathematics teacher perfects his students to do what he can do, so the leading ones perfect the saints to do the very things that they themselves do.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul was a representative of the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No matter how great Paul was, he was still just one member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In principle, what he was able to do, all the other members should be able to do also.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that all the members should be called as Paul was called.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For this reason, we all must know the purpose of God s calling.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I. TO DELIVER GOD S CHOSEN PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>OUT OF THE USURPING HAND OF PHARAOH</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>AND THE TYRANNY OF EGYPT</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The purpose of God s calling is firstly to deliver His chosen people out of the usurpation and tyranny of Pharaoh and Egypt 3:8, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Pharaoh was a type of Satan, and Egypt was a type of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Just as Pharaoh was the ruler of Egypt, so Satan is the ruler of this world John 12:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is still seeking to deliver His chosen people out of the usurping hand of Satan and out of the tyranny of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As God s called ones, we need a clear view of what the world is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The world is not a source of enjoyment; it is a place of tyranny.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the world Satan is keeping God s chosen people, those destined for the fulfillment of God s purpose, under his usurping hand.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every aspect of the world is a form of tyranny.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Exodus Pharaoh kept the children of Israel under tyranny by forcing them to do hard labor.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The same principle operates today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As people work, they suffer under various forms of tyranny.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even making a long drive to work on a crowded freeway is one kind of tyranny.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Likewise, the competition for promotion and the insecurity about losing a job are also kinds of tyranny.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nevertheless, anyone who does not labor for Pharaoh in the world will not receive the supply of the Nile.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to earn a living in the world, God s chosen people must serve under the tyranny of Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Shopping is another form of the world s tyranny.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many young women are held in tyranny in a subtle way through shopping for the latest fashions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Recently some saints told me that they do not have the time to pray or read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I pointed out that they have plenty of time to make telephone calls or to read the newspaper.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This indicates that even the telephone or the newspaper may be a means of tyranny.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is easy to preach to people, but it is very difficult to bring them out of the usurpation and tyranny of Satan and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As we shall see, Moses did not preach to the children of Israel, but he was able to rescue them from Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today we also need to have the authority to bring God s people out of the usurping hand of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One aspect of God s purpose in His calling is to use us to bring others out of the usurpation and tyranny of Satan and the world.</S>
