   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Transformed by the Renewing of the Mind</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After Romans 12:1 exhorts us to present our freed and enlivened bodies to God for the Body life, verse 2 deals with our soul, represented by the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It says, Be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The order of the spirit, mind, and body in Romans 8 is reversed in Romans 12.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Romans 8 reveals that we are freed and enlivened first in the spirit, then in the mind, and lastly in the body vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2-11 , and Romans 12 shows that in order to be used by God for the Body of Christ, we must first present our body, then have our mind renewed, and lastly be burning in the spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1-2, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a two-way traffic, coming and going.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are freed from sin and death first in our spirit, then in our mind, and lastly in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then we are used by God first in our body, then in our mind, and lastly in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The body needs to be enlivened and presented to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The mind needs to be set on the spirit by being filled and occupied with the things concerning Christ and renewed with the divine element and essence 8:6; 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To have our mind renewed is not to change our mind but to have a new element and essence added into our mind so that it becomes a new mind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the mind is renewed with the divine element and essence, we know God s will, that which is well pleasing to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 11 says, Be burning in spirit, serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, the body is enlivened and presented, the mind is renewed, and the spirit is burning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These are the three basic requirements for the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When our being is in such a condition, we can and will function for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Having an enlivened body, a renewed mind, and a burning spirit depends on our walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, walking according to the spirit is a basic requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is also the conclusion of the first seven chapters of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Chapters 1 and 2 tell us that we were fallen sinners; chapters 3 and 4 show that we were redeemed, justified, and reconciled; and chapters 5 through 7 deal with our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then Romans 8:4 reveals that we need to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the conclusion of Romans 1 7.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to see this and live a life of walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The issue will be that our body is enlivened, our mind is renewed, and our spirit is burning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we walk according to the spirit and have an enlivened body, a renewed mind, and a burning spirit, we will be prepared for the Body life and function properly in the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our functioning will not be individualistic, as the work of many Christian workers is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The work of such ones is not to function in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we pass through the experiences revealed in Romans 1 8, we will function as members in the Body according to Romans 12.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is a great difference between working individualistically and functioning in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we migrate to establish a church in a new locality, we should not go individualistically but as a member functioning in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In order to do this, we need to pass through the experiences revealed in Romans 1 8.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Otherwise, it is only our flesh migrating.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>My heart aches for and pities those in Christianity who are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They may have objective, traditional, doctrinal theology, but they do not have the living light.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, they work in blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord said that such ones are blind guides of the blind Matt 15:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, the light in the word of the New Testament, and especially in the Epistles of Paul, is clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How we need to thank the Lord that He has opened His word to us, making every portion of the Bible transparent and bright.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE BODY LIFE REVEALED IN 1 CORINTHIANS 12</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After we enter into the experience of functioning in the Body according to Romans 12, we can go on to the experience of 1 Corinthians 12.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First Corinthians 12 is a higher stage than Romans 12.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Romans 8 concerns walking according to the spirit v. 4 , and 1 Corinthians 12 concerns drinking of the Spirit v. 13 . Drinking of the Spirit is not merely for our individual enjoyment of the Lord but for the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the past those who were stirred up to drink of the Spirit but did not care for the Body life eventually lost their enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If our drinking of the Spirit is for the Body life, we will maintain our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should care more for the Body life than for excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The drinking of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians is for the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Drinking of the Spirit Issuing In Functioning</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>in the Body and for the Body</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Drinking of the Spirit issues in at least three things that are recorded and developed in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Chapter 13 is a parenthetical section.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>First, drinking of the Spirit issues in functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No other chapters in the New Testament go to such lengths to show us the way to function as do 1 Corinthians 12 and 14.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we see the real functioning in these two chapters, we will realize that much of the preaching and teaching among Christians today is abnormal because these activities are neither in the Body nor for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul teaches that the proper speaking in the meetings, whether prophesying or speaking in tongues, is in the Body and for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we drink the Spirit, we will function properly.</S>
