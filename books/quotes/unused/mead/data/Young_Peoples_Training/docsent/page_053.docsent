   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LOCAL CHURCHES BEING THE DESTINATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF GOD S REVELATION AND MANIFESTATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we have pointed out elsewhere, the local churches are the destination of God s revelation and manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Beginning with Genesis 1, God is progressively revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eventually, in the local churches God s progressive revelation reaches its destination.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, without the local church there is no destination for God s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The local churches are also the destination of God s manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Genesis 1 God was manifested in the man who was made in His image.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Gospels, God was manifested in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After the Gospels, in the Acts and the Epistles, God was manifested in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Consummately, in the book of Revelation, God is manifested firstly in the local churches and ultimately in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, if you reject the local church, you lose both the practicality of the church and the destination of God s revelation and manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because many Christians have missed this destination, they have become very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But praise the Lord that we are enjoying the practicality of the church life and the destination of God s progressive revelation and manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To us, the Bible is transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We were not this clear before we came into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not man s wisdom; it comes from the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Oh, the flow is a great matter!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because we are in the flow, we have the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE LOCAL CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE CHURCH MANIFESTED IN A LOCALITY</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we are not the church, then what are we?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We do not call ourselves the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The words local church are not a title, and we should never consider them to be a title.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To consider the words local church to be our title makes us a local church denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The words local church denote the nature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are a description of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church today is local because the practicality of the church is local.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To say that we are the church in Anaheim is like speaking of the moon in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we are in Hong Kong, we may speak of the moon in Hong Kong, and when we are in London, we may speak of the moon in London.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is both logical and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are not the church in the air; we are the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church manifested in Anaheim is the church at Anaheim, and the church manifested in Oklahoma City is the church in that city.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is not a title of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Just as the moon is simply the moon, so the church is simply the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To say that we are the church is not to give ourselves a title; it is simply to state a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>DENOMINATIONS BEING DIVISIONS</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The denominations and free groups are divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They call themselves by various denominational names.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the past, some Christian leaders came to me with a good intention, saying, How can you say that you are the church and that we are not the church?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Are we not saved?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I replied, You are definitely saved, but why do you call yourselves Presbyterians?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you are the church, why do you denominate yourselves in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In coming to speak to me about this, you certainly want me to admit that you are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I admit that you are a part of the church, but you call yourselves Presbyterians.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since you do this, how can I call you the church?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you are Mr. Smith, but wear a name tag saying that you are Mr. Jones, am I not correct in calling you Mr. Jones? You may say, No, I am Mr. Smith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Don t pay attention to this label.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But if you want me to forget it, you need to take the label off.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Why won t you drop this label?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then they said, Brother, this is not a simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are missionaries from another country, and we have our mission board.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is not easy to abandon that.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To this I said, Then you are what you are.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You are Presbyterians.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Why do the saints in the denominations need to designate themselves in divisive ways?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If they would give up their denominational names, we would immediately be one with them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But as long as they bear denominational titles, such as Presbyterian or Baptist, it is difficult for us to be one with them in a practical way.</S>
