   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Isaiah 50:4-9 describes the instruction the servant of Jehovah Isaiah typifying Christ received and the life he lived.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A. The Instruction the Servant of Jehovah Received</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Referring to Isaiah as a type of Christ as the Servant of Jehovah, verses 4 and 5 say, "The Lord Jehovah has given me /The tongue of the instructed,/That I should know how to sustain the weary with a word./He awakens me morning by morning;/He awakens my ear/To hear as an instructed one./The Lord Jehovah has opened my ear;/And I was not rebellious,/Nor did I turn back."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ as the Servant of Jehovah was instructed not by man but by God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ did not speak His own word but spoke according to God's instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He thus learned how to sustain the weary ones, the weak ones, with a word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jehovah awakened Him every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that every day the Lord Jesus had a morning revival.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, the Lord was never rebellious; rather, He was always obedient, listening to the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>B. The Life the Servant of Jehovah Lived</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The servant of Jehovah gave his back to those who struck him and his cheeks to those who plucked out the hair.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did not hide his face from humiliation and spitting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jehovah helped him; therefore, he was not dishonored.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He set his face like a flint, and he knew that he would not be put to shame vv.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Who is my adversary in judgment Rom 8:33a ?/Let him come near to me./Behold, the Lord Jehovah helps me Rom 8:31 ,/Who is the one who condemns me Rom 8:34a ?/Behold, they will all wear out like a garment;/The moth will consume them."</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Finally, in verses 10 and 11 we are told how he who fears Jehovah and hears the voice of His servant has light while walking in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Concerning such a one, verse 10b says, "Let him trust in the name of Jehovah,/And rely on his God."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 11 goes on to give a warning about self-made light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"Behold, all of you who kindle a fire,/Who surround yourselves with firebrands,/Walk into the light of your fire/And into the firebrands which you have lit./You will have this from My hand:/You will lie down in torment."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who make light for themselves and walk in their self-made light instead of God's light will suffer torment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This should be a warning to us that we may walk in the light given by God, not in the light we make for ourselves.</S>
