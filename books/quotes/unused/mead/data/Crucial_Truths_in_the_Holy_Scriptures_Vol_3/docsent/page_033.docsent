   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Spiritual Significance</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of History in the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The history in the Bible contains spiritual meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, the history of Sarah and Hagar speaks of the difference between the old and new covenants Gen 21:1-14; Gal 4:22-31 , and the story of Mephibosheth describes God s salvation 2 Sam 9:1-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Dispensations in the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must distinguish among the different dispensations in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we do not, many parts will seem contradictory and be difficult to explain.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The period of time from the creation of Adam to the end of the millennial kingdom can be divided into seven dispensations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The position and condition of man and the responsibility borne by man in each dispensation are different.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In each dispensation, however, man failed, and each dispensation ends in judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The dispensation of innocence from the creation of Adam to his being driven out of the garden of Eden, at most 130 years cf.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Gen 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This period is called the dispensation of innocence because man was without sin at the time of Adam s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man lived before God and was ruled by God; God ruled man directly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The dispensation of conscience from the fall of Adam to the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The dispensations of innocence and conscience span approximately 1,656 years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This period is called the dispensation of conscience because man fell from God to his conscience and was ruled by his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God ruled man indirectly through his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The dispensation of human government from Noah s leaving the ark to the dispersion at the tower of Babel, 427 years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This period is called the dispensation of human government because during this time man fell further from his own conscience to being ruled by other men.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was under man s rule.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God thus ruled man even more indirectly through other men.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At this time God gave man authority to rule men 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man s authority over man began in this dispensation Rom 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By this time man had fallen to the furthest extent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He fell from God to his conscience and then from his conscience to being ruled by other men.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, man fell from God s government to self government and from self government to human government.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After man fell to this extent, he could fall no further.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At this point, man truly needed God to come in and save him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The dispensation of promise from Abraham s calling to the giving of the law on Mount Sinai, 430 years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After man could fall no further, God came in and called Abram Abraham , promising him that He would bless man through his seed Christ Gal 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This meant that He would deal with man by grace through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God repeated this promise to the patriarchs.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, this period is called the dispensation of promise.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The dispensation of law from the giving of the law on Mount Sinai to the ministry of John the Baptist, about 1,500 years Luke 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although God promised to deal with man by grace through Christ, man did not know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead, he thought that he could do good and be justified by God by virtue of his own actions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, God temporarily put aside His promise of grace and used the law to show man his sin and impotence.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through the law, man was shown that he could not do good nor be justified in himself so that he would seek God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This period is called the dispensation of law because God dealt with man through the law at this time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The dispensation of grace from the ministry of John the Baptist to Christ s second coming Mark 1:1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God used the law only to deal with man temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His original promise of grace was not annulled by the law Gal 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He placed man under law for approximately 1,500 years to completely manifest man s sin and impotence so that he would know himself and his sin in order to bow before God s judgment Rom 3:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then God sent the Lord Jesus to fulfill His promise of grace, enabling Him to deal with man through grace and enabling man to live under His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The law continued to the time of John the Baptist Luke 16:16 , but from that time until the second coming of Christ, God has dealt with man and will deal with man through grace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, this period is called the dispensation of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The dispensation of the kingdom from Christ s coming to reign as King to the casting of Satan into the lake of fire, 1,000 years Rev 20:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When Christ comes back, the dispensation of grace will be over.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>His kingdom will be on earth, and He will reign for one thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This period of one thousand years is the time of the authority of His kingdom, so it is called the dispensation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many Bible scholars use these seven periods.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, the Bible divides the time from the creation of Adam until the end of the millennial kingdom into only four dispensations:</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The dispensation of the fathers from Adam to Moses, before the giving of the law Rom 5:13-14 , 2,513 years.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The dispensation of the law from Moses to the first coming of Christ John 1:17 , about 1,500 years.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The dispensation of grace from the first coming of Christ to His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The dispensation of the kingdom from the second coming of Christ to the casting of Satan into the lake of fire, 1,000 years.</S>
