Being under Christ&rsquo;s Headship</h2>
<p>Where there is life, there is oneness, and where there is oneness, there is the headship. With life comes headship, and with headship comes oneness. Oneness and headship are inseparable. Where there is oneness, there is headship. Without oneness, there is no headship. If there are many heads, there is no oneness. If a body is missing a head, the oneness is gone. If there are members but no head, the body will collapse.</p>
<p>When we are all in Christ&rsquo;s life and under the headship of Christ, everything in the church will be in one accord and harmony. This is the condition of the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem the river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. This indicates that the one accord in the New Jerusalem is the issue of the flowing of God&rsquo;s life, which brings everything within the city under the authority of God and Christ.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s life will bring us under His headship. No one can live in Christ&rsquo;s life and not be under His headship. When we live in Christ&rsquo;s life, we are under His headship, and the one accord is among us. The one accord in the church is not only out of life; it is also under Christ&rsquo;s headship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Heading Up All Things<br />
through the Shining of the Church</h2>
<p>When God&rsquo;s operation in the church is completed, the church as the firstfruits will be fully ripened, and the New Jerusalem will be manifested with the light of God&rsquo;s life shining out of it. God will place the New Jerusalem at the center of the new universe, and the nations will walk by its light (21:24). Without the light of this city, the nations would be in darkness. Since darkness is a sign of death, being in darkness is to be in death, and being in death is to be in discord. When the nations, who represent all things, walk by the light of the New Jerusalem, all things will be delivered from the darkness of death and from the chaos of darkness and will thereby be made one by the light.</p>
<p>Today all things are in discord because they are in darkness and in death. God has chosen the church, separated the church from all things, and imparted His life into the church. God&rsquo;s life is circulating in the church in order to bring His authority, which is His throne, into the church so that everything of the church may be headed up in God. When this life fills the church, the church will be the New Jerusalem, and God&rsquo;s light will shine out of her to bring all things into the light. Wherever light shines, darkness is eliminated, death has no ground, and all things are brought into one accord.</p>
<p>We should ask the many brothers and sisters who are living in the workers&rsquo; house if they are in one accord and headed up? If they are separate individuals and do not let life flow, they will be dead, not headed up, and not in one accord. To be dead means to be in darkness by being severed from Christ and from God&rsquo;s authority. However, if one brother has the operation of life within him, this life will bring God&rsquo;s throne into him. Then the river of water of life with the tree of life will flow in him until his whole being is under God&rsquo;s authority, and everything in him is in the realm of oneness. Then this brother will be like the New Jerusalem, which is pure gold, without impurities, and is altogether in one accord. Everything in this brother will be Christ and God; there will be no mixture. When he is in the workers&rsquo; house, it will be full of light. The light of life will shine out of this brother to illumine the workers&rsquo; house, and everyone will walk in this light. The light of life will kill all the darkness in the workers&rsquo; house, and the power of life within him will swallow up all the death in the workers&rsquo; house. Even if the saints in the workers&rsquo; house express opinions and the flesh, when this brother shines like the light of the New Jerusalem, those who are contentious will no longer be in darkness. Rather, they will be terminated under this shining, and the flesh will no longer be expressed. Then the saints in the workers&rsquo; house will walk in this light, darkness will be eliminated, death will be swallowed up, and everyone will be in one accord. Such a brother will be like the firstfruits of God&rsquo;s work in the workers&rsquo; house, and everyone will be brought into oneness.</p>
<p>When the life of Christ is fully expressed in the church and shines forth from the church, all things will be headed up in the shining of the church&rsquo;s light. When Ephesians 4:13 is fulfilled in the church, the heading up of all things in Christ in 1:10 will also be fulfilled. When there is the oneness in 4:13, there is the heading up in 1:10. When God&rsquo;s work in the church is complete, the church will become a transparent city of pure gold that shines forth God&rsquo;s light. This light will eliminate the darkness in all things and kill the death in all things, thus heading up all things.</p>
<p>Verse 10 of chapter 1 is not for us to merely study as a prophecy; it is for us to see the purpose that God desires to achieve through the church. When the church matures, God&rsquo;s purpose will be achieved. This is not a matter of prophecy but a matter of life. We should not pay attention to the fulfilling of this prophecy but to the maturing of life; we should let Christ&rsquo;s life transform us so that He may shine forth from us and bring us unto maturity.</p>
<p>When we are mature, the nations and all things will walk by our light. Furthermore, they will come under God&rsquo;s authority, and they will be headed up by this light. Thus, every saint bears responsibility. We must ask ourselves: How much do we let Christ work in us? How much do we let Christ shine in us? How much do we let Him shine out through us? This is the key to all matters. If ten saints serving together in the church cannot be in one accord, we cannot expect all things to be headed up. God is heading up all things by His life through the shining of the church. God&rsquo;s life will work in the church until it can shine forth from the church and become the light of all things. Then all things will be headed up in this light.</p>
<p>Satan destroyed the accord in the universe by bringing death into all things. Death brought in darkness, and darkness made all things chaotic. God is restoring the accord in the universe by working His life into a group of people. This life is operating within these people and becoming their light of life. This light of life will then shine out of them to become the light of all things and to make all things one. Thus life brings in light, and light makes all things one. These two sides can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p> Satan&#150;Death&#150;Darkness&#150;Chaos</p>
<p> God&#150;Life&#150;Light&#150;Oneness</p>
<p>If the lights in the meeting hall suddenly went out during an evening meeting, everyone would be groping in the dark. All people, matters, and things would fall into confusion and would not be able to proceed as usual. If the lights are bright, however, everything will be in good order. Another example is that there may be numerous saints and complicated affairs in a large church, but the church will not be chaotic if it is headed up by one administration. Such oneness is brought in only by the light of life. Whenever there is no light, darkness prevails. Furthermore, people, matters, and things fall into confusion, and the oneness is lost.</p>
<p>All things will be headed up by the light shining forth from the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem can shine forth light because there is a flow of life. As the river of water of life flows within the New Jerusalem, light shines forth. The nations will walk by this light and be headed up. When we have the flow of Christ&rsquo;s life within us, we will have the shining of His life. When electricity flows within a lamp, light shines. The shining of the electricity that is within the lamp is light. This light keeps people from being in darkness and chaos. Similarly, when the light of life shines forth from the church as the light of the nations, the nations will walk by this light, and all things will be headed up in this light.</p>
<p>The Bible says, &ldquo;God is light&rdquo; (1 John 1:5). God as light is the light of life (John 1:4; 8:12), which does not shine onto all things directly from heaven but is placed first in a vessel in order to shine through this vessel. This vessel is the church as a corporate vessel (Phil. 2:15). God wants to impart Himself into this corporate vessel and operate in this vessel. Then He will shine forth from this vessel to become the light of all things and to head up all things.</p>
<p>People in the world do not have a proper understanding of human life. Hence, many newspapers, magazines, and books have differing views and opinions concerning the human life. Such a chaotic situation is due to man&rsquo;s being in darkness. Philosophical writings on human life are in darkness. If philosophical writers do not know where they came from or where they are going, how can they know the meaning of human life? They can only grope in darkness and point at one thing or another. Furthermore, some are unconventional, and others are cynical. People do not know whose opinion to follow. Such a confusing situation will end when God&rsquo;s life shines forth from the church onto people in chaos so that they see light. All theories, views, philosophies, and interpretations are annihilated in God who is the light of life. God as the light of life will bring all things into one accord.</p>
<p>The saints have many different occupations and come from many different nationalities, cultures, and races. Before we believed in the Lord, our views concerning human life rarely agreed. What some regarded as good, others disliked, and what some took for granted, others rejected. After we are saved, we still have different occupations, nationalities, and cultures, but our view and speaking concerning human life are in one accord. We all say, &ldquo;Come and let us walk in the light of Jehovah&rdquo; (Isa. 2:5).</p>
<p>Religion, doctrines, Christian dogmas, and even Bible teachings do not bring us into one accord; only the shining forth of life in us brings us into one accord. Whoever the shining of the light of life reaches is in one accord and is headed up in this light. There is no other way for us to be in one accord or to be headed up, except through the light shining forth from this glorious life.</p>
<p>Having the same faith or the same opinion is not what enables us to work together for the Lord. Those who have the same faith or are of the same opinion can still contend and quarrel. We can work together because we let this living life operate and shine in us. If God&rsquo;s light of life can shine upon us and if we can be restricted by the operation of this life, we will be able to work together in one accord and be headed up.</p>
<p>All things can be headed up only by God&rsquo;s life shining forth from the church and becoming the light of the nations. God&rsquo;s life is within the church, but if the light of life is not able to shine through the church, all things will not be headed up. All things can be headed up because God&rsquo;s life is shining through the church.</p>
<p>Only the light of life can make all things one. All things will be in harmony and in one accord during the restoration of all things because the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah (11:9). The knowledge of Jehovah comes from His shining. Therefore, the earth being filled with the knowledge of Jehovah means that everything on the earth will be shined upon by God. At that time all things will be in harmony; the vipers will not harm, nor will the lions destroy. Isaiah describes the situation during the restoration: &ldquo;The wolf will dwell with the lamb; / And the leopard will lie down with the kid, / And the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; / And a young boy will lead them about. / The cow and the bear will graze; / Their young will lie down together; / And the lion will eat straw like the ox. / The nursing child will play by the cobra&rsquo;s hole, / And upon the viper&rsquo;s den / The weaned child will stretch his hand. / They will not harm nor destroy / In all My holy mountain, / For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah, / As water covers the sea&rdquo; (vv. 6-9). Such harmony is the result of all things being shined upon by God and being filled with the knowledge of Jehovah. Then all things will know God, and the people will say, &ldquo;Come and let us walk in the light of Jehovah&rdquo; (2:5).</p>
<p>Death severed all things from God and brought all things into a state of collapse. Therefore, in order for God to restore His relationship with all things and to restore the harmony among all things, He must first work Himself into a group of created and redeemed people to be their life and then shine forth from within them. There will be harmony when this light shines on all things.</p>
<p>Two portions in the Bible speak about the harmonious condition of one accord among all things that will be in the future. Revelation 21:24 says, &ldquo;The nations will walk by its light,&rdquo; and Isaiah 2:5 says, &ldquo;Come and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.&rdquo; Both portions speak of walking in God&rsquo;s light when all things are in harmony and one accord in the future. Hence, in the future all things will be in harmony, in one accord, and headed up because they will be in God&rsquo;s light. God&rsquo;s light annihilates the discord in the darkness and heads up all things. This all-things-heading-up light will shine on all things through the redeemed, that is, through the church, which is the coming New Jerusalem. Therefore, God will head up all things in the universe through the shining of the church.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>God's Plan concerning the Church &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
