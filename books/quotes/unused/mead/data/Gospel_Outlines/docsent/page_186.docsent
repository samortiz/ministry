   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject One Hundred Eighty-five ETERNAL REDEMPTION Scripture: Heb 9:12 The need for redemption Man is sinful before God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God is righteous and so is His law.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The law has a righteous requirement because of man s sins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When man s sin confronts God s righteousness, there is a need for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The meaning of redemption Redemption resolves man s sins before God according to the requirement of God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because of God s righteousness, sinful men must die.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So in order to redeem them, there must be another death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only another death can satisfy the requirement of God s righteousness, and only such a death can redeem men from their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The type of redemption In the time of the Old Testament, before redemption was accomplished, God set up a type of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Redemption was typified by the offering of goats and bulls.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Goats and bulls were killed, and blood was shed to accomplish atonement for man s sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The death and shed blood of goats and bulls was only a shadow, not the reality; while it made atonement for sins, it could not redeem men from their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The accomplishment of redemption Redemption was accomplished on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Jesus bore man s sins on the cross and suffered the punishment for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus He fulfilled the requirement of God s righteousness and accomplished redemption for man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The redemption of the Lord Jesus is not a symbol, but a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The blood of goats and bulls in the Old Testament time was only a symbol, but the redemption of Christ on the cross is a real accomplished fact.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The nature of redemption Redemption is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eternal not only refers to time, but in nature it also denotes a completion, something accomplished once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>So Christ s redemption, being eternal, is applicable and available to all men at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How to partake of Christ s redemption</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Develop this point.</S>
