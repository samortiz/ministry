   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO EXAMPLES OF REBELLION IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 1 Scripture Reading: Gen 2:16-17; 3:1-6; Rom 5:19 THE FALL OF ADAM AND EVE The Fall of Man Due to Not Submitting</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us consider the story of Adam and Eve in Genesis 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After Adam was created, God gave him some instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He commanded Adam not to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must realize that this was not merely a matter of eating or not eating the forbidden fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, God put Adam under a kind of authority with a view that Adam would submit to it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God entrusted all creation to Adam's authority so that Adam would manage and be the authority over all the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the same time, God put Adam under His own authority so that Adam would learn to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only those who submit to authority can themselves be authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the order of God's creation, He first created Adam and then Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God destined that Adam would be the authority and that Eve would be under Adam's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God set one to be the authority and the other to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the old creation and in the new creation, the order of precedence is the basis of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whoever is created first is the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whoever is saved first is the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For this reason, wherever we go, our first thought should be to find those to whom the Lord wants us to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Wherever we are, we have to see authority, and we also have to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man's fall came from not submitting to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eve did not check with Adam; she made the decision.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She saw that the fruit was good for food and pleasant to the eyes, so she took liberty and made the decision herself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before she stretched forth her hand to pick the fruit, she first used her head to think and receive the temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then she assumed the headship by stretching forth her hands.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, the taking of the fruit by Eve did not come from submission.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, it came from the decision of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not only did she transgress God's commandment, she also disregarded Adam's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rebellion against God's deputy authority is rebellion against God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Adam listened to Eve's word and took of the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was worse; it was in disobedience to God's direct command.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a result, Adam also disregarded God's authority and was rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All Work Needing to Be Done out of Submission</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>While we live on this earth, our first question should not be whether or not we should do a certain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, in doing a certain thing, we should ask to whom are we submitting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not a matter of doing or not doing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is a matter of to whom we submit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without submission there is no work and there is no service.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Adam took the fruit, the first question that should have been asked was whether or not this was in submission to God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All of the work of a Christian should come out of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nothing is of our own initiative; everything is responsive.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No act is active; everything is passive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In other words, everything should be initiated by God; nothing should be initiated by us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Not only was Eve under the authority of God; she was also under the authority that God had set Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eve had to submit to a double command and a double authority.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the same for us today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eve only thought of the fruit being good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She did not know to whom she should submit in eating.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From the very beginning, God wanted man to submit rather than to propose his own ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eve's act, however, originated from her own idea, not from submission.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She neither submitted to God's arrangement nor to God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Instead, she proposed her own idea, transgressed against God, and became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To fall is to act without submission.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>An act that has no submission behind it is rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The more submission a man has, the less acts there are with him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the beginning of a man's pursuit after the Lord, there are many acts and little submission.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As he progresses, the acts become fewer, until in the end only submission is left.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When many encounter work, they like to take action.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They do not like to be still.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They do not care whether or not there is submission.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For this reason, many works are done by the self, not through heeding and obedience.</S>
