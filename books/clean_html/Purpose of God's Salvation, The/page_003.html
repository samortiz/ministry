<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE MYSTERY OF GOD</h2>
<p>Many people admit that there is a God in the universe. But a person who is not in Christ cannot touch God. A person who is not in Christ can neither understand, know, comprehend, nor experience God. The reality of God is in Christ. We can say that Christ is God, but Christ involves more. Christ is the definition, the reality, and the mystery of God. It is hard to convey this matter adequately with human language. Everything concerning God is in Christ. God is manifested in Christ. Therefore, when Christ was on the earth among men, He was the expression of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE CENTRAL MEANING OF MAN</h2>
<p>Christ is the mystery of God and also the meaning of man. There are billions of people on the earth, but the meaning of human existence is Christ. Christ is the only genuine man. Therefore, a person who does not have Christ cannot fulfill the meaning of his existence. Many people are mentioned in the sixty-six books of the Bible, many people are recorded in human history, and many people live on the earth, but which of these people is a genuine man? Without a doubt, Jesus Christ is the only genuine, perfect, and meaningful man. Apart from Christ, we cannot see God, nor can we see a genuine, proper man. Christ is God, and Christ is also a man. This One is the Christ of God. Therefore, God is working so that such a Christ can enter into us. When Christ enters into us, God enters into us. When Christ enters into us and lives in us, we know the meaning of our human life.</p>
<p>Many people do not have a proper humanity, because they are short of Christ. The more Christ a person has, the more proper his humanity will be. The more of the element of Christ a person has, the more genuine his humanity will be. We should consider how proper our humanity was before we received Christ. We had the appearance of a man, but we did not express a proper humanity, because we were short of Christ. After our salvation we allowed the Lord to gain ground in our being; hence, the element of Christ increased within us, and our humanity became more proper. Were our young people proper before they were saved and allowed the Lord to gain ground in them? If we would tell the truth, we would say no. Their humanity was not proper. However, this is not because they were short of morality, knowledge, or religion but because they were short of Christ. Only when Christ enters into our being can we have the reality of God, receive the element of Christ&rsquo;s proper humanity, and become a genuine man. This is what God desires to do in us. God desires Christ to be our life so that Christ may be expressed through us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONSECRATION BEING TO ALLOW CHRIST<br />
TO GAIN GROUND IN US</h2>
<p>The Bible is centered on Christ. A person who has Christ will certainly be moral and God-fearing, and he will possess spiritual gifts. However, Christ is absolutely different from philosophy, morality, religion, and spiritual gifts. God wants Christ to be our life, and He wants Christ to have the full ground in our being. In order for Christ to gain ground within us, we need to consecrate ourselves to Christ. We do not consecrate ourselves to do something for Christ but to allow Christ to gain ground in us. Because Christ wants to be our life, we should hand ourselves over to Him so that He can live in us. This is the true meaning of consecration. As believers, we should not ask Christ to help us live; rather, we should hand ourselves over to Him so that He may live in us. It is one thing for us to live and expect help from Christ, but it is another thing to hand ourselves over to Christ and allow Him to live in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ACCEPTING THE CROSS<br />
BEING TO ALLOW CHRIST TO LIVE IN US</h2>
<p>The true meaning of the cross is to put ourselves into the death of Christ. When we accept the cross, we acknowledge that we have already died so that Christ may live in us. To fellowship with the Lord or to draw near to the Lord is to allow the Lord to live in us. Being a Christian is a matter of being able to say, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). This is marvelous. God created us, but He does not want us to live by our self. He wants Christ to live in us. Worldly people and sinners do not allow Christ to live in them, and most Christians and religionists also do not allow Christ to live in them. Hence, we are not talking about being a Christian but of allowing Christ to live in us. A Christian should be a person who allows Christ to live in him. God wants us to stop our living and to allow Christ to live in us. God does not want us to replace Christ with anything. He only wants us to take Christ as our goal.</p>
<p>May God open our eyes to see that the universe and mankind are for Christ and to see that Christ wants to be our life, to live in us, and to live out from us. For this reason, we need to consecrate ourselves, read the Bible, pray, fellowship with the Lord, accept the cross, and allow Christ to live in us. Christ is the center of God&rsquo;s desire. He must have the first place in the universe and also the first place in our being. He is all and in all. In Him all the fullness of the Godhead dwells, and when He lives in us and out from us, God is expressed. This is the Christ revealed in Colossians.</p>
