   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To prophesy is to excel because it is of the excelling Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul began 1 Corinthians 14:12 by saying, Since you are zealous of spirits....</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>J. N. Darby has a note on this portion of the Word that makes Paul s meaning clear.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>During Paul s time, the unbelieving Greeks were zealous of devilish spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After they became Christians, they needed to be zealous of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are many devilish spirits plus the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why Paul says that if you are zealous for spirits, you must be zealous for the excelling Spirit, that is, the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The excelling Holy Spirit should be sought by the seeking believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To speak for Christ, to speak Christ forth, to speak Christ into others, is to practice a function that excels.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the highest function.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>PROPHESYING BEING FOR OTHERS LEARNING</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Prophesying is for others learning 14:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For others to be able to learn by our prophesying, we have to learn something first.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A teacher cannot teach unless he has learned something.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If he has not learned something, how can his students learn something?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we prophesy for others learning, we speak not only by the inspiration of the Spirit in our spirit but also by our seeking and learning with the mind 14:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must learn how to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>My secret in speaking is that whenever I speak I pray in this way: Lord, infuse me with Your intention, with Your feeling, and with Your thought.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Lord, infuse me with Your word and Your expression.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Infuse me, Lord, with Your instant utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord is faithful to hear this prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all have to learn to say something for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then when we speak Christ to others, they will learn something.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Speaking for the Lord is not a sudden or miraculous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To speak for the Lord we have to learn just as if we are studying in a college.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to learn to speak, try to speak, desire to speak, and seek to speak since prophesying is excelling.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>PROPHESYING FOR THE PRACTICAL</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Prophesying is for the practical building up of the church 14:3-5, 12, 26 , the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Prophesying is not for the building up of a congregation, an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The way of one man speaking and the rest listening is the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The way of Christianity is to build a congregation, an organization, which is a facade.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Everyone prophesying builds up a body the Body of Christ, an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This organism can only be built up in the organic way by practicing 1 Corinthians 14:26 through the perfecting of the saints by the four gifts mentioned in Ephesians 4:11-16.</S>
