   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>STRENGTHENING HIS FORERUNNER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Luke 7:18 says, And John s disciples reported to him concerning all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ, was in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It seemed that the One with authority and sympathy would not do anything for John.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead, it was as if He had forgotten him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The disciples of John may have been bothered by this, and they reported to him concerning all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They may have been troubled by the fact that the Man-Savior, who healed the centurion s slave and raised up the widow s son, was not doing anything for John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verses 19 and 20 continue, And John, calling a certain two of his disciples to him, sent them to the Lord, saying, Are You the One who is coming, or should we expect another?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And coming up to Him, the men said, John the Baptist sent us to You, saying, Are You the One who is coming, or should we expect another?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John the Baptist s word here does not mean that he was in doubt concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He questioned Christ in this way in order to provoke Him to deliver him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He knew that Christ was the coming One, and he had strongly recommended Him to the people John 1:26-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After that, he was put into prison and there he waited, expecting that Christ would do something to deliver him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, the Lord did nothing for him, although He did much to help others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When John heard this, he was in danger of being stumbled Luke 7:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, he sent his disciples to the Lord with such a provoking question.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is right to consider together the three cases in 7:1-35.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord did something for the centurion and the widow, who were not related to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But He did not do anything for the one who was His forerunner, who had been cast into prison for His sake.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although the Man-Savior did many things for others, He did not do anything for John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was the reason John tried to provoke the Lord Jesus to do something for him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 7:22 and 23 we have the Lord s answer to John the Baptist s question: Go and report to John what you have seen and heard: the blind are receiving sight, the lame are walking, the lepers are being cleansed, and the deaf are hearing, the dead are being raised, and the good news is being brought to the poor; and blessed is he who is not stumbled in Me. In verse 22 the Lord first speaks of the blind receiving sight.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There was no such miracle in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By this, He gave clear evidence to John that only the Messiah could have done such a miracle Isa 35:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In spiritual significance, the blind receiving sight is also first.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Lord s salvation He first opens our eyes Acts 26:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we can receive Him and walk to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The lame signifies those who cannot walk in God s way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After being saved, the lame can walk by new life John 5:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The deaf signifies those who cannot hear God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After being saved, they can hear the Lord s voice John 10:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The dead signifies those who are dead in sins Eph 2:1, 5 , unable to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After being regenerated, they can fellowship with God with their regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The poor signifies everyone without Christ, without God, who have no hope in the world Eph 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Upon receiving the gospel, they are made rich in Christ 2 Cor 8:9; Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What would you have said if you had been John and had received the word spoken by the Lord in verse 22?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Perhaps you would have said, I don t want to hear this kind of report.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Lord, what will You do about me?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You give sight to the blind, You make the lame to walk, You cleanse the lepers, You cause the deaf to hear, You raise the dead, and You bring good news to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I would like to hear some good news concerning my situation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Lord, what will You do for me?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I am still in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Didn t You declare the jubilee and proclaim release to the captives?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Lord, I want You to liberate me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In verse 23 the Lord said to John, Blessed is he who is not stumbled in Me. This word implies that John the Baptist was in danger of being stumbled because the Lord did not act on his behalf according to his way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here the Lord encouraged him to take the way the Lord had ordained for him that he might be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In verse 23 the Lord seemed to be saying, John, I have done many things for others, but I shall not do anything for you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not be stumbled in Me. Blessed is the one who is not stumbled in Me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I believe that the Lord s word in verse 23 strengthened John for his coming martyrdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>John knew that Christ could do anything, but He would not do anything for him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although the Lord could have done something, it was right for Him not to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>John must have been convinced by the Lord s word and strengthened by it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In 7:24-28 the Lord Jesus spoke to the crowds concerning John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In verse 26 the Lord Jesus said that John the Baptist was much more than a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In verse 27 He went on to say concerning him, This is he concerning whom it is written, Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Malachi 4:5 prophesied that Elijah would come.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When John the Baptist was conceived, it was said that he would go before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah Luke 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, in a sense, John may be considered Elijah, who is about to come Matt 11:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, the prophecy of Malachi 4:5 will actually be fulfilled in the great tribulation, when the real Elijah, one of the two witnesses, will come to strengthen God s people Rev 11:3-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In Luke 7:31 and 32 the Lord Jesus went on to say, To what then shall I liken the men of this generation, and what are they like?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They are like young children sitting in a marketplace and calling to one another, and saying, We played the flute to you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Pharisees and lawyers v. 30 thought they were experienced and knowledgeable in the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But in verse 32 the Lord likens them to young children.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Christ and John the Baptist played the flute to preach the gospel of the kingdom, but the Pharisees and lawyers did not dance for the joy of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>John and the Lord Jesus also sang a dirge to preach repentance, but these ones did not weep for the grief of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The righteousness of God required them to repent, but they would not obey.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The grace of God afforded them salvation, but they would not receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In verse 33 the Lord continues, For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>John the Baptist, who came to bring men to repentance and cause them to grieve for sin, had no taste for eating or drinking 1:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Because John the Baptist lived in a strange and peculiar way, not eating and drinking in the regular way, the opposers accused him of being demon-possessed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In verse 34 the Lord says, The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a wine drinker, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Christ is not only the Savior, but also the Friend of sinners, the One who sympathized with their problems and sensed their griefs.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He came to bring salvation to sinners and cause them to rejoice in it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, He had the joy of eating and drinking with them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In 7:31-34 the Lord Jesus was actually rebuking that generation.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When He declared the jubilee, that was the playing of the flute.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But the men of that generation did not respond by dancing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Likewise, when He and John the Baptist sang a dirge, the people did not repent.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Instead, they said that John had a demon and that the Lord Jesus was a glutton, a wine drinker, and a friend of tax collectors and sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In verse 35 the Lord concludes, And wisdom is justified by all her children.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This wisdom is Christ 1 Cor 1:24, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Whatever Christ did was done by the wisdom of God, which is Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This wisdom is justified by all her children.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Those who believe in Christ are the children of wisdom, those who justify Christ and His deeds and follow Him as their wisdom.</S>
