   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MUCH BETTER TO BE HEALED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are also some believers who have gone to another extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to their natural disposition, they are hard and stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, through God's allowed sickness, they have become broken by God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As a result of going along with God's will through His chastisement, they have become very gentle, kind, yielding, and holy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Accordingly, they consider that being sick is a great benefit for them, and they begin to love sickness more than health.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They think that sicknesses cause their spiritual life to advance greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, they do not seek healing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If they realize that they should be healed, they would rather have God heal them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They accept all the sicknesses that come upon their bodies, thinking that it is easier for them to be godly when they are sick than when they are healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They think they are closer to God when they are lonely and in pain than when they are well and active.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They think it is far better to lie in bed than to be free to run around.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They do not want to ask for healing from God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They think that it may be more profitable to be weak than to be strong!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We admit that many believers have given up their evil works by becoming sick, and that they have acquired some profound experiences through their sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We also admit that many handicapped and disabled persons have exceptionally godly and spiritual experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But we must say that many believers are quite unclear concerning several points in this area.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although one who is sick can be holy, such holiness is compelled.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps if he were healthy and could choose freely, he would want to turn back to the world and his natural self.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He becomes holy only when he is sick, and he becomes worldly when he is not sick.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord has to keep him in sickness continuously before he can be holy continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His holiness is dependent on his sickness!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A living that is for the Lord should not be restricted to times of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not let others think that the only way God can subdue a believer is by sickness, and that without sickness, he is incapable of glorifying God in his daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A believer should express God's life in his daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>While it is good to endure suffering, it is better to obey God at a time when one is full of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should know that healing is of God; it is God who heals us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we seek after healing through man's medicine, we will find ourselves separated from God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, if we seek after God's healing, we will become more intimate with God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A person who receives God's healing will glorify God more than one who remains in sickness for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is true that sickness can glorify God because sickness provides God an opportunity to manifest His healing power John 9:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if one remains sick all the time, how can God be glorified?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When one receives God's healing, he sees God's glory through the demonstration of His power.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord Jesus never considered sickness as a blessing, as something which believers should bear until they die.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Neither did He say that sickness is an expression of love from God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus desired His disciples to bear the cross, but He never said that the sick should remain in sickness all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He told the disciples the manner in which they should suffer for Him, but He never said that they should suffer sickness for His sake.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although He said we would have suffering in the world, He did not consider sickness a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He indeed suffered while He was on the earth, but He was not sick.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Moreover, every time He saw sick ones, He healed them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He always considered sickness to be from sin and the devil.</S>
