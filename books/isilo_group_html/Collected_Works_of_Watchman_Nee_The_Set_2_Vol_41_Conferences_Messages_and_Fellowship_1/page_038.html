Ephesians 2:10 says, "We are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them." When the Lord ascended to heaven, He assigned works to each of His servants. On the one hand, we do not necessarily have the same gift; therefore, there is the need for humility. On the other hand, everyone has some gift; therefore, there is the need for mutual encouragement. If a man does not fulfill the portion that the Lord has assigned to him, no one else can replace his portion. Yet it is equally bad for someone to overstep another person's portion. Every Christian on this earth has a special journey that the Lord has assigned to him. He has to take the journey himself. No one else can replace him, nor can he replace anyone else.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 41: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (1) &nbsp; pg 38</div><br></body></html>
