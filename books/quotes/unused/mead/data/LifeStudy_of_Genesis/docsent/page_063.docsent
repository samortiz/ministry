   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a. Life Conforms the Believers to the Image of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Brings Them into Glory</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible says that it is life which conforms the believers to the image of the Son of God Rom 8:2, 6, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only by the way of life can we be conformed to the image of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Romans 8:2 speaks of "the Spirit of life," and verse 6 mentions that the mind set on the spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is by this life of the Spirit that we can be conformed to the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Also, it is Christ as life who brings us into God's glory to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Colossians 3:4 tells us that Christ our life will bring us into God's glory that we may express God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This confirms the claim that it is by God's life that we express God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Resurrection Life Gives Authority</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible also shows that it was the budding resurrection life which gave authority to Aaron's rod Num 17:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Twelve rods representing the twelve tribes of Israel were placed in the presence of the Lord for one night.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Each rod was a piece of dry, dead wood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>During the night, Aaron's rod budded, signifying that resurrection life had authorized his rod to reign over the people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, life gives authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you are going to be a leading one in the church, you need a great deal of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Elders are assigned not only by the outward appointment but by the inward authorization in life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All elders should be matured in life and qualified to rule by this reigning life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is also true for the deacons, the deaconesses, and the leading ones in the service groups.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only life can assign authority.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Revelation 20:4 says that it is the overcoming resurrection life which brings believers into the reign with Christ during the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Resurrection life brings us into the kingship with Christ because it proceeds out of the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The throne of God signifies authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We see a picture of this in Revelation 22:1 where the water of life issues out of the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, authority and life are mutually related.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The river of life is related to the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we have the throne of God as our source, we will be in the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are in the water of life, it will bring us to the throne of God, giving us the authority that proceeds from His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Life brings authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all must see that representing God requires God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The First Step Creating Man as a Vessel</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>to Contain God as Life</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first step of God's procedure in fulfilling His purpose was to create man as a vessel to contain Himself as life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I like this word vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do you realize that as a human being you are a vessel?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A vessel is like a bottle or a cup.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today, while I was with the Lord, I was rejoicing because I am a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I said to myself, "Man, you are exactly like a bottle.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Your mouth resembles the mouth of a bottle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The purpose of a bottle is to contain something, not to contain yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You are a vessel designed to contain God."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is not my concept.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was presented initially in Genesis and then stated emphatically by Paul in Romans 9 when he said, "Who are you, trying to argue with God?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Don't you realize that you are clay?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The potter has sovereign authority to mold the clay into vessels."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Romans 9:21, 23 reveals that God created man as a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are vessels to contain God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, after God created man, He put him in front of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The tree of life was good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In John 6 the Lord Jesus said that He was edible, that He was the bread of life John 6:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, we all can eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, we contain whatever we eat because it comes into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our being is simply a vessel to contain everything we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whatever we eat is not only contained in us, but is assimilated into our very element.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It even becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, dietitians say, "You are what you eat."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are not only containing vessels; we are eating vessels, vessels that assimilate what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God is desirous of being eaten by us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we tell God that we want to eat Him, He will be very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are His eating and assimilating vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Eventually, God will become us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We were made vessels to contain God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Romans 9:21, 23 tells us that we are vessels unto honor, vessels of mercy prepared unto glory.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Do not look down on me.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I am a vessel unto honor, not dishonor.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>One day I will be filled with glory and I will be in glory to express the God of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We all are vessels of mercy prepared unto glory.</S>
