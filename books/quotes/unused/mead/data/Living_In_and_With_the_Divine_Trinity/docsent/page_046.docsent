   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we want to continue our fellowship concerning our living in the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we use the word living, we mean abiding.</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, to abide in the Triune God is to dwell in the Triune God, to have our home in the Triune God, to live in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Triune God is embodied in the Son, and the Son as the embodiment of the Triune God with all His members is the organism of the Divine Trinity to produce fruit for the expression of the Triune God.</S>
