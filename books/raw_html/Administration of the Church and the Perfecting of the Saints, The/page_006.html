        <h2 class="head2">Expressing Opinions</h2>
<p>We can make suggestions when we fellowship with the elders, but we should not have opinions. For example, it does not matter how the chairs in the meeting hall are arranged. Suppose someone insists that the chairs should be upside down. Can we accept such a suggestion? In order to keep the oneness in the church, we must learn to have no opinions. We should not think that having opinions is a small matter. If we have a problem with opinions, the worms of controlling and insisting on one&rsquo;s views will crawl out. As long as a matter does not involve fornication, sins, or idol worship, we should do our best to keep the oneness by not expressing our opinions.</p>
<p>I once rode with four brothers. When we came to a fork in the road, we stopped, and the four brothers began to discuss which road to take. They discussed for forty minutes but still could not reach a conclusion. I eventually told the brothers that it did not matter which road we took, because if we had not stopped to discuss which road to take, we would have already arrived at our destination.</p>
<p>The elders&rsquo; meeting is an indication of whether a local church dwells in oneness. There is hardly a locality in which the elders do not argue. The elders are like a married couple; it is rare to find elders who do not argue with one another. Some elders may not argue, but as long as they have different opinions or views, it is hard for them to be calm and peaceful. Our opinion is a small worm, but it will eat up the oneness. Hence, we must be careful. We must learn the lesson of not expressing our opinions with the brothers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having the Temperament of a Donkey</h2>
<p>A brother with the temperament of a donkey does not submit to others. A person with such a temperament thinks that he is superior to others. Almost every Christian desires to stand out and does not want to be a little lamb. Some brothers think that they are more qualified than the elders in the church. This is to have the temperament of a donkey. Often brothers who are unwilling to be elders also have the temperament of a donkey. Such brothers may say that they do not need to be elders, because Brother So-and-so is an elder. We are all born of Adam and therefore have the temperament of a donkey, so we are hard to deal with. If a donkey is in the midst of a flock of sheep and kicks and jumps wildly, thinking that he is higher than others, the flock will definitely suffer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being a &ldquo;Dragonfly&rdquo; in the Air</h2>
<p>Some people are like &ldquo;dragonflies&rdquo; in the air, flying aimlessly and always bumping into things. If such a brother is an elder, many saints will be crushed to death. Such impetuous people tear down the oneness among the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Playing &ldquo;Monkey&rdquo; Tricks</h2>
<p>In the church quite a few brothers play clever tricks like a monkey. We have suffered much from this in the church over the years. This worm has devastated the oneness in many local churches. We should have prospered more under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing, but our oneness was eaten by the worm of people&rsquo;s trickery. As a result, we lost some of the blessing. What a tragic situation!</p>
<h2 class="head2">Playing Politics</h2>
<p>In the church it is better to be honest and simple. Of course, we need to exercise wisdom so that we know when we should speak and when we should not speak. However, we must not play politics. Playing politics can be likened to burying a corpse in the snow. When the snow melts, the corpse will be exposed. Playing politics gives place to the devil. Some people are not even aware that they are playing politics, because it is their habit. In our dealings with the saints we must be loyal, faithful, and sincere in the spirit. The more we are in the spirit, the simpler we will be. A simple person will gain the spiritual trust of the saints, and trust will bring in the blessing. If the saints lose spiritual trust in the responsible brothers, the church will lose its blessing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Evading Problems</h2>
<p>We should not create problems in the church, nor should we evade problems. Some people always evade problems; they leave the problems for others to bear. The more we evade problems, the bigger the problems will become. It is impossible to have no problems in the church. When problems arise, we should bring them to the Lord in prayer. We should pray with the saints in order to deal with and swallow up the problems, thus taking the problems as our bread (cf. Num. 14:9). We should not play politics or use trickery to deal with the problems. Politics and trickery generate problems and do further damage to the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Clever</h2>
<p>We need wisdom, not cleverness, in order to administrate the church. Cleverness is the most harmful worm because it subtly brings many problems into the church. We cannot afford to be careless in this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Assuming Positions</h2>
<p>Assuming positions means that some assume the position of an apostle or an elder in the church. When the testimony of the church begins in a locality, some saints serve zealously and assume the position of an elder. These saints think that they are the only ones qualified to be elders. When the co-workers go to such places to serve, these brothers are accommodating, but the service is not smooth. Some brothers who should be elders are unwilling to be elders, but others who should not be elders assume the position of an elder. This is the primary reason that some local churches are not strong.</p>
<p>These ten worms are ten intrinsic factors that damage the oneness in the church. If instead of being watchful we allow these ten worms to continue to eat, the oneness of the church will be destroyed. The most terrible thing about worms is that they cannot be seen from the surface. By the time we see them, it is already too late. Whether in a family or in the church, the oneness is crucial and must not be damaged. When the oneness is damaged, the ointment will not flow, and the dew will not descend. Some churches do not receive the blessing, because the oneness has been damaged. If we would deal with these worms, within a short period of time the churches would be blessed. If the oneness between a husband and wife is not damaged, the family will be blessed. If the oneness in the church is not damaged, the church will also be blessed, even if there are no gifted persons in the church. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would be on guard against these ten worms. Then the church will dwell together in oneness and receive the God-commanded blessing.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
