<h1 class="title">LOVING THE LORD TO EXPERIENCE<br />
HIS MANIFESTATION AND HIS ABIDING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 14:19-23; Exo. 33:14</h1>
<p>In John 14:19-20 the Lord said, &ldquo;Because I live, you also shall live. In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; In these verses the Lord said that after He resurrected from the dead, He would regenerate us by entering into us to be our life. Therefore, we live because He lives; we live in His resurrection life with Him. This is the reason we will know that the Lord is in the Father and is one with the Father, that we are in the Lord and are one with the Lord, and that the Lord is in us and is one with us. This is the situation of everyone who has been saved.</p>
<p>Verses 21 through 23 go on to say, &ldquo;He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him. Judas, not Iscariot, said to Him, Lord, and what has happened that You are to manifest Yourself to us and not to the world? Jesus answered and said to him, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&rdquo; This shows that after we are saved, our living should be one in which the Lord manifests Himself to us and makes an abode with us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S PRESENCE BEING HIS MANIFESTATION</h2>
<p>Let us look at the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation from the example of Moses in the Old Testament. In Exodus 33:14 God said, &ldquo;My presence shall go with you, and I will give you rest.&rdquo; In this verse the word <em>presence</em> in the original language means &ldquo;face.&rdquo; This means that God&rsquo;s countenance, His face, would go with Moses and give Moses rest.</p>
<p>God asked Moses to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt. When they left Egypt and arrived at Mount Sinai, God called Moses to the top of the mountain while the children of Israel waited at the base of the mountain. However, when they saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, they made a golden calf and worshipped it (32:1-6). Worshipping the idol greatly offended God. God said that Moses would still lead the children of Israel into the land of Canaan, a land flowing with milk and honey, but He Himself would not go up in their midst (33:1-3). God seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Moses, take the Israelites up to the land. I will send an Angel to help you drive out all your enemies so that you may gain the land of Canaan as your dwelling place, but I will not go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Moses heard this word, he prayed and negotiated with God (vv. 12-17). Moses seemed to be saying, &ldquo;You brought the children of Israel out of Egypt. It was not I who brought them out of Egypt. I was not looking for You when I was shepherding the flock of sheep in the wilderness; You looked for me and asked me to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt into the land of Canaan. I did not initiate this; You did. These are Your people, not mine. Yes, they committed a sin and worshipped the idol. But since You brought them out of Egypt, You still have to bear this responsibility. If You will not bear this responsibility, neither will I. If You withdraw, I will also withdraw. If You want me to bring them into the land, You must go with us. If You will not go with us and lead us, we will not go further.&rdquo; In verses 15 and 16 Moses uttered a strong prayer in which he negotiated with God. After he prayed, God was bound and had to agree. God told Moses not to withdraw. God also assured Moses that He would bear the responsibility and that His presence, His face, would go with Moses.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s face is His presence. A brother once asked, &ldquo;What is the difference between God&rsquo;s face going with us and God going with us?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Many times the Lord goes with a person, but He hides His face from that person. It is not that the Lord does not go with you. He goes with you, but He hides His face. His face is not manifested.&rdquo; I gave an illustration: &ldquo;Suppose five of us travel to another city to preach the gospel. However, while we are traveling, I hide my face. Even though I am traveling with you, you do not see my face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Moses led the children of Israel on their journey to the land of Canaan, Moses did not lose God&rsquo;s presence, God&rsquo;s face. God was always manifested to Moses. God did not only accompany Moses by walking with him; God also manifested Himself to Moses throughout the journey. Every day Moses saw God face to face. Moses had God&rsquo;s face, God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>In the New Testament age the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is to save us into Himself so that we are joined to Him in life and in essence. The Lord&rsquo;s salvation is not focused on our being forgiven of our sins so that we are spared from perdition to wait for the enjoyment of some eternal blessing in the future. This is not the focus of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation; rather, this is only a human concept. It is true that the Lord&rsquo;s salvation solves the problem of our sins and that there is forgiveness of our sins and deliverance from perdition. However, this is not the meaning or the goal of salvation. The meaning of salvation is to bring those who are outside the Lord into Him. We often address believers as &ldquo;brothers and sisters in the Lord,&rdquo; or when referring to a believer, we say, &ldquo;He is a person in the Lord.&rdquo; Sometimes when we speak of unbelievers, we say, &ldquo;They are not in the Lord. They do not have the Lord. Only believers are in the Lord.&rdquo; Do not think that this is merely an expression; it is a fact. Being in the Lord is a fact. God is saving us from being outside of the Lord to being in the Lord. We are people in the Lord.</p>
<p>Some may ask how to become a person who is in the Lord. The Lord shed His blood on the cross for our sins. Therefore, when we believe into the Lord, we are forgiven of our sins and are cleansed (Heb. 9:22; Acts 10:43; 1 John 1:9). The Lord became the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection from the dead (1 Cor. 15:45b). Now the Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), and He is able to enter into us so that we can be joined to Him (John 1:12-13). We can use a microphone as an example. As soon as it is plugged into an outlet, electricity enters into it. When electricity is transmitted into the microphone, the microphone is in the current of electricity; it is in electricity. We can all understand this example. A three-year-old child, however, would not be able to understand that the microphone is in electricity, because he thinks that electricity is intangible. To him, it is incomprehensible that the microphone can be in electricity. Those who have some knowledge of physics know that since electricity has been transmitted into the microphone, the microphone is in electricity.</p>
<p>Similarly, those who believe in the Lord Jesus are in Him because the Lord is the Spirit, and His Spirit has come into us. We are in Him because we have the Lord Spirit. If we were to tell unbelievers that we are in the Lord Jesus, they would say that this is superstition, because Jesus Christ is intangible to them. It is hard for them to believe, because they can neither see nor touch Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, this is our experience. We know that the Spirit is in us, and therefore we live in Him. We are joined to the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17). A saved person has the Lord in him, and he is in the Lord. He is joined to the Lord.</p>
