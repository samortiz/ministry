<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO KNOW THIS POWER</h2><p>Because it is important that believers have the proper knowledge of this power, the Apostle Paul prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of God and know the surpassing greatness of the power that is toward us who believe. Yes, we have the surpassingly great power within us, but our need today is to know this power. Whether you are aware of it or not, there is a transmission taking place from the third heaven, the place where God is, into us. It is this transmission that makes us different from unbelievers. Because of this power within us, it is impossible for us to cast off our Christian faith. Again I say that within us there is the divine power and that this power is the Triune God who has passed through creation, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension and has been installed in us as the all-inclusive power. Thus, there is a divine connection between us and the third heaven. What we need today is to know the surpassing greatness of this power.</p><h2 class="head1">SPEAKING AND THE EXPERIENCE<br />OF THE TRANSMISSION</h2><p>We need to read these verses in Ephesians again and again until we are deeply impressed with them and can speak them forth. Every day we need to speak them to ourselves, to those in our family, to the brothers and sisters, to the angels and demons, and to all the created beings. The more we speak of this power, the more we shall experience it being transmitted into us.</p><p>Eventually, through our faith in this transmission and through our speaking it forth, the church will come forth in a practical way. Christ is the Head over all things to the church. We need to believe this and speak it continually. For the sake of a better church life, I would suggest that we all speak 1:19-23 ten times a day. Let us see what the result will be if we all do this. How much better is this kind of speaking than vain talk about the brothers and sisters or the situation in the church! Talking about the saints does not lift us up and strengthen us; on the contrary, it brings us down and weakens us. If all the saints talk this way, the church life will disappear. Therefore, let us speak 1:19-23 and forget about the situation with the churches, the elders, and the brothers and sisters. For a period of ten days, let all of us in the church speak these verses ten times a day. I believe that if we do this, the church life will be uplifted, for as we speak, the transmission will take place. In this way we shall be infused with divine power from the heavenly transmission. From experience I can testify that this will happen.</p><p>We are too natural, too logical, and too low. Let us forget about the condition of the churches and the saints and come back to God&rsquo;s speaking. Let us return to the pure word of God. Let us believe God&rsquo;s word and speak it. As we speak, we shall experience the heavenly transmission, and we all shall be infused with the Triune God as the all-inclusive power. This great power is to the church. Here, in the transmission of the divine power, we have a solid church life.</p><p>We should not study Ephesians 1 merely for doctrine. Rather, we must believe God&rsquo;s speaking of the universal fact. We not only believe God&rsquo;s speaking, but we ourselves echo it again and again. In this way we experience the transmission of the divine power that is to the church.</p>
