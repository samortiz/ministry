   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sin is ugly and the world is possessing, yet they are still outward.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to see further how to experience life in a deeper way dealing with the flesh and the self.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most people on the earth are not Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>America is reportedly a Christian country; about half of the people say that they are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yet, most of them are not even regenerated, that is, having received the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Of those who have been regenerated, many are still living in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more mature Christians stay away from sin, yet very few are not possessed by the world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Lord's recovery, Christians talk about dealing with the flesh and the self.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a much deeper aspect of the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This short lesson cannot cover these two topics adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We will only get a basic understanding at this point.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You must read The Experience of Life to get more details.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I. THE DEFINITION OF THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can find at least three definitions in the Bible of the flesh: A. The Corrupted Body</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first definition of the flesh in the Bible is our corrupted body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The body is the body created by God; flesh is something corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God did not create a flesh; He only created a body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But Satan came into the members of this body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Romans 7:23 tells us clearly that the law of sin is in the members of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Adam ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, that fruit entered into the members of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>So the body is created by God, but sin as a personified matter, Satan himself, entered into man, into his body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since then man's body created by God became corrupted and ruined.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That corrupted and ruined body is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>B. The Whole Fallen Man</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The flesh does not refer merely to man's fallen and corrupted body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, it refers to the totality of man's fallen being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The flesh is therefore the uttermost expression of the fallen tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, the flesh in this sense includes man's body, soul, and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you consider the works of the flesh listed in Galatians 5:19-21, you will find that some, such as fornication, uncleanness, sensuality, and drunkenness, are related to the lust of the corrupted body; others, such as enmities, strife, angers, and divisions, are related to the fallen soul; and still others, idolatry and sorcery, are related to the deadened spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This proves that the three parts of our fallen being are involved with the evil flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, in Galatians the flesh denotes the whole of man's fallen being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The flesh is not just a part of man's fallen being; it includes the totality of the fallen tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>C. The Good Aspect of Man</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Usually when we mention the flesh, we think that the flesh is corrupt and wicked, just as mentioned in Galatians 5:19-21.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the Bible shows us that the flesh has not only an evil aspect, but also a good aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The good flesh desires to do good and to worship and serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul in Philippians 3:3-6 indicated that there were some who worshipped God in the flesh and boasted in their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The flesh there undoubtedly refers to flesh in its good aspect, for by it man worships God and through it man boasts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why is there a good aspect of man or of the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because although we are the people who fell deeply, we still have some good element which was originally created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, we often want to do good and serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But, after all, man or the flesh in its good aspect is weak and powerless, not being able to do either.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the sight of God, we, the fallen men, controlled by the flesh, wholly became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Anything which originates in us, whether good or bad, is of the flesh and does not please God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, not only our temper, hatred, or anything against God which originates in us are of the flesh, but the gentleness, love, and even the service to God which originates in us are also of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whatever originates in us, whether good or bad, is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to know the flesh to such an extent; then we have really touched the meaning of the flesh.</S>
