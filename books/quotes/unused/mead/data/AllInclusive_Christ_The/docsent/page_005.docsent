   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE GOODNESS OF THE LAND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ITS SPACIOUSNESS Scripture Reading: Deut 12:9; Heb 4:8, 9, 11; Eph 3:17, 18; Phil 3:7, 8, 10, 12-14; Exo 3:8; Deut 4:25</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen in the Old Testament that the land with its temple and city is the center of God s plan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What God planned to do on this earth was to obtain that piece of land with the temple and the city built upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The temple is the center of God s presence, and the city is the center of God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God s presence and God s authority could only be realized by the temple and the city built upon that piece of land.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I must ask you to consider the whole record of the Old Testament more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The entire Old Testament deals with that piece of land and its temple and city.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE TYPE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have already seen that this land is the full type, the all-inclusive type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We know that there are many types in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We know that the passover lamb is a type of Christ, and we know that the manna is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The tabernacle with all its furniture, utensils, and various offerings is also a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But I wish to point out to you that without this piece of land, there is no all-inclusive type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The passover lamb is not the all-inclusive type, and neither is the manna or even the tabernacle with all the things related to it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many different kinds of offerings were ordained by the Lord, but they only depicted various aspects of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only the land of Canaan is the full type, the all-inclusive type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have all accepted Christ as our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That is quite wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But we must realize that Christ as the Redeemer is not the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are told in the Scriptures that Christ is all and in all, that Christ is the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everything is in Him and He is in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is no other type in the Old Testament but the land of Canaan which shows Him as such.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What do we mean by the word all-inclusive ?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are told that Christ is the light, but this is not all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are told that Christ is our life, but this also is not all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are told that Christ is the food and the living water, but even these do not make Him the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is not only the light, the life, the food, and the living water, but Christ is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whatever you need, whatever you contact, whatever you obtain, whatever you enjoy, whatever you experience all these things must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is the all-inclusive One to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are not speaking doctrinally but very practically.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whenever you do something, whenever you enjoy something, whenever you use something, you must immediately apply Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For instance, you are sitting on a seat.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do you realize that this is not the real seat?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is but a shadow, a figure pointing to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is the real seat.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you do not have Christ, it means that in your entire life you have never had a seat.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is no rest for you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You have nothing to rely upon.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You have something false, for Christ is the real thing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let me tell you something which may sound strange to you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sometimes when I put on my glasses, I say, Lord, these are not real glasses; You are my real glasses.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Without You, I can see nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without You, I have no sight.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you have Christ and the way to experience Him, you have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you do not have Christ and know not how to apply Him and experience Him in such a practical way, you have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When you are climbing the stairs, do you realize that Christ is the real stairs to you?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You are told that Christ is the way, and without Him there is no way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>So when you are walking or driving, you must say, Lord, You are my way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Without You I have no way, I have no way to do things, I have no way to go on, I have no way to be a person.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ is everything to us, so Christ is our way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many times during the past years of serving the Lord I have encountered problems between the husband and wife.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many times the brothers have come to me and said, Brother Lee, would you kindly tell me a better way to deal with my wife?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>My answer is always this: Brother, there is no better way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The better way is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>And I would say the best way is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Almost every time I answer in such a way, people do not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They always query, What do you mean by that?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>So I tell them, Brother, I mean that Christ is the best way for you to deal with your dear wife.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Sometimes they press me to tell them in detail how to live, how to get along, and how to deal with their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then I tell them, Brother, I have told you clearly, Christ is the best way for you to deal with your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It s quite simple.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Forget about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Just come to the Lord in your spirit to have a personal contact with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Come and tell Him, Lord, You are my life, You are my way, You are everything to me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>So I come to You once more to take You as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I take You as the way to deal with my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then be assured that you will know.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I cannot tell you what to do, but the Lord Himself will be your way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Believe me.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The sisters especially like to go into detail about their marital problems.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They say, Oh, brother, please give me some time.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Be patient with me.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Let me tell you the whole story.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I tell them, Sister, I have the patience; I am ready to listen to you.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But I tell you, it is all useless.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The more you say, the more you tell me about this and that, the more you will get into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Be simple.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Just kneel down and from your spirit say something to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Don t say something to me.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This doesn t mean I don t want to hear you, but I cannot point out any better way than Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You have to contact Christ once more.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Eventually most of the brothers and sisters have been convinced and have come to know something of Christ in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They have come to me and said, Now I know that Christ is the best way for me to deal with my wife ; Christ is the best way for me to deal with my husband.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You see, this is not merely a doctrine or some sort of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>You must experience it.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You must apply Christ to your daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The people of Israel enjoyed the passover lamb and then the manna day by day for forty years, but they were never fully satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>They just applied a little of Christ; they just experienced a small portion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Not until they entered the land of Canaan was He everything to them and were they fully satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When they entered the land, what they ate came from the land, what they drank came from the land all their living came out of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The land was everything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>No other type in the Old Testament is so all-inclusive as the land of Canaan.</S>
