   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-ONE IN CHRIST Date: October 17, 1936, evening</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Kulangsu, Amoy</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:30a; Eph 1:3</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our messages during the past few evenings have been fragmentary in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Beginning from tonight they will be more systematic.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I hope that in the next few days, I can impress you deeply with the matter of being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The words in Christ are very simple, but their significance is profound.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without being in Christ, there is no gospel and there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If there is not such a thing as being in Christ, there is not even Christianity, and there is certainly no redemption and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everything that God has done is done in Christ and not in man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everything that God has accomplished within us is done in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>GOD NOT DEALING WITH INDIVIDUALS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Tonight is an introductory word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Following this, every evening we will see a little more about being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ephesians 1:3 says that God "has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may think that God is redundant and cumbersome by adding the words "in Christ" after the words "every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It seems unnecessary to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why does God's Word say this?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we understand this, we will understand Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We also will understand God's plan of redemption and how His work is accomplished in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In God's plan of redemption, He does not deal with man individually.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible shows us that God does not deal with the world as individuals, but as a corporate whole.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God does not ask how many sins and evils you have committed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He only asks if you are in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man pays attention to individual sins, but God has included the world in one man Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can find out what we are from this man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If he did not have a problem, we would not have any problem, and if he has a problem, we have a problem, because we are in him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THERE BEING ONLY TWO MEN IN THE EYES OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the principle of the Scripture, there are only two men in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible says that Adam was the first man the first Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is the second man the last Adam 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some may ask, "What about all the men who were between these two men?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are obviously many men in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why does the Bible only speak of two men?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is because in God's eyes everyone is included in these two men.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Other than these two men, there is not a third man; there is no other man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You are either in Adam or in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Adam is like a big man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once you are born, you are born into this big Adam, and when you believe in the Lord and are regenerated, you are transferred into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>IN ADAM</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I once saw a picture of a woman with a big skirt and under her skirt were many small children.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God views us the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are human beings in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God has put the whole human race into Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can include the children in the parents, and the parents in the grandparents.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Each successive generation is included in the preceding generation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This goes on all the way back to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way we see that everyone is in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today we see that we come from Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Strictly speaking, we are still in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whatever Adam did on that day, we did the same.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When Adam and Eve sinned in the garden of Eden, we sinned as well.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What Adam did we also did.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What does it mean to be in Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I can explain this with an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When I was in Kaifeng, a person asked me what it means to be in Adam and asked me to give him an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I answered, "The Chinese say that our ancestor is Hwang-ti.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once Hwang-ti fought with Tzi-you and killed him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Suppose at that time that Tzi-you was not killed, but that Hwang-ti had been killed instead.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If that had happened, would there still be the Chinese race today?"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He answered, "Of course not."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I said, "Why would there no longer be a Chinese race when Hwang-ti died?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He answered, "Because if Hwang-ti had died, we would have all died."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I argued, "Hwang-ti's death was his business.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our life has nothing to do with him!"</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He said, "No. We all came from Hwang-ti.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If Hwang-ti had died, we all would have died as well."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Tzi-you would not need to kill all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All he would have to do would be to kill Hwang-ti, and all of us who come after him would be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the way the Bible sees Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We do not have to commit sins in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Everyone who is born of Adam has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Adam's experience is our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>First Corinthians 15 says that in Adam we all died.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When Adam died, the whole world died with him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You do not need to search your personal history.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As long as you are in Adam, his experience has become your history.</S>
