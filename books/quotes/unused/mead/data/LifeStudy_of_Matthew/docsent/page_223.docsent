   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FORSAKING JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WITH ITS TEMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After the Lord had been tested and examined and after He had rebuked the scribes and Pharisees, He forsook Jerusalem with its temple.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 23:37-39 the Lord spoke a final word to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After this word, the Lord had nothing more to do with her.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. Jerusalem Killing the Prophets</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 37 says, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Jerusalem and her children were chosen by God to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, when God sent His prophets to them, they killed them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. The Lord as a Hen</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Desiring to Gather Her Children</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Together under Her Wings</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 37 also says, How often I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her young under her wings, and you would not!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It has always been God Himself who cared for Jerusalem, like a bird fluttering over her young Isa 31:5; Deut 32:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, when the Lord Jesus said, I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her young under her wings, He indicated that He was God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord is like a loving bird, fluttering, brooding, over her young.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Often He desired to gather the children of Jerusalem together, but they were not willing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the Lord Jesus was declaring this final word to them, He was still like a loving hen, stretching out His wings to brood over the little ones.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But they were not willing to be gathered under His wings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>C. The House the Temple Left Desolate</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 38 the Lord said, Behold, your house is left to you desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since house here is singular, it must denote the house of God, which was the temple 21:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was the house of God, but now it is called your house, because they had made it a den of robbers 21:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The prophecy about the house becoming desolate corresponds with that in 24:2, which was fulfilled when Titus destroyed Jerusalem with the Roman army in A.D. 70.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the context of the whole Bible, the house here refers to the temple, the unique house, the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But at this point the house of God had become your house ; it was no longer the house of God, but the den of robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Lord was cleansing the temple, He said, My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a den of robbers 21:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In ancient times, according to the book of Ezekiel, God left His temple.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The same thing was happening here.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In chapter ten Ezekiel saw in a vision the glory of God leaving the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, the temple was left desolate for the rebellious Jews, and eventually it was burned and destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here in Matthew 23 the Lord was once again about to leave the house desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not too long afterwards, the temple was destroyed by the Roman army under Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus 23:38 corresponds to 24:2, which indicates that not one stone was to be left upon another.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Both of these verses refer to the desolation of the temple in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the time the temple was destroyed, it was no longer the house of God; rather, it had become the house of rebels.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>D. Not Seeing the Lord until His Coming Back</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 39 says, For I say to you, You shall by no means see Me henceforth until you say, Blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This will be at the Lord s second coming, when all the remnant of Israel will turn to believe in Him and be saved Rom 11:23, 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ezekiel saw the glory leaving the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This glory typified the Lord Jesus, who is the real glory, the manifestation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Israel will not see Him again until His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to Zechariah 12, the remnant of Israel will repent when the Lord comes again.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then they will say to Him, Blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord s word here is brief, but it includes a number of things from the destruction of Jerusalem until the Lord s second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here the Lord made a clear declaration that He, the very glory of God, was leaving the nation of Israel and that they would not see Him until His coming again.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nearly two thousand years have passed since that time, and Israel still has not seen the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some may ask, Does this mean that the Jews have no opportunity to believe in the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As individuals, the Jews still have the opportunity to believe, but as a nation they do not have this opportunity today.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As a nation, Israel is through with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thank the Lord that He is still merciful to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even though He has left the nation of Israel, the back door is still open for individual Jews to come to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today no Jew has the position to come to God as a representative of his nation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But when the Jews are persecuted by their enemies at the end of this age, they will cry out to their God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then Christ will descend and place His feet on the Mount of Olives, which will be cleft like the waters of the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This will enable the Jews to escape from persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At that time they will repent to the Lord and call upon Him, and the nation will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This salvation will be not only for individuals, but for the entire nation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, before the Lord s coming back, it is impossible for the nation of Israel to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But, as we have pointed out, individual Jews can still repent today and come into God s grace.</S>
