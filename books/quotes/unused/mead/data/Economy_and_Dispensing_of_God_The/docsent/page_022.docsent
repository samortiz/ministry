   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE GOD'S DISPENSING AS THE SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THEIR GOSPEL AND WORK Scripture Reading: John 1:14, 16-17, 29; 12:31; Heb 2:14; John 12:24; 19:34; 1 Cor 15:45b; John 20:22; 1 John 2:20, 27; Phil 1:19; John 3:5-6; 15:1, 5; 4:10, 14; 6:49-51, 63; 7:38-39; 15:4-5, 16; 21:15; 1 Pet 2:2; John 15:7; 6:27, 57-58; Exo 16:13b-15, 21; Eph 6:17-18a</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous chapters we have seen that God's economy is to dispense Himself as the unlimited and untraceable supply to the believers for their growth in life and for their living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this chapter we will see God's dispensing as the supply to the believers in their preaching of the gospel and in their work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>During the past few years we have been speaking quite much about preaching the gospel through door knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Door knocking is not for door knocking itself, but for the spreading of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This spreading and preaching of the gospel is simply to dispense Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since we do have Christ, we can go to others and dispense Christ into them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through our speaking, gradually, word by word and sentence by sentence, we dispense Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our door knocking is different from that of the Mormons and the Jehovah's Witnesses: our door knocking is for the ministering, dispensing, and distributing of Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to carry out such a dispensing work, we need the rich supply of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Divine Trinity, the very Triune God, is the source of our supply.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God is divinely triune.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He as the unique God needs to be triune in order to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For His dispensing work, He is the Father as the source, the Son as the course, and the Spirit as the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the Spirit He is the flow that brings the source with the course into us, so that the riches of the Divine Trinity will become our supply.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These riches are the very source of His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Day by day for us as Christians, it is altogether a matter of dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This matter of dispensing can be illustrated by our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As living creatures, every day we eat and we drink.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our living consists mainly of eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Both eating and drinking are a dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The groceries that we buy are dispensed first into our stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then the spontaneous law of digestion works within us to digest the food.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After digestion, there is the process of assimilation, in which the food that has been dispensed into our stomach is assimilated into our tissues to become our fibers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually, the food even becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every day of our life a dispensing is going on.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is by dispensing that we receive nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is by dispensing that plants and human beings grow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is by dispensing that a small seed becomes a large squash.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I know some brothers who were teen-agers a number of years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now they are married and have children.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some of their children are over ten years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Their growth as well as the growth of their children is the issue and the result of dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may say that this is due to life; however, to say this is too general.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In a particular sense, this is due to dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Dispensing issues in growth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without dispensing we cannot live very long.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our survival depends on a marvelous, God-ordained dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God's ordained way is that we eat and drink every day.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The most important thing in our daily life is eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every day we should eat at least three meals and one snack.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By this dispensing we can work, walk, and be strengthened to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I can stand and speak for two hours because while I am speaking, some dispensing is going on within me.</S>
