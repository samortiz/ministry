Consequently, such a person will surely go to hell. As long as this person is still alive on the earth, he may still be able to hear the gospel of the Lord Jesus' substitutional death; he may still believe and be saved. But if he kills himself, he will destroy, cut off, and annul all chances to hear the gospel and be saved. Listen, salvation and perdition are determined in this life. When it is time for you to die, if you do not believe in the Lord Jesus, you will not have another chance to hear the gospel and be saved. When one commits suicide, his life is terminated; when life is terminated, there is no other chance for him to be saved. Therefore, those who commit suicide will perish. The blood of the one who commits suicide is the seal on his entrance ticket to hell!</P><P>Once I was conducting a meeting in Changchow. I was speaking on the same subject as I am today. That evening there were over fourteen hundred people, including quite a number of male and female high school students. When I came to this point, I thought, "It is useless for me to say this word to them, because I am afraid that none of them have ever had the thought of committing suicide." But the Spirit of the Lord was working in me, and I could not help but speak. I told them very frankly, "If you want to go to hell, you should kill yourselves, and if you kill yourselves, you will surely go to hell." After I finished my speaking that night, a teacher came to me. He had graduated from a university and was an intelligent, educated man. He told me that he thought man's life was very meaningless and that man's living was monotonous. Many times he had thought of killing himself. He was afraid to do so only because of the darkness before him! He said that he now knew that if he killed himself, he would lose all hope of being saved. So he would not dare to do it anymore. After a few days, another high school student came to see me. He told me about his pessimism toward human life. Many times he thought about killing himself but he did not have an opportunity to do so. After he heard the message that day, he dared not harbor that thought any longer.</P><P>Another time while I was conducting a meeting in Amoy, I spoke on the same subject. I said again that if a man commits suicide, he will go to hell. Later on, a woman doctor told me that she had a nurse who was always trying to kill herself. The doctor tried every time to stop her. That evening, after hearing my message, the nurse dared not to have such a thought anymore. Now these people have all believed in the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior. They have received Christ; they are saved; Christ has comforted their hearts and changed their lives, so that now they not only dare not, but need not commit suicide. I do not know how many sitting here today have this kind of motive. Christ will also satisfy your heart. Why try to kill yourself? Why perish and go to hell?</P><P>Once I was working for a few days at a certain college in Nanking. On the last evening during the after-meeting counseling, a college student who was from my native town came and talked with me. He had no difficulty with his tuition. He came from a good family. In class he was in no danger of receiving poor grades on his examinations. But he was very pessimistic toward the human life. Where did man come from? Where was man going? From the time he was in high school, he had lost interest in human life and was very disenchanted. He felt that there was nothing in the world that could satisfy his heart. He felt that there was a need, a craving, and a lack in his heart that nothing in the world could satisfy or console. He was very negative. He was negative toward everything. Life to him was a heavy burden, and it was absolutely meaningless to live on earth. The more he lived, the more he suffered. There was no other attraction to human life except  monotony and pain. He was always lonely, self-contemplative, and melancholy. The more he contemplated, the more he became confused and disillusioned. While he was groping in darkness, he could not see any ray of light. To him, it was better to terminate his burdensome life as soon as possible! He did not want to bear the vexation anymore. He planned to throw his body into the ocean when he returned home to Ninpo by boat during winter vacation. In this way he would part with the world forever and free himself of this troubled life. But after hearing the gospel for a few days, he learned that Jesus Christ has died for all and is living to be our Friend. There was no need for him to die. While we were talking, he received the Lord Jesus as his Savior. After he had made up his mind to receive the Lord, I invited him to tell all these things to God. I then prayed with him. After prayer, he asked me what was the first thing he should do in the morning. I told him that he should find a chance to read the Bible by meditation and prayer, and nourish his spiritual life. I then left him. After a few days, I asked his friend how he was doing. The friend told me that he was different, that he was now a happy person. After another few days, I met his friend again, and I asked about him again. I received the same answer. This man had received the Lord Jesus. He did not want to commit suicide anymore.</P><P>Friends, why do you seek death? I know that you are not satisfied with human life. I know that you are always lonely and bored. I know that your life is monotonous. I know that you sigh all the time. You feel that human life is painful, and tears always fill your eyes. Although you may possess many things of the world, none of them can satisfy your heart. You feel that there is a need and craving in the deepest part of your heart; you want to grasp hold of something that you do not even know to fill up your lack. Indeed, our life is filled with sorrow and pain. There is no taste to anything. This is why many want to kill themselves. But is suicide necessary? Jesus Christ came to save those who are in sorrow. He has comforted the hearts of many people. He has satisfied the cravings of many. He has changed the lives of many people and has wiped away the tears of many. He will help you in the same way, changing your life of sorrow to a life of joy. He is the sun amidst our dark days. He is the song in the midst of the dark night. With Him, your heart can be comforted and cheered. Why should you die? Why do you have to commit suicide and go to hell? O sorrowful and suffering ones, hear the gospel today: the Lord Jesus can and will save you. Receive Him as your Savior and Lord, and all the problems of your human life will be solved.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
