   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>M. Revelation 17:13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"These" refer to the ten kings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some have said that the beast here refers to the Pope.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This cannot be right, because no ten kings have ever given their power to the Pope.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some have said that the beast refers to one of the Roman emperors.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But this is unreasonable too, because never have ten kings given their power to any one Roman emperor.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The ten kings give their power to the beast because they see the beast resurrecting from the dead and reckon that he is a superman and because they see the work of the evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After Christ died and resurrected, the Holy Spirit descended and formed the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After Antichrist dies and resurrects, the evil spirits try to imitate such an operation, and they cause the ten kings to give their power to the beast.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>N. Revelation 17:14</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and they who are with Him, the called and chosen and faithful, will also overcome them."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to the order of the record, we have this verse before verse 16.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But according to the order of the facts, verse 16 occurs before verse 14.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Revelation 19:11 is a detailed account of the war in 17:14.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The actual war is recorded in Revelation 19:11-21.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although many follow the Lamb, the One who overcomes is the Lamb Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is the sharp sword which comes out of the Lamb's mouth and the might of His feet that overcome the enemy and trample him under His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not His followers who overcome the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lamb does not overcome the enemy through His power, but through His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He overcomes because He is the King of kings and Lord of lords.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This speaks of authority, not of power.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are three groups of people who accompany the Lamb: the called, the chosen, and the faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These three groups of people stand in opposition to the great harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who follow the Lamb must be called.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To be called is based on God's own decision.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Originally, the choosing came before the calling, but here, the calling comes before the choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we see that this is a choosing from among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord says that many are called but few are chosen Matt 22:14 , following the order in Revelation 17:14.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Psalms 89:19 explains this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Israelites had been chosen already, but God chose David from among the chosen Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This shows that the saved ones belong to one group all the called ones are saved , while the overcoming ones belong to another group those who are after God's heart .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who follow the Lamb are not only called and chosen, but also faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be faithful is to not care for one's self, but to care for the Lord's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>O. Revelation 17:15</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"And he said to me, The waters which you saw, where the harlots sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This verse explains the meaning of "waters."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since the harlot is a mystery, a sign, and is not interpreted literally, the waters should also be a mystery, a sign, and should not be interpreted literally.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we are satisfied with Christ, we will not be sitting on the waters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we make the saints' fellowship an open fellowship with the world, we will be sitting on the waters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This book tells us that the woman sits in three places:</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>1 On the beast 17:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This speaks of her union with the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>2 On the seven hills v. 9 . This speaks of her taking Rome as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>3 On the waters v. 15 . This speaks of her power reaching the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Why is she sometimes called "the harlot" and sometimes called "the woman"?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The word "woman" refers to her relationship with Rome, while the word "harlot" refers to her relationship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Politically speaking, she is a woman, and religiously speaking, she is a harlot.</S>
