   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE PRODUCING OF THE BRIDE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 10:10 the Lord said, "I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may know this verse and may even have some experience of it, but we need to ask, "Why did the Lord come that we may have life?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord came that we may have life for the unique purpose that the bride might be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can prove this by John 3.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this chapter the words spoken by the Lord are short and simple, yet they are profound.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord came that we may have life, but how can we have this life?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 3 shows that we can have life by being regenerated, born again.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is through regeneration that we receive Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The way to be born again is to be born of water and the Spirit v. 5 . "Water" was the central concept of the ministry of John the Baptist, that is, to terminate people of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Spirit" is the central concept of the ministry of Jesus, that is, to germinate people in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Water deals with all the negative things of our past, burying everything of our old history.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Water buries the old life, and the Spirit brings in the new life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The life which we have received by being born again is a life for us to enter into the kingdom of God v. 3 . Let me give an illustration to help us understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the earth there are a number of kingdoms.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are the plant kingdom, the animal kingdom, and the human kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The only way to enter into a particular kingdom is to have the life of that kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We entered the kingdom of humanity by being born of human parents.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without having been born of human parents, we could never have seen, or entered into, the kingdom of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the universe there is another kingdom, the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The only way that we can enter into this kingdom is by being born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is the kingdom of man, the kingdom of humanity, and there is the kingdom of God, the kingdom of divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all have been born into the kingdom of humanity, but we need to enter into the kingdom of divinity by being born again of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nicodemus thought that to be born again was for him to return to the womb of his mother v. 4 , but to be born again is to be born of water and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means to have our old history buried in the water and to have a new beginning, a new life, a new history, a new day, a new start of life, by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have entered into the kingdom of God by a new birth, by regeneration, by being born of water and the Spirit.</S>
