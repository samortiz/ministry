<h1 class="title">The Body of Christ&mdash;<br />
the Means of the Divine Administration</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 12:12-27</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The apostle&rsquo;s dealing with head covering concerns the Head; his dealing with the Lord&rsquo;s supper (the Lord&rsquo;s table) concerns the Body&mdash;11:3, 17-34:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Regarding the headship of Christ, which represents God and is represented by man, we must keep the divine governmental order ordained by God, without any disorder.</li>
	<li>Regarding the Body of Christ, we must be properly regulated by the apostle&rsquo;s instruction, without any confusion or division.</li>
	<li>The Head is Christ, and the Body is the church (v. 3; 1:2; 12:27); these two&mdash;Christ and the church&mdash;are the controlling and directing factors of the apostle&rsquo;s dealing with the confused and disorderly church:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In chapters one through ten Paul deals with the church&rsquo;s problems first by stressing Christ as God&rsquo;s center and our portion.</li>
		<li>In chapters eleven through sixteen he emphasizes the church as God&rsquo;s goal and our concern.</li>
		<li>Both Christ and the church are crucial to the carrying out of God&rsquo;s administration in His New Testament economy.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The unique mystical Body of Christ is the means for God to carry out His administration&mdash;Rom. 12:4-5; Eph. 1:22-23; 1 Cor. 12:12-13, 25, 27; 11:29:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The mystical Body of Christ is thoroughly and absolutely related to God&rsquo;s administration; apart from the mystical Body of Christ, God has no means, no way, to carry out His administration.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to have a group of saved and regenerated people who have become one to be an organic Body to carry out His administration&mdash;Eph. 3:10-11; 4:16; 1 Cor. 1:2; 12:12-13, 27.</li>
	<li>The mystical Body of Christ, the church, is for Christ&rsquo;s move on earth; the Head is now operating God&rsquo;s administration through the Body&mdash;11:3; 12:12.</li>
	<li>Divisions damage the mystical Body of Christ with respect to the carrying out of God&rsquo;s administration&mdash; 1:2, 10-13; 12:25, 27:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Satan&rsquo;s subtle device is to cut the Body into pieces.</li>
		<li>For centuries God has not been able to carry out His administration because the unique means for this&mdash;the mystical Body of Christ&mdash;has been cut into pieces through division.</li>
		<li>Because we realize that the carrying out of the divine administration requires the unique Body, the mystical Body, we hate division and are absolutely opposed to it&mdash;1:10; 12:25; Acts 20:30; Rom. 16:17-18; Titus 3:10.</li>
		<li>In order that God&rsquo;s administration may be carried out, we must care for the oneness of the unique mystical Body of Christ (Eph. 4:3, 13; John 17:21-23); having such a concern will preserve us in the Body and keep us from any division.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We take care of God&rsquo;s administration by discerning the Body&mdash;1 Cor. 11:29:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To discern the Body is first to realize that Christ has only one mystical Body.</li>
		<li>If we have the proper understanding of the Lord&rsquo;s supper, we shall not be divided by anything; rather, we shall remain in the unique mystical Body of Christ, the means for Christ to carry out His heavenly ministry for the accomplishment of the divine administration.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Body of Christ is the corporate Christ&mdash;12:12-13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In verse 12 <em>the Christ</em> refers not to the individual Christ but to the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The corporate Christ is composed of Christ Himself as the Head and the church as His Body with all the believers as His members.</li>
		<li>All the believers in Christ are organically united with Him (Rom. 12:4-5) and constituted with His life and element (Col. 3:4, 11) and have thus become His Body, an organism to express Him; hence, Christ is not only the Head but also the Body.</li>
		<li>The Bible considers Christ and the church as one mysterious Christ&mdash;Acts 9:4-5:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ is the Head of this mysterious Christ, and the church is the Body of this mysterious Christ; the two have been joined to become the one mysterious Christ&mdash;Eph. 5:32.</li>
			<li>All the saved ones in all times and all space added together become the Body of this mysterious Christ.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Because the reality of Christ is the Spirit, the way to be constituted with Christ to be His Body is to drink the Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 12:13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The baptism into the one Body has positioned us all to drink one Spirit.</li>
		<li>By drinking of the Spirit we are constituted to be the Body.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Blending is the most helpful thing in keeping the oneness of the Body&mdash;vv. 24-25:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The universal Body of Christ is a blending of all the local churches in the divine life&mdash;Col. 4:15-16; Rev. 1:4, 11; 2:7a.</li>
	<li>The goal of the universal blending is the reality of the Body of Christ.</li>
	<li>Blending requires us to be crossed out and be by the Spirit to dispense Christ and do everything for the sake of His Body.</li>
	<li>Blending means that we should always stop to fellowship with others; to have fellowship is to put away our private interests and join with others for a common purpose&mdash;the building up of the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem&mdash;1 John 1:3; Eph. 4:16; Rev. 21:2.</li>
	<li>In the spiritual element all the churches should be blended together as one.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The one Body is the one church of God, manifested in many localities as many local churches&mdash;Eph. 1:22; 1 Cor. 10:32b; 1:2; 12:27; Rev. 1:4, 11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The local churches are many in existence but are still one Body universally in element&mdash;Eph. 4:4.</li>
	<li>All the local churches are and should be one Body universally, doctrinally, and practically&mdash;1 Cor. 4:17; 7:17; 11:16; 14:33; 16:1.</li>
	</ol></li>
