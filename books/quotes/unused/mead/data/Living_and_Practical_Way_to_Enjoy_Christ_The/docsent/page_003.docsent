   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAN BEING A VESSEL OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we need to see what the Word says we are.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The holy Word tells us clearly that we are vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man is a vessel Rom 9:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not many Christians have paid adequate attention to the fact that we are vessels of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christians talk about men being God's creatures or men becoming God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some even go to the highest point by saying that man can be a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in Romans 9 we are told that man is a vessel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A vessel is a container.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is different from a utensil or an instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A vessel is not used to do something but to contain something.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are not supposed to do something for God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Forget about your doing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are destined to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We were made to be containers of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The human concept is that we have to do something for God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even in Christianity many teachers tell people again and again that they need to do something for God, to work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I do not say that this is wrong, but it does not touch God's central thought.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to realize that we are vessels unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God, strictly speaking, does not need us to do something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God needs some containers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to Romans 9 God desires that we be vessels unto honor, vessels unto glory, and vessels of mercy to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brothers and sisters, you have to realize that you are vessels unto God!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The age today is the age of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord's recovery today is to bring back the young generation to His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Mankind, the human race, has continually been falling away from God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now at the end time the Lord is going to bring the human race back to His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's purpose with man is to have man as His container.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the United States the young people are enjoying and tasting all the material things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After the enjoyment of all the material things, after the experience of all the things invented in human culture, they get nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is an emptiness, a vacuum, within them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is because they were made to be vessels of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nothing can fill you up but God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Education, religion, science, physics, marriage, and all the things in human culture cannot satisfy man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nothing can fill man up and satisfy him but God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now is the end of time, the end of all the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is going to do something in a fast way to bring back this generation to His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Romans 9:21 indicates that when God created man, He formed man as a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Man is a vessel of clay but he was destined unto honor and unto glory.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>So Paul says we are vessels unto honor and vessels unto glory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Of course, we are vessels of mercy v. 23 . God had mercy upon us because He has destined us to be His containers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A Coca-Cola bottle is a vessel made to contain Coke.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Man is not a Coca-Cola bottle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Man is a "God-bottle."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Man is a bottle made of clay, but this bottle is different from the Coca-Cola bottle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This bottle has something wonderful within it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Genesis 2:7 says that when God created man, He formed man's body of the dust of the ground and breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Hebrew word for breath in Genesis 2:7 is the same word for spirit in Proverbs 20:27, which refers to the "spirit of man."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This proves that the breath of life breathed into the nostrils of man is the spirit within man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God breathed into man the breath of life because man needs a spirit in order to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A radio has a receiver within it so that it can receive, contain, and express the radio waves from the air.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The outward box of the radio is not good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It needs an inner recipient, an inner receiver.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Within us there is also a receiver, and this receiver is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Man has a human spirit Job 32:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Darwin tells us that men are the descendants of monkeys.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Of course, that is nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Eventually, as Darwin was dying, he repented of his devilish teaching about evolution.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Man is not the descendant of a monkey.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A monkey does not have a spirit, but every man has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Nearly all the Christians have neglected Zechariah 12:1.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This one verse in the Bible ranks the spirit of man with the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It says that the Lord is the One who stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man are three great items.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do you realize that you have something within you which is as important as the heavens and the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Oh, the heavens!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Oh, the earth!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Oh, my spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I have a spirit that is as important as the heavens and the earth!</S>
