   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The New System Taking Care</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of Every Aspect of the Church Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our new system is not a one-sided arrangement; it takes care of every aspect of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, we still keep the big Lord s Day morning meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is to take care of those who come for the bread-breaking meeting and to listen to a message.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are not dropping the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We want to be proper and not go to an extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The elders need to take care of the Lord s Day morning meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They need to prepare a good message, and the subject needs to be appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can speak concerning the burden of the small group meetings in any meeting except the Lord s Day morning meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In that meeting we cannot speak concerning the small group meetings, and we cannot have the truth lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We use the Lord s Day morning meeting to keep the people who come only to listen to a message.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Gradually, as their church life becomes more normal and they begin to know the saints more, we will transfer them to the small groups and the truth lesson meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as there are people sitting in the big meetings on the Lord s Day morning, we must take care of their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second, the elders must work and labor diligently on the ones who come only to the big Lord s Day morning meeting and not to the small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The elders cannot force them to do anything, but they must exercise wisdom to visit them, nourish them, and stir up the hunger in their inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this way they can lead them into the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to work on the small groups in this way, and we need to work on the truth lesson meetings in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is to be faithful to the new system, and this is what it means to continue steadfastly in it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although this is a training, I want to study the matter together with you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After we have studied it, we can bring the result of our study back to our church to practice it in an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the one hand, we must do our best to promote the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the other hand, we cannot give up the big Lord s Day morning meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That meeting more or less helps some people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The big meetings also must be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They should not be like the small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Neither should they follow the format of the truth lesson meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to deliver a solid message, a proper preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some meeting halls use the big Lord s Day morning meetings to conduct the truth classes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is like teaching mathematics in a history class; it is a little of everything but almost nothing in actuality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One and a half years ago, I removed all the co-workers from the meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I was hoping that the meeting halls would not degenerate into a region for the work but that the elders would do the work of management, perfection, and care themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, in order to strengthen the speaking in the big Lord s Day morning meetings, we have asked a few co-workers to return to the meeting halls to help the halls and to support a good preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Still, I am very concerned that once the co-workers return to the meeting halls, they will immediately pick up the work again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The meeting halls must be managed and cared for strictly by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The co-workers do not need to busy themselves with the work there, but their help in sustaining a good preaching is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may take hall one of the church in Taipei as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There are sixty to seventy saints who need to listen to a message when they come on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we turn that meeting into a truth class, they will not come.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every meeting hall has a group of people who are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If they stop coming to the meeting, our attendance will immediately drop by one thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the reason that I deliberately said that it is improper to conduct the Lord s Day morning meeting like a truth class.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whatever we do, we must do properly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we want a Lord s Day morning meeting, we must conduct one properly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Otherwise, it is better not to have one at all.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even if there are only a few dozen people who come to listen to a message, we must still deliver a proper message.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the same time, our truth classes need to be absolutely proper according to the standard of the truth classes.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The small groups also must be proper according to the standard of the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although the small group meetings are somewhat unorganized, we must still encourage everyone to practice them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not forget our slogan: Heaven and earth may pass away, but the small group meetings and the truth lessons must never be forsaken.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our practice will take care of all aspects of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Since the church is a family, it has to take care of the needs of all kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Suppose a family has a two-month-old baby, some teenagers, and some old persons.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It will not work for everyone to eat the same kind of food.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Different kinds of people must have different kinds of food.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to prepare many different kinds of food for many different kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must take care of each group of people properly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We cannot serve one kind of communal cooking to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the reason we have different kinds of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In addition to the big Lord s Day morning meeting, which takes care of those who come for a message, we have the bread-breaking meeting, the prayer meeting, the small group meeting, and the truth classes.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have pointed out in the past that we need a life message after the bread-breaking meeting or the prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some meeting halls, however, do not practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Some do practice this, but the messages they use are not the right ones.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Perhaps it is too much of a burden to prepare the messages in each meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They may not be able to do a good job.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Perhaps the church in Taipei as a whole should pick up this burden and prepare the messages for the various meeting halls as well as make them available to the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The various meeting halls and churches do not necessarily need to use these messages.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They can consider their local situation and use them accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If the elders are flexible and apply these messages in an organic way, the small groups will become vital.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One advantage to reading the messages is that in the sharing time the saints will not ramble in their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The weakness in our meeting lies in the fact that those who have something do not share, but those who have nothing show up at every meeting, open their mouths in every meeting, and speak too long every time they open their mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Some people are all right when they are silent, but once they open their mouths, they turn others away.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Although everyone knows that some stand up and speak every time, no one stops them from their rambling.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Instead, everyone holds back his function and refuses to share the portion that perfects the saints and benefits the church.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The elders must exercise wisdom in managing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There is a time to exercise control.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>After the message, when the time comes for everyone to share, the elders need to exercise control.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The minute they observe that there is some improper or vain sharing, they should stop this speaking and ask others who have something to share to speak instead.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If there is no control, the meeting will flow where the wind blows ; it will not move according to the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we have life messages, we can choose a few passages to read together.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In this way we can save the meeting from rambling, and we will afford the attendants a solid supply.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This can be more beneficial to the saints than listening to a message in the big meetings.</S>
