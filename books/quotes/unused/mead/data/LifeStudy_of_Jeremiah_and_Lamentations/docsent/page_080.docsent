   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. The Deceitful and Incurable Heart of Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the Searching, Test, and Reward of Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jeremiah 17:9-11 is concerned with the deceitful and incurable heart of man and with the searching, test, and reward of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"The heart is deceitful above all things / And it is incurable; / Who can know it?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>/ I, Jehovah, search the heart / And test the inward parts, / Even to give to each one according to his ways, / According to the fruit of his doings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>/ As a partridge broods over what she has not laid, / A man makes riches but not rightly; / In the midst of his days they will leave him, / And at his end he will be a fool."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even this word regarding the deceitful and incurable heart of man is related to God's economy with His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yes, man's heart is corrupt and deceitful; its condition is incurable.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nevertheless, even such a heart can be a tablet upon which God writes His law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Concerning this, Jehovah says, "I will put My law within them and write it upon their hearts" 31:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This reveals that God has a way to put Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once He has come into man, God will spread from man's spirit into his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is God's way, according to His economy, to deal with the heart of fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>F. Jeremiah's Trusting Prayer to Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 17:12-18 we have Jeremiah's trusting prayer to Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jeremiah began his prayer by saying, "A throne of glory set on high from the beginning / Is the place of our sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>/ You are the hope of Israel, O Jehovah; / All who forsake You will be put to shame" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>12-13a .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 13b goes on to say that those who turn away from Jehovah will be written in the earth because they forsook Him, the fountain of living waters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then Jeremiah continues his prayer, saying, "Heal me, O Jehovah, and I will be healed; / Save me and I will be saved, / For You are my praise.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>/ Behold, they say to me, / Where is the word of Jehovah?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>/ Let it come now!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>/ But as for me, I have not hurried away from being a shepherd after You, / And I have not desired a day of disaster.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>/ You know that what came out of my lips / Was before Your face.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>/ Do not become a terror to me; / You are my refuge in an evil day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>/ Let those who persecute me be put to shame, but as for me, do not let me be put to shame; / Let them be dismayed, but do not let me be dismayed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>/ Bring upon them an evil day, / And break them with a double destruction" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>14-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to understand this trusting prayer according to God's economy and dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to interpret this prayer correctly, we need to receive God, the speaking and dispensing One, into us.</S>
