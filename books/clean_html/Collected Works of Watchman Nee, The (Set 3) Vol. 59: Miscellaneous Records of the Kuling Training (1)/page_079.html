<h2 class="head1">PAUL'S THOUGHTS BEING CAPTURED</h2><p>Paul, who was Saul, was an intelligent, clever, and rational person. He was very resourceful, and he served God with his own zeal. On his way to Damascus to arrest Christians, he met a great light and fell to the ground. From that day forward, he was stripped of his own proposals and ideas. He asked, "What shall I do, Lord?" He no longer wanted to do anything by himself. Once he met the great light, he became foolish. He no longer had any plans or proposals. May the Lord give us such "foolishness," a "foolishness" that results from enlightenment. Light not only humbles us but silences us. Once a man touches God's authority and sees His light, he does not have to suppress his words or muzzle his proposals. Spontaneously his cleverness, concepts, and suggestions are gone. He is conscious of his captivity. He is brought to the obedience and rule of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">EXAMPLES OF REBELLION IN THOUGHTS</h2><p>Let us consider some Old Testament examples of thoughts that were not taken captive. First we have Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron. Their sin was different from the sins of others. Others sinned by indulging in the flesh. Nadab and Abihu sinned in the matter of serving the Lord. They proposed something by themselves and offered strange fire. They did not subject themselves to their father's authority. Instead, they made proposals on their own and offered sacrifices with their censers. Their sin was an offense against God and against His minister. They thought that they were doing a good thing, but they actually were offering incense according to their own conviction. They thought they were rendering service to God. They thought that even if they were wrong, their mistake would fall within the realm of divine service. They thought that it was serious and fatal to commit worldly sins but that it was minor and inconsequential to commit mistakes in God's service. Little did they realize that God immediately rejected them and sentenced them to death. Their actions were the result of their runaway thoughts. They had their own ideas about divine service, and the result was terrible.</p><p>Consider the case of King Saul. He was rejected because he kept the best of the sheep and oxen for himself. He considered it a waste to destroy these choice goods. He was not rejected because he stole, robbed, or extorted from the people of Israel. He had many reasons and ideas. He wanted to offer these as sacrifices to God. He wanted to please God in his own way. If a man has not touched authority, his thoughts will always be a problem to him. It is not a matter of whether or not one has the desire to serve the Lord, but a matter of the means he uses to serve the Lord. He should not think that he can act according to his own will as long as he has a desire to serve God. This is where many people stumble. In God's service no one can propose anything. God is the One who proposes. Even if He appoints us to be a king, He does not want us to make any proposal of our own. He only wants us to be an executor of His order and His will. It is wrong for us to think that we can tell others what to do just because we have been appointed by God to be an authority. We should have only one aspiration, which is to find out what God wants us to do. God says that obedience is better than sacrifice and taking heed better than the fat of rams. Saul did not realize that he had no right to propose anything to God; he had no right to make suggestions to God. Man can only say, "Lord, what do You want me to do? Your servant is listening." Our place is in the dust and among the footstools. Saul saw the excellent and fat livestock and thought it a waste to destroy them. He wanted to save them and offer them to God. Would it not be much better to save them? Saul had a heart to serve God; he had a heart to make sacrifices, but he did not have a heart to obey. Rather than offering everything to the Lord, it is better for him to say, "Lord, I dare not make any proposals or suggestions of my own; I want to obey You in everything." No oblation of fat or offering of fragrance can take the place of obedience. In the end Samuel told Saul, "Because you have rejected the word of Jehovah,/He has also rejected you from being king" (1 Sam. 15:23b). The Lord ordered Saul to destroy the Amalekites and all their livestock, but Saul did not want to do it. Ultimately, a young Amalekite killed Saul (2 Sam. 1:8-10). God wanted Saul to destroy all the Amalekites, but he would not do it. In the end he was killed by an Amalekite, and his reign ended. This is a serious thing.</p>
