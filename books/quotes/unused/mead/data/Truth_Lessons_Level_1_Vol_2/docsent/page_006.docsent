   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. Malachi 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>His Status and Time</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Malachi was the most hidden among the prophets, because aside from his name, there is no record of his status or genealogy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The books of Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, and Zechariah do not once mention his name.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to his own writing, Malachi might be a prophet at the time of Nehemiah.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>During that time, first, the holy temple had been rebuilt and the offering of sacrifices had been restored Mal 1:6-10 ; second, the zeal of the priests had gradually grown cold in the service of God compare Mal 1:6 with Neh 13:4 ; third, the people had neglected to bring their tithes to the storehouse compare Mal 3:8 with Neh 13:10-12 ; fourth, the people had married heathen wives compare Mal 2:11 with Neh 13:23-25 ; and fifth, the initial fulfillment of the prophecy in Malachi 3:1-5 probably refers to Malachi and Nehemiah initially.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verses 1 and 2 say, Behold, I will send Malachi meaning my messenger and typifying John the Baptist and Elijah , and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple...But who may abide the day of his coming?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Malachi spoke for God during Nehemiah s absence from Jerusalem, thus paving the way for the work of rearrangement to be carried out upon his return.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Nehemiah came back, he unexpectedly cast all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber of God s house and thus cleansed the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His action fulfilled the word quoted above.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Malachi might also be the last prophet during the rebuilding of the holy temple and the holy city.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He also rebuked the people for dealing treacherously against their brothers 2:10 ; for marrying heathen wives, even dealing treacherously against the wives of their youth 2:11-17 ; for robbing God in tithes and offerings 3:7-11 ; and for speaking against God 3:13-15 .</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Elijah the Prophet and John the Baptist</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Malachi 4:5-6 contains the prophecy concerning the coming of Elijah the prophet: Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This refers to one of the two witnesses in Revelation 11:3-12 who, before the restoration of Israel, that is, three and a half years before the Lord s coming back to the earth, will prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, testifying for God Matt 17:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This prophecy also refers to the coming of John the Baptist at the beginning of the New Testament to prepare the hearts of the people for the Lord Jesus Luke 1:16-17; Matt 17:12-13 .</S>
