[1]  CONTENTS How to Be Useful to the Lord Learning to Pay the Price in Our Daily Life Being Used by the Lord and the Overflow of Life The Need to Grow and Mature in Life After Receiving Salvation The Economy of God's Grace How to Be Useful in the Lord's Hand
[2]  CHAPTER ONE HOW TO BE USEFUL TO THE LORD THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOD'S PLAN AND MAN
[3]  Actually, we only need to ask ourselves if from the day we were saved until now we have ever had the feeling of wanting to be used by the Lord or have ever heard within us a soft, gentle voice saying that the Lord wants to use us.
[4]  However, the Bible shows us that while the Lord has the responsibility of visiting, we also have a responsibility the responsibility of paying a price Matt 8:19-22; 16:24-27; Luke 9:59-62 .
[5]  THE PRICE IN THE GOSPELS LEAVING ALL TO FOLLOW THE LORD
[6]  If we are not useful to the Lord today, the only reason is that we are not willing to pay a price, not willing to answer His demands, and not willing to forsake our reputation, our education, our position, our future, and our whole life.
[7]  THE PRICE IN PHILIPPIANS GIVING UP ALL THINGS TO GAIN CHRIST
[8]  The price in the Gospels refers to all that we have, whereas the price in Philippians 3 refers mainly to all the things that enable us to serve the Lord.
[9]  The revelation in Philippians 3 is that we should pursue the experience of Christ and the power of His resurrection v. 10 . Therefore, we need to pay the price by giving up all that we have our theology, eloquence, doctrines, knowledge, and experience in exchange for Christ, the experience of Christ, and the gaining of Christ.
[10]  CHAPTER TWO LEARNING TO PAY THE PRICE IN OUR DAILY LIFE THE REAL PURSUING TAKING PLACE IN OUR DAILY LIFE
[11]  At one time or another, we all have made up our mind to pursue spiritual growth and usefulness to the Lord.
[12]  In the church life no one is solely a younger one or solely an older one; rather, everyone is a younger one and an older one as well.
[13]  To pay a price is to put aside everything that is apart from God in order to receive the second part of God's salvation.
[14]  The Lord said that we need to forsake all our possessions to follow Him, and the apostle said that we need to suffer the loss of all things to gain Christ.
[15]  We must do this because God in Christ intends to work Himself into us so that we may be united and mingled with Him.
[16]  However, if we want God to come into us and be mingled with us, so that He can operate in us both the willing and the working Phil 2:13 and enable us to live Christ 1:21a always allowing Christ to be magnified in our body v. 20b then we must pay a price.
[17]  The purpose of paying a price is to afford God the opportunity to do in us what He intends to do.
[18]  The significance of paying a price is that we allow God to have a place in us so that He may come into us to be our life and even to be fully mingled with us without any hindrance, limitation, or difficulty.
[19]  If we only have faith, we still cannot say that for us to live is Christ, we still cannot know the power of Christ's resurrection, and we still cannot say that it is God who operates in us both the willing and the working.
[20]  The result is that by handing yourself and all you have over to God, God and all that He has are mingled with you.
[21]  If we do not pay a price, love God, or pursue the Lord, but all day long we only think about being raptured and receiving a reward, then we are just daydreaming.
[22]  CHAPTER THREE BEING USED BY THE LORD AND THE OVERFLOW OF LIFE WORKING FOR GOD BY THE OVERFLOW OF LIFE
[23]  Many children of God often consider that to work for the Lord is to be used by Him.
[24]  It is true that to be used by the Lord is to work for Him, but what does it mean to work for Him?
[25]  Today by the Lord's mercy we have clearly seen that working for the Lord is not a matter of how many things we accomplished for Him but of how much of the Lord's life overflows from us and is imparted through us.
[26]  CHAPTER FOUR THE NEED TO GROW AND MATURE IN LIFE AFTER RECEIVING SALVATION THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPT CONCERNING GOD'S SALVATION
[27]  In today's Christianity, including both Catholicism and Protestantism, most people do not have an accurate concept concerning God's salvation, nor do they have a clear knowledge of the economy and arrangement of God in His salvation.
[28]  According to this concept, if a person who feels that he is a sinner and deserves to suffer perdition repents and believes in the Lord receiving Him as his Savior and calling on Him his sins will be forgiven, he will be reconciled to God, and God will be gracious to him and bestow blessing upon him.
[29]  THE EMPHASIS OF THE GOSPELS OF MATTHEW AND MARK PAYING A PRICE
[30]  These two Gospels tell us to leave all that we have, to deny ourselves Matt 16:24; Mark 8:34-35 , to enter in through the narrow gate and walk on the constricted way Matt 7:13-14 , and to pay a considerably great price to follow the Lord Jesus.
[31]  However, after we are saved and have received the life of God, we still need to walk on the Lord's way and live a heavenly life.
[32]  Luke and John show us from one side that upon believing in the Lord, we receive forgiveness of sins and the life of God.
[33]  Matthew and Mark show us from another side that from the day we were saved, we who have been forgiven of our sins and have received the life of God should follow the Lord and take the Lord as our life and our living.
[34]  Rather, the ultimate goal of our salvation is for us, the saved ones, to be mingled with God that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith Eph 3:17 as our life and that we may grow up unto maturity 4:13 .
[35]  According to this concept, if a believer has a heart that fears the Lord, and if in his daily life he reads the Bible, prays to the Lord, attends the meetings, helps others, and pleases the Lord, then the Lord will bestow many blessings on him.
[36]  The Bible also tells us that after a person has been saved and has received the Lord's life, he becomes part of the crop in the Lord's field Rev 14:15-16 .
[37]  In many people's concepts salvation means merely that God loved us and sent His Son to accomplish redemption for our sins, so that as long as we believe in Him, our sins will be forgiven and we will go to heaven to enjoy eternal blessings.
[38]  Revelation 12 tells us about the man-child who, because he overcame, was caught up to God and to His throne before the great tribulation of three and a half years v. 5 . Then in chapter fourteen we see the hundred and forty-four thousand who, because they followed the Lamb, were raptured to Mount Zion in the heavens while the Antichrist was acting lawlessly on the earth vv.
[39]  GOD'S THOUGHT CONCERNING SALVATION THAT WE MAY BE CONFORMED TO THE IMAGE OF GOD'S SON
[40]  If we carefully read through the Bible, we can find God's thought concerning salvation.
[41]  Today in Christianity the prevailing concept is that we were once sinful but that after we believed in the Lord and received God's forgiveness, we were saved.
[42]  Then chapter four says that His desire is that we, the saved ones, arrive at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ v. 13 . First John 3 says that undoubtedly "now we are children of God," yet "it has not yet been manifested what we will be." John also says that, nevertheless, at the Lord's return "we will be like Him." Furthermore, he says, "Everyone who has this hope set on Him purifies himself, even as He is pure" vv.
[43]  Thank God that on the day we were saved, God came into us, and as soon as He entered into us, a fellowship was brought in between Him and us, us and Him 1 John 1:3 .
[44]  In the past, once we had a certain idea or a definite opinion, no one could change us.
[45]  CHAPTER SIX HOW TO BE USEFUL IN THE LORD'S HAND THE LIFE IN CHRISTIANS BEING A SERVING LIFE
[46]  After having the experiences of sanctification and victory, chapter twelve tells us that we should offer our bodies as a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, and that this kind of service is reasonable v. 1 . This means that in our consecration we should experience a crisis, in which we leave the realm of not serving God and enter into the realm of serving God.
[47]  As we kneel down to pray, giving ourselves to the Lord to love Him a little more, to draw near to Him a little more, and to allow His life to have a little more ground in us, immediately we have a desire to serve God.
[48]  If we would love the Lord more and more, consecrate ourselves to Him, abandon our future, allow our natural life to be broken and our disposition to be dealt with, follow the spiritual light, and live in Christ, then the life within us will have the opportunity to grow from within.
[49]  SERVING THE LORD BY RELYING ON THE INNER SOURCE OF LIFE
[50]  The life and the blood cells that flow to the ears to enable us to hear also flow to the eyes to enable us to see, flow to the mouth to enable us to speak, and flow to the legs to enable us to walk.
[51]  If we all would earnestly exercise ourselves in these five matters loving the Lord absolutely, consecrating ourselves thoroughly, giving up our future, allowing our natural man to be broken, and letting our flesh be dealt with then Christ would be able to have an outlet for His life to be lived out through us little by little.
[52]  We must see that every saved one is a person whom the Lord would use.
[53]  The Lord's life is a serving life, and the Lord's life comes into us so that we can serve.
[54]  If because of the Lord's love, all of us would once again submit ourselves, consecrate ourselves, give up our future, and be broken and dealt with, in less than a year many brothers and sisters among us would be manifested as called ones, as workers, as elders, as deacons, and as those who engage in business, making money solely for the Lord.
[55]  First, God will shine His light in you to show you that all that you have, including your natural life, your flesh, your temper, and your disposition, are enemies of the life of Christ and are frustrations and limitations to the life of Christ.
