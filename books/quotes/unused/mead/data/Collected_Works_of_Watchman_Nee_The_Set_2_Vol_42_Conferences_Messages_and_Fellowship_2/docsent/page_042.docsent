   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>No Condemnation in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to read two more verses.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 8:1-2 says, "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These two verses describe the kind of people who are not under condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We think that those who have repented, who are righteous, and who are doing good are not condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But God says that those who are in Christ are not condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As long as a person is in Christ, that is good enough; there is no need to do anything anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those who are in Christ are not condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is no other condition.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why is a person no longer condemned when he is in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is because when Christ was judged on the cross, he was judged in Christ as well.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The judgment that Christ went through became his judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ's experience on the cross became his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Christ we are no longer condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The words no longer imply that there is not a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ was judged and condemned on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are in Christ, and Christ has borne our judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is good enough, and there cannot be any further condemnation in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If I borrow one hundred dollars and return it later, my creditor cannot demand one hundred dollars any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since we have been terminated on Christ's cross once, we have been judged already, and now there is no condemnation to those who are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am not as bold as others may think.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I used to think about what would happen to me if I were to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A few times when I was sick, I feared for what would happen if I went to hell then.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today I believe that God has judged and punished me once and for all in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am very happy today, because I am no longer condemned in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brother Lui is a businessman.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If anyone owes him money, and he collects what is owed at the end of the year, he would not go and ask for more money later.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is what all honest people do in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thank God that our debt has been paid by Christ on the cross, and God can no longer come to us for payment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No Longer Impotent in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who borrow feel intimated by their creditors, and those who have not borrowed can be afraid to borrow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Suppose you only earned one dollar a month, and the dollar is only good for one meal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What can you do except borrow?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is like a believer who realizes that his sins are forgiven, but at the same time always worries that he will sin again.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A Greek scholar wrote thirty years ago that the word condemnation in Romans 8:1 has two meanings in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It has a legal meaning and a general meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the legal context it means condemnation, but in the general context it does not mean condemnation, but encumbrance or impotence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence this verse means that those who are in Christ are no longer condemned and are no longer impotent!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Adam we were impotent to withstand sin; we were crippled.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We were impotent in respect to many sins and unable to overcome them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We made resolutions, prayed, and struggled, but we still failed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>None of these ways worked.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But now we are made potent in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everyone who is in Christ is no longer impotent, but has become potent.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The question is not whether we have power in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The question is how much has been transmitted into us from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we are in Christ we receive everything from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The whole issue therefore rests on whether or not we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Freedom of the Law</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Why are we no longer condemned in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Why are we no longer impotent?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Verse 2 provides an explanation: "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The word "for" indicates that verse 2 is preceded by something in verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The word "for" explains and relates to the things mentioned in verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, verse 2 gives the reason for verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Verse 2 mentions a law.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What is a law?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A law is a rule that never changes; it is something that always remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Chinese government has a law which says that whoever murders will be executed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It does not matter if Chang or Lee or anyone else murders; he will always be executed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The law of gravity is also a law.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Every object that falls will fall toward the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It does not matter if the object falls today or tomorrow; it does not matter if it falls in Nanking or Peking.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As long as you let go of an object, it will fall to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is what is meant by a law.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This verse says that sin is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This means that sin always acts the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Man always sins.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>No matter who he is, he always sins.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He will sin today, and he will sin tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Suppose I have a quick temper.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If I lose my temper easily at Mr. Chen and lose my temper easily at anyone who is similar to Mr. Chen, this means that similar temptations produce similar results.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Everyone is proud and everyone has a temper.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When the right temptation comes, everyone falls to pride and temper.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Similar conditions produce similar sins every time.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We seldom commit new sins.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Most of the time we have our private sins which we are fond of committing.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This shows that sin is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Every sin we commit is a familiar sin.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We may have struggled with them for years already, yet we repeatedly commit the same sin or sins.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is easy for us to know that we sin.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But do we realize that sin is a law?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Sin is not just a conduct, but a law.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This verse also mentions the law of death.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What is death?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The biblical definition of death is extreme weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If a man is sick, you know that you should give him a word of comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>However, you do not have the strength to do it; this is the law of death.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>You know that you should be holy, righteous, and patient.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>However, you cannot make it; this is the law of death.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Everyone who is sitting here today is bound by the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Every time you fall, you fall because of the same sins, and every time you fail, you fail in the same things.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>You may commit sins that others do not commit, and you may not be able to do things that others can do.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>But every person has his own version of the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>There is a way to overcome the law of sin and of death; it is by the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Only Christ is not bound by the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I have in my hand a copy of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Although it is not moving, it has a constant tendency to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>It has not fallen, however, because there is an opposite force holding it up.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The force of my three fingers has stopped it from falling.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Gravity is a force; it pulls the book downward.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>My fingers are another force; they keep the book from falling.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Hence, I can say that my fingers have freed this book from the law of gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>My hand is the "savior" to this book.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The same is true with the Lord's salvation in us; He holds back the power of sin with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Although my fingers are small, they can withstand the great force of gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Does this book need to make up its mind, struggle, or hope not to fall?</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>No. My three fingers have prevented it from falling.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The same is true with our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We do not have to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>As long as we are in Christ, the law of the Spirit of life will free us from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The work of deliverance from perdition has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>In the same way, freedom from sin is accomplished only in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>When we are in Christ, we can overcome all sin.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Everything is accomplished in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>EVERYTHING BEING IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>I thank God that I am saved, forgiven, justified, and have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>None of these things originate from myself; they are all given to me in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>This is why the Lord said that He is the Beginning and the End Rev 22:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Thank God that I am in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Around me, in front of me, and behind me there is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Christ occupies everything.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Christ, Christ, Christ, everything is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>What are we?</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>If we have anything, it is because we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Last night I spoke on the meaning of being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Tonight I spoke on overcoming sin in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>I do not know how to make this more clear to you.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>We are completely useless in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Everything is Christ, Christ, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Christ is everything, and everything is in Christ.</S>
