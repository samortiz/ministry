   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE THE SCENE AROUND THE THRONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE HEAVENS Scripture Reading: Rev 4 5</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Chapters four and five of Revelation show us the scene around the throne in the heavens after Christ s ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE THRONE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first main item mentioned in chapter four is the throne of God set in heaven v. 2 . The throne of God is the very center of the entire universe and the very source of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Revelation, the throne of God is not the throne of mercy but the throne of divine authority for judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE GOD OF LIFE AND REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The One who is sitting upon the throne is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verse 3a there are two figures which signify God jasper and sardius.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The One who sits on the throne is like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Two in the Bible signifies a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That two kinds of precious stones describe the appearance of God signifies that the appearance of God is a testimony, a witness, testifying what kind of God He is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Precious stones are not originally found in nature; they are formed by a process from other materials.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This signifies that God is not natural but different from all natural things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In addition, the color green in the Scriptures signifies life, and red signifies redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A jasper stone is dark green and semitransparent, symbolizing that God is the God of life in its transparency, pureness, and brightness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sardius, a precious stone with a red color, signifies redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is a God of life and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Life and redemption are the main items of the person and work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The bread at the Lord s table signifies life, and the cup stands for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The very God who directs the entire universe is a God of pure and transparent life, and He is also a God of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He has the appearance of green jasper and red sardius.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A RAINBOW AROUND THE THRONE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Around the throne of God is a rainbow v. 3b . The rainbow is first mentioned in the Scriptures as a sign that the very God of life and redemption is the One who establishes and keeps His covenant Gen 9:12-17 . That the covenant in Genesis 9 was made for the sake of the inhabited earth indicates that although God will judge this earth with its inhabitants, He still remembers His covenant concerning the earth and will keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to Revelation 4:3, the rainbow around the throne was like an emerald in appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>An emerald is of a grass-green color, signifying the growing things, the lives on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The rainbow declares to us that God will keep His covenant for the sake of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE TWENTY-FOUR ANGELIC ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 4 speaks of the twenty-four elders around the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are many expositions of Revelation with many differing opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What we are speaking here is not the result of quick and simple decisions concerning the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, what we are saying is based upon many studies of all these expositions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some people say that the twenty-four elders here are the elders of the church, including the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, we cannot agree with this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The scene revealed in chapter four encompasses the entire universe, and the elders and apostles of the church cannot be the elders of the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These elders must be the leading ones among the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the record of the Scriptures, the angels are the most ancient ones in God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, their leading ones are the real elders in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The praise of the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures are further proof that the elders here are not the redeemed elders in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In verse 9 the four living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to God, while the praise of the twenty-four elders in verse 11 speaks of the glory and the honor and the power.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because the living creatures represent the redeemed ones, they give thanks to the Lord for His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead of thanks, however, the twenty-four elders give praise to the Lord for His power.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The twenty-four elders are the leading angels who have been appointed to authority; they have the power to rule in the universe, so they praise the Lord for His power.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In verses 11-13 of chapter five, there are two kinds of hosts praising God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There are the angelic hosts, the angels, and there is the rest of creation in heaven, on the earth, under the earth, and in the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Of all of these, there are two groups of representatives.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The twenty-four elders as leading ones represent the angels, and the four living creatures represent the rest of creation v. 14 . The twenty-four elders take the lead among the angels to worship and praise God, and the four living creatures lead the rest of creation to worship and praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This further indicates that the twenty-four elders are the leading ones among the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That the twenty-four elders have golden crowns upon their heads means that they were given the power to rule as kings 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From the beginning of creation, the Lord appointed the angels to have the power and authority to rule the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But at the second coming of the Lord, the earth will be handed over to the Lord and His overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The angelic elders are also clothed in white garments, similar to the clothing of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the one hand, they have the authority to rule the universe, and on the other hand, they are the priests serving in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 5:8 each of the elders has a harp, which is for praising the Lord in His presence, and they have bowls of incense.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The incense signifies Christ, while the bowls are the prayers of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The angelic elders, as the most ancient of the creatures, praise the Lord, and they bring the saints prayers to God.</S>
