   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-TWO DEALING WITH THE GIFTS 6 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 12:4-31; 14:1-25 THE PROBLEM CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TODAY S TONGUE-SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In dealing with the gifts, Paul emphasizes six matters: speaking, the Spirit, the Body, God s administration, love, and the superiority of prophecy for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapter twelve Paul speaks of the Body again and again, at least eighteen times.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But in chapter fourteen he speaks of the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, in chapter twelve we have the Body and in chapter fourteen, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE BODY AND THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Body and the church are synonymous; both refer to the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Body is the church, and the church is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, in chapter twelve Paul emphasizes the Body, and in chapter fourteen he emphasizes the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is a distinction between the Body and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Body is an organism for Christ as the believers life to grow and express Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church is an assembly for God to operate His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ as life is the essence of the Body as an organic entity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This organism is not for organization; it is for living to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is the essence of His Body, and His Body is an organic entity which lives, grows, and matures with Himself until it eventually expresses Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 12:12-27 the main thought is not activity or enterprise.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is that the Body is an organism to live, grow, mature, and express Christ as the inward essence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For this reason, verse 3 tells us that when we say, Lord Jesus, we are in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is the Spirit who brings us into the Body, for the Spirit is the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of life, not merely the Spirit of God as found in Genesis 1:3.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have received the Spirit who brings us into the Body organically.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Romans 10:13 Paul says, Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to put this verse together with Acts 2:21: And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here in Acts 2 to be saved is to receive the initial gifts of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To receive the Spirit as the initial gift is equal to being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This takes place not only by believing, but also by calling on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everyone who truly believes in the Lord Jesus will also call on Him and say, Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we say, Lord Jesus, the Spirit will come into us, and we shall be in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Spirit is the pneuma, the breath, the air, for us to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is impossible for us to breathe without taking air into us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we breathe, the air is in us, and we are in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Likewise, when we call on the Lord Jesus, we are in the Spirit who gives life and brings us into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to 12:13, in the Spirit we have been baptized into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The water of baptism is a symbol of the fact that we have been baptized into the Triune God Matt 28:19 and baptized into Christ Gal 3:27; Rom 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we were baptized into Christ, we were baptized into His Body and became part of this organic Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First Corinthians 12 clearly reveals that we have become members of the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hallelujah, we are now in the Body!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have called, Lord Jesus, and have been brought into the Spirit, the Spirit has ushered us into the Body, and now we are organically in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After speaking so much concerning the Body in 12:12-27, Paul begins to speak of the church in verse 28: And God has placed some in the church: firstly apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church is for God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Paul mentions the church, his emphasis is not on an organic entity, but on God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Body is for the expression of Christ; the church is for the administration of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In chapter fourteen Paul s concept is not mainly related to organic growth, but to governmental administration.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In chapter twelve the emphasis is on life; in chapter fourteen it is on government.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, we may use the term organic expression to describe chapter twelve and the term governmental administration to describe chapter fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, the building up of the church is for administration, but the building up of the Body is for the expression of Christ organically.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To express Christ we need the Body; to carry out the divine administration we need the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For this reason, chapter twelve emphasizes the Body organically for growth and the expression of Christ, but chapter fourteen emphasizes the church governmentally for the carrying out of God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At this point I would ask a question related to speaking in tongues: For the Body to grow organically and express Christ, can tongue-speaking ever be helpful?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to answer this question carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It would be wrong to say that tongue-speaking could not be of any help to the growth of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Speaking in tongues is somewhat related to the Spirit, and the Spirit is for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For this reason, we should not say that tongue-speaking could never be helpful to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The decisive factor concerns our realization regarding tongue-speaking and our application of it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you apply tongue-speaking only for your self-seeking, this will damage the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But if you seek tongue-speaking for the Body and if you take care of the Body, then your tongue-speaking will be helpful to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some among us have testified that tongue-speaking stirred them inwardly to seek Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is a fact which cannot be denied.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Certainly to seek Christ is by the Spirit and for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, those who are stirred up by the Spirit through tongue-speaking to seek Christ may not realize that their seeking of Christ should be for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In such a case, their realization regarding tongue-speaking is somewhat short.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For tongue-speaking to be helpful to the Body depends on the proper realization and application.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now let me ask another question: Is tongue-speaking helpful in the building up of the church for God s administration?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The answer to this question is a clear and definite no. Especially as practiced today, tongue-speaking is of no help to God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the contrary, in case after case it damages the church, tears down God s administration, and overthrows the divine government.</S>
