<h1 class="title">ISSUE NO. 17</h1><h2 class="head4">The Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 323, Shanghai,<br />May 1939</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Hwa Shi-bin, Ning-Hai</h2><p>Thank the Lord for leading me step by step to walk in His will. Brother Shao Tzi-wen and I went to work in Hwang-Yen in the middle of March. All of a sudden, we heard that fighting had erupted in Hai-Men, and we turned back and went to San-Men-Wan instead to do some pioneering work for a month. At Hun-Du six men and three women were saved (mostly young adults), and a miniature local church was formed. Praise the name of the Lord! Brother Philip Luan wrote to me to invite me to stay in Hong Kong for a while. I always have a burden for missionary work in far-off places. It would be good to go first to Hong Kong and then elsewhere according to the Lord's leading. By this I may learn to live by the Lord and to suffer for Him, severing myself from affections based on kinship. But I see my own incompetence and am hesitant to go forward. The Lord willing, I would like to go to Shanghai to inquire of the senior co-workers about my trip to Hong Kong. I wonder whether Brother Nee and Brothers Chang Kwang-rong and Hsu Dah-wei are in Shanghai yet. A few churches in Ning-Hai have seen some progress. But there are very few brothers in all the churches who can stand between the breach, who watch and pray, and who deal with God directly, telling Him of the church's shortcomings and conveying to others the message from the throne! There are not many who can discern the wiles of the devil and who can set up defenses with authority in prayer! Most people only see the movement of the hands of the workers. The meeting life and the work are merely mutual imitations of one another, and rarely does one see God's standard. There is truly the need for God to continue to shed His grace.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Hwa Shi-bin, April 29</p><p>(Brother Nee is not in Shanghai yet, and Brothers Chang and Hsu are still in Chekiang&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Chang Yu-zhi, from Jin-Hwa</h2><p>I left Lan-chou from Jin-Hwa today. From the twelfth to the sixteenth, there were five days of gospel work. We saw God's miraculous hand in the weather&mdash;it was neither rainy nor sunny. If it had been too sunny, the people would not have come and listened, and if had been rainy, it would have been very inconvenient. The best weather is when it is neither rainy nor sunny. We truly saw the Lord's blessing in Shui-Ting this time. Brother Tang's messages were on "The Best Love" and "The Presence of Christ." All the brothers and sisters were greatly edified. Thank and praise the Lord! I intend to go to Lu-Tang-Sha (fifteen miles from Jin-Hwang) tomorrow morning to preach at the Cheng-Mei Girls' School. Then I will preach the gospel at the local hospital for a few days. Later, I may go to Wu-Yih and Wenchow to preach the gospel. Please pray for me. I have read the book The Messenger of the Cross and have come to realize that my work has very little spiritual element in it. I deeply realize that my past work lacked the mark of the cross. I am willing to be dealt with by the Lord in a deep way and do not wish to work with so much of my own element still intact. I am not clear at present whether I should go back to Shanghai and then to north China or preach the gospel a little longer in the inland regions of Chekiang province. Please pray for me. May my walk be according to His heart and His timing.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Yu-zhi, April 18</p>
