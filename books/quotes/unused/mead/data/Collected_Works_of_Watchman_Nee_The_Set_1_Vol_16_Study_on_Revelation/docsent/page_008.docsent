   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>H. Seven Calls</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every epistle contains the words, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches" Rev 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These seven epistles are spoken by the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why then do they say that the Spirit speaks to the churches?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because the Lord spoke directly to John, the churches could only read the epistles which John had written.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, in reading, there was the need of the inspiration of the Holy Spirit in order to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Moreover, when the Lord was on the earth, He did not speak by Himself but through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even today, the Lord is still speaking through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, Revelation says that the Spirit is speaking to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we will consider the content of these seven epistles in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE CHURCH IN EPHESUS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>REVELATION 2:1-7 A. Revelation 2:1</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"To the messenger of the church in Ephesus write: These things says He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, He who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"Write."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John is the Lord's secretary, recording the words of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"The church in Ephesus."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church has two aspects: one is the mystical church; the other is the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One is the Body of Christ; the other is the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The churches which are mentioned in these two chapters are churches which belong to localities.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"The church in Ephesus" is different from "the church of Ephesus" because the church in Ephesus merely resides in Ephesus; it does not belong to Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the so-called Roman Church, Greek Church, and Chinese Christian Church are all unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"To the messenger."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This epistle is given to the messenger.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that it is much inferior to the book to the Ephesians written by Paul, because Paul wrote to all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From this we can see that many of the believers at that time had passed away or backslidden.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, only the messenger could receive this epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we further compare the content of these two epistles, we can realize that the earlier and latter conditions of this church were very different.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ephesus had definitely become loose and desolate and had backslidden.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To this church the Lord presents Himself as "He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, He who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is to make the church in Ephesus and the messenger know that He has full authority; He searches the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>B. Revelation 2:2-3</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"I know your works and your labor and your endurance and that you cannot bear evil men; and you have tried those who call themselves apostles and are not, and have found them to be false; and you have endurance and have borne all things because of My name and have not grown weary."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This section is the Lord's word of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This section of praise is divided into three aspects:</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Concerning Them</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"Your works."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Their works must have been very good.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"Your labor."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They must have labored diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"Your endurance."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This church had the heart of a father or mother in bearing others' weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Concerning the Administration of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"You cannot bear evil men."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>See 1 Corinthians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"You have tried those who call themselves apostles and are not."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They did not loosely receive people into the work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even if one was an apostle, he still needed to be tried.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From this we see that they had much spiritual insight.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Concerning the Outward Work</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They endured for the Lord's name and did not grow weary.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Judging from only the items mentioned above, the church in Ephesus was indeed quite perfect.</S>
