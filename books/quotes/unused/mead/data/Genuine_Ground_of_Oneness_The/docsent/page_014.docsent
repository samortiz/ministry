   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE BABEL, BABYLON, AND THE GREAT BABYLON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ISSUES OF DIVISION Scripture Reading: Gen 2:9b, 17; 11:4, 9; 1 Kings 12:26-30; 15:34; 2 Chron 36:5-20; 1 Cor 1:11-13a; Rev 17:3-5 TWO LINES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Bible there are two lines: the line of life and the line of death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These two lines come from the two sources that exist in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One of these sources is God, and the other is the Devil, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, each of these lines will have a particular issue, result.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The line of life begins with the tree of life and ends with the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The line of death begins from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and, passing through the great Babylon, ends with the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Oneness is on the line of life, originates with God, and issues in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Division, on the contrary, is on the line of death, originates with Satan, and issues in the great Babylon and, ultimately, the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we would see the great truth of oneness in the Bible, we need to be clear about these two sources, lines, and results.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then we shall know where oneness and division belong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many Christians are careless about division because they do not see the seriousness of these two lines.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Never regard division as an insignificant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Division is extremely serious, a matter of life or death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To be in oneness is to be in life, but to be in division is to be in death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the previous chapter we pointed out that the essence of oneness is life and light.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this chapter we shall go on to see that the issue of division is firstly Babel, then Babylon, and eventually the great Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>NO MORE DIVISION</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's four great acts are related to creation, election, the new creation, and the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Apart from God, the only proper source in the universe, there is another source, Satan, with another element and issue.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By the time of the New Jerusalem, this source, element, and issue will all be cast into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, in the new heaven and new earth God will be the unique source, and only His element and issue will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason, in the new universe there will be no division.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There will be no more death, no more sorrow, no more crying, no more pain, and no more darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can go on to say that in the new heaven and new earth there will be no more sin, worldliness, flesh, self, or Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There will be no negative things whatever.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that there will be no more division.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Division is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It comprises such negative things as Satan, sin, worldliness, the flesh, the self, the old man, and evil temper.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are enlightened concerning the nature of division, we shall see that it includes every negative thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not think that division stands by itself and that it is not related to such things as the flesh, the self, and worldliness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Division is not only related to all negative things; it includes all negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just as division is all-inclusive, so, in the same principle, oneness is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It includes God, Christ, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ephesians 4:3-6 indicates this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the oneness revealed in these verses, we have God the Father, Christ the Lord, and the Spirit as the giver of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This oneness includes such positive things as our regenerated spirit and our transformed and renewed mind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Everything positive is included in the proper oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate consummation of oneness and of all the positive things included in it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the lake of fire will be the ultimate reservoir of division and all the negative things included in it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may say that the lake of fire will be the eternal dead sea containing every negative thing in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The lake of fire will be the ultimate and universal trash container.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The New Jerusalem, on the contrary, will be the ultimate consummation and expression of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This city will be characterized by one throne, one river, one tree, and one street.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the street will flow the river of the water of life, and on either side of the river there will be the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, we may properly call the one street of the New Jerusalem the street of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This unique street will make division impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Division with all the negative things related to it will be found only in the lake of fire.</S>
