   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When we go to preach the gospel to people, we must exercise our priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We are priests handling God's gospel, which includes everything from the incarnation of the Triune God to the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must serve God as priests by handling the entire gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As priests of the gospel of God, we should first get sinners regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then as nursing mothers we should nourish and cherish these new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to nourish and cherish them with the word in the Spirit, ministering life to them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to nourish them with the milk of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By doing this we help them to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we can bring them into group meetings so that they can be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This fellowship should show us that whatever is revealed in the New Testament concerning how to serve is altogether different from our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the Lord's recovery began among us, we gathered from Brother Nee all the studies he had accumulated from church history concerning the New Testament way of Christian service.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We practiced what we saw from the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then because of the Lord's mercy, we gradually found out that what we were practicing was not so complete.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We had many deficiencies.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brother Nee started to restudy the Bible beginning in 1931 for the purpose of seeing more concerning how to meet, how to serve, how to function, and how to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In recent years, especially in the last four and a half years, I have also studied the Word concerning these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today I believe that we are here with the result of all our study.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have studied the New Testament book by book, chapter by chapter, and verse by verse.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We cannot find any more verses concerning how to meet, how to serve, how to function, and how to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have nearly exhausted the study of the New Testament concerning the scriptural way of Christian service.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we are wise and would receive the Lord's mercy, we will see that this is what the Lord wants to do today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is strategic.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This move of the Lord is like a tide.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must also realize that the goal of the opposition today is twofold: to oppose the God-ordained way and to smear, to put down, and to put aside my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Dear saints, suppose that today we put the God-ordained way aside and we put this ministry aside.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is left here today if we do this?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we reject the God-ordained way, we have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I know that if I do not take this way, my ministry will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord showed me this ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If I would not take it or pass it on to the saints, I am finished in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The speaking of God stops in me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I want to convince you not to drop this way or reject this way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I love all of you because you love the Lord and the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You have sacrificed a lot to take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But I am a little concerned that you might be somewhat influenced to be hesitant about taking the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must be like the wise merchant mentioned in Matthew 13 who sold everything to buy the pearl of great price.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we practice the priestly preaching of the gospel, we are not carrying it out as we did in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to drop the old way of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not preach in the old way, which is the natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to preach in the spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First, we have to know what a priest is and how we can be proper priests.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A priest must be one who lives a daily life of revival.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is revived by the Lord every morning, and he participates in and enjoys the Lord's victory every day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to be revived in the morning and victorious and overcoming during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We also need to help the saints become this kind of revived, overcoming person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the daily life of a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then we have to realize that the priesthood is for the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The first item to practice in the priesthood of the gospel is to visit sinners to get them saved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to bring the gospel to them so that they can be regenerated to become parts of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In our old way, we had big gospel meetings and invited people to come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These meetings were with one person speaking and the rest listening.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Most of us were just the helpers, the Levitical serving ones, who served one great priest, a gifted evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>That is the old way, but the God-ordained way is not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the God-ordained way, every believer is a priest of the gospel, going to people with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The gospel is just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We go to people to bring God to them and to bring them back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After we baptize them, we need to sit down with them to converse with them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not use vain words nor should we use too many verses from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We can use a few verses to impress these new ones that today Christ is the Spirit and that now they have Christ within them, in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to learn this new way.</S>
