   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE HOW GOD DEALS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH THE BELIEVERS' SINS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>DISCIPLINE IN THE KINGDOM 2 RECEIVING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN THE KINGDOM IN THE COMING AGE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we preach the gospel, we tell others that we receive eternal life through believing in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a person believes in Him, he will have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everyone who understands the Word of God knows that in the church age, as soon as a man believes, he has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is our message.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the question now is this: When is this eternal life manifested, revealed, and enjoyed?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today our minds and spirits are constantly being harassed by death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Satan is still very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So when will the eternal life be fully manifested?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Will it be in the new heaven and new earth?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Or will it be in the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let us read John 5:24-29.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Truly, truly, I say to you, An hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He gave to the Son to also have life in Himself; and He gave Him authority to execute judgment because He is the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming in which all in the tombs will hear His voice and will come forth: those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have practiced evil, to the resurrection of judgment."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 24 says that as soon as a person believes, he has eternal life and will not come into judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He who hears the word of the Lord and believes the Father who sent the Lord has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But verse 29 says that those who have done good will come forth to the resurrection of life, while those that have practiced evil will come forth to the resurrection of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word life Gk. zoe in verse 29 is the same word as in verse 24.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those that have done good will come forth to the resurrection of zoe, and those that have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 24 says clearly that we have eternal life already.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But verse 29 says that some will not have eternal life until after the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Can you see the difference here?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 25 is on the church age.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It says that the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all are these dead people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have heard the voice of the Son of God, and as a result, we live.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verses 28-29 say, "Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming in which all in the tombs will hear His voice and will come forth."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 25 says that an hour is coming and it is now.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 28, however, omits the phrase "and it is now," saying only that an hour is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, it refers to the future, not to the present.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Also, the Lord Jesus says that in the future all the ones from the tombs will come forth from the tombs.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 25, He refers to "the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verse 28 He refers to the dead who are in the tombs.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 25 talks about the dead, referring to those dead in trespasses and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the Lord speaks of those dead in the tombs, He is not referring to the death of the soul in sin; rather, He is referring to those dead in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All those who are dead in their body, that is, those who are in the tombs, will hear the voice of the Son of God for the second time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who have done good will go into the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil will go into the resurrection of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This second time is the time when all those in the tombs will rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Let us read Mark 10:30.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"But that he shall receive a hundred times as much now at this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields, with persecutions, and in the coming age, eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here the Lord Jesus mentions eternal life again.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to note what kind of eternal life this is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The eternal life in Mark 10:30 is not the eternal life of the church age spoken of in the Gospel of John or the eternal life in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Please note that this eternal life is in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The phrase the coming age in the original language means the next age or the subsequent age.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today we are in the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The next age is the age of the kingdom, that is, the age of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Here, the Lord says that one can receive eternal life in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This does not refer to the eternal life we receive when we believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Before the Lord spoke this word, a man came to Jesus asking what he should do to inherit eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This was a question concerning works.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, the Lord Jesus told him of an eternal life that is gained by works.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He told the young man that he must keep the law and sell all he had before he could inherit this eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus shows us clearly that eternal life comes by grace and not by works.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>So why does He say here that we have to keep the law and sell all that we have, before we can inherit eternal life?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is because the eternal life described here in Mark 10 is different from the eternal life described in John.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The eternal life in Mark 10 is received through works.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The eternal life in John is received through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After the young man left, the Lord Jesus looked around Him and said to the disciples, "How difficult it will be for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God!" v. 23 . In saying this, the Lord put eternal life and the kingdom together.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After the Lord Jesus said this, the disciples wondered what His word meant.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord said, "Children, how difficult it is for those who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The disciples were astounded and asked who then could be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord said that "with men it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God" v. 27 . Peter then asked what he would get for having left all to follow Him, and the Lord told them of the things that are to come.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>"Jesus said, Truly I say to you, There is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for My sake and for the gospel's sake, but that he shall receive a hundred times as much now at this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields, with persecutions, and in the coming age, eternal life" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They will receive eternal life in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, the eternal life spoken of here is the eternal life in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The eternal life in the kingdom is obtained through works.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is acquired through consecration, through suffering and bearing reproach for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>For the Christian, the question of eternal life in this age is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The question of eternal life in eternity is also solved.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But whether or not he will have eternal life in the kingdom depends on whether he loves the Lord, forsakes everything for the sake of the gospel, denies himself in everything, and rejects the world.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It depends on whether or not he is living for money, for material gain, for his family, or for the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If he loves the Lord and forsakes all things for the sake of the gospel, the Lord promised that he will not lose these things even in this age, but on the contrary, he will gain a hundred times as much.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If one gives up a little for the Lord today, he will reap a hundredfold return in the heavenly bank.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Who can get such a high interest rate?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>A deposit of one dollar will yield a hundred dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You cannot find such a bank in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In addition, there is eternal life in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In many places in Matthew, the phrase "eternal life" is used interchangeably with the word "kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In these places the living ones are the ones who enter into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>For example, Matthew 7:14 says that the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few that find it.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Today many preach the gospel using this passage, and exhort people to enter the narrow gate and take the constricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But if one were saved through entering the narrow gate and taking the constricted way, salvation would not be of grace, but of works.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Salvation would then become a reward for entering the narrow gate and taking the constricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The eternal life revealed in the book of Matthew does not refer to the eternal life of today; rather, it refers to the life in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In order to reign with Christ in the kingdom, a person must enter the narrow gate and take the constricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If one does not obey God's commandments and God's will, he will lose his eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>However, this does not mean that he will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But he will lose the eternal life in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If this problem is solved, then the problem of the ages in the Bible will be clearly resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In the age of the church, everything is by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>At the end of the church age, God will establish His kingdom through His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In the kingdom only the faithful servants will reign with Christ by being resurrected from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The Bible shows us this very clearly.</S>
