   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE RELATIONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BETWEEN CHILDREN AND FATHERS A. Children</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 1 says, The children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In exhorting the children and the parents, the apostle deals with the children first, since trouble comes mostly from them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this verse Paul does not simply speak of children, but of the children.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By using the definite article before children Paul indicates that the children of believers are not common.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They are different from the children of people in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, the particular children, those in the families of believers, are exhorted to obey their parents in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The phrase in the Lord indicates obedience to the parents by being one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It also indicates that this should be done not by self-effort, but by the Lord, and not according to the natural concept, but according to the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The children of believers should realize that they are to obey their parents by being one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moreover, they are to obey their parents not by their own strength, but by the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their obedience is to be according to the Lord s word, according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this verse Paul says that for the children to obey their parents in the Lord is right.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Greek word may also be rendered just.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To obey the parents is both right and just.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verses 2 and 3 Paul goes on to say, Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise, that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is not only the first commandment with a promise, but also the first commandment concerning man s relationship with man Exo 20:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The promise, mentioned in verse 3, is that it may be well with the children and that they may live long on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first part of the promise is related to prosperity in material blessing; it also refers to living in a peaceful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The second part is to have longevity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to this commandment, prosperity and longevity are God s blessings in this life to those who honor their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Honoring is different from obeying.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Obedience refers to an action, whereas honor denotes an attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is possible for the children to obey their parents without honoring them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to honor their parents, the children need a certain attitude, a certain spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the children need to learn to obey their parents with honor.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we would live long on the earth, we need to honor our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who fail to honor their parents commit suicide in a gradual way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They actually shorten their life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you wish to prolong your days, learn to obey your parents with honor.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Bible this is the unique condition for having a long life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Anyone who desires a long life needs to fulfill this condition.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>B. Fathers</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verse 4 Paul turns to the fathers: And the fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Provoking to anger damages the children by stirring up their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is always destructive for parents to be angry with their children.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For this reason, I counsel the parents not to lose their temper when dealing with their children.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not provoking the children s anger requires the fathers anger to be dealt with by remaining under the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The only way we can keep from losing our temper is to stay on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In dealing with your children s wrongdoings or misbehavior, you must firstly go to the cross and stay there.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Otherwise, you will lose your temper, and this loss of temper will provoke your children s anger.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead of provoking the children to anger, the fathers are to nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To nurture children means to bring them up, to raise them, by nourishing them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Raising children requires that the parents give them the needed instruction related to human life, family life, and social life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The word admonition here includes instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul was probably referring to the Old Testament requirement that parents instruct their children with the word of God Deut 6:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means that we are to teach our children with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Along with this instruction, we sometimes must discipline them, chastise them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is crucial that parents learn to nurture the children in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As parents, we must do our duty with respect to our children.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means that we should not only teach them, but also set up an example for them to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Just as the Lord Jesus sanctified Himself for the sake of His disciples John 17:19 , so parents should sanctify themselves for the sake of their children.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those who do not have children may be free to do certain things, such as sleep late in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But those with children do not have the liberty to do these things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For the sake of their children, they must be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Children always imitate their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, it is the parents responsibility to set up a high standard and a proper pattern and example for their children to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, no matter how good an example is set by the parents, how the children develop depends on God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the one hand, the parents must keep a high standard, but on the other hand, they need to trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Day by day we should tell Him, Lord, these children are not mine; they are Your possession placed in my custody for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Lord, what I am doing with them is simply fulfilling my responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How they will turn out, Lord, depends absolutely on Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is possible for parents to be selfish concerning the spiritual welfare of their children.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If their children get saved and become spiritual, they are very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, these parents may not be happy to see the children of other families becoming more spiritual than their children.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Most parents in the church hope that their children will become the future apostles, elders, and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Thus, even in this matter, we are selfish.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I once read of a certain woman who prayed desperately for her child to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Although she prayed daily for years, still her child was not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>One day she inquired of the Lord why He did not answer her prayers and keep His promise.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord told her that He would surely keep His promise and answer her prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, she was too selfish.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If she would stop praying so much for her child and begin to pray for the children of others, she would see His faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>From that time onward, she began to pray for other children to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>After a short while, her child was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This story illustrates the fact that we may be selfish even in praying for the salvation of our children.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Not to pray for our children is wrong, but to be fully occupied with prayer for them in a selfish way is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Hence, the matter of the salvation of our children and their spiritual welfare is also a test to us.</S>
