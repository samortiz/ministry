   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A HIGHER STANDARD OF QUALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But after seventy years God came in to do a recovery work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God came in to recover the thing that was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the recovery of God's expression the scale was not so big as the original, but the quality was higher.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Humanly speaking, we pay attention to the size of something, but God cares, not about the size, but about the quality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By reading Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, and Zechariah you could see that the returned people were deeply dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Their spiritual morality and character were higher than those of the children of Israel before the temple was built.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In a sense Solomon was not that moral; he had many concubines.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That is terrible!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That is a kind of unveiling of the rottenness of that king of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was wise, but he was rotten.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His morality was too low!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But after the captivity, in the recovery, the character of God's people was very much uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you considered Ezra and Nehemiah, you would have to admit that these leaders were pure and moral.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Their character had a high standard.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So as to quality the Lord's recovery was higher than what had been there previously.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE REAL THING IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Old Testament began with the first Adam, and the New Testament began with the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first Adam was Adam himself, and the last Adam is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The model in the Bible began with the old man, but the real thing in the New Testament began with the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To say that Christ is the last Adam means that He ends the Adamic race.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was the last one of Adam's race.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The old man was ended in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is also the second Man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The second Man means a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>So the model was with the first Adam as a beginning, and the real thing was with the last Adam, the second Man, as a beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When you open up the New Testament you have Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You have a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just as the first Adam began to produce to replenish the earth, so the last Adam, Christ, began to produce many members, His believers, to replenish the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With this producing Christ, God accomplished His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Beginning with Pentecost, God's temple, the church, began to be built.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This time it was the real thing and not the model.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>BABYLON THE GREAT</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But within a short time as he had done in the Old Testament, Satan came in among the believers to do a ruining work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He ruined the Christians and lowered their Christian character.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They became exactly as the children of Israel had become in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They became idolatrous, leaving Christ for other things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then Satan came in and destroyed the church and carried away the believers into Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is why you have Babylon not only in the Old Testament, but also in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Revelation 17 there is Babylon the Great, which includes Catholicism and all the Protestant denominations as the daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Old Testament Babylon was just a model, and the New Testament Babylon the Great is the real thing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Of course this kind of word is offensive to Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, it is not we but the Bible which speaks of a Great Harlot and many daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is surely such a word in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>So there must be the real persons.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Who is that Great Harlot today?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>And who are the daughters of this Great Harlot?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If this is not the Roman Catholic Church and all the denominations, to whom can this word be applied?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Look at the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Is there not a great Harlot committing fornication all the time?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Fornication in the Bible is that God's people go away from God to something other than God, just as a wife might go away from her husband to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Bible tells us that the unique husband in this universe is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His people are His wife Isa 54:5; Jer 31:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ came as the Bridegroom to have the Bride John 3:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In 2 Corinthians 11 Paul said that he had betrothed the believers as a pure virgin to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At the end of the Bible, in Revelation 19 there is a wedding of God and His people.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The real fornication is that God's people would give Him up and go to something else.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Catholicism has gone away from God to something else.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the same principle all the Protestant churches also have gone away from Christ the Lord to things other than Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>So in the eyes of God, Catholicism is the Great Harlot, and all the Protestant denominations and divisions are daughters of that Great Harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Because of this situation there is the need of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the ancient times God's faithful people were called out of Babylon and back to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>That was the Old Testament recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today there is also the need to come out of Babylon the Great and to come back to the proper church life.</S>
