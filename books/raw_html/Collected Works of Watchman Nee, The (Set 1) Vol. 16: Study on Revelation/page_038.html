<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Revelation 11:10</H2><P>"And those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them and make merry; and they will send gifts to one another because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth."</P><P>The message spreads everywhere, and these are the reactions. The sending of gifts indicates their extreme rejoicing. There is such rejoicing probably because (1) the people's flesh has been tormented and (2) their consciences have also been tormented.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. Revelation 11:11</H2><P>"And after the three and a half days, the breath of life out of God entered into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell upon those beholding them." </P><P>Resurrection is the work of the Spirit. That "they stood on their feet" indicates that they are now living. (In 11:8 the dead bodies are lying down.) The "fear" is probably caused by two reasons: (1) the immediate reason is that they are seen to have come alive all of a sudden; (2) the remote reason is that since they have had such authority in the past, what will these two now do since they have resurrected? "Great" here is the same word in the original text as "great" in 11:8 and 11:13.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. Revelation 11:12</H2><P>"And they heard a loud voice out of heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them." </P><P>The "cloud" here and the "cloud" in 10:1 of this book both refer to the same thing. The Lord's ascension was beheld only by His disciples; however, the ascension of these witnesses is beheld even by their enemies. This allows the latter to know that only God is God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Great Earthquake<br>(Revelation 11:13-14)</H2><P>"And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and seven thousand men were killed in the earthquake, and the rest became terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven. The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is coming quickly."</P><P>"The city" here is the city of Jerusalem. In the original, "seven thousand men" is seven thousand men of renown. The whole book of Revelation records only four earthquakes: (1) In 6:12, at the time of the sixth seal; (2) in 8:5; (3) in 11:13; and (4) in 11:19. (The earthquake in Revelation 16:18 is the same as the one in 11:19 because the order of events is the same: a loud noise, lightnings, voices, thunders, an earthquake, and finally, great hail.)</P><P>To become "terrified" does not mean to repent. They merely acknowledge that this is God's doing because 16:11 clearly says that they would not repent (cf. Exo. 8:18-19; 1 Sam. 6:5-6; and Josh. 7:19).</P><P>This is the end of the inserted visions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. THE SEVENTH TRUMPETâ€”THE THIRD WOE<br>(REVELATION 11:15-18)</H2><P>"And the seventh angel trumpeted; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever. And the twenty-four elders who sit before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshipped God, saying, We thank You, Lord God the Almighty, He who is and who was, because You have taken Your great power and have reigned. And the nations became angry, and Your wrath came, and the time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to give the reward to Your slaves the prophets and to the saints and to those who fear Your name, to the small and to the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth." </P><P>This portion concerns the results of the sounding of the seventh trumpet. The plagues of the seven bowls are the plagues that occur at the sounding of the seventh trumpet. This is the third woe spoken of in 11:14. After 11:16 the seats of the twenty-four elders are not mentioned again because the kingdom has arrived. Furthermore, after 19:4 the elders themselves are not mentioned again because they have resigned their position of ruling the universe.</P><P>The "wrath" in 11:18 refers to the plagues of the seven bowls. In verse 18 only three kinds of people receive the reward: (1) "Your slaves the prophets" (There are prophets in the New Testament too. These are those who have spiritual gifts.); (2) "the saints"; and (3) "those who fear Your name." (In the Old Testament time, there were people who feared God, but this designation does not apply to those in the church age. The people who fear God at this time are probably those Gentiles who enter into the kingdom to be the common citizens.)</P><P>"Those who destroy the earth" probably refer to: (1) those who build up the religious Babylon (the people of the Roman Catholic Church); (2) those who worship the image of the beast and follow him (those in Revelation 13:14); and (3) those in Revelation 20:7-9.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. THE SITUATION IN HEAVEN<br>AFTER THE SEVENTH TRUMPET<br>(REVELATION 11:19)</H2><P>"And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple; and there were lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and great hail." </P><P>This verse and Revelation 16:17 through 21 are concurrent, for both show us the situation at the end of the third woe.</P>
