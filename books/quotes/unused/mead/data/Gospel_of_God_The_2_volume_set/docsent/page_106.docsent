   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There is a third difference.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It lies in the attitude Christians should have concerning eternal life and the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning eternal life, God has never told us to seek after it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, every time it is mentioned, He shows us that we have it already.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, concerning the kingdom, the word of the Bible says that we have to seek after it and pursue it diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today, concerning the kingdom, we are in the stage of pursuit; we have not obtained it yet.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We still have to put forth the effort to seek and pursue after the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The fourth difference lies in the way God treats the kingdom and eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God treats eternal life as a gift; it is given to us Rom 6:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One never sees a person going to the Lord to seek for eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is not such a thing, because eternal life is free grace; it is given through the Lord Jesus to all those who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is no difference between a seeking one and one who is not seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the kingdom is not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One recalls the mother of the two sons of Zebedee coming to the Lord Jesus and wishing that the Lord would cause her two sons to sit on both sides of Him in the kingdom Matt 20:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the Lord Jesus said, "To sit on My right and on My left, this is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father" v. 23 . Grace is obtained once we call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the kingdom depends on whether one can be baptized in His baptism and drink the cup which He drank.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Both of the disciples said that they could.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the Lord said that even though they promised that they would and could, the matter is still not up to Him to decide.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Father is the One who gives.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, the criminal who was crucified along with the Lord said to Him, "Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom" Luke 23:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Did the Lord Jesus hear his prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Indeed, He did.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But He did not grant his request.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The criminal asked the Lord to remember him when the Lord receives the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus did not answer him that he would be with Him in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, He answered him, "Today you shall be with Me in Paradise" v. 43 . The Lord did not answer his question concerning the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But He did give him a reply concerning Paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As long as we call on Him, we can go to Paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But it is not so simple to go into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, there is a big difference here.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's attitude toward eternal life and the kingdom of the heavens is different: one is the gift of God, and the other is the reward of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Concerning the difference between the kingdom of the heavens and eternal life, there are other passages in the Bible which are quite interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we come to the fifth difference.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Revelation 20 shows us that the martyrs receive the kingdom, although it does not say that they are the only ones who receive the kingdom v. 4 . The Bible, however, never shows us that man must be martyred to receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If that were the case, Christianity would become a religion of death, for then man must die.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But one does not see such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, the kingdom is different.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The kingdom requires striving.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It even takes martyrdom to obtain the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example, poverty is a necessary condition for the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order to obtain the kingdom of the heavens, one has to lose his riches.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Bible shows us clearly that no person on earth who is rich according to his own ways can enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We cannot say that no rich man can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We cannot say that no one can enter into eternal life who would not lose his riches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Inasmuch as it is difficult for the camel to go through the eye of the needle, in the same way it is difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of the heavens Matt 19:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But have you heard that inasmuch as it is impossible for the camel to go through the eye of the needle, in the same way it is impossible for a rich man to be saved and have eternal life?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The poor can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>So can the rich.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The poor can inherit eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>So can the rich.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But to enter into the kingdom of the heavens is a problem for the rich.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we accumulate wealth on earth, we will not be able to enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Of course, this does not mean that one has to give up all of his money today.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am saying that one has to hand over all his money to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are only the stewards.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are not the master of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Bible never recognizes a Christian as the master of his money.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Everyone is but a steward of money that is for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All of us are but the Lord's stewards.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is such a condition for entering the kingdom.</S>
