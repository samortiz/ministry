   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT ORDINANCING OURSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now look at 2:20-23 in more detail.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 20 through 22 are actually one sentence, three verses that make up Paul s question.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to verse 20, Paul asks the Colossians why they subject themselves to ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Greek the word translated ordinances is actually a verb.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates that Paul was asking why the Colossians were ordinancing themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then in verse 21 Paul lists three ordinances about handling, tasting, and touching.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 22 he goes on to say that these are things which are all for corruption in the using.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Greek words for corruption and using may be rendered destruction and consumption respectively.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here Paul is saying that all material things are destined to decompose and to be destroyed through corruption when they are used 1 Cor 6:13; Matt 15:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whenever we use a thing, that thing is eventually destroyed or corrupted through use.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, whatever we eat is destroyed in the eating, whether it is clean or unclean according to the Levitical dietary regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since whatever we eat is destroyed in the using, there is no need for us to be subject to regulations about eating.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Acts 10 Peter was still concerned about what was clean and what was unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the voice from heaven told Peter that what God had cleansed he should not regard as common.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Colossians 2 Paul is encouraging the saints not to care about the regulations of asceticism regarding things which are all for corruption in the using.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whatever we use will eventually be destroyed and become nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In particular, when food is consumed, it is destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, there was no need for the saints to regulate their eating by ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A CLEAR VISION</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul could write such a word because he had seen a clear vision of the all-inclusive Christ as the one Person and of the cross as the one way in God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, he did not care for regulations about handling, tasting, or touching.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He would not be occupied with ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He knew that all material things perish with the using and eventually come to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul realized that the believers in Colosse needed to see a great vision of the all-inclusive Christ and of the cross as God s way in His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We also need a clear view of Christ and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>ONENESS AND HARMONY THROUGH THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Apart from God s one way, we should have no ordinances and no particular ways or practices.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The way God has ordained, uplifted, and honored is the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The cross is our only way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do you know what can solve the problem of quarreling between husband and wife?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It can be solved only by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the same principle, only the cross can enable the leading ones in a locality to be one and in perfect harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all need to pass through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not experience the cross, we cannot have the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the saints must learn to daily pass through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By passing through all manner of crosses, large and small, we shall have oneness and harmony in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the church life it is possible to have oneness without harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order to have a sweet harmonious oneness, we all must daily pass through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not argue that you are right and that others are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more you dispute in this way, the less you pass through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To repeat, the way to our destination is through the intersection of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not avoid any cross.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the contrary, pass through all the crosses you encounter in the Christian life, in the family life, and in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In married life and in the church life in particular, you need to pass through the cross daily, even hourly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Ephesians 4 Paul exhorts us not to allow the sun to go down on our anger.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that we should let go of our anger by passing through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we have a daily life of passing through the cross, there will be harmony both in the family life and in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Praise the Lord for Christ and the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God has given us one Person the all-inclusive Christ and one way the cross.</S>
