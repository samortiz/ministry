   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Notice how easy it is for God s grace to come to a household.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The whole household of Crispus believed and was baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>7.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us consider the condition at Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Acts 2:39 says, For to you is the promise and to your children, and to all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God calls to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The promise of Pentecost includes the forgiveness of sins and the receiving of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was given to you and to your children ; it was not merely given to you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who are heads of the family in particular should lay hold of this promise and say, Lord, Your promise is for me and also for my children.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It cannot be mine without my children also being included.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I want it for myself, and I want it also for my children.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And if a son of peace is there, your peace shall rest upon it; but if not, it shall return upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord says that when a person sets out to preach the gospel, he should say as he enters into a house, Peace to this house.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This shows that God s peace comes to man by households.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not just given to individuals, but to households.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If anyone is worthy of peace in a house, peace will come to his entire household.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This verse is clear enough.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God deals with man by households.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thank God, peace comes to man household by household.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>9.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Household of Stephanas</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here Paul said that he baptized every member of the household of Stephanas.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Like the jailer and the house of Lydia, Stephanas s whole household believed and was baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>10.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Household of Onesiphorus</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Second Timothy 4:19 says, Greet Prisca and Aquila and the house of Onesiphorus, and 1:16 says, May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here was a family that took care of Paul, a household that was not ashamed of his chain.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Notice again that it was not an individual matter but something to do with a household.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These numerous cases provide ample proof in both the Old Testament and the New Testament that God deals with man by households.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is particularly true in the case of salvation; God takes the household as a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE HOUSEHOLD BEING ALSO THE UNIT</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>OF GOD S PUNISHMENT</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to see some verses which show that the unit of God s punishment is also the household.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When man rebelled against God, God was provoked and He judged man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In judging man He took the household as a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God s judgment comes through one man to the entire household, just as God s blessing comes through one man to the entire household.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once we see this, we will take a stand for our household and declare that our household is for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A. Pharaoh and His House</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Genesis 12:17 says, The Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues, because of Sarai, Abram s wife.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The sin of Pharaoh brought God s plague to his whole household.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God punished his whole household.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If God s judgment comes to a household, we should expect that His blessing also will come to a household.</S>
