   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX FOUR LINES IN FIRST CORINTHIANS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:5, 7; 2:14-15; 3:1, 3; 4:21; 8:1b; 12:31 --13:1, 3, 8; 14:1, 37; 16:18, 24</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we are going to experience the things mentioned in 1 Corinthians, we have to see that in this book, four lines are presented to us: the line of Christ, the line of the gifts, the line of the spirit, and the line of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE LINE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first line is the line of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Chapter one says that God has called us into the fellowship, the participation, the enjoyment, of Christ v. 9 . God's intention is that we all may share Christ, partake of Christ, and enjoy Christ as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God v. 24 . He has been made to us righteousness for our past, sanctification for our present, and redemption for our future v. 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In chapter two Christ is the Lord of glory v. 8 and the depths of God v. 10 . In chapter three He is the foundation v. 11 . In chapter five He is the Passover v. 7 and the unleavened bread v. 8 . In chapter ten He is the spiritual food, the spiritual drink, and the spiritual rock vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In chapter eleven Christ is the Head v. 3 . In chapter twelve He is the Body v. 12 . Finally, in chapter fifteen He is the firstfruits vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>20, 23 , the second man v. 47 , the last Adam v. 45 , and the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is the first, the second, and the last.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is everything, and this all-inclusive Christ became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This life-giving Spirit indwells our spirit, so he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today all the items of what Christ is are the elements, the components, of the life-giving Spirit, who dwells in our spirit to be our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE LINE OF THE GIFTS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The second line in 1 Corinthians is the line of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This line is not very positive.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, in a certain sense, it may be considered as negative.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In chapter one Paul said that the Corinthians had been enriched by Christ in everything, especially "in all utterance and all knowledge" v. 5 . He did not say that they were rich in life, in the spirit, or in the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They were rich in speaking and in knowledge in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, the Corinthians practiced the miraculous, outward gifts such as healing, speaking in tongues, etc., mentioned in chapters twelve and fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But they were still infants in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They were not only fleshly but even fleshy 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In chapter twelve Paul said that there are varieties of gifts v. 4 . The gifts are many in number, but at the end of chapter twelve Paul advised the Corinthians to earnestly desire the greater gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Of the nine gifts which Paul listed in chapter twelve as the manifestation of the Spirit, speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues are listed last because they are not the best gifts vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>7-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then at the end of chapter twelve Paul spoke of the placing of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He said, "And God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues" v. 28 . Notice that various kinds of tongues are listed last.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul went on to say, "Are all apostles?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Are all prophets?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Are all teachers?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do all have works of power?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do all have gifts of healing?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do all speak in tongues?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do all interpret tongues?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But earnestly desire the greater gifts" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>29-31a .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues are again, for the third time, listed last in Paul's writing because they render the least profit to the church 14:4-6, 19 .</S>
