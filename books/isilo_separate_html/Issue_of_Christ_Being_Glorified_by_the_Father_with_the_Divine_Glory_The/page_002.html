The burden of these messages can be expressed in the following four statements:</P><P>1.The glory of Christ's divinity was concealed in Him as in a grain of wheat.<br>2.In His glorification He, as the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit for His divine dispensing.<br>3.In His resurrection He was born with His humanity to be the firstborn Son of God for His divine transformation.<br>4.Through His resurrection all His believers were regenerated to be the many sons of God for His divine multiplication.</P><P>The matter of Christ's being glorified by the Father is referred to in the following verses of John: 7:39; 8:54; 12:16, 23; 13:31-32; 17:1, 5. This message, which is quite particular, is on the concealed glory of Christ's divinity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. CHRIST AS THE SECOND OF THE TRIUNE GOD POSSESSING THE DIVINE GLORY FROM ETERNITY PAST</H2><P>Christ as the second of the Triune God possessed the divine glory from eternity past. John 1:1 reveals that Christ, the Word, is God: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." As God Christ has the divine glory. Since Christ was God from eternity past, He possessed the divine glory also from eternity past. What is the divine glory? The divine glory is God Himself. God Himself is glory.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
