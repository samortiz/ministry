   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Witness Lee: The first verse gives us the noun-subject.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul began with the word Paulos, his own name.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Following this, he spoke of his three qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These three qualifications qualify the noun-subject Paulos .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is like a business card in which the name of a person appears first, followed by his titles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul spoke in a defensive tone in his letter to the Roman Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is because men at that time could not easily accept the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul did not use his own name when he wrote the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But in Romans 1:1 he put down his own name and showed his qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the authority by which he was commissioned for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this declaration he said that he was not only called but also separated unto the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The gospel of God is the gospel that Paul preached.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verses 2 through 6 give an overall explanation of this gospel, because the predicate does not appear until verse 7.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 7 is a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The words in verses 2 through 6 are parenthetical words.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the New Testament, we find at least fifty to sixty such parenthetical passages.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>William Kelly was a great Bible expositor of the last century.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was a doctor in theology but later gave up his theological degree.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Over seventy years ago when he wrote about the word servant in Romans 1:1, he pointed out that a servant is a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In man's eyes such a person is lowly, but it was different for Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was a slave of Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul seemed to be boasting about this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Outsiders probably cannot understand what he was saying.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only those who know the liberty and sanctification of grace can boast of such a title "a slave of Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No one else is taught this way, and no one else can enjoy this privilege.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are called saints, but Paul was a called apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Apostleship is not hereditary or self-appointed, but commissioned and separated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul was an apostle for the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why did he not say the gospel of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although the gospel was accomplished by Christ, the source of this gospel is God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No doubt, the gospel can only be found in Christ and through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But "the gospel of God" points us to God as the ultimate source of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>William R. Newell is an American Bible expositor.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He told us that in the beginning of the book of Romans we only find the name of Paul, not Silas, Timothy, or other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only he was called by Christ to be an apostle to the Gentiles Gal 2:8-9 and a herald of the gospel in that age.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The book of Ephesians also bears only the name of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is because he was the only one who saw the great revelation of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the beginning of Romans, he calls himself a slave, one bought with a price.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This expression speaks of his most noble aspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The word called is used three times from verse 1 through verse 7.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Calling is God's act of designation and separation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In verse 6 the saints are "the called ones of Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The believers are given to Christ by the Father John 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They were joined to Him before there was even the history of the world: "Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world" Eph 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Romans 1:7 speaks of the called saints not called to be saints .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This does not mean that we are asked to become saints a teaching of the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are called under God's sovereignty as saints.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are the holy ones, those who are washed by Christ's blood and who are created in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even the angels did not become angels through a process of sanctification; they were created angels.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is what Paul means when he says that he was called.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul was called and summoned for the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The gospel is God's glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is God who loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is God who sent His Son to us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, the gospel is the message that tells us about God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This was Paul's commission.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>CONCERNING THE "APOSTLE"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Watchman Nee: Ephesians 4:8 says that the Lord gave apostles to His church after His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, we know that the twelve apostles were appointed before His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, the apostles appointed after His ascension were different from the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even in the kingdom age, their position will be different.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The twelve apostles will not only reign and rule with the Lord, but will sit on the twelve thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel Matt 19:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In 1 Corinthians 15, Paul talked about his experience of being called to be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He said that the Lord appeared directly to him and called him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In verse 5 he said that Christ appeared to "the twelve."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In verse 7 he said that the Lord appeared to James, the brother of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The same verse also says that the Lord appeared also "to all the apostles."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>These apostles certainly were not the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Perhaps they refer to an ordinary group of apostles who were appointed by the Holy Spirit to continue the work of the first apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Acts 13 speaks of Paul and Barnabas being called by the Holy Spirit to be apostles to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Of the original twelve apostles, Judas died on account of his evil.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Some people do not consider Matthias to be one of the twelve and artificially put Paul as one of the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But Acts 1 says that Matthias was "counted with the eleven apostles" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>24-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In chapter two it says, "Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke forth" v. 14 . This shows us that the Holy Spirit recognized Matthias as being one of the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Paul was an apostle; so was Barnabas.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Even Silas and Timothy were called apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Romans 16:7 shows us clearly that Andronicus and Junia were apostles also.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Revelation 2:2 speaks of false apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This book was written between the end of A.D. 95 and the beginning of A.D. 96.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>At that time John was old, and most of the apostles of that age were dead.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>John was the only one left.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It was difficult to know who were real apostles and who were false.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus said that apostles must be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Apostles are those who are sent out by God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The death of the twelve apostles did not terminate the lineage of apostleship.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In Roman Catholicism, the pope at the Vatican appoints himself as an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The term apostle carries a special significance and status because of this.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>One item to be recovered in the Bible is the producing of apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Neither Paul nor I can be counted as one of the twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Yet we can still be apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The proof of apostleship is first in God's sending and then in the church's confirmation.</S>
