   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE A CLOSING WORD I. THE GOD IN ROMANS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that God is revealed progressively throughout the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is revealed in twelve situations in Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First of all, Romans shows us God in His creation 1:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God is invisible; yet the invisible things of God, such as His eternal power and divine nature, are clearly seen, being apprehended by means of the things created by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Secondly, Romans unveils to us God in condemnation Rom 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After being created, man fell and became sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This brought in God s condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After this, Romans presents to us God in redemption Rom 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God s condemnation reveals man s need of salvation, but for the righteous God to save sinful man, redemption is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After redemption, God is revealed in justification Rom 3 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God is righteous and He cannot be unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The redeeming death of Christ has fulfilled and satisfied God s righteous requirements for us sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the redemption of Christ not only affords God the righteous ground upon which to justify those who believe in Christ s redemption, but also God Himself is bound by His righteousness to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Following this, God is seen in reconciliation Rom 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We were not only sinners, but also enemies of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s justification is based upon Christ s redemption and issues in His reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here we joy in God and enjoy God in all that He is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>More than this, God is realized by us in our identification with Christ Rom 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has not only reconciled us to Himself, but has also identified us with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We were born in Adam, but God has transferred us from Adam into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Romans 6 God has become the God in identification, having accomplished a great work in order to make us one with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God has identified us with Himself in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Romans also shows that God is experienced by us in sanctification Rom 6 through 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He has made us one with Christ so that we may be sanctified not only positionally, but also dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Identification thus issues in sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In sanctification, He is the God in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The very God who created us, redeemed us, and justified us is now in us!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is no longer merely objective to us, but He is very subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is no longer just in the heavens, far away from us; He is now right within us, in our spirit 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Romans also reveals that God is enjoyed by us in glorification Rom 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He has foreknown us, predestinated us, called us, and justified us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is now sanctifying us and He will glorify us 8:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Moreover, God is further revealed to us in His love that secures our destiny 8:31-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In justification He has made us partakers of His righteousness, in sanctification He is working His holiness into our being, and in glorification He will bring us into His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His love is the security of all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is also seen in His selection Rom 9 through 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not that we have selected Him, but rather that He has selected us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His selection is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In His selection we have been destined to have a share, a portion, in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually, God is glorified in the Body of Christ Rom 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In chapter twelve God is in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is not only God in the spirits of the believers, but God in a corporate, collective entity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Finally, Romans unfolds to us that God is expressed in the church life Rom 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Body of Christ is spiritual and universal.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It has to be expressed practically in various localities as churches.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God is expressed in Christ, Christ is expressed in His Body, and the Body of Christ is expressed in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As we come to Romans 16, we discover that God is in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the one hand, God is in our spirit; on the other hand, He is in all the local churches.</S>
