BEING JOINED TOGETHER AND KNIT TOGETHER<br />
WITH THE MEMBERS TO CAUSE<br />
THE GROWTH OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>Growth is also spoken of at the end of Ephesians 4:16, which says, &ldquo;Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together...through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body.&rdquo; There is a distinction between <em>the growth of the Body</em> in this verse and <em>grow up into...Christ</em> in verse 15. Growing up into Christ in verse 15 is related to basic growth in our spiritual life, but the growth of the Body in verse 16 is a further step of growth because it is related to letting the Holy Spirit operate in us to bring forth a function that is manifested through our being joined together and knit together with the members of the Body for the growth of the Body. In other words, growth in verse 15 is related to giving Christ the ground in our life; growth in verse 16 is related to being full of Christ in our function. This second step of growth causes the service of the saints in the church to be full of the element of Christ.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters have some experience of being joined to Christ in their personal life, but they do not manifest much spiritual function in relation to the other members of the Body of Christ. They seem to have the element of Christ in matters related to their living, but when they come together with others, not much of Christ is manifested in their function in the church meetings or service.</p>
<p>I know a sister who was indeed a person living in the Lord. Yet remarkably, she would always fall asleep in the meetings. She loved the Lord and lived in the Lord, but she loved to sleep in the meetings. Furthermore, even though she knew that she would fall asleep, she would still sit close to the speaker. She did not like to sit in the back, so she would always sit in the second or third row. A young co-worker went to speak at this sister&rsquo;s locality around 1943. Since he had just started to serve the Lord, he was bold in himself but narrow in his capacity. As he spoke over a period of four days, the sister would fall asleep in front of him. Finally, when he could not stand this any longer, he spoke to the sister from the podium, saying, &ldquo;If you continue to sleep, I will kick you out!&rdquo; After the meeting I said to him, &ldquo;Brother, you were too much. Do you not know that she loves the Lord?&rdquo; Nevertheless, I still would like to ask, if brothers or sisters sleep in every meeting, what does this say about their service?</p>
<p>My burden is to show that it is possible for a Christian to grow up into Christ in many matters without manifesting Christ through functioning in the church. We may not fall asleep in the meetings, but if we have no burden for the service and cannot bear others, we are sleeping in our spirit. It is possible to have some personal growth but not contribute to the growth of the Body. After growing in Christ personally, we need to function for the sake of the growth of the Body. We cannot neglect our personal relationship with the Lord, but it must be for the building up of others. We must hold to truth in love, gradually grow up into Christ in all things, and be joined together and knit together with others according to our operating function so that the Body may grow and build itself up in love.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO GROW WITH THE GROWTH OF GOD</h2>
<p>Growth is also spoken of in Colossians 2:19, which says, &ldquo;Holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, being richly supplied and knit together by means of the joints and sinews, grows with the growth of God.&rdquo; Since Ephesians and Colossians are sister books, Colossians 2 also speaks of growth in relation to the building up of the church. This shows that the growth of the church is based on the increase of the element of God. All growth in the church, whether individual or corporate, involves the increase of the element of God. The church is built up when God increases in us. The church is torn down when the element of God decreases. The increase in the element of God determines how much the church is built up.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>grows with the growth of God</em> is so concise and all-inclusive that it includes both steps of growth spoken of in Ephesians 4:15-16. Actually, the love, the truth, and the operation spoken of in these verses are God Himself; without God, they would not exist. In Genesis 11:1-9 God scattered the people from Babel over the surface of the earth because the people rebelled against God and rejected Him. When God forsook them, their language was confounded. However, when the Holy Spirit descended on the day of Pentecost, the resulting oneness was signified through the communication of human language (Acts 2:1-11). As soon as the Spirit came, there was oneness. Thus, oneness is God Himself. If we learn to live before God, deny our self, and reject the flesh, our oneness in the church will be unbreakable; even the authority of Hades will cause no harm because our oneness will be God Himself.</p>
<p>We need to see exactly how much of the element of God is in us. If we have too much of the element of our self, we need to be shined upon and judged so that the element of our self may be killed and so that the element of God may increase. We must take care of this principle in all our service in the church. In our prayer with others, visitation of others, or fellowship with others after the meeting, our natural element must gradually decrease so that the divine element of God may gradually increase. Without this, we will not have much growth or be built up.</p>
<p>All natural human elements divide and tear down the church; only the mingled element of God is the joining and building element of the church. If there is not the element of God in a prayer meeting, there is a problem with that meeting. If our ways of visitation are the same year after year, it indicates that we are not growing. Some people manifest only their natural human element in their visitation. Thus, instead of building up the church, they actually tear down the church. For example, before they visited the brothers and sisters, there was death, but it was not spreading quickly. However, as soon as they start to visit the brothers and sisters, this death spreads more quickly. In order to have service that builds up the church, we must learn to reject our natural element and let the element of God increase so that the divine life in us may grow. Only then can we manifest the function that joins us together and knits us together with others for the building up of the church.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Service for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
