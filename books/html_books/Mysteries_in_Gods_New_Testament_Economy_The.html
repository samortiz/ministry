Under Your sovereignty, You have arranged the circumstances and have prepared all of us to be gathered together from all the scattered places into Your name. Lord, remember that we are meeting in Your name. We remind You of Your promise that You will be with us. May You fill this conference with Your glorious Self. Sanctify these four days. Lord, grant us a clear sky, one that is open, unclouded, and unveiled, so that we would be full of eyes within and without and would be as clear as the four living creatures are before You. Lord, we worship You for giving us such a prayer. May You bring us into all that we pray and ask for and grant us all the glorious facts that we beseech You for, so that we would know Christ, the Body of Christ, the economy of God, and God's move on earth today. O Lord Jesus, fill our minds and our mouth with Yourself so that we would not talk about anything else, but would only talk about Christ and His glorious Body. May this one thing fill our hearts, and may it fill the prayers and praises that we offer to God the Father. Lord, thank You that You are with us daily until the end of the age, according to Your promise at the end of Matthew 28. Lord, bless this day. In this day may all that we feel, all that we think about, all that we touch, all that we talk about, speak of, and sing of, and all that is expressed within and without be just You. Lord, we are sitting with You in the heavenlies. Preserve us. Do not let us lower ourselves, and do not allow us to descend. May Your own Self fill our vision, our speaking, and all of our conversations. O Lord Jesus, while we are praising You, we cannot forget about Your enemy. We pray that You would bind him. We also bind him in Your victorious name. Lord, we believe what we are binding is what You have bound in heaven already. Lord, release Your riches, and release our spirits. We believe that whatsoever we release has been released in the heavens already. May You gain the glory. Amen.</P><P>After being separated for such a long time, it is a joy to be gathered together under one roof again. The reason that we are all gathered together this time is that a few of the responsible brothers from Taipei took the opportunity to make a visit to Southeast Asia in March. Based on what they have seen and experienced, they felt that there was the need for all the elders and co-workers of all the churches in Asia to come together for fellowship and to seek the Lord together. For that reason we decided to have this conference. Perhaps the feeling of the brothers is inclined toward the meeting of the present need. But my feeling before the Lord is not to take care of the present situation. Rather, it is to be turned away from the present situation and to enter into a new day and another age.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A HISTORY OF CHANGE</H2><P>The history of the Lord's recovery has not been that long among us. We have passed through about three quarters of a century. Our brother who was before us, Brother Watchman Nee, was saved in 1920. Two years later, the Lord used him to raise up meetings in his hometown of Foochow. This could be considered as the beginning of the Lord's recovery among us. From that time until now, it has been sixty-eight years. Humanly speaking, it is a long period of time, long enough for a man to pass through most of his life. During the first period of the Lord's recovery, that is, the first eight or ten years, we received help mostly from outsiders. Between 1930 and 1934, Brother Nee himself began to receive revelation from the Lord.</P><P>In 1931 Brother Nee consented to the request of some brothers from the Closed Brethren for a visit to us in China. The Closed Brethren were stronger than the Open Brethren in matters of truth and life. Their visit created some problems. Based on this, Brother Nee was willing to go to them and had some fellowship with them. In 1933 he went to Europe, and from there he crossed the ocean and went to Canada. The Brethren movement was strong in those two places. Through this visit, Brother Nee gained more knowledge and was also somewhat affected. After he came back, he reconsidered the way that the Lord wants the church to take on this earth. He received God's revelation and saw something new concerning the truth of the church.</P><P>As a result, in 1934 he published a book based on a Bible study he conducted with the brothers. The name of it was The Meeting Life. In 1937 he called an urgent co-workers' meeting, which was held first in Shanghai and then in Hangkow, in which he released a series of messages. These messages became the content of the book The Normal Christian Church Life, with which we are all familiar. After this, there was a storm among us. The problem involved was a very deep-rooted one. For six years Brother Nee was not able to fulfill his ministry. It was not until 1948 that his ministry was recovered and that he was able to serve the churches again. He then went on further with what he saw. As a result, he began a training at Kuling near his hometown. One term of this training was conducted during the second half of 1948. It lasted for four months. In 1949 there was a second term, which lasted for about four months also. After this the Communists took over the mainland. Some of us left the mainland and came to Taiwan. I was one of these. Brother Nee stayed behind on the mainland with the other brothers and sisters for the Lord's testimony. Soon afterwards, the situation changed drastically. Brother Nee was put into prison, and he and his speaking were locked up for twenty years. During this period we were unable to communicate with each other. Hence, we had no way to find out what more he had seen before the Lord.</P><P>After we were led out of the mainland, we began to propagate the Lord's work. First we began in Taiwan, then in Southeast Asia, and lastly in the West. During the past forty years, the Lord has been taking us on all the time. All that the Lord has shown us has been released as messages, and most of it has been printed in books. However, there is one unfortunate thing among us. During the past twenty or more years, time and again turmoils have occurred. About once every few years there has been a storm. Some of you can remember that from 1949 to 1957 our number jumped from three or five hundred to forty or fifty thousand. But the visit of Brother Sparks brought in the dissension of a few brothers, and a storm was formed. The storm began taking shape in 1959. Within a period of six years, the whole situation became quite damaged. Prior to this I had gone to America to work overseas. I did not come back until 1965 to deal with the situation. That was the first storm. After this, the Lord propagated His work in the United States through us. By 1978 there was another storm. That storm was not as complicated. In less than a year, it was over. During the past few years, there has been a third storm. This storm began developing and fermenting from 1985. By 1987 it had become a definite turmoil. Now after over two years, the storm is almost over.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>REACTION TO THIS TURMOIL</H2><P>I personally passed through these few turmoils and took the lead in taking care of them. For this reason, I have many thoughts and realizations and have even seen many things concerning these matters. I am saying all this to let everyone know the cause and direction of our meeting at this time. Except for this reason, I have no desire to mention anything concerning the past. When we come together this time, the primary thing is to return to the word of the Lord. I believe a lot of you here, after hearing about the things that have happened in the last three to five years, would all feel that we have heard too much. The same words and the same things have been repeated again and again. It has really been meaningless. May the Lord cover me with the blood. During this entire time of turmoil, I did not say anything. Up until last November, I had been silent. I spent most of my time here in Taipei to bear the Lord's commission for three things: 1) to conduct the training for the gospelization work of Taiwan; 2) to bring in the new way beginning from the church in Taipei; and 3) to work with the translation and editing of the Chinese New Testament Recovery Version. Actually, most of my time was spent on the New Testament Recovery Version.</P><P>During this period I was silent for another reason: I wanted to see what the Lord's hand was doing and what the mind of the Lord was. I had indeed heard enough, but I did not think that I should express any opinion. That was why I was silent. I only released some messages to the church here according to the Lord's leading. The supply on this side has never stopped, but I did not do anything to deal with the problem that had arisen. It was not until November of last year when we had the international conference on Thanksgiving Day in Anaheim that I received the clear direction from the Lord, had a clear understanding of all the situations, and began to speak officially. I spoke twice to all the elders and co-workers from different countries, once after the Thanksgiving conference and another time after the winter training. Based on the messages and fellowship in these two times, I compiled the two books The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion and The Present Situation of the Churches in the Recovery throughout the World. These two books are my clarifying and concluding word to the saints in the Lord's recovery throughout the whole world. I also prepared this clarifying and concluding word for the sake of history. The book The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion includes my spoken messages, but its content was edited afterwards by me personally. I have carefully checked all the facts and have tried my best to be accurate, to be without any mistakes. In addition to an account of the beginning and development of the whole period of the rebellion, the content of that book includes personal testimonies from over thirty brothers. Therefore, concerning this storm, I have spoken the clarifying and concluding word that I needed to speak. I have absolutely no more interest in talking about this matter. This matter now stops here. I hope that you brothers who have come to attend this conference will not mention it anymore. It does not deserve any more mentioning. In these four days we will go on.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PAYING ATTENTION TO THINGS<br>ORGANIC AND INTRINSIC</H2><P>During the past two years, I have released many messages. Some are in English; others are in Chinese. I believe you can find two expressions which I have used in a particular way. They are "organic" and "intrinsic." All my messages from the second half of 1986 never depart in thought and idea from these two points of being "organic" and "intrinsic." I feel that during this recent storm, many sayings and rumors have deviated from organic matters into organizational matters, and many have departed from the intrinsic things to the outward things. Romans 2:28-29 says, "For he is not...who is one outwardly...But he is...who is one inwardly." Hence, everything that is done outwardly does not count. Everything that is not intrinsic, but is outward, is worthless before God. This shows that the Bible does not give any credit to outward matters. In the same way, organization is not only worthless but also condemnable before God. Only that which issues forth from the divine life of the Triune God is organic and is of worth and of value before God. This is why my messages for the past few years have repeatedly been on the organic and intrinsic matters.</P><P>The Lord's recovery among us began with Brother Nee. He paid much attention to the matter of being organic. Although he did not use the term organic much, all of the messages he released had to do with life. In the foreword of his book The Normal Christian Church Life, he made it clear that although the book covers his view concerning the work and the church, he would much rather concentrate himself on the spiritual side of his ministry and avoid dealing with the outward, technical aspects of the work and the church. When we began mentioning the new way five years ago, some brothers thought that it was but an outward method. This is a great misunderstanding. On the one hand, our human body is very organic. On the other hand, this organic body cannot be cut off from activities. If we are right and proper in our eating, working, and exercise, the body will be healthy. The same is true with the Body of Christ. It has its works and activities. Seemingly these works and activities are outward and superficial. Actually they issue from the source, element, and essence of the inward life.</P><P>Hence, the new way that we are practicing here is absolutely not an outward activity that has to do only with budgets, statistics, or numbers as the outsiders say. Everything that I have spoken to the trainees concerns either Christ's death and resurrection or spirit and life. This can be proved from the messages that I have released. It is true that when we first started four or five years ago, I did ask them to have statistics and budgets, and to pay attention to results. But during that trial period, I said again and again that it was an experiment; nothing was final yet. I was taking the lead to experiment. I knew what we were trying to obtain. Thank the Lord. By today we have obtained what we wanted to obtain.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A PROSPEROUS SITUATION</H2><P>This time during the Asia elders' and co-workers' meeting, besides the elders and co-workers on the whole island plus those from overseas churches, we have two hundred eighty full-time brothers and sisters who are here as participants. Approximately two hundred among them are involved in the gospel outreach work. The other eighty are trainees. Since January of last year, four groups have moved out to the villages for the spread of the gospel, and sixty-one churches have been raised up, bringing in approximately two thousand remaining fruit. In the past, the item which was most attacked was the Full-time Training. But today by looking at the manifested result, you can see for yourself whether that was something outward or something intrinsic. At present, doors are opened to the Lord's recovery in all six continents of the world. Mainly they were opened through our publications and through the video and audio tapes of messages. In places like Mexico, Central America, and South America, it is not the opening of city after city, but the opening of whole continents. The need is unprecedented in the history of Christianity. Even Africa and India in Asia are also opened up, not to mention many other places. Even if we had many more people, they would not be able to meet the demand. We are truly short of manpower. In southern California alone, we are unable to meet the need.</P><P>For this reason, we have to continue with this training. Now the ones sent out from here are welcomed everywhere they go. They are very effective. Especially now that the Chinese-speaking meetings are springing up everywhere abroad like green shoots after the rainy season, the potential is very great.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>REMOVING DOUBTS AND MOVING FORWARD</H2><P>However, there is still one thing which causes my heart to ache very much. From the time the Lord's recovery moved from the mainland to overseas, that is, since 1949 when we came to Taiwan, it has been forty years already. Our standard and quality is still not high enough. Some places are still at the kindergarten stage; they are merely maintaining a minimum testimony. The Lord's recovery on earth is involved in a work of education. We should be continually uplifted and deepened in truth and life. During the recent storm, I was generally aware of the criticisms in all the places. Please pardon me and give me the liberty to be a fool and to speak the words of a fool. I have no intention to rebuke anyone. I only ask you to remove your doubts and to throw them all away. These doubts are not only hurting others but are even the more hurting yourselves. I speak this word so that you will remove your doubts. The Lord's recovery has absolutely no problem. If there is any doubt in you, I beg you to leave that behind. There is no problem in the Lord's recovery. There is no problem in Taipei, and there is no problem in the United States. We have already said this clearly in the book The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion.</P><P>I have spoken all these words not for myself, but for you who have come from afar. You have sacrificed your time, your energy, and your money. You have laid aside your jobs and families to come here. I am very grateful for this. If you still have some doubts in you, they are unnecessary. There is nothing to worry about. The Lord's truth is still among us. The Lord's recovery has no problem. Hence, please take this frank little fellowship in love. I pray that the Lord would be merciful to me and also to you, that from today we would not speak much concerning this matter. I also hope that you would not discuss this matter behind our back anymore. Let the past be past. Forget the things that are behind, and press forward to the things that are before, so that we can all go on together.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>COMING BACK TO THE LORD'S WORD TOGETHER</H2><P>It is a rare opportunity for all of us to be able to gather here this time. I feel deeply that the best thing to do is to come back to the Lord's word together, to enjoy the Lord and His presence, and to have some prayers in one accord. I believe that this is worthwhile. For this reason, during these four days we have arranged to have one hour during the first session every morning to enjoy half a chapter from the book of Ephesians. We will have another half a chapter for pray-reading in the second session. This will serve as the foundation for our fellowship. In the afternoon, I would ask you to take my advice and come together from three-thirty to six o'clock to read some messages. There are altogether eight messages, two from the California elders' meetings of March this year, two from the elders' and co-workers' meetings of the church in Taipei recently, and four from last week's conference with the church in Taipei. Every afternoon we will read two messages. In the four evenings, we will have four messages that cover specifically the mysteries in God's New Testament economy. The first message will be on the mystery of God being Christ. The second message will be on the mystery of Christ being the church. The third message will be on the mysterious organism in God's New Testament economy. The fourth message will be on the mysterious law of the Spirit of life in God's New Testament economy. This time we want to consider these matters in a most profound, transcendent, and conclusive way. I hope that this will serve as an initiation to draw out more treasures and will bring in something precious. I believe that the Lord is rich among us.</P><P>I want the brothers and sisters to know that during the past five or six years, while I was studying the new way of the Lord, I have never deviated from the basic structure of the messages of my ministry. All the time I have been on life. Let me repeat that it is a rare opportunity for us to come together this time. I hope that the brothers would pray and would be prepared to receive revelation from God. This will uplift us and will uplift and carry on the Lord's recovery.</P><P>(A word given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on April 18, 1990)</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE MYSTERY OF GOD&#151;CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Col. 2:2b;

Amen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEW TESTAMENT, ECONOMY, AND MYSTERY</H2><P>The main subject of our meetings this time is the mysteries in God's New Testament economy. Here we have three very crucial terms. The first is the one that we are most familiar with&#151;the new testament. Unfortunately, many crucial terms in the Bible have been made common by Christians through their usage. As a result, they have lost their true meaning. When we mention the new testament, many do not have too much feeling for it and do not pay much attention to it. In 1931 Brother Watchman Nee called together a special conference and talked specifically about the matter of the new testament. Most of those messages were printed in his magazine The Present Testimony. They were very valuable messages. Later the Gospel Bookroom published a book called The New Covenant. The first half of that book contains messages by Brother Nee on the principles of the new testament. The second half of that book contains messages that I released in 1948 in Shanghai concerning the practice. From that time until now, in our literature and messages we have not touched the matter of the new testament again. But whether or not we understand it, and no matter how much or how little we comprehend it, in the universe and also in human culture there is such a noble thing as the new testament.</P><P>Another crucial term is economy. The term in Greek is oikonomia. Oikos means house, and nomos means the law. The word means house law, household management and household administration, and is extended in meaning to denote an administrative arrangement, plan, and economy. In one conference in Los Angeles in 1964, I first began using the word economy. First Timothy 1:4 and Ephesians 3:9 both use this word. The third term is mystery. In Ephesians 3:9 Paul spoke of "the dispensation of the mystery, which from the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things." God had an Old Testament economy in the Old Testament. He also has a New Testament economy in the New Testament. The Old Testament economy was based on the law of God. There was not that much mystery in it. But the New Testament economy is different; it is based completely on the mystery of God. Every point in God's New Testament economy is a mystery.</P><P>We can say that the whole New Testament economy is a story of mystery. This mystery is based on God, or on the Triune God. The Triune God is a mystery. There is no way for us to exhaust Him. I have been speaking on the truth concerning the Triune God for a few decades. I consider that I have spoken much. But in the end, I have to say that I still do not understand that much. The reason for this is that it is a mystery. It is not so accurate to say the Trinity or the Three-in-One. The direct expression should be triune. This is not found in any earthly mathematics. We think that we know the doctrine of the Triune God. But actually we still do not know that much. I feel that the more we work in the Lord's work, the more we feel that we cannot work. The more messages we give, the more we feel that we do not understand. We all have to admit that we are nothing, and we can do nothing. Only God is the One who is. As for us, we are not. If we want to know about God, we first have to know about ourselves. We are nothing, and the Lord is everything. All we can do is to put ourselves in His hands. As long as He blesses, others will be fed and will have an overabundance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MYSTERY OF GOD&#151;CHRIST</H2><P>Of all the mysteries in God's New Testament economy, the first of them is the mystery of God. The second half of Colossians 2:2 says, "The mystery of God, Christ." We can see that Jesus Christ is a mystery; He is not simple at all. I do not believe that we have exhausted all that the Bible speaks concerning Him. I believe that we have only covered a part. There are still many things which we do not understand. In spite of that, when we come together to fellowship and to talk about them, we will gradually be brought into understanding them.</P><P>Concerning God's mystery, Christ, I have listed six points. First, Christ is the mysterious Word of God. Second, the Word became flesh. Third, He passed through human living. Fourth, He was crucified. Fifth, He resurrected. Sixth, He ascended. All these items that Christ has passed through are the mystery of God. Christ is the Word of God, and the Word is God Himself. As the Word becoming flesh, God became flesh and stayed with us. His living was God's living. When men saw Him, they saw God. Then He died in the flesh and resurrected. He lived in His death. He was the grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died to produce many grains (John 12:24). He died and He lived. He lives through His dying, for He is life and He is God. Finally, He ascended. Concerning Christ, we have these six points: the Word of God, His becoming flesh, His passing through human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Christ in these mysterious aspects is the mystery of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Christ Being the Mysterious Word of God</H2><P>Now let us follow the outline to consider the various aspects of the mysterious Christ of God point by point. First, He is the mysterious Word of God in eternity past. John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." In eternity past, before time began, Christ was the Word of God. It was divine thought that became constituted as an expression, which in turn became the Word that can be comprehended by man. The Word here is logos in Greek. It means an expression constituted by a thought, which is understood by man. Although our God cannot be seen in the universe, He is the Word that can be understood by man. By this Word His mysterious being is explained and expressed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Invisible Word of God<br>Becoming Visible Flesh</H2><P>Second, the invisible Word of God became the visible flesh, which is Jesus Christ. His whole person is the embodiment of the Word of God. This is why the first Epistle of John begins with the Word of life which was there from the beginning and which was with the Father. It is that which we have heard, which we have seen with our own eyes, which we beheld, and which we have touched with our own hands. By becoming the flesh, this Word has become tangible and touchable. He is the mysterious God who was conceived of His Spirit and begotten in the womb of a human virgin (Matt. 1:20b). Then from this virgin's womb, He was born with humanity to be the mysterious God-man, in whom both divinity and humanity are mingled. Originally, He was the mysterious God in eternity. Through His Spirit, He was first begotten in the virgin's womb. Then after conception, He was born with humanity as a God-man in whom divinity and humanity are mingled. What was conceived was God. What came out was the God-man. The baby Jesus that was in the manger was the mysterious God-man in whom both divinity and humanity are mingled as one. This Jesus is Jehovah the Savior. Men shall call His name Emmanuel, which means God with us (Matt. 1:23). He is Jehovah God as our Savior and is also God with us.</P><P>When Christ became flesh, He put on human flesh (Heb. 2:14a) and partook of all that man is. Through this He brought His mysterious divinity into humanity, that is, He brought God into man. In this way, the mysterious fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily in this mysterious God-man (Col. 2:9). What is in Christ, the mysterious God-man, is not only divinity but also all the fullness of the Godhead, which is the expression of the riches of all that God is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>This Mysterious God-man&#151;<br>Passing through Human Living</H2><P>Third, this mysterious God-man passed through human living in His humanity with His mysterious divinity. When the Lord Jesus was living on earth, outwardly He was a man, a carpenter at home. Actually, it was God working in His humanity. This kind of realization has much to do with our living. Our living on earth today should be as that of the Lord Jesus, a living of divinity through humanity. We are not just human beings. We are God-men. We are those with God within us. When we live by Him, it makes us different. If we realize this matter, it will become more useful to us than if we understand many messages. Once the son of a king realizes his own status, he will become more dignified and will be different from others in his speech and conduct. Today, many Christians do not live like God-men, because they are not clear about their status. Permit me to say that it is very difficult for me to lose my temper today because I cannot sell my status. I can never forget that I am a God-man. If I remember my status, I will never lose my temper or criticize others easily, thus losing my own status. The Lord Jesus never sold Himself this way when He was on the earth. All the time He was living a life with the dignified status of a God-man.</P><P>Moreover, while the Lord was on earth, He experienced for us all the sufferings of human life. He was tried in all respects, that He might be able to sympathize with our weaknesses and help and rescue us (Heb. 2:17-18; 4:15). At the same time, He expressed the divine virtues in His humanity by the mysterious attributes of God (Luke 7:13-14). Today, we should live the same way on earth. We are no longer sinners. Rather, we are God-men. We should express the divine virtues in our humanity by God's mysterious attributes, such as love, light, holiness, righteousness, and power. This is the life of the Lord Jesus on earth. It is also the life that we should live today. What is expressed in our living should not merely be our virtuous acts but should be the divine virtues of God expressed in our humanity. Our living should be filled with the mysterious attributes of God that express the divine virtues.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>This Mysterious God-man Being Crucified<br>to Accomplish His All-inclusive Death</H2><P>Fourth, this mysterious God-man was crucified in His humanity with His mysterious divinity, dying an all-inclusive, mysterious death, thus accomplishing the eternal redemption of God (Heb. 9:12). When Christ the God-man was on the cross, He accomplished His all-inclusive death in seven statuses. First, as the mysterious Lamb, He took away the sin of man (John 1:29). Not only did He deal with the outward sins of man, but He also dealt with the nature of sin in man. Second, as a mysterious man of flesh, He condemned sin in the likeness of the flesh of sin, that is, in the form of fallen man, and dealt with the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3). Through the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in the flesh, God judged sin together with the flesh in which sin dwells. Third, as the mysterious last Adam, He terminated the man of the old creation (Rom. 6:6). The first Adam was the beginning of the human race. The last Adam is the termination of the human race. When Christ as the last Adam was crucified on the cross, the old man, who was created by God and who became fallen because of sin, was terminated. Fourth, as the mysterious Firstborn of all creation in the old creation, He terminated the entire old creation and reconciled all the creation to God (Col. 1:15, 20). Christ as the Firstborn of all creation takes preeminence in all creation. When this Christ was crucified on the cross, the whole old creation was terminated so that all the creation of God could be reconciled to Him. Fifth, as the mysterious brass serpent, He bruised the ancient serpent and destroyed Satan and his world (Gen. 3:15; Heb. 2:14; John 12:31). Sixth, as the mysterious Peacemaker, He abolished all the separating ordinances in the law (including all the different kinds of living, customs, and habits that cause divisions among mankind) through His mysterious death, thus making peace for all His Jewish and Gentile believers (Eph. 2:14-16). Seventh, as a mysterious grain of wheat, He released the divine life in Him through His death, thus making us many grains of wheat of life, like Him (John 12:24). This is the eternal redemption that Christ, the mysterious God-man, has accomplished through His allinclusive death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>This Mysterious God-man, Who Was Crucified,<br>Being Resurrected from the Dead</H2><P>The fifth main point is that this mysterious God-man, who was crucified, was resurrected from the dead with His crucified humanity by His eternal and immortal divinity (Acts 2:23-24; 3:15). The resurrection of Christ is truly a mystery. In His mysterious resurrection, He brought the humanity that He had put on into His mysterious divinity. When He became flesh, He brought divinity into humanity. When He resurrected from the dead, He brought humanity into divinity. This caused God and man to be mingled as one. Hence, today we are living in His divinity, and God is living in our humanity. God and we have the same life and the same living.</P><P>Moreover, as the mysterious only begotten Son of God, in His mysterious resurrection He was begotten with His humanity as the Son of Man to be the mysterious firstborn Son of God (Acts 13:33; Rom. 8:29), causing all His believers to be resurrected with Him and to be brought forth as the sons of God to be His brothers, who constitute the church of God (1 Pet. 1:3; Rom. 8:19; Heb. 2:11-12), which is His Body. This is indeed a mysterious birth. Every one of us has a part in this birth. Furthermore, in Christ's mysterious resurrection, this last Adam has become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) and is now ready to be received by those who believe in Him. Once we believe in Him, this life-giving Spirit enters into our spirit and joins us to His Spirit, so that we become one spirit with Him. We must see this truth. This is a most important item in our Christian experience. Only by being the Spirit can He enter into us to be our life and our living. If Christ cannot live in us, salvation becomes objective. But now that Christ has become the life-giving Spirit in resurrection and is living in us, God's salvation becomes subjective to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>This Mysterious God-man Ascending to the Height</H2><P>The sixth point is that this mysterious God-man, in His mysterious resurrection, ascended to the height with all the ones whom He resurrected (Eph. 4:8a; 2:6). This was accomplished in Christ's resurrection before we were born. We have to realize that we human beings are limited by time. But with God there is no time element. With Him there are only the facts; with Him there is no element of time. After Christ resurrected, He brought all the ones that He had resurrected, that is, those who believe in Him, to the height. In His mysterious ascension, there are sixteen items of what He has obtained and attained, what He is doing in this age, and what He will accomplish in the future.</P><P>First, He offered to God the ones whom He resurrected. God in turn gave them back to Him, and He gave them as gifts to the church (Eph. 4:8b). Second, He mysteriously fills all in all (Eph. 4:10; 1:23). Third, He mysteriously sat on the right hand of the Majesty on high (Heb. 1:3b). Fourth, He mysteriously was enthroned and crowned with glory and honor (Rev. 3:21; Heb. 2:9). Glory is the splendor into which Christ's person, with divinity and humanity, entered, and honor is the preciousness which the worth of Christ attained and the dignity which the position of Christ reached. Fifth, He became mysteriously the Head over all things (Eph. 1:22), that all things may be subjected under His feet. All of this is to the church. Sixth, He became mysteriously the Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36). To be Lord denotes Christ's being Lord of all men and all things in His divinity with His humanity (Acts 10:36). To be Christ denotes Christ's being anointed by God to accomplish God's eternal economy. Now this mysterious God-man is not only the Lord of all but also the Christ of God, bearing the commission to fulfill God's eternal economy. Seventh, He became mysteriously the Leader and Savior (Acts 5:31). He is the Ruler of all the kings of the earth for the arranging of the world situation, in order that He can be the Savior of all kinds of men.</P><P>Eighth, in such a mysterious ascension, He poured out Himself, the One who had entered into glory and attained honor, as the consummated, essential, and economical compound Spirit upon all His believers, baptizing them into His mysterious Body, the church of God (Acts. 2:17-18; 1 Cor. 12:13). Ninth, He became mysteriously the surety of the better covenant, that is the new covenant (Heb. 7:22), to be a guarantee to man. He shed His blood and died to enact the covenant, and He became the surety of such a covenant in resurrection. Tenth, He became mysteriously the Mediator, that is, the Executor, of the new covenant as a testament (Heb. 9:15). When Christ was on the earth, He enacted the new covenant through His death (Matt. 26:28) and left this new covenant as a testament, or a will, to His believers. Then He resurrected and ascended to the heaven to be the Executor of the testament that He enacted and left to His believers (Heb. 8:6), executing upon us all the bequests of the new covenant, such as the effectiveness of His all-inclusive death, His resurrection in power, His divine life, and the law of life to be our supply and enjoyment. Eleventh, He became mysteriously the Minister of the true tabernacle in the heavens, ministering heaven into us (Heb. 8:1-2). In other words, He ministers to all the believers the heavenly life and the divine and rich heavenly supply. Twelfth, He became mysteriously our Advocate with the Father, pleading for us (1 John 2:1b). Before the righteous God, He became our Advocate, pleading for us, that the interrupted fellowship between God and us may be recovered. Thirteenth, He became mysteriously the High Priest, interceding for us and saving us to the uttermost (Heb. 4:14-16; 7:25-26). Fourteenth, He became mysteriously the Son of Man as the High Priest walking in the midst of the golden lampstands, the churches (Rev. 1:13-16; 2:1). He is our High Priest, caring for the churches in His humanity.</P><P>Fifteenth, heaven will retain Him until He comes to be the Bridegroom to marry His bride, His overcomers, and to set up His kingdom and reign with His overcomers (Acts 3:21; Rev. 19:7-9; 11:15; 20:4, 6). Sixteenth, He became the mysterious Lamb of God as the center of the New Jerusalem in eternity (Rev. 22:1-3). In the new heaven and new earth in eternity, the New Jerusalem is the eternal habitation of the Triune God with us the redeemed people. Its center is the Lamb on the throne.</P><P>God is a mystery, and the mystery of God is Christ. This Christ is the mysterious Word of God, taking on the form of flesh and passing through human living in His humanity with His mysterious divinity. He was crucified, accomplishing the all-inclusive and mysterious death, resurrected, and ascended to the heavens. This totality of what Christ is, what He has done, all that He has passed through, and all that He has attained, obtained, and established constitute the story of the mystery of God. May this mysterious story of God become our subjective knowledge and our practical living.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on April 18, 1990)</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ADDITIONAL WORD</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(1)</H1><P>While I was listening to your pray-reading this morning, I had a feeling within me. We began to practice pray-reading in 1966. By now it has been twenty-four years. This does not mean that we have graduated already. We still have to learn to pray-read better. In our pray-reading, we did not have an adequate digestion of the Lord's word. In particular, the rich flavor that is in the Lord's word did not come out through our praying and digestion. Pray-reading is like eating; one cannot do it hastily. This is especially true with rich meals. We have to eat slowly before we can sense the taste and assimilate the riches. We have to learn to do this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RAISING THE LEVEL OF SPIRITUALITY</H2><P>You who are sitting here can be considered as the cream of the Lord's recovery in Asia. I would take this opportunity to fellowship with you a word from my heart. According to my observation, during the past few decades, we seem to have stopped advancing in the Lord's recovery. Our spiritual level has not progressed that much. It seems that we are still at the elementary school age. We know some basic truths. But concerning matters such as the mysterious revelations in God's New Testament economy, we still do not know that much. During the past forty years, although I have borne the responsibility in the release of the truth, there are few among us who can be considered as university graduates spiritually. For this I feel indebted to you.</P><P>This time I came with an intention to fellowship this matter with you clearly. At least I should tell you honestly that we are not up to the standard. We have to have the self-realization that we are not up to the standard. Do not talk about the right and wrong things anymore. They are not worth our mentioning at all. What is worth mentioning is our knowledge concerning the truth. We have to realize that at least fifty percent of our work in the church is in education. If this aspect is conducted poorly, we come short and have failed. For this reason, from now on, we must strive and pursue toward this point.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>KNOWING THE MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF CHRIST</H2><P>We all know that Christ is the mystery of God and that the church is the mystery of Christ. What I desire to see is that all the churches would have a thorough understanding concerning Christ and the church. We who are in the church should not talk about anything else but Christ and the church from the beginning of the year till the end of the year. Our daily life should not be one that centers around morality or conduct. Our daily life should be one that emphasizes Christ living out from within us. What we talk about and pursue all day long should be our knowledge concerning Christ and the church. Our living is to live Christ and to build up His Body. Wherever we go, what the saints should do and say should be this one thing only. What is expressed in our living should be the living out of Christ for the building up of the church. This is glorious. This should have been the situation among us. But during the past few years, according to my observation, what we have been talking about was not Christ. What we have been living was not Christ, and what we have been pursuing was not Christ! May the Lord have mercy on us!</P><P>In the first message, we saw six points concerning Christ being the mystery of God: the Word in the beginning which was God, His becoming flesh, and His passing through human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. All these seem simple and familiar. But every one of these points is a mystery. I will only mention one of these items. For example, I can prove my point by fellowshipping with you concerning Christ's death. Not only among us but also among common Christians in Christianity, the death of Christ is known, emphasized, and constantly brought into consideration. According to the revelation in the Bible, the death of Christ is all-inclusive and profound. When this Christ died on the cross, He bore at least seven statuses. When He died as one man, seven things were accomplished through His death. First, He is the Lamb of God who bore away the totality of our sin, that is, the inward sin and the outward sin, solving the problem of the singular sin and the plural sins, the root of sin and the fruits of sin. Second, He was a man in the flesh, condemning sin in the likeness of the flesh of sin, dealing with the evil nature of sin within us, which is the embodiment of Satan, and also taking care of the sin-poisoned body.</P><P>Third, He is the last Adam. In other words, He is the last man in the old creation. Adam was the first man, the head of the old creation. Christ is the last Adam, the end of the old creation. Before Adam, there was no man. After Christ, there also follows no other man. Christ died on the cross in this status and terminated us, the men in the old creation (Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20). Christ brought us along when He was crucified on the cross and dealt with our old man. Fourth, He is the Firstborn of all creation. He was crucified on behalf of all creation. By this He terminated the whole old creation, so that all created things are reconciled to God. Fifth, He is the brass serpent, with the outward appearance of the serpent, but without its poison. When He was hung on the cross, He destroyed the old serpent, Satan, and judged the world that belongs to him.</P><P>As a result, all the negative things have been dealt with by the death of Christ. Sin and the nature of sin are gone. The flesh, the man in the old creation, together with the whole old creation are gone. Even the old serpent, Satan, together with the world, has been terminated. As the Lamb, the man in the flesh, the last Adam, the Firstborn of all creation, and the brass serpent, the God-man, Christ, has dealt with all the negative things in the universe on the cross.</P><P>In addition, there are two positive statuses in Christ's crucifixion. One is the Peacemaker. He came to make peace. The other is the Life-dispenser. He came to dispense life. Through His death, He annulled all the commandments in ordinances and made peace, creating one new man as a result. This new man needs the life of God. Hence, this crucified Christ became at the same time a grain of wheat. The purpose of His death was not only for our redemption to deal with sin or for the destruction of Satan, but also for the release of the divine life within Him and the dispensing of it into all the believers, that they may become the many grains, just as He Himself is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SPEAKING, LIVING, AND TEACHING<br>THE MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF CHRIST</H2><P>Dear brothers and sisters, you are all elders and co-workers in the churches. You should be talking about this day after day. Since you are the elders and the co-workers, you should take the lead to do this and should teach the saints to do the same. Permit me to say that according to my observation, I have not seen much of this kind of condition among you. I have to say an honest word. Our condition is wrong. We are those who take the lead. We have a heavy responsibility. We all have to bow down before the Lord and admit that for many years, we have neglected the works that we ought to do as elders and co-workers. We have to ask the Lord to forgive us.</P><P>I say this not to give you a hard time. I am being painfully repetitious with the good intention that we would see the real situation among us. For many years we have had no progress. I have been deeply sorrowful. How poor we have been. For this reason, I would not allow the situation to continue. I have to wake everyone up. We have been wrong. Our direction has been absolutely wrong. If you travel around today, what is seen and heard in many places is not Christ. They are all things that are not Christ. It is meaningless to find out who is right and who is wrong. To be wrong is worth nothing. To be right is also worth nothing. All these are things that come from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. What we need is the death of Christ. This is my burden. Let us talk about the death of Christ instead.</P><P>When we go back to the churches, we should help all of the saints to know the death of Christ in these seven statuses. At least we have to spend half a year to teach them, until everyone, old and young, great and small, can speak about them, and can understand the meaning of them. Only then will the situation be up to standard. We should speak about this, live this, and express this. This is the situation that we should have in every local church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>KNOWING THE MYSTERIOUS RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</H2><P>Following this, we have to talk about the resurrection of Christ. The resurrection of Christ seems simple, but it too is actually mysterious. First, the God-man, Christ, resurrected from the dead and brought the humanity that He had put on into divinity. This divinity is His status as the Son of God. When He resurrected, He brought His human part into divinity and was born the Son of God. Second, in this way, He was no longer the only begotten Son but also the firstborn Son of God. In the only begotten, there was only divinity, the status of God. In the firstborn Son there is the divine element plus the human element. It is the same way with us. We were the sons of man. But as soon as we believe and receive the Lord, we become the sons of God. God's nature and elements are added into our humanity. Third, in His resurrection, we were all resurrected together with Him to be born the sons of God. Christ's becoming flesh brings divinity into humanity. His resurrection brings humanity into divinity. In this way, God and man are mingled as one. Moreover, in His resurrection He has become the life-giving Spirit, entering into all those who believe in Him to be their life.</P><P>These are the four great things that Christ accomplished in His resurrection: bringing humanity into divinity, being born the firstborn Son of God with His humanity, begetting us as the sons of God through resurrection with Him, and becoming the life-giving Spirit. In this way, He brought all those who believe in Him into divinity. They are fully mingled with God. This is the mysterious resurrection of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RAISING UP THE ATMOSPHERE OF<br>PURSUIT FOR THE TRUTH</H2><P>Brothers, I believe these truths are in the books that we have published. We should pursue after these things, speak about these things, and should teach the brothers and sisters these things. We should be an "educated" family, one that is filled with the atmosphere of pursuit for the truth. We should not talk about or discuss anything but Christ. We should be those who become alive in Christ this way, and we should exercise moment by moment to live in our spirit. In our speaking and in our conduct, we should follow our spirit. If you elders and co-workers do this, I fully believe that after a year or so all the churches will be speaking Christ, discussing Christ, and living Christ, and there will be no difficulty or storm among us. May the Lord be merciful to us.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on April 19, 1990)</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST&#151;THE CHURCH</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:4-6, 9-10;

Lord, thank You for giving us the Word. You have indeed opened up to us the mystery in Your Word in this end time. Lord, be gracious and merciful to us that we may see Your mystery. Visit us once more tonight. We worship You once more. We exalt You and love You. Amen!</P><P>In this message we will look at the mystery of Christ, which is the church. All of us seem to know this, but strictly speaking, this message is more profound than the last one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AN OVERVIEW OF THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</H2><P>Here I have listed nine main points. The first three points form one group. The first point is concerning the church being chosen and predestinated by God the Father before the foundation of the world. The second point is concerning it being redeemed by God the Son after the foundation of the world. The third point is concerning it being sealed with God the Spirit and receiving the Spirit as the pledge at the time of its redemption. First, there is the selection of God the Father. Then there is the redemption of God the Son, after which is the sealing and pledging of God the Spirit. The sealing is for us to become God's possession. The pledge is a guarantee and a foretaste for God to become our possession. This is the full salvation that the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit has accomplished upon us.</P><P>After we have experienced the full salvation of the Triune God, we have the fourth point, which is to participate in the resurrection and ascension of Christ, thus becoming the Body of Christ. Then in the fifth point, we become the universal new man to be God's kingdom and God's house, as well as the habitation of God. Following that, there are two more points. The sixth point is that we have the absolute ground and right to enjoy the unsearchable riches of Christ for the expression of the multifarious wisdom of God. The seventh point is that Christ makes His home in our hearts. Not only is He the life supply in us, but He is also working Himself fully into us, occupying every part of our heart, so that we may be filled with the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of what He is, to become all the fullness of God. In this way, we have the eighth point, which is the life union of Christ and the church. This is the great mystery in the universe. The ninth point is that this great mystery will reach a final stage when it will ultimately be consummated in the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST BEING OUR DAILY LIFE</H2><P>This message is more crucial than the last one because it is concerned with us directly. If we want to know about the life that a Christian should live, we have to know about the mystery of Christ. The mystery of Christ should be our daily life. Without this mystery, our life would just be the life of a human being; it would not be the life of a Christian. The Christian life is a mystery, and this mystery has to do with Christ. This Christ is already in us as our life. He lives in us daily. In our daily life, everything whether positive or negative, enjoyable or bitter, should be the expression of this mystery. The reason for this is that we are not the one who is living, but a mysterious One is living within us. Everyone in the world lives unto themselves. Whether they are happy or sorrowful, there is no mystery at all. But a Christian is different. In smooth circumstances he would give thanks. In adverse circumstances he would offer up praise. Others are bewildered by him. This is the mysterious story of Christ.</P><P>For many years, I have been talking to you about Christ. Some are concerned about what will happen when I have exhausted my speaking. I told them that I may exhaust my speaking, but the Christ within me will never be exhausted. He is a mystery. Sometimes, there seems to be nothing more to say. But then He comes again and appears even richer than before. Our Christian life is a mysterious story. Without this mystery, we would fail. No matter how ill-treated we are, we can behave as if nothing has happened; we can be at ease. By this Christ the mystery is expressed. We are crucified with Christ. It is no longer we who live, but it is Christ living in us. When we love, it is Christ loving. When we are humble, it is Christ who is humble. When we are patient, it is Christ who is patient. This is the mystery. Individually speaking, this mystery is our personal life. Corporately speaking, this mystery is the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST&#151;THE CHURCH</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Mysteriously Chosen and Predestinated<br>in Christ by God the Father<br>before the Foundation of the World</H2><P>Now let us consider the church as the mystery of Christ point by point. First, the church was mysteriously chosen and predestinated in Christ by God the Father before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:3-5). Ephesians 1:4 and 5 say that He chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world that we should be holy, and that He predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself. We were God's creation; we were not His sons. But God chose us, predestinated us, and called us to sonship. Now through partaking of the life of God, we become the sons of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Mysteriously Redeemed in the Beloved<br>after the Foundation of the World</H2><P>Second, after the foundation of the world, the church was mysteriously redeemed in the Beloved (Eph. 1:6-12). The Beloved here is Christ. He is the One most loved by God. Christ is God's heart desire. All of God's heart is set on Him. We are redeemed in such a One. We were all chosen by God in eternity. But we were redeemed in time and even at different times. Our redemption is according to the riches of God's abounding grace with which He graced the church in the Beloved. It is also according to the dispensation of the mysterious economy in God's will, which is according to His good pleasure. Our salvation is not just according to the riches of God's grace, but is prearranged according to the dispensation of God's economy. None of us was a believer when we were born. Even when we were saved, we were somewhat confused. Few were definite and assured. It was only afterwards that we became more clear. That is why Peter said that though we have not seen Him, we love Him, and while believing in Him, we exult with unspeakable and glorified joy (1 Pet. 1:8). Just by believing and loving this way, we obtain great joy. Hence, a Christian is truly a mysterious person. From the very beginning, he is a mystery.</P><P>In the dispensation of God's economy, not only has He brought us to Himself, and caused us to believe and to be saved, but He has also headed us, the church, up together with all things under Christ the Head, that the church, according to God's counsel and predestination, which is according to His will, may be made a chosen possession under Christ the Head to become those who have before hoped in Christ. As soon as we are saved, we are God's predestinated possession and have become those who have before hoped in Christ. Those in the world live on earth without hope and without God. But we the saved ones are in Christ and are the first group of people who have hope.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church Mysteriously Being Sealed<br>with the Holy Spirit and Receiving<br>the Holy Spirit as the Pledge<br>at the Time of Its Redemption</H2><P>Third, at the time of our redemption, we were mysteriously sealed with the Holy Spirit, and we received the Holy Spirit as the pledge (Eph. 1:13-14). At the time we believed in the Lord, we received the Holy Spirit as the seal. This seal of the Holy Spirit operates and works, reminding us and giving us the feeling that we have believed in the Lord Jesus and that we belong to God. I believe every one of us has had this experience. This tells us that we are the saved ones, and we have the Holy Spirit in us as the seal. This Holy Spirit is the pneumatic Christ (Rom. 8:9), who also is the Triune God (Matt. 28:19).</P><P>To be sealed with the Holy Spirit means to be marked out by the Holy Spirit as the living seal. The redeemed church has become God's purchased possession. At the time of redemption, this possession was sealed by the Holy Spirit for the purpose of it eventually being fully redeemed. Since the seal of the Holy Spirit is living, it works within us, saturating and transforming us with the divine element, until we mature in the life of God. Eventually, even our bodies will be fully transformed and redeemed. Now we all have the seal of the Holy Spirit within us. This seal is daily sealing us and reminding us, so that we are continually rescued and delivered from our natural self. In the end, the image of God will be expressed from within us, and we will become like God. Moreover, the redeemed church not only is God's possession but also has obtained God as its possession, with the Holy Spirit as the pledge. God has given us the Holy Spirit not only as the pledge of our possession, assuring us of what we will possess, but also as the foretaste of our inheritance of God as our possession, that we may gain a foretaste of God as our full possession. Through the Holy Spirit in us as the firstfruit, we have a foretaste of the sweetness of God. This foretaste is in us as the guarantee, assuring us that one day we will enter into the full and rich enjoyment of God. By then our body will be redeemed in glory and will be changed in its form. We will fully inherit God Himself as our enjoyment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church Mysteriously Participating<br>in the Resurrection Power of Christ<br>and in Everything That He Has Attained<br>and Obtained in Ascension,<br>Thereby Becoming the Body of Christ</H2><P>Fourth, the mystery of Christ, the church, participates mysteriously in the resurrection power of Christ and in everything that He has attained and obtained in ascension, thereby becoming the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:19-23). We must participate in the resurrection of Christ and enter into His ascension before all that He has attained and obtained in ascension can become our enjoyment. By then, the Body of Christ will be expressed. The Body of Christ is produced fully from the resurrection and ascension of Christ. After Christ resurrected, He became the life-giving Spirit. In His ascension He became the outpoured Spirit. In this way He becomes the essential, economical, and compound Spirit. As the essential Spirit, He gives us life. As the economical Spirit, He pours Himself out on us. He is also the compound Spirit. In Him is included not only divinity and humanity, but also human living, the effectiveness of death, and the power of resurrection. Such a compound Spirit is in us and also upon us, making us the Body of Christ. In this way the Body life of Christ is expressed.</P><P>This Body of Christ is the fullness of Him that fills all in all (Eph. 1:23) as the corporate expression of the embodiment of the processed Triune God. This Body was mysteriously made alive together with Christ (regenerated&#151;John 3:5-6) and was raised up together (taking Christ as life and living together with Him&#151;Col. 3:4a; John 14:19b) and seated in the heavenlies together to participate in all that Christ has attained and obtained in His ascension (Eph. 2:5-6). We are regenerated in the resurrection of Christ. We are made alive and are seated in the heavenlies also in His resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church Mysteriously Becoming<br>the Universal New Man<br>as God's Kingdom and God's House,<br>and Being Built Up as the Habitation of God</H2><P>Fifth, the church mysteriously becomes the universal new man as God's kingdom and God's house, and is built up as the habitation of God (Eph. 2:15, 19-22). The church is the new man. It is God's kingdom, God's house, and God's habitation. This is indeed a mystery. The church, the mystery of Christ, as the universal new man, is replacing the old man in God's creation for the expression of God and the accomplishing of God's economy. It is God's kingdom to be ruled by God and to rule for God (Rom. 5:17b). It is also God's house to enjoy God's riches and to express the glory of God's riches (1 Tim. 3:15-16). Furthermore, it is built up as the habitation of God. This is the result of submitting to the authority in God's kingdom and enjoying the riches in God's house (Eph. 4:16).</P><P>This being the case, we have the following conclusion. In the organic Body of Christ, in the living in the universal new man, which is constituted of God as life, and in the living in God's house of life and in God's kingdom of life, there are no lifeless organizations such as a universal federation or local autonomies. There is obviously the need in the churches in all the localities to have some administrative arrangements for the business affairs. Seemingly, these administrative arrangements are non-organic. Actually, the administrative arrangements for these business affairs also have to be under the ruling of the Holy Spirit and according to His leading. For example, when the apostles set up elders in a locality, they must do so under the Holy Spirit's leading (Acts 20:28a). This shows us that in the church, even in the arrangements of business affairs, there is the need for the ruling and the leading of the Holy Spirit. This is different from worldly business organizations, workers' unions, or ethnic associations. They do not have the Holy Spirit. They only have human beings. We who are the church have the Holy Spirit in each one of us. Even arrangements in business affairs, which may seem organizational outwardly, must also be done under the leading of the mysterious Holy Spirit within us. Actually, there is not much administrative work in the church. The main work is the shepherding, the teaching, and the leading. These are the three things that local elders should do.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church Mysteriously Enjoying<br>the Unsearchable Riches of Christ</H2><P>Sixth, since the church as the Body of Christ is the universal new man, the kingdom of God, the house of God, and the habitation of God, it mysteriously enjoys the unsearchable riches of Christ (Eph. 3:2, 7-11). This is through the stewardship of grace given by God and is according to the dispensation of the mysterious economy of God. The purpose of this is to make known through the church the multifarious wisdom of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Christ Mysteriously Making Home<br>in Our Hearts That We May Be Filled<br>with the Breadth, the Length, the Height,<br>and the Depth of What Christ Is,<br>to Become All the Fullness of God</H2><P>Seventh, the church, being strengthened in its members into the inner man with power by God through His Spirit, has Christ mysteriously making home in the believers' hearts, with the result that it is filled with the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of what Christ is, to become all the fullness of God (Eph. 3:15-19). Not only do we have Christ in us as the rich supply, this Christ is also making home and living in our hearts. For this reason, we need the Holy Spirit to strengthen our whole being into our spirit. In this way, Christ will have the chance to occupy the different parts of our heart&#151;our mind, emotion, will, and conscience. In addition to our spirit, Christ will spread and occupy our whole soul step by step. Hence, for Christ to make home in our heart is for Him to be constituted in the hearts of the believers in the church and to spread within them. Then we will gradually experience the boundless dimensions of what Christ is&#151;His breadth, length, height, and depth. This points to the boundless and immeasurable riches of Christ. In the end, we will be filled to become all the fullness of God as the full expression of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Mysterious Life Union<br>of Christ and the Church Being<br>the Great Mystery in the Universe</H2><P>In this way, we have point number eight, which is the mysterious life union of Christ and His Body, the church. This union is a great mystery in the universe (Eph. 5:32). This mystery is the processed Triune God being joined and mingled with the regenerated and transformed tripartite man to become a universal couple. This is the ultimate point of the mingling of God and man. God is the principal character, and man is His counterpart. The two share the same nature; they live and walk together. In other words, divinity is living in humanity to become the reality of humanity, and the human virtues are living out the divine glory and beauty to become the expression of divinity. Divinity and humanity are mingled as one. Divinity is the content and the reality within, and humanity is the manifestation and beauty without. The virtues manifested by us Christians should be the manifestation of the glory and beauty in the divine attributes. This is different from the morality of the world, which is only proper human behavior. But a Christian is one who has divinity as his element and reality, from which the divine glory and beauty are expressed through the human virtues. This is the expression of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Mysterious Ultimate Consummation<br>in God's Economy&#151;the New Jerusalem</H2><P>Finally, we have point number nine, which is the mysterious ultimate consummation in God's economy, the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2). This is the peak, the climax, of the union and mingling of the processed Triune God with the transformed tripartite man, resulting in the tabernacle where God dwells and lives with man, and the temple where man dwells and serves God. The two become the mutual habitation of the redeeming God and the redeemed man (Rev. 21:3, 22). On the one hand, the New Jerusalem is the habitation of God. On the other hand, it is also our habitation. God dwells in it and lives with man. Man dwells in it and serves God. In such a place, the Triune God is the life supply, and the tripartite man is the outward appearance for the expression of God (Rev. 21:12, 14). The Triune God on the throne is the center of the holy city from which flows the river of life with the tree of life growing alongside to be the supply of the whole city (Rev. 22:1-2). This is the inward condition of the New Jerusalem. Outwardly, the redeemed nation of Israel, indicated by the names of the twelve tribes, is the gates of the city. The redeemed church, indicated by the names of the twelve apostles, is the walls of the city. The two are the outward appearance of the city, expressing the effulgence of God's glory (Rev. 21:11-14). Because the gates are of pearl and the walls are of jasper, they are transparent and shining, and the effulgence of God's glory is expressed this way.</P><P>Today, the church, which is joined and mingled mysteriously with the Triune God, is a miniature of this New Jerusalem. Everything should have this holy city as its highest standard and its matchless hope. If we have such a profound and transcendent realization concerning the mystery of Christ, the church, our goal and hope will be uplifted. We will see and identify with the New Jerusalem as the highest standard of everything in our lives, and our ultimate hope will also be the New Jerusalem.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on April 19, 1990)</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ADDITIONAL WORD</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(2)</H1><P>In the last message on the mystery of Christ, the church, there were two main points that I would like you to pay attention to: the mysterious enjoyment of the unsearchable riches of Christ for the manifestation of the multifarious wisdom of God and the mysterious making home in our heart by Christ unto our being filled with the breadth, length, height, and depth of what Christ is to become all the fullness of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED FOR REAL EXPERIENCE</H2><P>These two items, the riches of Christ and His making home in our hearts, on the one hand touch our personal experience and on the other hand consummate in the church. The manifestation of the multifarious wisdom of God as well as becoming all the fullness of God point to the highest plane that the church can attain to, which is to be the ultimate expression of the Triune God. We can talk about these two items in doctrine, but it is difficult to find out what they involve in experience. Neither of these two items are mere doctrines. They require experience. Although they are mysterious, we should have experience concerning them.</P><P>Concerning the riches of Christ, we may say that they refer to all that Christ is, such as light and life. But we are often not clear as to how to experience them. Christ's making home in our hearts also includes many matters. But how can they be experienced? We should be very definite concerning these matters. According to the revelation of Ephesians 3, these two items, the enjoyment of the riches of Christ and His making home in our hearts, though personal in their experience, have to do with the Body of Christ. Only when we have the experience of these two items can there be the real Body life. If we want to have the practical church life, we must enjoy the riches of Christ. The reason the church life is weak, low, and empty is our lack of experience concerning the riches of Christ. In addition, Christ must make home in the church before it can be solid, uplifted, and strong. Only through this will the church become all the fullness of God for the expression of His multifarious wisdom. This is very definite. It is something that every one of us should experience.</P><P>Such teachings have been spoken among us frequently. But it is not easy for them to gain our attention. I do not know how many there are who, as a result of listening to or reading these messages that we have released, have paid the price to study what it is to enjoy the riches of Christ and what it is to have Christ making home in our hearts. There is no need to talk about others. Do we have some definite pursuit concerning the riches of Christ ourselves? Do we have real experiences of Christ making home in our hearts? Can someone point out in a concrete way which item of the riches of Christ he has experienced? Can someone tell us how Christ is making home in his heart? These matters are very crucial, for they have to do with the Body of Christ, the church. No wonder Ephesians 3:17-19 says that when Christ makes home in our hearts, we will be able to comprehend with all the saints the breadth, length, height, and depth, as the universal dimensions of Christ, that we may be filled to become all the fullness of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED FOR THE SPIRIT OF REALITY</H2><P>For this reason, I want to consider this matter in a more definite way so that we may have definite experiences. We do not want to experience Christ in a vague and abstract way. Often our talk about the enjoyment of Christ, the living of Christ, and the expression of Christ are just vague words. There is the lack of definite expressions. Concerning this matter, although the record of the New Testament gives us the revelation and the teaching, it does not give us too many examples. This is why these matters become all the more mysterious. When we read about them, though we may touch something, it is difficult to understand or to get into the experience because of the lack of examples.</P><P>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He told the disciples, "I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality" (John 16:12-13). Hence, the main thing is not the examples. What is needed is the Spirit of reality. Only by the Spirit of reality can we have real experiences of Christ. Therefore, in the third message, we will talk about the mysterious organism, and in the fourth message, we will talk about the mysterious law of the Spirit of life. Today, there is something within us that is organic. It is called a law. It is something that we should depend on and follow after. It is the most important key to our experience of Christ and the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED FOR A DEFINITE PURSUIT</H2><P>In this additional word, I would like to remind you that we must have a definite pursuit of the riches of Christ and of His making home in our hearts. It is easy to say these words, but it is not simple to experience them. However, without the experience, they are but shallow and vague words. For example, Christ is light, and we can pursue Him in this item. We can say to the Lord, "Lord, in these days, I wish to pursue You as the light. May the eyes of my heart be enlightened, and may my spiritual sight be clearer, that I would know You and Your Body, and would have a deeper comprehension concerning all the secrets in Your Body." We may have heard of the mysteries in God's New Testament economy, but we still need the vision. This is why Paul prayed for us in Ephesians 1, that the eyes of our heart would be enlightened to know the hope of His calling (v. 18). By chapter three, through the grace that God had given to him, he brought to light the dispensation of the mystery, which from the ages had been hidden in God who created all things (v. 9). Ephesians 5:14 says, "Awake, sleeper, and arise from among the dead, and Christ shall shine on you." All these words require our definite and concrete pursuit.</P><P>After we pursue in this way for a time, we can go on to pursue other things such as Christ as our life. This is an even deeper matter. In the past not many saints have pursued in this way. In the future, every one among us should pursue this way. Some should pursue Christ as light. Others should pursue Christ as life. Still others should pursue Christ as power or as wisdom. If we will all pursue Christ in such a definite way, the church life will be solid and rich. When anyone comes to the meeting, he or she will not share something vague only, but will be able to prophesy in a definite way. There will not only be the terminology but also the definite experiences. There will be the utterance as well as the reality.</P><P>Concerning the matter of Christ making home in our hearts, we also should have a definite pursuit. In my daily life, has Christ made home in my mind? Is my mind His proper habitation? Do I have further knowledge concerning Christ? Has my view been transformed concerning various matters? Is Christ in these views? We can say the same concerning our emotion, our will, and our conscience. We should no longer be general, and our speaking of the Lord's word should no longer be vague. I think that we should make a distinction and have some discernment. We have to pursue in depth the matter of Christ making home in every part of our heart. Who is living in our mind and our will? Do we have Christ in our happiness, anger, sorrow, and joy? These are the kind of experiences we should have. They should be something that we can speak about.</P><P>When we pursue this way, we will become definite. I believe it will be very effective. This is why I feel that we should pursue further the matters covered in the book of Ephesians, so that we would have definite experiences and gain something real. We should have as much of this as possible. The more of these real items we have, the more solid, rich, and prosperous the church life will become. When we experience the riches of Christ item by item, Christ will make home in our hearts step by step. In this way, we will have definite and real experiences of Christ, and the Body of Christ will grow and be built up in a definite and real way.</P><P>(Spoken by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on April 20, 1990)</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE MYSTERIOUS ORGANISM<br>IN GOD'S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Ezek. 1:15-21; Eph. 1:22; Rev. 21:2, 11; 22:1; John 15:1; Eph. 4:4-6; Col. 1:27; Eph. 4:22-24, 30; 5:25b-27, 29; 4:11-16; Col. 3:3-4a; 1 Cor. 12:25-27; Rom. 8:2-13; 12:4-8; 1 Cor. 12:14-22; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rom. 15:16; John 21:15; 1 Pet. 2:2; Rom. 12:1; 1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 12, 24, 31; Col. 1:28-29</H1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The mysterious center in God's economy:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The move of God's New Testament economy being like the turning of a big wheel&#151;cf.

We worship You and wait on You. We thank You from the depth of our being. Lord, we are truly indebted to You. You have generously loved us in many ways, but we have been indifferent and unresponsive toward You. Lord Jesus, draw us again that we would run after You. Lord, we are waiting here for Your mercy and blessing. You have rich provisions for us. Your blood, Your anointing, Your word, Your light, and Your life are all provided for us. Lord, reveal Yourself to us here once more. Speak to us again, and release the mystery in Your word. Open Yourself up to us. All of us are open to You. We would all say, "Lord, Jesus, we love You." Although we do not love enough, and we do not know how to love, we still would say that we would love You forever. Lord, we dare not love You by ourselves. We trust in Your mercy and Your blessing. Lord, be one spirit with us, and speak in our speaking that we would see this organic union. Release the riches in Your word in a most definite way that all of us would be supplied, cared for, and healed and that all of us would receive Your anointing and enjoy Your sweetness. Lord, how sweet it is that we can sit before You, touch Your word, and seek after Yourself. Grant us more of Yourself. Bless us in a great way tonight. Touch us, and may we touch You. May every one of us be able to say that the Lord is with us. Lord, we do not depend on what we speak or on what we can do. We depend fully on You and Your word. May You meet the need of each one of us and give all of us a word. Lord, even a little supply from You will satisfy our hearts and will bring us home in joy, so that we will be thinking about and meditating on You through the whole night, enjoying Your presence in this way. May we have a bright and revived morning, so that we can bear a good testimony for You once more. Amen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MYSTERIOUS CENTER<br>IN GOD'S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Move of God's New Testament Economy<br>Being Like the Turning of a Big Wheel</H2><P>Now we come to message three, which is the mysterious organism in God's New Testament economy. I believe you are quite familiar with the term organism. But it is a heavy burden on me to try to explain this organism thoroughly and to speak about it until it gets into you. It is difficult for me to know where I should start. After seeking before the Lord, He gave me Ezekiel 1. There we have four wheels turning. In the beginning of this message, my first point is the mysterious center in God's economy. The move of God's New Testament economy is like the turning of a big wheel (cf. Ezek. 1:15-21). Today the greatest thing happening on earth is the tide of democracy. Everywhere people are talking about democracy. This is indeed a great change. When we come back to the Bible, we first see at the beginning of Revelation the scene at the throne in heaven. Following that we see the move on the earth, represented by the four horses (Rev. 6:1-8 with notes). The first horse is the white horse, which, together with its rider, symbolizes the spreading of the gospel. It takes the lead in the entire move on earth. When we look at the world situation, especially at the changes in eastern Europe, we know that this is the turn of the great wheel of the age. But we have to remember that we are in a bigger and greater wheel, which is the move of God's New Testament economy.</P><P>Many of us here have come from far away for this time. Perhaps many of you do not know each other. What has brought us here together? We have to say that it is all because of God's New Testament economy. We all have to recognize God's sovereignty. Many things are not up to us. We are in this great wheel of God's economy. Apparently, this elders' and co-workers' conference was initiated by the brothers in Taipei. But actually, the Initiator is neither they nor I, but God. We are nothing. We are all women before God; we cannot depend on ourselves. What we are looking for is His mercy. We wait for His blessing. Hence, it is the move of God's New Testament economy that has gathered us together to participate in the mystery of His New Testament economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>This Turning Wheel in God's Economy<br>Having the Body of Christ as Its Axis</H2><P>We know that every wheel has an axis; it is the center of the wheel. The great turning wheel of God's economy has the Body of Christ as the axis and the center. In a certain sense according to the truth, we can say that this axis is Christ. But as far as God's New Testament economy is concerned, this axis is the church, the Body of Christ. This is why we say here that the turning wheel of God's economy has the Body of Christ as its axis. This means that all of God's move and work today are joined to the church and are for the church, the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22).</P><P>If we know something about world history and would spend some time to study the Old Testament prophecies, we have to bow down and worship the Lord that indeed, everything in the universe and all the world situations, whether political, military, industrial, commercial, scientific, or educational, have the Body of Christ as the center. They are all joined to and are for the Body of Christ.</P><P>We moved to Taiwan from the mainland in the second half of 1949. The world situation was tense. We decided to forget about everything and seize the opportunity to spread the gospel. First, we printed big quantities of gospel tracts in proportion to the population of Taipei. We divided up the city into districts according to the streets and passed out these tracts from house to house. Second, we made huge gospel posters and posted them at train stations, crossroads, and other important places. We even posted them by the doors of the brothers' and sisters' homes. Third, we sent out gospel teams to promote a gospel atmosphere along the large and small streets. In addition, every week, we went to the New Park to preach the gospel. We did this for four or five years, and our number increased from three or five hundred to forty or fifty thousand. None of us was affected by the world situation. From that time until now, after so many seasons of battering storms and rain, Taiwan is still solid as a rock. It has even made such miraculous achievements in recent years. I believe all these happenings are for the move of God's gospel. We know that the entire world situation is for the Body of Christ.</P><P>Furthermore, the New Jerusalem, as the ultimate consummation of God's work, is the axis of God's move in the whole universe (Rev. 21:2, 11; 22:1). The whole universe is full of God's move, and the ultimate achievement of this entire move is the New Jerusalem. The church today is the miniature of the New Jerusalem in the future, and the Lord's recovery on earth represents His church. This is why I have a strong burden during this conference to fellowship with all of you again concerning the church as the mysterious organism in God's New Testament economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BODY OF CHRIST AS THE AXIS OF GOD'S ECONOMY<br>BEING THE ORGANISM OF THE TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>Second, the Body of Christ as the axis of God's economy is the organism of the Triune God. This is not a small thing. According to Ephesians 4:4-6, we can say strongly that the Triune God is in the Body of Christ today. Here it mentions one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God, who is over all, through all, and in us all. According to the human understanding, the Triune God is in heaven. But according to the revelation of the Bible, we have to say conclusively and definitely that the Triune God is in the Body. The Body of Christ is where the Triune God is located today. It is true that the Triune God is in heaven, but mainly He is not working there. Rather, He is working in the Body of Christ. Today, the Triune God is doing only one central work, which is the building up of the Body of Christ. Everything that God is doing in the universe is for this central work. Today, we who are in the Lord's recovery are in the center of this central work of God. The mysterious organism of God's New Testament economy is right here with us. If we truly see this revelation, our life and service will be absolutely different.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Being an Organization Manufactured<br>by Man, but an Organism Produced<br>by the Triune God as Life</H2><P>Today the Triune God is continually and actively working in the Body of Christ. Everything on earth, whether it is political, military, economic, or scientific, is all under the sovereign arrangement of the Lord. Everything works together and coordinates together for the Body of Christ. This Body is not a humanly manufactured organization, but an organism produced by the Triune God as life. Hence, the church as the Body of Christ is not a congregation, but a Body. It is not a human organization, but the organism of the Triune God.</P><P>You can see two things standing here: a wooden table and me as a person. The wooden table is a dead organization. It cannot move. I am a living organism and am very lively. Every part of me is functioning. The old system in Christianity has annulled all the organic functions of the Christians. In the long run, they cannot function anymore and are like those without any spiritual life. What is left is just a clergy-laity system. In the Lord's recovery, we have to overturn this so that every believer may become alive and may function for the organic Body to be expressed.</P><P>We all know that the spiritual life which is in every saved person has its capacities that come with its nature. According to its capacity, it likes to move, to function, and to serve the Lord. Apparently, the meetings with one speaking and all listening appeal to the Christian taste. But actually, the capacity within a Christian's nature has no taste for that. Everyone who knows this fact or who has a taste of this kind of meeting is for the mutual speaking and mutual listening, because the mutual speaking and mutual listening match the capacity of our spiritual life.</P><P>Our human body is a living organism. That is why it has to be active. The less the body moves, the easier it is for it to become sick. The more it moves, the healthier it becomes. In the practice of the new way during the past five years, our study gave us a conclusion in four steps: 1) the preaching of the gospel for the saving of sinners, 2) the nourishing of the new ones in their homes, 3) the setting up of the group meetings for the mutual perfecting, and 4) the prophesying in the Lord's Day meeting by everyone for the release of the riches of Christ and the supply to the members, with the result that the Body of Christ is built up. These four steps are the begetting, the nourishing, the teaching, and the building that we have talked about. They are scriptural and fully match the capacity in our spiritual life. Because of this, we must promote this matter today so that all the brothers and sisters, whether they be newly saved or long-time Christians, whether old or young, can develop the capacity of their spiritual life and can become living and functioning members.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The True Vine, as a Portrait of Christ,<br>Being an Organism by which the Triune God<br>Accomplishes His Eternal Economy</H2><P>The true vine in John 15, as a portrait of Christ, is the organism of the Triune God by which He accomplishes His eternal economy. This true vine is the organism in the eternal economy of the Triune God. The Lord Jesus is the tree. We are the branches. When we are joined to and mingled with Him, we become the organism of the Triune God. The Triune God is operating and working in this true vine today. Hence, we should not despise ourselves, for we are the Body of Christ. We have a part in the true vine that the Triune God is cultivating. This is a tremendous thing. Today amidst the fallen and desolate Christianity, we are the center of the organism of the Triune God. This is our source. We should never forget or neglect this. The Lord's recovery is carrying out the mingling of the Triune God with this organism so that He can live, operate, and work here for the wheel of His economy to be turned.</P><P>Hence, from the true vine in John 15, we can see that the organism of the Triune God is a tree with life. It is organic and can produce fruit. It is not like the wooden table which has no life, which is organizational, and which cannot produce fruit. Since we are the branches of this vine tree, we are organic. We are not placed on a wooden table. Rather, we grow on a tree. For the branches to be on a tree is something organic rather than organizational. Only a fabricated tree is organizational. A real tree is not organizational. That is why a real tree will grow, and its growth will eventually bear fruit. Since we are the branches of the tree, we are organic and can grow and bear fruit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>This Organism Being the Structure<br>of the Union and Mingling<br>of All the Believers with the Triune God</H2><P>Furthermore, this organism is the structure of the union and mingling of all the believers with the Triune God (Eph. 4:4-6). This is truly a tremendous thing. We who have believed in Him are now able to be joined to and mingled with Him. In this structure of union and mingling, God the Father is the person. He is over all, managing and caring for all, and is through all, penetrating and joining all, and is even in us all, dwelling and living in all. In addition, God the Son is here as the element and factor of life. Through baptism, we the believers have been cut off from the element of the old Adamic life, and through believing, we have been joined to the element of Christ's new life. Moreover, we have God the Spirit as the essence of life. The Spirit of the life of Christ is the essence of the Body of Christ. The hope is the saturation of the Body of Christ with the splendor of this essence that the Body of Christ may enter into the glory of the life of Christ (Col. 1:27). Now we are all in the organism of the Triune God. This Christ who is the Spirit of life is saturating us continually with His essence until we express the splendor of this essence, which is the redemption of our bodies into glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Metamorphic Change of This Organism,<br>the Mingling of God and Man</H2><P>Following this, let us consider the metamorphic change of this organism&#151;the mingling of God and man (Eph. 4:22-24). Although the Body of Christ has been cut off from the old creation, the "skin" of the old creation has not been fully shed. There is still the need for the metamorphic change, which is the putting off of the old man that has been corrupted by lust and the putting on of the new man that is created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the truth. Hence, every day we are putting off the old man and putting on the new man. The more we put off the old man, the more we will put on the new man. This metamorphic change is accomplished through the renewing in the spirit of the mind of the believers. When the Spirit of God continually saturates our minds, we have the spirit of our mind. It is in this spirit that we are renewed and are transformed.</P><P>This metamorphic change of the organism, the mingling of God and man, is also accomplished through the redemption by the saturating of the Holy Spirit of God as the seal (Eph. 4:30). The more the Holy Spirit saturates us, the more our bodies are redeemed. The parts of our being that have not been saturated by this seal are not yet redeemed. The Holy Spirit is in us as the seal. From the day that we were saved, God has been sealing us with His element for the purpose of saturating our whole being until our bodies are fully transformed and redeemed. This kind of metamorphic change is also through the nourishing, sanctifying, and washing of Christ's word of life (Eph. 5:25b-27, 29). In the Lord's word, there is not only the washing water, but also the nourishing element and the sanctifying power. The nourishing affords the supply in life and provides the warm, tender, loving cherishing. Sanctification separates us unto God and transforms us. The washing removes the spots and wrinkles so that the divine organism may become holy and glorious.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Growth of This Divine Organism<br>and the Organic Building Up<br>of the Organism by Itself</H2><P>As a step further, let us consider the growth of this divine organism and the organic building up of the organism by itself (Eph. 4:11-16). The gifted ones in this organism perfect others so that they can also become gifted ones and can do the work of the ministry for the organic building up of the Body of Christ. Furthermore, the growth of this organism in the divine life equals the organic building up of the organism by itself in the divine life. When a baby is born, he needs to grow by drinking milk. This growth is the building, and both the growth and the building are organic functions. To build a house is organizational; it is not organic. It is done by putting together different materials. It is an organizational building. But our body is not like this. Our body is built up organically. It is not built up by adding some flesh or skin from without, but by the growth of itself through eating.</P><P>The most difficult lesson to learn for us who are working for the Lord is to not have an organizational work but to have an organic work. Many times our nourishing and perfecting of others are merely organizational methods. We only add something onto others. We should learn of Paul, who helped others to grow in life. In 1 Corinthians 3:6 he said, "I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow." If we want to have an organic work, we need to have this kind of realization and attitude. We should not depend on our own methods. We are only those who plant and water. We can only do our part to nourish others, to fellowship and pray with others, and to supply them with some words of life. In the depth of our being, we still look to the God who gives life to work in man. In this way, we are not adding something to man, but are supplying others from within so that they can grow in life and be built up.</P><P>In order for the Body of Christ to grow and be built up organically this way, we need to hold to truth in love and to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things. When we lead and help others, we have to point out a way for them to learn to practice holding to truth in love and to grow up in all things into the Head, Christ. By this, they will be able to touch and enjoy Christ, and Christ will have the preeminent place in them. They will then grow and be built up. In this way, out from the Head, all the Body, being joined together through every joint of the supply and being knit together through the operation in measure of each one part, will be able to grow gradually unto the organic building up of itself in love. Hence, strictly speaking, it is not we who are building. We are only affording others a little supply, through which they grow and are built up organically.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Living of This Organism</H2><P>Finally, let us look at the living and service of this organism. The living of this organism is the corporate and organic living of the Body of Christ (Rom. 12:5). All the members live together by taking Christ as life (Col. 3:3-4a), and all care for one another (1 Cor. 12:25-27). This kind of living is also an organic living produced by the union and mingling of the Triune God with the tripartite man (Rom. 8:2-13). We are men of three parts. Through the law of the Spirit of life, we were first enlivened in our spirit by the Spirit of Christ. Next, we are enlivened in the mind of our soul by the spreading Spirit of God. Lastly, we are enlivened in our mortal body by the indwelling Spirit of God. We are first made alive in the spirit by Christ the Spirit of life, resulting in our spirit being life. This Spirit then continues to spread outward from our spirit to our mind, making our mind life also. This Spirit continues to spread outward to our bodies so that our bodies also have the life of God. For this reason, we have to set our mind on the spirit, walk according to the spirit, and put to death the practices of the body through the indwelling Spirit of God. This is the living of the tripartite man mingled with the Triune God. He is the Dweller, and we are His dwelling. He and we are mingled as one. We live together to become the organic Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Service of This Organism</H2><P>Next we look at the service of this organism. The service of this organism is the corporate, organic service of the Body of Christ (Rom. 12:4-8). Our living is corporate, and our service is also corporate. It is like our human body&#151;there is nothing in it that is not corporate. Whether it speaks or moves, it does so corporately. The same is true with service in the Body of Christ. Hence, in this service, every member is necessary (1 Cor. 12:14-22). Moreover, every member functions organically according to his measure (Eph. 4:16b). Since we are members in the Body of Christ, we are all necessary, and we all have our function. Once we fulfill our function in the Body, we have the corporate, organic service.</P><P>Furthermore, this service of the organism is the organic service of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel (1 Pet. 2:5, 9). This service involves the preaching of the gospel for the saving of sinners, offering them up as sacrifices to God (Rom. 15:16). Following that, there is the nourishing of the believers and helping them to grow so that they can offer themselves up as living sacrifices to God (John 21:15; 1 Pet. 2:2; Rom. 12:1). In addition, there is the perfecting of the saints that they may do the work of the ministry unto the organic building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:11-16). In addition, we have to lead the saints to prophesy, to speak for God, for the organic building up of the church (1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 12, 24, 31). These are the four steps in the practice of the new way: the preaching of the gospel, the nourishing of others, the perfecting of the saints, and the prophesying for the Lord. Hence, we all have to be like the Apostle Paul, who labored and struggled in all wisdom to present every man full-grown in Christ to God (Col. 1:28-29). This is the organic service of the Body of Christ. It is for everybody, and it is in a priesthood. Everyone preaches the gospel to save sinners, esveryone nourishes the believers, everyone perfects the saints, and everyone prophesies. In this way, all of us will arrive at a full-grown stage, and the Body of Christ will be built up. By this, the great work of the organic service in the Body of Christ will be accomplished.</P><P>I hope that the brothers and sisters would see that in the organism of the Triune God, whether it be the living or the service, whether it be the growth or the building, everything is organic and must be organic. For this reason, we saw clearly that we have to change the system. Without changing the system, we would only be in an organization. The changing of the system can bring us gradually into the organic living and service of the Body of Christ. May the Lord be merciful to us.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on April 20, 1990)</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE MYSTERIOUS LAW<br>OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE<br>IN GOD'S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Col. 3:4a;

Lord, we admit that we have nothing and that we can do nothing. For this reason You must speak and must point out to us one by one the mysteries in Your Word. May You supply Your word to us once more, and may You glorify Yourself. Shame Your enemy. Lord, by Your victorious name and under Your victorious blood, we bind what You have bound in heaven, Your enemy. We also ask You to release Your riches and to glorify Yourself. Amen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LIFE, THE SPIRIT, AND THE LAW BEING ONE</H2><P>The message that we will consider now is the key of the keys. It concerns the mysterious law of the Spirit of life in God's New Testament economy. This is a three-in-one subject. The three are life, the Spirit, and the law. These three are one; they are triune. The consummation of these three is the law. This is like the Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The consummation of the Three is the Spirit. The Father is embodied in the Son. The Son is realized in the Spirit. The Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. The Triune God has been processed to become the completed God. This completed God is the all-inclusive, essential, economical, compound, life-giving, and indwelling Spirit. This Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. He is also the Triune God Himself. When we talk about the law of the Spirit of life, the same is true. Life is in this Spirit, and the Spirit is this law. Hence, this law is the Spirit, and the Spirit is life.</P><P>We cannot tell if there was such a branch of knowledge as physics among mankind two thousand years ago when Paul wrote the book of Romans. But Paul did use this term law in his spiritual writings. It is not the legal law, but the natural law, the law of the Spirit of life. Today, many who are sitting here have studied physics and know science. Through physics and science we find out the laws and principles behind all matters in the universe. In Romans 7 and 8, Paul mentioned four laws. One is the law of God outside of us. The other three laws are inside of us. They are the law of evil in our flesh, the law of good in our mind, and the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EVERY LIFE HAVING A LAW</H2><P>Paul discovered that there was a law of evil in his flesh, which wars with the law of good in his mind. Through this he was made a captive and was put under sin (Rom. 7:23). These two laws fit the description of the "conflict between reason and lust" described by the ancient Chinese. Reason is the law of good, and lust is the law of evil. These two are warring with each other. In the end, reason always fails, and lust always wins. Except for those who have a strong will, who walk by reason, and who temporarily overcome their lust, most are caught by it. The experience of millions of people can testify to this. However, Paul said in Romans 8:2 that "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death." In Paul's experience, the law of the Spirit of life is versus the law of sin and of death. It is not only versus sin but also versus death. Sin and death cannot be separated in the same way that the Spirit and life cannot be separated. One law is versus the other. The Spirit is versus sin, and life is versus death.</P><P>I must tell you that every life is itself a law. The human life begets humans. The dog life begets dogs. No one can change this. Take, for example, the sprouts of four kinds of trees&#151;the apple tree, the pear tree, the peach tree, and the almond tree. It is difficult to differentiate between them. But when they grow up to a certain stage, the apple tree will bear apples, the pear tree will bear pears, the peach tree will bear peaches, and the almond tree will bear almonds. This does not come about through any regulations in outward circumstances, but through the respective regulations of the different lives within them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Law of the Spirit of Life<br>Being the Key to the Mysterious Organism<br>in God's New Testament Economy</H2><P>In this message, the most important thing to realize is the law of the Spirit of life. Now let us consider the outline point by point. First, the law of the Spirit of life is the key to the mysterious organism in God's New Testament economy. The mysterious organism in God's New Testament economy is a matter of Christ being our life (Col. 3:4a). With life, there is the law. Without the law of life, what we have is just outward regulations and ordinances. For example, the Ten Commandments that God gave to Moses were not the law of life, but were laws in the letter. They were there to regulate man and to expose man's real condition. But the law of the Spirit of life that we talk about is a life-law. The life in this life-law is Christ. Christ is life, and in His life there is a law. Hence, the life of Christ is a law.</P><P>Furthermore, the mysterious law of the Spirit of life in God's New Testament economy depends on the Spirit of life as the law (Rom. 8:2a). Hence, the law and the Spirit of life are not separate. Rather, the law is the Spirit of life. Moreover, this law of the Spirit of life is the key to Christ being our life. According to the revelation of the Bible, on the one hand, the Spirit of life denotes Christ, because Christ is life. On the other hand, it denotes the Triune God. The Spirit of life is the consummated Spirit, who is the Triune God Himself.</P><P>In the whole universe, the highest and greatest law is one in which the Triune God is the law, because the Triune God is the highest, richest, and best life. There is no other life that is higher and better than the Triune God. Hence, there is no other law that is higher and better than the Triune God as law. Today, this law of the Spirit of life in us is tremendous, for this law is just the Triune God Himself. What Romans 8:2-13 talks about is actually this law. Verse 2 tells us in plain words that the law of the Spirit of life has freed us. After this it talks about the processed Triune God working Himself into us, the tripartite man. First, He enters into our spirit to make our spirit life (v. 10). Next, He saturates our mind, so that our mind also becomes life (v. 6). Finally, He permeates our bodies from the soul to which our mind belongs, giving life to our mortal bodies (v. 11). The purpose of the Triune God dispensing Himself into our whole being in this way is not merely to be life but to be a law.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Three Persons and the Three Laws<br>in the Universe</H2><P>Second, let us look at the three persons and the three laws in the universe. The first person is God, who has become the first law, the law of the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2a). The second person is Satan, who has become the second law, the law of evil (Rom. 7:21, 23, 25b; 8:2b). The third person is man, who has become the third law, the law of good (Rom. 7:23b). Today, all three laws are in the believers. God's law of the Spirit of life is in our spirit. Satan's law of evil is in our flesh, and man's law of good is in our soul. The evil law of Satan overcomes the good law of man, taking man captive; but God's law of the Spirit of life overcomes the evil law of Satan, releasing man (Rom. 7:23; 8:2). The processed Triune God who is living in our spirit as the law of the Spirit of life functions mainly in freeing us from all things and in delivering us from Satan, who is the law of sin and of death in our fallen nature.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Christ as Life and<br>the Spirit of Life as the Law</H2><P>The third point is Christ as life and the Spirit of life as the law. When Christ becomes our life, at the same time, the Spirit of life becomes the law within us. Christ as life is the element in the Body of Christ&#151;what the Body of Christ is. The Spirit of life as the law is the capacity of the Body of Christ. It is a natural power. A law is a capacity and is a natural power. With every life there is its nature, and within its nature there is the capacity. This capacity is the natural power of its nature, which is the law of its life. The peach tree grows peaches because in the peach tree there is a nature, and this nature has an innate ability, which produces a capacity. It is the law of the life of the peach tree, and it brings forth peaches. In the same way in the Body of Christ, Christ as life is the element of this Body, and the Spirit of life as the law is the capacity of this Body. All these have their source in God the Father.</P><P>Hence, we can say that God the Father is the source of life in the Body of Christ. This results in God the Son being the life element of the Body of Christ, and as the element of the Body of Christ, God the Son brings in God the Spirit as the capacity of the Body of Christ. First, there is the source; then, there is the element; and finally, there is the capacity. The source is God the Father, the element is God the Son, and the capacity is God the Spirit. Actually, the three are just one. Today, in our living and service, apart from this capacity, we can do nothing and can accomplish nothing. This is the problem with Christianity today. Few realize this fact. By the Lord's mercy, it is a very great thing for us to see this revelation. As Christians, the whole key to our living and service in the Body of Christ depends on this capacity of the law of the Spirit of life.</P><P>We all have to see clearly that the Lord is in us today as the law of the Spirit of life. Hence, strictly speaking, we do not pray for the Lord to help us. Rather, we have to go along with His demand as the law within us. This is like an apple tree. For it to grow there is the need for watering and fertilizing. But it takes time for the fruit to grow. This is a law of life. There is a certain law to fruit-bearing. One must follow this law before the fruit will grow. It is the same way in our living and our service. We must go along with this capacity of the law of the Spirit of life before we can have normal growth and fruit bearing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Spirit of Life as the Essence<br>Becoming the Law in the Body of Christ</H2><P>Fourth, Christ is the life element of the Body of Christ, and the Spirit of life is the essence of this element. This essence becomes the law in the Body of Christ, which is the innate ability of the Body of Christ. We have said that the mysterious organism of God is fully a matter of Christ being our life. This life is the element of the organic Body of Christ. The essence that comes with this element is the Spirit of life. This Spirit of life as the essence becomes the law in the Body of Christ, which is the innate power of this Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Triune God Becoming the Law&#151;<br>the Innate Ability&#151;of the Body of Christ</H2><P>Hence, point number five concludes by saying that the law in the life of the Body of Christ, that is, its innate ability, is a living person, who is the Spirit of life. This Spirit of life is the realization of Christ as life to His Body. Christ as life to His Body is the embodiment of God the Father as the source of life. Hence, it is the Triune God Himself who has become the law, that is, the innate ability, of the Body of Christ. This is very clear.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Our Living in the Body of Christ Depending on<br>This Law&#151;the Spirit of Life</H2><P>Sixth, the living in the Body of Christ depends on this law, who is the Spirit of life. Since the law in the life of the Body of Christ is the Spirit of life, its living depends on this law as the Spirit of life. For this reason, our minds have to be set continually on this law (Rom. 8:6b). Our walk must also be closely according to this law (Rom. 8:4b). Furthermore, we have to put to death the practices of the body according to this law (Rom. 8:13). In this way, we can have the living in the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Main Gifts in the Service of the Body<br>of Christ Depending on the Spirit of Life,<br>Which Is This Law</H2><P>Furthermore, point number seven says that the main gifts in the service of the Body of Christ depend on the Spirit of life which is this law. The service in the Body of Christ depends on the gifts of the Spirit. According to the revelation of the New Testament, the gifts of the Spirit can be divided into the gifts in life and the miraculous gifts. The gifts in life are those enumerated in Romans 12:6-8 and also include the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, the discerning of spirits, helps, and administrations, as listed in 1 Corinthians 12:8-10 and 28. The miraculous gifts are those other items listed in 1 Corinthians 12:8-10 and 28, which include healing, operations of works of power, tongues, and interpretation of tongues. The miraculous gifts, especially speaking in tongues and the interpretation of tongues, do not require the growth in life. But the gifts in life require the growth in life. They come with the growth in life.</P><P>We have to see that the service in the Body of Christ has the gifts in life as the principal parts and the miraculous gifts as the supplements. Hence, we should not pay too much attention to the miraculous gifts. They are supplements only. The principal parts are the gifts in life. Without the gifts in life, nothing can be done. However, without the miraculous gifts, although there would be somewhat of a lack, we could still go on. Of course, it would be the best if we had both. The principal gifts depend on the growth in life, and the key is again the law of the Spirit of life. Hence, the principal parts of the service in the Body of Christ also depend on our following the law of the Spirit of life. The more we follow the law of the Spirit of life, the more we will grow and mature in life, and the more the functions in the gifts in life will be realized.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Cooperation Needed by the Law<br>of the Spirit of Life in God's Economy</H2><P>Finally, point number eight talks about the cooperation needed by the law of the Spirit of life in God's economy. First, we have to cease from our own struggling and striving. Galatians 2:20 says, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live." Our old man, the first husband (Rom. 7:2), has been crucified (Rom. 6:6). We do not belong to ourselves or live to the law anymore. We have become the wife of Christ and have become those who depend on Christ. Hence, it is no longer we who live. We should cease from all our struggling and striving. When we stop and let go of whatever we are holding onto, it is no longer we who live. Following that, in our living or our service, we go along spontaneously with the operation of the law of the Spirit of life in us, cooperating with it. Then the two, that is, the law and us, act as one man, the outward being in harmony with the inward (Gal. 5:16a, 25). We are neither working alone nor are we giving up working altogether. Rather, we are cooperating with the law of the Spirit of life within, fulfilling the demand of this law, going along with the operation of this law within, and spontaneously developing the capacity of this law. For this, we need to cooperate by prayer and by having a spirit of dependence, thus maintaining our fellowship with the Lord of life and the Lord of work (1 Thes. 5:17; Eph. 6:17-18). When we continue to live in the fellowship with this Lord, who is the Spirit of life within us and the law in the Body of Christ, we will have the genuine living and service of the Body of Christ. This will enable us to grow in life, to be filled with the gifts of life, and to develop the organic functions for the building up of the Body of Christ unto the fulfillment of God's New Testament economy.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on April 21, 1990)</P></body></html>
