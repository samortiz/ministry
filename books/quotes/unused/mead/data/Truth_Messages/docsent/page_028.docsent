   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT ONE IN OUR HUMANITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have pointed out that according to the type of the standing boards of the tabernacle, our oneness is not in the wood, but in the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Years ago, I thought that if I were humble, gentle, mild, kind, and meek, I could easily be one with others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Eventually I learned that the more humble, gentle, mild, kind, and meek I was, the more difficult it was for me to be one with other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The reason for this is that those who have these characteristics are also very careful and are good fault-finders; therefore, they often condemn others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who are rough and tough, however, are not nearly as bothered about the mistakes of others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever I am with the careful ones, I feel as if I am being observed, accused, and condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This does not mean, however, that we should endeavor to be rough, for both meekness and roughness cause difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I used to think that if both a husband and wife were meek, they would have a happy married life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But I have learned through experience that this is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It does not seem to matter whether or not both are meek, both are rough, or one is meek and the other is rough.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every married couple has problems.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many married ones compare their marriage with that of others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that they are somewhat dissatisfied with their marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When I made such a comparison in the past, I found out that other married ones were not more satisfied than I. My point here is that in our humanity it is impossible for us to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead of oneness, there is friction.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The picture of the standing boards in Exodus 26 clearly shows that the oneness of the boards is altogether in the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And this gold must be weighty, thick, and sufficient to support a heavy board and hold it together with other boards.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How important it is for us to have an adequate layer of gold!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need enough gold to bear the weight of the board.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>BELIEVING GOD S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>CONCERNING GENUINE ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not an easy matter to acquire enough gold to thickly overlay a board of acacia wood fifteen feet long and twenty-seven inches wide.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Humanly speaking, it is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Likewise, it seems impossible for the saints to be truly one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, the fact that the tabernacle was built in the wilderness indicates that although it is impossible with man, it is possible with God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>My experiences in the church life throughout the years have caused me much disappointment and discouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The encouragement I have today does not come from experience; it comes from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nothing written in the Word of God is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, everything written in God s Word will be fulfilled by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With God, there are no impossibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, we need to believe what is written in the Word regarding genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I believe that the time has come for God to see the actual oneness among us in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>My burden in this message is to point out that genuine oneness is absolutely not to be found in our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not think that if you are humble or meek you can be one with others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No matter whether we are meek or rough, slow or quick, proud or humble, educated or uneducated, we all have a problem with oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In ourselves, by ourselves, and with ourselves we simply cannot be one with others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In fact, we are not always one with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once again we need to emphasize that the oneness is in the gold, not in the acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that the oneness in the church is not in our humanity; it is altogether in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the past I wondered why the Lord did not mention such virtues as humility, meekness, and kindness in His prayer for oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead, He spoke mainly about being in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The concept of verses 21 through 23 is that of oneness in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This reveals that oneness is not in humanity; it is only in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>PERFECTED INTO ONE BY GAINING MORE GOLD</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In no other portion of the Bible is the Triune God revealed in such a practical way as in chapter seventeen of John.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The various pronouns used I, Us, You indicate that the Triune God is related to our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is in the Triune God that we are perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To be perfected means to have more gold.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only when the boards were adequately overlaid with gold were they perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This indicates that to be perfected into one means to gain more of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Surely mere teachings about oneness can never make us one.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Oneness is not a superficial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is a matter of sinking deeply into the Triune God until we are fully overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We all need a great deal more of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is not sufficient simply to be coated with a thin layer of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we truly have light on our need to be overlaid with gold, we shall repent and say, Lord, I repent that I am only gilded with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I have not yet been overlaid.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What I have experienced of You is merely gilding.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is good for causing others to praise me, but it is not good for the real oneness, for holding me together with others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When even a small problem arises, my layer of gold is not sufficient, and the oneness is damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Lord, for the oneness, overlay me with an adequate amount of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The more we are overlaid with gold, the more oneness we have.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Nothing can damage the oneness that comes from our being overlaid with an ample quantity of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The more we have of God, the stronger is our oneness.</S>
