   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GRACE IN GOD S CHILDREN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some who are ignorant of the Bible think that the teachings on the mountain in Matthew 5 7 have to do with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Is this law?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The law is an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is grace?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Grace is to give to others what they do not deserve.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In fact, the first cheek, the first garment, and the first mile are grace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All these are what others do not deserve.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But because the life in us transcends all things, none of these things can touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why we allow others to strike our right cheek and then turn the left cheek to them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why we can give to others not just the tunic, but the cloak as well.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is why we can walk not just one mile, but two.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But this is not God s grace; this is the grace of God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is what God s children do when they act according to the God of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God gives men what they do not deserve.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We also can give men what they do not deserve, even more than what they do not deserve.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>X. BEING ENLARGED THROUGH OUR REACTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why do we have to do this?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let me tell you: The teaching on the mountain was given to enlarge our capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God increases our measure through our reactions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many things are too dear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As soon as we live out the teaching on the mountain, God strips these things from us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The tunic and the cloak are taken away again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But this enlarges us again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We will be enlarged many times more than our capacity for the cloak or the tunic.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many Christians are the same size as the garments they wear; they are very small.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They can be affected by one little garment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One garment alone is worth their wrath and the sacrifice of their Christian propriety.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everywhere we go, we find these small people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christians can be large.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But, even more, they can be enlarged, because God has given them a large life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you can let go of one garment, you can let go of one hundred garments.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you can yield to someone s demand for one mile, you can yield to his demand for two miles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you do this, you will be enlarged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is a big thing to save one s face.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many people cannot bear humiliation and disgrace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They can give away all their garments, but they cannot be struck or disgraced.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is hard for them to take insulting words from others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But here is one who is struck in the face.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He not only endures but also takes it willingly, gladly, and happily.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As soon as we turn our left cheek to others, we are enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are enlarged through all of our unreasonable experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Suppose you have a strong will.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you are oppressed and persecuted and you accept oppression and persecution willingly, even walking the second mile, you will be enlarged as time goes on.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the past years, I have met many small people in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have not met too many big people in the church either.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I hope that the new believers will take this way from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Take God s life and react in a transcendent way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the basic condition for maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you continually react according to God s transcendent life, you will be enlarged more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No material thing will bind you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No despising or disgrace will limit you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even your own strong will will not hold you down.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You will grow continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we do not practice this, the church will be filled with small people.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>XI.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>CHRISTIAN VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>BEING A TRANSCENDENT VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I am not saying that walking the second mile is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Walking the second mile is a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>That principle involves being transcendent.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The left cheek is also a principle that involves being transcendent.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What does it mean to be transcendent?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To transcend means to be on top.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Suppose someone strikes your right cheek.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you try to remember Matthew 5 and say, I am determined to let him strike.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If he wants my tunic, I will give him my tunic reluctantly.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If he forces me to walk one mile, I will force myself to accompany him two miles.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This kind of behavior is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is not transcending.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You have not climbed high enough.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Who can give their other cheek?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is those who, when insulted, realize that they have received a rich life from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is why they can turn their left cheek to others when they are struck on the right cheek.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Others may force them to walk a mile.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But the life they have received from the Lord is so abundant that they can go a second mile.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Christians are never reluctant people, and the Christian reaction never just meets the minimum requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>A sister once said, I almost lost my temper!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>She sounded very victorious when she said this.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But this is not a Christian reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>A Christian reaction does much more than what is needed; it stands the challenges well.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is the meaning of the second mile.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Some people are extremely unkind to you; that is the right cheek.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If you can return kindness to them and still be victorious before God, that is the left cheek.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The left cheek speaks of abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It denotes surplus.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The Christian victory is not a meager victory.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Christian victory is an overflowing victory.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Christians should always have a surplus; they should always transcend their experience.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Christian victory never comes by force; it is never achieved by gritting one s teeth or arguing.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Christian victory is always easy to come by.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>May the Lord enlarge us again and again, and may we express the grace of God s children again and again.</S>
