   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>X. RECEIVING THE POWER, AUTHORITY,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND KINGDOM OF THE TEN KINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Satan probably will give his power and authority to Antichrist before he is slain.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But it may only be after Antichrist is assassinated and resuscitated that the ten kings will give their power, authority, and kingdom to Antichrist 17:12-13, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then every power and authority will be concentrated in one person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>XI.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>ACTING FORTY-TWO MONTHS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Revelation 13:5 says, Authority was given to him to act forty-two months.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Forty-two months here and in 11:2 are the three and a half years in 12:14 and the thousand two hundred and sixty days in 11:3 and 12:6, which will be the time of the great tribulation Matt 24:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the end of this age Antichrist will make a covenant with the nation of Israel for seven years Dan 9:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Three and a half years after the covenant is made, he will break it, terminate all Jewish worship and service to God Dan 9:27 , persecute the saints 13:7 , and destroy the holy city 11:2 for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once again, I say strongly that, contrary to what many think, the great tribulation will not last seven years; it will be three and a half years, or forty-two months, or twelve hundred sixty days.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In these three and a half years Antichrist will do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A. Speaking Great Things</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>and Blaspheming God, His Tabernacle,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>and Those Who Tabernacle in Heaven</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Revelation 13:5 says, And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and verse 6 says, And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle and those who tabernacle in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I do not know what great things Antichrist will utter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Undoubtedly, he will speak things that no one has ever imagined, things that will surprise people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He will blaspheme God, God s tabernacle, and those who tabernacle in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I believe that those who tabernacle in heaven are the overcomers who will be raptured to the tabernacle of God in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although I do not know what great things Antichrist will speak, in principle he probably will say, You have heard that the so-called God has done this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now let me tell you that I can do greater things than He.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this way he will utter great things to blaspheme and insult God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At that time, probably a good number of the worldly people will know that the overcoming Christians have been raptured, for this will certainly be on the front page of the newspapers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many will be saying things like, My cousin has suddenly disappeared ; My wife has been taken away ; or My roommate was there last night, but when I woke up this morning he was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, the Christians remaining on earth will begin to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Antichrist may then rise up and use the mass media to give a lecture in which he will claim to do something greater.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He may say, Listen to me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I will do greater things than this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It may be that he will use space technology to do certain outstanding things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To repeat, before Antichrist is slain and resuscitated, the overcomers will be raptured to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When they arrive, they will command Satan to be cast down to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As soon as this word is pronounced, the archangel Michael will take the lead to fight against Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>About this time, the seventh Caesar, Antichrist, will be slain.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Satan descends to earth, the spirit of Nero will be released from the abyss and enter into the assassinated seventh Caesar, resuscitating him to be the eighth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>While all this is taking place, everyone on earth will be talking about the rapture, and the Christians still on earth will testify about it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then this resuscitated eighth Caesar will speak great things to deceive the earth dwellers, promising to do greater things than those God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This will be the blasphemy he will utter against God, His dwelling place, and the overcomers who have been raptured to God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the Christians remaining on earth during this time know about all these things, they will be greatly helped.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If any of us are still on earth after the rapture of the overcomers, we would never be cheated by Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Perhaps we would recall what we have read in these life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These messages can help us become the firstfruits.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But those who are not the firstfruits will not be left in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After reading these messages, we are no longer in darkness about Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We surely have seen the light.</S>
