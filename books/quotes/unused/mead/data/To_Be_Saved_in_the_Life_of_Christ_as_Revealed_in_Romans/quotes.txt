[2]  CHAPTER ONE TO BE SAVED BY REIGNING IN LIFE AND BY THE DISPOSITIONAL SANCTIFICATION OF THE INDWELLING SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 5:17; 8:2, 5b, 4 AN OPENING WORD
[3]  The first section is God's redemption through the death of Christ, and the second is God's saving in the life of Christ.
[4]  Hence, 5:10 says, "If, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life."
[5]  When we were saved, we were put into the position of a king in order to reign in life.
[6]  Reigning in Life by Being Obedient and Submissive to the Lord, Our Master
[7]  To reign in life over so many rebellious things, we must first be obedient and submissive to the Lord.
[8]  If we are not submissive to the Lord who is our Master and our God, no one will be submissive to us.
[9]  Through Our Cooperation by Presenting Ourselves as Slaves to Righteousness
[10]  CHAPTER TWO TO BE SAVED BY THE FREEING OF THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE AND BY THE DISPENSING OF THE TRIUNE GOD INTO OUR TRIPARTITE BEING Scripture Reading: Rom 8:5-13; 15:16b; 6:18, 19b, 22b SAVED BY THE FREEING OF THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE Four Laws in Romans 7 and 8
[11]  Romans 7 and 8 reveal four laws: the law of sin and death in our members 8:2 , the law of good in our mind 7:23 , the law of God outside of us 7:22 , and the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit 8:2 .
[12]  CHAPTER THREE TO BE SAVED BY THE RENEWING OF OUR MIND, ISSUING IN THE TRANSFORMATION OF OUR SOUL, AND BY BEING BUILT UP IN THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Rom 12:2a; 8:6, 5b; 12:1, 3-5 SAVED BY THE RENEWING OF OUR MIND, ISSUING IN THE TRANSFORMATION OF OUR SOUL
[13]  DISPOSITIONAL SANCTIFICATION BY THE INDWELLING SPIRIT, THE FREEING OF THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE, AND THE RENEWING OF THE MIND WHICH ISSUES IN TRANSFORMATION, BEING RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER
[14]  Saving Us from the Individualism of Our Natural Life
[15]  Being built up together in the Body of Christ saves us from the individualism of our natural life.
[16]  CHAPTER FOUR TO BE SAVED BY THE LIVING OF THE CHURCH LIFE IN A LOCALITY AND BY THE CRUSHING OF SATAN UNDER OUR FEET Scripture Reading: Rom 16:1-25; 14:1-3, 10, 12, 15, 17; 15:5, 7; Eph 4:3; Eph 6:12
[17]  The book of Romans, a book on the full gospel of God, consummates in its last three chapters, chapters fourteen through sixteen, in a particular revelation of the practice of the local churches, after the unveiling of God's full and complete salvation in chapters one through thirteen.
[18]  This full and complete salvation is composed of two aspects: the objective aspect of redemption, including forgiveness, justification, and reconciliation; and the subjective saving, including reigning in life, dispositional sanctification by the indwelling Spirit, the freeing of the law of the Spirit of life, the dispensing of the Triune God into our tripartite being, the renewing of our mind issuing in the transformation of our soul, and being built up in the Body of Christ these being the six items which we have covered in the preceding chapters , and the two succeeding items, conformation to the image of the Son of God and the redemption of our body which we will cover in the last chapter .
[19]  Having participated in the first six items of God's saving in the life of Christ, we will be well enabled to live a proper church life in a definite locality as a local expression of the Body of Christ to be a local testimony of Christ according to God's New Testament economy.
[20]  We must receive the believers in the light of the judgment seat of Christ Rom 14:10, 12 .
[21]  By Standing on the Unique Ground of Oneness Locally
[22]  The living of the church life in a locality must be by standing on the unique ground of oneness locally.
[23]  CHAPTER FIVE TO BE SAVED BY OUR BEING CONFORMED TO THE IMAGE OF THE SON OF GOD AND BY OUR BEING GLORIFIED Scripture Reading: Rom 8:28-30, 11; Phil 3:21
[24]  In this chapter we will cover the last two items of God's saving in the life of Christ: our conformation to the image of the Son of God and our glorification.
[25]  As the only begotten Son of God, He is God, the Second of the divine Trinity, having divinity only; as the firstborn Son of God, He is the God-man, the embodiment of the Triune God, possessing both divinity and humanity, bearing the image of the God-man, of God mingled with man, to manifest God through man, to express all God's attributes in man's virtues.
[26]  By the Transformation with the Element of the Divine Life
[27]  In order to be conformed to the image of the Son of God, we need the inward transformation by the renewing of the mind Rom 12:2a with the element of the divine life.
[28]  God's conforming us is His fashioning us in the life of Christ that we may bear the image of Christ as the God-man to express Him as the embodiment of the Triune God, and God's glorifying us is His saturating us with the splendor of the life of Christ that we may be soaked with His glory to express the processed God.
[29]  While we are experiencing all these items the reigning in Christ's life over all the insubordinate things, the subjective sanctification in our disposition by the indwelling Spirit, the freeing from the bondage of sin by the law of the Spirit of life, the dispensing of the Triune God into our tripartite being, the renewing in our mind and the transformation in our soul, being built up in the organic Body of Christ, and the living of the proper church life in a locality God is actually conforming us gradually to the image of His firstborn Son, the God-man, Christ.
