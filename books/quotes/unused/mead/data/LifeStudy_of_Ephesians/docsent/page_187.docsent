   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE HELMET OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the first part of verse 17 Paul goes on to say, And receive the helmet of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is for covering our mind, our mentality, against the negative thoughts directed at us by the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such a helmet, such a covering, is God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Satan injects into our mind threats, worries, anxieties, and other weakening thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s salvation is the covering we take up against all these.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such a salvation is the saving Christ we experience in our daily life John 16:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Satan s darts come to us through our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, just as our conscience needs the breastplate of righteousness and our will needs the shield of faith, so our mind needs the helmet of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need truth, righteousness, peace, faith, and then salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Righteousness issues in peace, and peace gives us the ground to have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then faith brings in salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not separate the helmet of salvation from the shield of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The shield protects the front of our being, but the helmet protects our head.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The shield and the helmet work together.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 17 Paul also speaks of the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Among the six items of God s armor, this is the only one for attacking the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>With the sword we cut the enemy to pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, we do not take up the sword first.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, we must firstly put on the girdle, the breastplate, and the shoes, and then take up the shield of faith and the helmet of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then, when we are entirely protected and have salvation as our portion, we may receive the sword of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verse 17 the antecedent of the word which is Spirit, not sword.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that the Spirit is the word of God, both of which are Christ 2 Cor 3:17; Rev 19:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If I were writing this verse, I would say, the sword of the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But Paul speaks of the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Is the sword here the sword of the Spirit or the sword of the word?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Most readers consider that Paul was saying that the sword is the word and that the Spirit wields the sword.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I understood the verse this way for years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I thought that it was the Spirit, not I, who used the sword.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In other words, according to this understanding, the sword is the word, and the One who uses the sword to slay the enemy is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From my youth I was taught that the Spirit helps us to use the word of God as the sword.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But this is not the meaning here.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The correct meaning is that the Spirit is the sword itself, not the one who uses the sword.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Word of God is also a sword.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The sword is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here we have three that are one: the sword, the Spirit, and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>My main burden in this message is on this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Word is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But if this Word is only printed letters, it is neither the Spirit nor the sword.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Greek for word in verse 17 is rhema, the instant word spoken at the moment by the Spirit in any situation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the logos, the constant word in the Bible, becomes the instant rhema, this rhema will be the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This rhema, which becomes the Spirit, is the sword that cuts the enemy to pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For example, we may read a particular verse again and again, only to have it remain the logos , a word in letters.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Such a word cannot kill anything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But one day this verse becomes the rhema to us, the present, instant, living speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At that time this rhema becomes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For this reason, in John 6:63 the Lord Jesus said, The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here the Greek text also uses rhema .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The instant, present word is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This kind of word is the sword.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, the sword, the Spirit, and the word are three that are one.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, we, not the Spirit, are the ones to use this sword to kill the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In our Christian experience, the Word and the Spirit must always be one.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is an utter falsehood to say that we take the Spirit without taking the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Without taking the Word, we cannot have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In my experience, I receive the Spirit mostly through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As I contact the Word in a living way, it becomes the Spirit to me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, some take the Bible without the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This also is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Those who wish to grow flowers need both the seeds and the life contained in the seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is impossible to separate the life within the seeds from the seeds themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In order to have the life, we must take the seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The relationship between the Word and the Spirit is like that between the seeds and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must have both.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord Jesus is both the Spirit and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He is not the Spirit without being the Word, nor the Word without being the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Because He is both the Word and the Spirit, He created us with a mind to understand and a spirit to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we come to the Bible, we should exercise both our mind and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We exercise our mind by reading and our spirit by praying.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Since we need both to read and to pray, we should pray-read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I can testify that through pray-reading my spirit becomes strong and ready to devour the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I not only exercise my spirit, but I also exercise my mind to consider the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>For example, I may ask why grace and truth are mentioned in chapter four, whereas love and light are mentioned in chapter five.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I also pray concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The more my spirit is strengthened by pray-reading the Word, the more eager I am to use the sword of the Spirit to slay the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In my speaking I have a sword with which to cut the enemy to pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>With the whole armor of God we have truth, righteousness, peace, faith, and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Finally, we have the rhema, the Spirit, the sword.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is our offensive weapon to use in attacking the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When we have the whole armor of God, including the sword, we are not only protected, but also prepared to wrestle against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>By having truth, righteousness, peace, faith, and salvation we are equipped, qualified, strengthened, and empowered to use the sword in spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Then the enemy is subject to the cutting of our sword, and he is slaughtered by us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>As we engage in spiritual warfare against the enemy, we do not use gimmicks, skills, or politics.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Our only weapon is the Spirit-Word, which is the sword.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We do not employ cunning craftiness we wield the sword of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Our loins are girded with truth, and our conscience is covered by Christ as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Then we have peace as our firm foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We can boast to the whole universe that we have no problems with God or man, for we are standing on the peace accomplished by Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Furthermore, we are protected by the shield of faith and guarded by the helmet of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Therefore, when we pray-read the Word, every word becomes the rhema, the sword that cuts the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In this way the victory is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We not only subdue the enemy and defeat him, but slay him and even cut him into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This is what it means to fight the spiritual warfare with the whole armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The church must be such an equipped, fighting, and victorious church to slay God s enemy.</S>
