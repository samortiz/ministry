We have now found out that the most scriptural and effective way of preaching the gospel is to visit people in their homes
These home meetings will help them to know the Lord's salvation and other truths concerning a new believer's living
When we go out to knock on doors, we have to confess our sins thoroughly and pray so that we can obtain the filling of the Spirit
We believe that when we go out to knock on doors, it is the Triune God who brings us with Him to knock on doors
After everything is installed and connected, all you need to do is turn on the electricity and the light bulbs will shine
The third step in leading people in the new way is to lead the new ones to realize that the meetings of the believers are mutual
Even the brothers and sisters who have been in the church for a few decades are not clear concerning this kind of proper meeting
Rather, you have to change the habit of one person speaking with the rest listening to everyone speaking and everyone listening
In the concept of most of the brothers and sisters, the meetings are for listening to messages and not for speaking
Now the new way demands us to be watchful, to live in the spirit, to exercise the spirit, and to speak by the spirit
Also, we will be restrained in our speaking, not taking up all the time but allowing others to carry on the speaking
As long as we practice in these areas during our daily living, we will have something to speak when we come to the meetings
In the regular meetings of the church, there is no need of a definite topic, nor the need to be tied down by a topic
When everyone comes together we do not talk about news or stories but speak about the Bible hymns and the spiritual publications among us
Among the four Gospels at the beginning of the New Testament, only the Gospel of John mentions the matter of worship
At that time, the Lord Jesus told her that the worship of God was not on the mountain in Samaria, nor in Jerusalem, but in the human spirit
In Revelation, there is no mention of worship services at all; instead, it mentions numerous times the matter of eating
Corinthians 1426 says Whenever you come together each one has a psalm has a teaching has a revelation has a tongue has an interpretation
In talking about the steps to lead people in the new way, we must first understand that attending worship services is absolutely not of God
Those who were buying and selling in the temple were related to the worship of God, but the Lord Jesus cast them out one by one
Would you be following Jesus the Nazarene to know God, or would you be going to the temple of Judaism to worship God?
The bankers, general managers, professors, doctors, and those with money and position may not be willing to come
The way of meeting as revealed in the New Testament is absolutely not like that being practiced by Christianity today
Because it has not been fulfilled in the last two thousand years, does this mean that it will never be fulfilled?
If it is not yet successful today, tomorrow it will be successful, if it is not successful with us, it will be successful with others
We have to lead the new ones to confess their sins; the more they do it and the more thoroughly they do it, the better it is
The more they confess, the more sins they will realize; the more sins they realize, the more they will confess
Formerly, for over thirty years we have been in the old system, and the number of people has not increased much, nor the number of churches
If you would walk according to the Spirit in every matter, then your spirit will be burning from morning until evening
You will speak at home and you will also speak in the group meeting you will speak in the neighbors home and you will also speak on the bus
At that time, we had already encountered this problem of the change of the system that is being spoken of today
After that, most of my time was spent in the Western world in developing the work in America, Europe, Africa, and Australia
Including the development in Asia, there are over nine hundred churches on the whole earth at the present time
Even with those who were in the training, there were areas where they did not listen accurately, or understand adequately
They may have listened correctly and understood rightly, but when they went out to speak, they did not speak accurately
When this life is gained by us, the result is the producing of the church, and the ultimate consummation of the church is the New Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem is the ultimate manifestation of the mingling of the processed Triune God with the redeemed and transformed tripartite man
In the recent ten years, from 1975 to 1984, we cannot deny that the effect of our gospel preaching was not that great
Under my leadership, the recovery first reached Taiwan, then Southeast Asia, then Japan, and finally the Western world
Concerning Canada, the brothers there have worked for nearly twenty years, but the number now is still not quite one thousand
In Central and South America, a total of more than twenty countries, the number still did not exceed ten thousand
We co-workers in every locality should all prostrate ourselves before the Lord, confess our uselessness, and also ask the Lord for His mercy
According to my knowledge, just in the Philippines and Singapore, there are some large congregations other than ours
Afterwards, in the Catholic Church, a group of lovers and seekers of the Lord including Madame Guyon was raised up
Due to the Mystics being too mysterious, Andrew Murray later improved their practice and produced the inner life group
At the end of the last century and the beginning of this century, this group was quite prosperous; many received help from them
The Brethren were raised up; they emphasized very much the expounding of the Bible, and were very prosperous in the last century
Matthew chapter thirteen shows us that when the Lord went out to sow, there were four kinds of situations with different results
With the second kind, the seeds fell on the rocky places where they did not have much earth; after having sprouted, they withered away
The Lord did not tell us that the longer you hear the gospel, the more secure and thorough your salvation will be
It is very difficult to say that the salvation of those who heard the gospel and were baptized quickly is not secure
It does not say how long she listened; but one thing is certain-after hearing the gospel she was baptized that same day
When Paul and Silas spoke the Lord's word to the jailor and his whole household, they were immediately baptized that night
For two thousand years, the various denominations and groups have had different views concerning how a person can become a Christian
It is very difficult to decide to what extent a person should believe in Jesus before he can be acknowledged as a brother
On the day of Pentecost, there were three thousand people who received the apostles' word, and they were baptized immediately
You have the responsibility to feed him and take care of him; otherwise, it will be very easy for him to have an early death
Regardless of whether they are large meetings or small meetings, we need to stay away from the habit of one speaking and the rest listening
We must overthrow this tradition of Christianity and change to speaking to one another and listening to one another
We all need to have a spiritual and victorious living live in spirit moment by moment walk according to the Spirit and be burning in spirit
When we are building the local churches in this way, we are building up the Body of Christ, the universal church
When you return to your respective localities to speak, you must also speak completely, thoroughly, and comprehensively
We know that most of the gatherings in society are carried out with one person speaking and the rest listening
The basic principle in any of the meetings called by the worldly people is one person speaking and the rest listening
In the book Church Affairs, he said that to maintain the Lord's Day morning meeting is to follow the customs of the nations
According to the revelation in the New Testament, the meetings of God's children are also in the principle of mutuality
Even when the whole church is gathered together, it should be, and must be, in this manner, that is, 'each one has'
Only the meetings in this principle are according to God's desire, are of the New Testament, and are in God's economy
It is easy to have a meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening as long as you can find a speaker and have the seats ready
It is difficult to have every attendant speak because in the Christian meetings one should not speak ordinary words, but the words of God
The universal church is the Body of Christ, while the local church is the local expression of this unique Body in the universe
In addition, the hymns are also a very good means for speaking because they are God's words composed into poetry and songs
Today's problem is that from the beginning our brothers and sisters did not have this practice, nor have they endeavored in this area
For this reason, to ask the brothers and sisters to build up home meetings now would be as difficult as climbing a high mountain
Presently, for every attendant to speak the word of God in the meetings is not easy; yet, only this kind of meeting is rich and glorious
For over thirty years, we have been meeting, but we have not established the habit of everyone speaking the Lord's word
Having everyone speak now would be like requiring us to speak English instantly when we have been speaking Chinese for the past few decades
For this very reason, we have been here trying to change the system for three years and have not yet succeeded
The meetings must be full of the word and the Spirit, with speaking to one another and listening to one another
These three points are lacking in our midst, not to mention that they are non-existent in the denominations of Christianity
People should not criticize what our training does, because it is not the final stage, and it is not yet the time for judgment
Let those who are in one accord with us and who are humble walk this way, labor diligently, and study every aspect together with us
Our gospel preaching is not prevailing; the meetings are not carried out properly; and the building up of the church has not been adequate
We look to the Lord for His mercy that for the sake of His Body He would grant us a way to overcome these failures
The degradation and failure of Christianity and its greatest lack lies in the fact that the believers do not speak the Lord's word
The principle of the New Testament is that every saved person is a member of the Body of Christ and a priest of God
We were all originally born in Adam to be the descendants of Adam, a part of Adam, and even the members of Adam
It does not matter in which country we were born and what language we speak; we are speaking for Adam, and are even speaking Adam
It does not matter whether one belongs to a high class speaking refined words, or to a low class speaking coarse words; he is speaking Adam
After we were saved and regenerated, we were transferred from Adam into Christ and joined to Christ, to become members of Christ
Today even among the churches in the Lord's recovery, it is still difficult to avoid reasoning, arguing, and debating
If we live in Christ, we will be closely knitted together, but if we live in Adam, there will be complaints, opinions, and frictions
For this reason, immediately after we are saved, we should learn the truth; then we will be able to speak God's word in Christ
Her blessing by the Holy Spirit reveals that the Savior in His humanity is the 'fruit' and in His deity is the 'Lord'
She recognized the fruit of Mary's womb as her Lord, and acknowledged the deity of the Child to be born of Mary
How different is this kind of speaking from the so-called outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the tongue-speaking in the Pentecostal movement!
Mary said, 'My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit has exulted in God my Savior; because He has looked upon the low estate of His slave
He has done mighty things with His arm; He has scattered those who are proud in the understanding of their heart
He has succored Israel His servant to remember mercy, even as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever'
After reading this portion of the Word, we will realize that for anyone to speak such a long psalm he must be very familiar with the Bible!
Everyone can then be busy all day long with their secular business; all they need to do is come to a meeting on Sunday
To take the old way of Christianity is easy, but to take the God-ordained way in the New Testament is not easy
We all know that speaking is an easy matter; but it requires you to learn when you are young until it becomes habitual through practice
If this kind of meeting of speaking to one another and listening to one another is not realized, we do not have the scriptural way to meet
In particular we must familiarize ourselves with the New Testament otherwise it will be difficult for us to speak the Lords word properly
They have no concept concerning the central vision of the New Testament revealed in such books as Ephesians and Colossians
For this reason, we also have to familiarize ourselves with the hymns among us and to bring others into the riches of the hymns
Today in the Lord's recovery, there are many spiritual publications that can render us help in the knowledge and experience of the Lord
When we go to the new believers, we also teach them in the same way little by little, just as a mother teaches her child to speak
He can only utter something word by word; but after two or three years his speaking will consist of sentences and paragraphs
We have to open up the book of Romans and tell him, 'This Spirit is like the word, so near to you, even in your mouth and in your heart
We should not expect him to learn everything all at once; rather, we have to teach him slowly, little by little
Among this one thousand people there are the elders the coworkers the fulltimers and the young students especially the college students
Especially the elders, as the head sheep, should take the lead among the flock to practice speaking the Lord's word in the meetings
The church in Taipei has made the decision to practice the new system in the one hundred 'gospel tents' formed during the gospel festival
We have studied almost all of the history of Christianity, the writings of renowned persons, and biographies of spiritual giants
Since 1934, Brother Watchman Nee had been emphasizing that meetings with one speaking and the rest listening are not scriptural
He said that this was to follow the custom of the nations, that it was unnecessary, and that it should not be maintained
He felt that if this kind of meeting with one speaking and the rest listening were removed immediately, there would be nothing to replace it
He had the baptism of the Holy Spirit and he spoke in tongues, but he did not bring these things into the big meetings
In their meetings they did not have any preaching, nor did they use any publications; rather, they had only the Bible
When we speak, we seldom speak the Scriptures that we have read, and seldom do we speak the Lord's word; we have not yet built up this habit
Concerning this matter, there are the clear words from the two sister passages in Colossians 3:16 and Ephesians 5:18-19
In our experience we do not have the habit of speaking these two kinds of words; therefore, we do not know how to speak
For this reason, it is not at all easy for us to speak the words of the Bible and of the hymns in a mutual way in the meetings
Whenever you go to a meeting, whether large or small, you have to practice speaking mutually to one another with the Bible and by the hymns
Those we can depend on are first, the elders; second, the co-workers; third, the full-timers; and fourth, the college students
We should also build up an atmosphere among us so that when anyone has a spiritual question, he can ask about it in the meeting
We should not bring these questions of the brothers and sisters outside the meetings and use them as subjects for gossip
If we learn to pick up the burden for the meetings to speak the Lord's word, the meetings will be living and rich
According to the present arrangement, to have the church meetings and church services in the communities is a clear and accurate way
For the district meetings the elders coworkers fulltimers and the college students should all live in the Lords Spirit in their daily living
In Taipei the elders, co-workers, full-time trainees, and college students make up about one quarter of the total number of attendants
We can encourage the elders, co-workers, full-timers, and college students to speak one by one in the meetings
Those who by nature want to speak should refrain from speaking, and those who by nature do not want to speak should speak
If the sisters, even though they are young, jump and speak in a wild way in the meetings, people will feel it is inappropriate
No meeting can be as practical as a group meeting in communicating with and blending together the brothers and sisters
If people are too far apart, it is easy for misunderstandings to occur; but if they are too close, it is easy to have problems
From now on, our practice will consist of the home meetings on the small scale, and the district meetings on the large scale
Many among you have attended three terms of training, have worked in the communities for a year and a half, and have experienced much
As to how many meetings the new ones should have each week, we must make that decision according to their condition
Or should we be less rigid about the home meetings, not so formal, giving them the freedom to meet either in the morning or in the evening
While you are taking care of these twenty new ones, you should find a way to join the new ones with the old ones in the district
When you go out to knock on doors to preach the gospel, you may baptize a fifty-five year old college professor
Gradually, because of the difference in age, it will become difficult for the two of you to communicate with each other
When we carry out the group meetings and bring the new ones to serve, this includes the matter of knocking on doors to preach the gospel
According to the present situation with the meetings, we have the home meetings, the group meetings, and the district meetings
We need to do more research to find out the proper way to have the home meetings, the group meetings, and the district meetings
From the information gathered through experiments, we will find the proper way and apply it to the practical need of the church
According to the present situation, among all the meetings of the new way, the group meeting is a very complicated one
Besides this, we have the goal of bringing all the students into the district meetings and even into the group meetings
Throughout the past years, according to our statistics, we have had only one hundred fifteen thousand people under our care
As a result, although our number grew larger and larger, those whose function has been truly manifested are few
These steps are the various processes He has gone through, which include the Father's choosing and predestinating and the Son's incarnation
When the Son came to earth, He came with the Father and by the Spirit, and lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years
In the end He willingly went into death, gave up His soul-life, was nailed to the cross, and accomplished redemption
He then breathed this Spirit into those who believed in Him to become their life, their content, their supply, and everything to them
Because Christianity came to the East along with western culture, we have more or less been influenced by the traditions in Christianity
There are many believers among the different denominations in Christianity who are all chosen, redeemed, and regenerated by God
We do not see much sanctification and transformation in them, nor do we recognize in their daily walk the mark of the sons of God
Among us, although we have left degraded Christianity to come into the Lord's recovery, it is not easy to stay in the recovery
The responsible brothers in all the meeting halls tried their best to arrange for speakers to release messages week after week
In the old practice, the more the people listen to messages, the more they like to listen, and the less they function
As a result, the condition of the whole church is stagnant; there are not many positive activities taking place
Generally speaking, the brothers and sisters are all very good; especially those who are stable are quite seeking
The meetings spoken of in the Bible are occasions for people to be encouraged, to be stirred up, to speak, and to function
Brothers and sisters, please remember that the way of meeting as revealed in the Bible is one that enlivens people
The system of meeting in today's Christianity does not develop the spiritual function of life within us, the regenerated ones
It restricts, limits, and suppresses our spiritual functions, with the result that they are reduced or annulled
The reason is that there is not much supply and nourishment in the meetings, and also there is the lack of the release and exercise of life
For this reason, in the meetings under the old system, it is difficult to see any growth in life, and there is very little building
All of you as trainees must understand that this training is to bring us back to the way of meeting as revealed in the Bible
Individually speaking, we grow by being nourished and exercised in the spiritual life; corporately speaking, we are built up in the Body
In the process of this development of their organic ability, the activities of the brothers and sisters may not be on the right track
In order to have a revival, we must live daily in the Spirit, walk by the Spirit, and conduct ourselves according to the Spirit
If you had a good morning but were out of the spirit in that afternoon you would feel inadequate when you come to the meeting in the evening
Rather, it is a matter of being living, of living in the spirit, fellowshipping with the Lord, and enjoying the Lord's word constantly
Whether it is a home meeting, a group meeting, or a district meeting, we will be able to meet the needs of others
As long as the saints would supply life by functioning in the meetings, the result will be the growth of life and the building up together
If you are such a person, then whether you go to the home meeting, the group meeting, or the district meeting, you will be a supplier
Do not ask what the new method is, for it is not a matter of the method, but of the person, whether or not your person is living
Since October of 1984 when we first mentioned the change of the system, we have been practicing small group meetings here in Taipei
At that time, we had a slogan: 'The heaven can be annulled, and the earth can pass away, but the small group meeting must not be forsaken'
Afterwards, we were divided into four hundred small groups, and the number of attendants was between three thousand and thirty-five hundred
In the second half of 1986, we began to conduct formal trainings, and we tried our best to bring the local saints into those trainings
As a result, during the last year, although the small groups still existed, they were in a situation where they were left to themselves
At present in the church in Taipei there are about thirty-five hundred saints who attend meetings regularly in the halls
In addition, it is also quite difficult to ask the new ones to willingly open up their homes to have group meetings week after week
It is not necessary for the training center to promote this, nor is it necessary for the elders or the district leaders to arrange for this
We always need to remember that we are going to contact people; since this is the case, we need to do it with a humanity that is adequate
Their way of gaining people in general is through preaching, on the one hand, and through the use of other things, on the other hand
In the Old Testament, the fine flour is for the meal offering , and the meal offering signifies Christ as food for both God and man
Their workers only render help to people outwardly; they do not bring people into Christ, nor do they bring Christ into people
If we cannot bring a person into Christ in a practical way, though we have tried our best, we simply have to put this one aside temporarily
When the crowd who had been fed with bread came to force Him to be king, He retreated to the mountains, Himself alone
The Lord told them that the Son of Man came not to feed people with bread, but to dispense Himself as the bread of life into men
In the same principle, it is not that today we do not care for people; rather, we care for people within a limit
Most people consider the church as a charitable organization with a goal of seeking the welfare of the society
The commission that we have received from God is to dispense the Triune God into people to be everything to them
The purpose of our training is to train you to be quick in response and to supply people according to their need
In carrying out the group meetings, we should put all the elders, co-workers, full-timers, and trainees into the groups
Leading these groups is much more complicated than what you have learned in the trainings you have received before
When you young ones attend the group meetings with older ones, you need to learn not to have feelings towards such situations
No matter what others think of you, you have to exert your whole strength to reach your goal, and not stop short
We who are working for the Lord are really under the observations of a thousand eyes and have a thousand fingers pointing at us
You young ones should not let others despise your youth; rather, in every respect let your progress be manifest to all
When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was like a deaf person, not hearing the slandering of man and not reacting to slandering words
The Apostle Paul served the Lord according to this principle: it was not his concern to be welcomed by others or to be exalted by them
Christianity has degraded to today's fallen condition because few people are able to speak the Lord's word in the meetings
In the early days, the words of praise spoken by the brothers and sisters in the bread-breaking meetings were quite simple
After a while, the words of praise became monotonous; and eventually, no one had much feeling about those words anymore
After that, the praises in the bread-breaking meeting had more depth of content and the meeting became more enjoyable
Once Thou wast the only grain, Lord, Falling to the earth to die, That thru death and resurrection Thou in life may multiply
We were brought forth in Thy nature And the many grains became; As one loaf we all are blended, All Thy fulness to proclaim
Singing and speaking the above words in the bread-breaking meeting truly touches the burden and feeling in our spirit
We felt that the one hundred eighty-three hymns were not adequate, so we published a second volume of our hymnal
As a result, when they broke bread to remember the Lord, they still selected the old hymns that they were accustomed to
In the bosom of the Father, Ere the ages had begun, Thou wast in the Father's glory, God's unique begotten Son
When to us the Father gave Thee, Thou in person wast the same, All the fulness of the Father In the Spirit to proclaim
By Thy death and resurrection, Thou wast made God's firstborn Son; By Thy life to us imparting, Was Thy duplication done
For the bread and for the wine, For the pledge that seals Him mine, For the words of love divine, We give Thee thanks, O Lord
The content of the hymn is merely a gratitude and remembrance concerning the Lord's death, sacrifice, and the shedding of His blood
O glorious Christ, Savior mine, Thou art truly radiance divine, God infinite, in eternity, Yet man in time, finite to be
Because they did not have this kind of knowledge nor this kind of feeling, they could not have this kind of expression
During that period although their understanding and experience were only up to a certain level the power of their speaking was like dynamite
Brother Nee once said that during that period their revelation and light were like the pouring down of a waterfall
Panton also said that the strength of the Brethren movement was greater than that of the Reformation by Luther
We need to return to the Bible to recover the meeting revealed in 1 Corinthians 14, where the secret is altogether in speaking
The Lord's word must have full ground in us in order to operate and supply the riches of Christ to our inner man
To let the word of Christ dwell in us is different from providing hospitality to a guest for three to five days
We should let the Lord's word be our Master, taking ground in us, occupying us, so that it can move freely in us
Some people have problems with their digestive systems; their stomachs are so damaged that nothing eaten can be digested
Even though you have the words of the Bible, they cannot become the words out of your mouth because you have not digested and absorbed them
If we want to walk properly in this way we must be ones who are overcoming spiritual living in the spirit and fellowshipping with the Lord
Solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their faculties exercised for discriminating between both good and evil'
In other words, you must apply the verses that you pray-read and memorize every morning to your practical daily living
When you go to the department store to shop and pick up an item, something within will say, 'Do not love the world'
We previously mentioned different ways of speaking such as speaking with the word, with the Spirit, with singing, and with prayer
In the next few years, not only do you have to carry out the new way in Taipei; you must succeed in learning the Lord's word
In this way, no matter where you go in the future, you will be a person who takes in the Lord's word in a full way and is exercised by it
Because of the anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches, the word of life is choked, and it becomes unfruitful
Today, the spiritual living of many Christians is neither a race nor a battle; they spend their time foolishly and ignorantly
When he is on the battlefield, he has to be on the alert all the time and be aware of everything going on around him
If you want to be an overcomer by visiting people for the preaching of the gospel, you must be prepared like an athlete in the Olympic games
During the last year and a half in which we practiced door-knocking here, we baptized over thirty thousand people
If one-fourth of the saints meeting with us would go out to knock on doors, in just thirteen years, by the year 2000 A
Our Lord knows that among the wolves there are still the sheep, the sons of peace, and He wants us to go and bring them out
From now on, in the Lord's recovery, we must lead the church to practice this matter of door-knocking for the preaching of the gospel
We must pay the price to be an overcomer, to take this overcoming way to preach the gospel by knocking on doors
You must remember that the biblical way, whether for meeting, gospel preaching, or serving, requires that we be overcomers
Perhaps in an hour and a half you have to go to take care of a meeting, but yesterday you lost your temper with someone
We must have the truth as the channel, and we must pay the price to dispense into people what we have experienced
As a result, what we give to others will not be merely teachings of truth, but what we have learned, experienced, and obtained from the Lord
When you go to take care of the home meetings, someone may advise you out of a good heart, saying, 'You are so young and are quite smart
Throughout the ages there have been countless people who poured out their precious lives as ointment on the Lord
He may not understand your word, but the Holy Spirit will work in him, and your word will be deeply impressed into him
When you come to the meetings, whether large or small, spontaneously you will be able to release something from within
With either a long message or just a few sentences, you will be able to supply others with what you have received and experienced
You should not despise those who would not do this, and you should not be concerned with those who criticize you
In any meeting, you must follow the Spirit of the Lord to release the riches that you have experienced, realized, and obtained
If the Lord's recovery is without such a change, and if there are no full-timers raised up, there will gradually be no way to go on
In many things they follow us to improve, but their rate of improvement is very slow because they do not have an absolute heart
Had it not been for what Luther saw, and for his courage and boldness, he would never have dared to rise up to initiate the Reformation
He was buried, entered into Hades, passed through death, was resurrected from the dead, and became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
Today, this Jesus is joined as one with Peter, James, John, Stephen, and thousands of those who believe in Him
From that day on, what Paul preached and worked was fully controlled by the vision he saw; he never deviated from it
The inheritance we have obtained is not a heavenly mansion, or any creature in the universe, but the very Triune God Himself
He is the inheritance which we have received, just like a portion of the good land that was allotted to each Israelite in the Old Testament
Otherwise, we will lose our prize and will have no part in the coming kingdom; we will be punished and cast into the outer darkness
The New Testament uses a great term economy to convey the thought that the Triune God has a desire an intention a plan and an arrangement
He entered into the womb of the virgin Mary and remained in her womb for nine months in accordance with the law of creation
For three and a half years He went everywhere healing the sick, casting out demons, preaching the word, and calling out disciples
In this Spirit there is Jehovah the Father the Son the Spirit man humanity and human living with crucifixion resurrection and ascension
When we come to meet, we should not bring in the worldly elements, neither should we bring in the practices of Christianity
The change of the system is not a change of dead methods; rather, it is to recover the meeting which the Lord desires according to the Bible
When we come together, each one has a psalm, or a teaching, or a revelation, or a tongue, or an interpretation
Today in the church, in the Lord's recovery, there must be such an item of gospel preaching by visiting people
For the church to gain people and for the gospel to go out, there is no other way as widespread and far-reaching as this
If we have never gone out to visit people to preach the gospel, we have not consecrated ourselves to the Lord in an absolute way
For us to do this is to testify to Satan that we are those who have consecrated ourselves fully to the Lord and to His gospel
After we preach the gospel and baptize people into the Triune God, we have to supply them with more of the riches of Christ
After a person is saved, he will be liberated in a kind of free atmosphere to develop the gift of life within him
The uphill way is hard, and not many are willing to take it; the downhill way is easy, and many are happy to take it
The Lord will surely work out the mutuality in meeting as described by the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25
May the Lord bless everyone who has a desire to take this way, and may the Lord also use this way of recovery that is revealed in the Bible
