[1]  We have been speaking concerning the God-ordained way in both Taiwan and the United States for seven and a half years, but we have not seen a definite result.
[2]  The word that we released has been more than clear, stressing that the group meeting is the crucial matter in the Lord s ordained way.
[3]  We said that the group meetings should constitute eighty percent of the church life, and we also said that the gospel preaching, the nourishing, the cherishing, the feeding, and the perfecting should be done in the groups.
[4]  Among the churches there are some group meetings, but these are not the group meetings we intend to build up that can occupy eighty percent of the church life.
[5]  After the recovery spreads to a certain nation, it should reach the typical local people.
[6]  If we cannot do this or we would not do this, we will suffer a big deficiency.
[7]  Because we have Caucasians, Chinese, Hispanics, Koreans, and other ethnic groups in the church life, we need to face a real problem that we do not have in other regions of the world, that is, how to group our people.
[8]  Realizing our situation, our environment, and the condition of our work, we should pray, Lord, we do not have the wisdom.
[9]  FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE TWO THE PRACTICE OF THE GROUP MEETINGS
[10]  I am very burdened for the church in Anaheim concerning the practice of the group meetings.
[11]  In my ministry regarding this matter I said that we can forget the heavens and the earth, but we must not forsake the group meetings.
[12]  I have the burden to teach you the details concerning the forming of the groups and the practice of the group meetings just as an English teacher would teach his students the ABCs.
[13]  However, I cannot do this with the whole church.
[14]  To form the groups in the new way there is no need to touch any of the existing church meetings or group meetings.
[15]  While you are on your way to contact this brother, you should pray, Lord, what should I say to him?
[16]  Thank You that You have exposed us, that You have shown us our shortage, and that You have shown us what You need.
[17]  Lord, we thank You for all these things, yet we are still ignorant concerning the proper experience of the group meetings.
[18]  Lord, cover us from all these things that we may have a clear, pure, and even purified fellowship so that You can show us Your way.
[19]  The instructions I am giving now concerning the new way are different from what I spoke in Taiwan.
[20]  In Taiwan I charged you to visit people and to get them baptized immediately.
[21]  But today I do not encourage you to get people baptized in a quick way.
[22]  Also, when you visit people, do not speak too quickly to them concerning the Bible, God, Christ, or salvation.
[23]  Up to the present moment, we need Your supply so that we may know how to form the groups step by step and how to build them up, how to have everything increasing to be eighty percent of the church life.
[24]  Lord, teach us and guide us, even in our fellowship with one another.
[25]  Lord, we do not like to be an unturned cake, but we do not know how to turn to the other side.
[26]  Therefore, on the one hand, we must take the new way, the God-ordained way, as the Lord has revealed it to us, and on the other hand, while we are going forward we must take care of our background, our present situation, and the many churches around the globe.
[27]  After much consideration before the Lord, I feel led by the Lord to the conclusion that while we are endeavoring to take the new way, we should not change anything of the present situation.
[28]  The formation of the new groups will require a great deal of prayer, and it will also require much laboring.
[29]  Whether we gain one this year or do not gain one, we can still live; we can still come to the Lord s table to enjoy the Lord.
[30]  Prayer: Lord, we do look unto You for Your further leading concerning the group meetings.
[31]  Lord, we fully realize that there is the need to do something, yet we do not know what to do.
[32]  He did not say that as long as the Spirit is in us and we love the Lord and pray much, the Spirit will lead us to know who the elders and the deacons should be.
[33]  It is best that a group meeting be started with a small number of persons.
[34]  However, with only two to five members it will be difficult to practice the proper function of the group, which needs to visit sinners and gain them for the Lord.
[35]  However, if we do not bring the new ones to the church meeting on the Lord s Day but go ourselves, we will neglect the new ones.
[36]  Since we still need to attend the church meeting on the Lord s Day morning, it is better to arrange to have the Lord s table with the new ones in the afternoon or the evening on the Lord s Day.
[37]  FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE SIX PRACTICING THE GROUPS UNDER THE PROPER ARRANGEMENT AND LEADERSHIP
[38]  Prayer: Lord, do teach us how to pray concerning Your move in the matter of grouping.
[39]  We do not want to pray in vain words.
[40]  Lord, do cleanse us again with Your precious blood that we may have a clear conscience with a crystal clear spirit in our fellowship.
[41]  We do need Your leading that we may know what we should do in all the churches in Your recovery concerning this matter.
[42]  I feel that the leading ones in every church should gather the willing ones and give them a word of explanation to cause them to know what we intend to do and how we are going to do it.
[43]  Our experiences in the past and our experiments in the recent years have led us to conclude that, although the church life should be organic, by the Spirit, in the Spirit, and with the Spirit, still there is the need for some arrangement.
[44]  We should not form the groups merely according to geography or according to the saints age, and we surely should not do it according to preference.
[45]  Prayer: Lord, thank You for Your recovery on this earth.
[46]  Lord, do cleanse us with Your precious blood and anoint us with Your ointment that we may enjoy You.
[47]  Lord, we do beg You to stir up our spirits, and we also want to fan our spirits into flame.
[48]  THE PURPOSE FOR THE INCREASE, THE PERFECTING, AND THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH
[49]  The purpose of the vital groups is the increase, perfecting, and building up of the Body of Christ Acts 2:46-47; Eph 4:12 .
[50]  First, we need the increase not only of Caucasians but of all peoples.
[51]  Acts 2:46-47 says, And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with exultation and simplicity of heart, praising God and having favor with all the people.
[52]  The condition of the vital groups is that of loving one another in oneness and with one accord John 13:34-35 .
[53]  However, we must admit that although we do love one another, we may not love one another very much.
[54]  Because we meet together day after day and year after year, we surely have human affection for one another; but the condition of loving one another in the vital groups should be more than this.
[55]  In John 17 the Lord Jesus said that when His disciples are one in the Triune God, the whole world will believe that He was sent by the Father vv.
[56]  In John 13:34-35 the Lord Jesus said, A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.
[57]  In grouping the saints together, we do not need to legally follow a certain way.
[58]  We can group the saints together according to the Spirit and according to the situation.
[59]  In some situations grouping the young ones together with the old ones may not be a help to the young ones, but in other instances grouping the young ones with certain elderly saints will make the young ones more living.
[60]  In our homes we enjoy our married life, but when we come to the church, we are all members of the Body.
[61]  Prayer: O Lord, the church needs a revival, and we all need a new start.
[62]  Even tonight give us a new start with our fellowship.
[63]  Lord, grant us mercy and grace that we all may be willing to renew our consecration to You.
[64]  The number of saints in the churches in the United States is still relatively small, but because the recovery has been in the United States for thirty years, we may consider that the churches in this country are somewhat old.
[65]  Even those who have been in the church life for only a short time cannot avoid the tendency of oldness from the atmosphere in the churches.
[66]  All of us need to pray definitely to have a new start from the Lord.
[67]  Although we had group meetings in the past, I do not consider them as being up to the Lord s standard.
[68]  Based on our past experience, we may feel that we know how to attend a group meeting, but actually, we do not know.
[69]  Gideon told the fearful ones to return, and twenty-two thousand withdrew, leaving ten thousand v. 3 . Then God said to Gideon that this was still too many v. 4a . God gave Gideon a way to test the people to determine whom God would choose and whom God would not choose.
[70]  However, if we practice positive thinking, we may still suffer the suffering of Job Eventually, because of the sufferings that we endure in the Christian life, I was compelled to come to the following conclusion: to be a man, I must be a Christian; to be a Christian, I must be in His church, in His recovery; and to be in His recovery, I must be an overcomer.
[71]  FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE NINE THE VITAL GROUPS IN THE CHURCH LIFE 3 Scripture Reading: John 17:19-21; 13:34-35; Acts 2:42-47 PRAYING IN A NEW WAY TO MEET THE NEW NEED
[72]  For the vital groups, the first thing is our prayer.
[73]  Thus, the first matter in this training will be to train the vital group members concerning how to pray in the new way to meet the new need.
[74]  Our way of prayer has become a form; week after week we pray in a habitual way, repeating the same prayers to the Lord.
[75]  When we pray, we should simply tell the Lord directly what we want: Lord, we want to be revived.
[76]  We need the Lord to come and stir us up that we may pray in a new, refreshing, and living way.
[77]  In John 17:19-21 the Lord Jesus prayed, And for their sake I sanctify Myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.
[78]  And I do not ask concerning these only, but concerning those also who believe into Me through their word, that they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me. We are all members of the Body of Christ.
[79]  However, although today we are still in the recovery and in the oneness, we need to realize that the oneness among us is not a living oneness.
[80]  If we love one another, we do not need to tell people that we are Christ s disciples.
[81]  FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE TEN THE BUILDING UP OF THE VITAL GROUPS 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 5:6-7a; Lev 2:1-13; Matt 16:24; Phil 2:2; Eph 4:3; Acts 1:14; 4:24; Num 6:1-4; Rev 2 3; Rom 15:16; 1 Pet 2:5, 9; 1 Thes 2:7; Eph 4:12-13; 1 Cor 14:1-5, 23-26, 31, 39a THE ONENESS AND THE ONE ACCORD
[82]  There are two crucial matters in the New Testament that we all need to pay attention to: the oneness and the one accord.
[83]  In that chapter oneness is covered by the Lord Jesus in His prayer.
[84]  The Lord s prayer in John 17 followed His discourse in John 14 16, in which He released the mystery of the Divine Trinity.
[85]  We may come to the meetings, praise the Lord, and prophesy, but we may do all these things without being conscious of the fact that we do not have the adequate one accord.
[86]  HAVING AN INTIMATE AND THOROUGH FELLOWSHIP IN CHRIST AS THE ELEMENT AND SPHERE, BY EXERCISING YOUR SPIRIT WITH MUCH AND THOROUGH PRAYER, CONCERNING YOUR STATUS, SPIRITUAL CONDITION, AND PRESENT SITUATION IN AND WITH THE LORD
[87]  The word fellowship is used in the New Testament first in Acts 2:42: And they continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.
[88]  In the vital groups we need to fellowship concerning our status, our spiritual condition, and our present situation in and with the Lord.
[89]  In order to be blended together, we need to confess the sin of individualism and individuality.
[90]  Condemning All the Self-exalting Views and Dropping All the Divisive Opinions
[91]  To keep the oneness of the Spirit we need to condemn all the self-exalting views and drop all the divisive opinions.
[92]  Some of the saints may feel confident that they are more knowledgeable and can do things better than the elders of the church.
[93]  If we would practice the blending, we should not forget the matter of fellowship.
[94]  Because we do not like people to know us, we have become very sensitive, and our being sensitive causes us to be very touchy.
[95]  If we do not have the one accord, God cannot answer our prayer, because we do not practice the Body.
[96]  We may have been Christians for many years, yet we must admit that we are too natural.
[97]  We may think that we are very spiritual, yet we have to realize that we are naturally spiritual.
[98]  This means that we have not been dealt with by the Lord that much.
[99]  If you desire to pray, you must learn to pray a real prayer that is not initiated by you.
[100]  For us to pray merely in our vital group meetings is not adequate.
[101]  For the blending we need to pray day and night.
[102]  We can be blended by much and thorough prayer, as fine flour of the wheat, with all the members of our group, with the Spirit as the oil, through the death of Christ as the salt, and in the resurrection of Christ as the frankincense, into a dough for the Lord 1 Cor 5:6-7a; Lev 2:1-13 .
[103]  If we are under the Lord s enlightening, we will realize that our thinking, our intention, and our desire are all evil.
[104]  THE RELEASE OF THE SPIRIT FOR BLENDING Scripture Reading: Acts 1:14; 2:42; 6:4; Eph 6:18 Hymns, #846
[105]  I would recommend that we pray-read all of the verses cited above in the Scripture reading so that we can enter into the burden of this message.
[106]  In these days we are burdened for the blending of the saints in the vital groups.
[107]  In the book of Acts, we can see that the one hundred twenty practiced the Lord s command to pray in harmony, to pray in one accord 1:14 .
[108]  In our prayer we should not merely exercise our spirit but also release our spirit.
[109]  Praying is the unique way for us to exercise our spirit and even the more to release our spirit.
[110]  When our spirit is released, we can be blended together in this released spirit.
[111]  If we pray and our spirit is not exercised and released, our prayer is wrong.
[112]  In order to give Him the preeminence, we must be willing to be adjusted, to be broken, to be made nothing, so that the Lord can have a way in us, through us, and among us for the building up of His organic Body.
[113]  FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE PRAYER BY EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT
[114]  We need to pray by exercising our spirit for the release of the Holy Spirit.
[115]  If we do not exercise our spirit, the Holy Spirit is locked and imprisoned inside our being.
[116]  We believed in the Lord Jesus, we received the Spirit, and the Spirit came into us.
[117]  In Ephesians 6:18 the apostle Paul charges us to pray at every time in spirit and watch unto this in all perseverance and petition.
[118]  In our prayer time we should have the attitude that we are with our King and we are fully occupied with Him.
[119]  God the Father as the Spirit dwells and operates in us John 4:24; 1 John 4:13; Phil 2:13 ; God the Son as the life-giving Spirit lives and makes His home in us 1 Cor 15:45b; Gal 2:20a; Eph 3:17a ; and God the Spirit dwells in us, supplies us, and fills us Acts 5:3-4; Rom 8:11; Phil 1:19b; Acts 13:52 .
[120]  The Bible says that when we believed in the Lord Jesus, the Spirit came into us, Christ came into us, and God the Father came into us.
[121]  We have the Spirit within us, Christ within us, and God the Father within us, but we are not living because we do not pray.
[122]  THE VITAL GROUP PRACTICE THE NEED FOR TRAINING TO
[123]  In order for us to practice the church life according to the God-ordained way, we need to be trained.
[124]  Brother Nee and I have given hundreds of messages on this line, stressing that we should not do anything according to our way or by our energy, but by prayer and by trusting in the Lord.
[125]  This is very good, but we may use prayer and trusting in the Lord as an excuse for taking the freedom to do what is right in our own eyes.
[126]  We may say that because we do not feel a certain matter is of the Lord, we will not do it.
[127]  If we want the increase and the remaining fruit, we have to realize two things: first, we need to pray for our child; then we have to take care of this child.
[128]  Another point I would like to make is that we must drop our own way.
[129]  Third, we also need to pray that we will not preach according to our way but according to the trained way.
[130]  We may exercise our spirit only when we feel we have to pray or speak something, but we must exercise our spirit at all times.
[131]  FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE FIFTEEN ANOTHER EARNEST TALK CONCERNING
[132]  THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS THE NEED OF REGENERATION, TRANSFORMATION,
[133]  The basic revelation of the New Testament is that we, the descendants of Adam, regardless of whether we are sinful or righteous, of whether we are good or bad, are altogether the old creation.
[134]  Even if we were not sinful, we would still need to be regenerated.
[135]  But the Lord Jesus responded to him by saying, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God v. 3 . To be born anew is to be born again, which is to be regenerated with the divine life, a life different from the human life received by natural birth.
[136]  A number of you have outwardly been adjusted in your prayer, but I am concerned that you have not been transformed and conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God.
[137]  I am concerned that you may be outwardly behaving.
[138]  We need to be transformed in our prayer, in the way that we worship, and in our meeting life.
[139]  Thus, in our prayer and in everything we do in the church life, we should have the assurance that it is not our doing, but the doing of another One, who has passed through death and resurrection and who is now living in us.
[140]  First, we need to be blended by much and thorough prayer in love.
[141]  We have to practice this blending until we see the Lord.
[142]  Actually, when I say that we need to be released, this does not only mean to pray.
[143]  When we come together in the vital groups, we should release ourselves by opening up to one another.
[144]  First, we have to pray that we may be blended with others in love.
[145]  We have to pray that we can be blended, that we can be filled with the Spirit, that we can redeem our time by unceasing prayer, and that we can do things in the service, not according to our own way but according to the coordinated way, willing to give up our freedom.
[146]  We need to begin to pray to gain the candidates for our gospel preaching.
[147]  Then we need to pray, Lord, among these, who are the ones that I should take first as my candidates for Your gospel?
[148]  We should not take more than five people on our list as our initial candidates for the Lord to gain.
[149]  FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE SIXTEEN BEING BURDENED WITH GOD S LOVING CONCERN FOR SINNERS AND WITH CONVERTING
[150]  In the previous message, we pointed out five crucial points for our seeking in the vital groups.
[151]  First, we need to seek to be blended with the other members of our vital group by having an intimate and thorough fellowship with much and thorough prayer.
[152]  Fourth, we need to learn to serve and work not in our own way but in the coordinated way by giving up our freedom.
[153]  I do not mean that we need to shout all the time, but when we pray in the meetings, our prayer should not be voiced in a common way.
[154]  We have to learn to be burdened with the loving concern of God s heart toward the perishing sinners.
[155]  John 3:16 says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes into Him would not perish but have eternal life.
[156]  God s virtues are His love, His kindness, His grace, His mercy, His patience, His forgiveness, etc. To tell out God s virtues is the preaching of the gospel of God s salvation in His virtues according to our experiences.
[157]  We have pointed out that in the group meeting we should have the proper, intimate, and thorough fellowship with one another by exercising our spirit with much and thorough prayer.
[158]  We need to pray, Lord, make us vital in singing, vital in speaking, and vital in everything.
[159]  We also have to build ourselves up according to the seven points covered in the previous two messages.
[160]  Specifically, we need to pray for the dealing with our disposition, character, and peculiar traits.
[161]  In the church many of us love the Lord, love the Lord s recovery, and love the church, but not many are really useful because of the defects related to our disposition, character, and peculiar traits.
[162]  In this message we will touch the matter of mutual teaching in the group meetings by mutual asking and mutual answering.
[163]  In the group meetings we do not promote anyone to be a particular teacher; rather, we desire to encourage all the group members to learn how to teach.
[164]  First, he may not understand the Lord s word in verse 24: Unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins.
[165]  He may also wonder what the truth is and how the truth can set us free v. 32 . Actually, in this portion of the Word the crucial point is that Christ as the great I Am eventually becomes the truth as our reality, and this is the very factor that sets us free from the slavery of sin.
[166]  In the previous message we mentioned the matter of dealing with our disposition, our character, and our peculiar traits.
[167]  FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE NINETEEN PAYING THE PRICE TO LEARN THE DIVINE TRUTHS AND PRACTICE THE MUTUAL TEACHING
[168]  In this message we will continue to consider the matter of mutual teaching in the vital groups.
[169]  To speak in a natural way, to gossip, to murmur, and to complain are all quite easy, but to teach the divine truths is not easy.
[170]  If we mean business with the Lord to participate in the vital groups, from this point forward we must make up our mind with a definite determination that we will endeavor to get into the biblical truths.
[171]  When you decide to do this kind of reading, you must also decide to cease all your unnecessary talk, your murmuring, your complaining, and your gossiping Matt 12:36; Eph 4:29 .
[172]  When you answer the telephone, you should learn to keep your conversations to as few sentences as possible.
[173]  If we would carry out the mutual teaching in the vital groups, we must terminate our idle talk and concentrate our entire being on one thing: learning the truth so that we will be furnished, equipped, and completed to have the capacity and also the capability to teach.
[174]  Although you might have been regenerated many years ago, you need to realize that you have not come out of the womb yet; you are still in the womb of the Holy Spirit.
[175]  When we stand up in the meetings to speak for the Lord, we must have the assurance that what we are going to speak is something with weight, with light, and with the life supply.
[176]  In the near future we will train the vital group members to go out to contact people with the gospel.
[177]  I do believe that we will gain some people.
[178]  So, immediately we will all need to know how to nourish the newborn spiritual babes that they may be kept and preserved.
[179]  After a short time, we will all need to bring these babes into our vital groups to perfect them through mutual teaching.
[180]  Before we start to move, start to work, start to take action, in the preaching of the gospel, I have a heavy burden with a heavy word to fellowship with you all.
[181]  The reason that we need to have this kind of training with these groups is that for centuries the Lord s church on this earth has become degraded.
[182]  This Christ, who is the life element with which His Body is constituted, has been sown into us, making our heart the growing earth, the growing soil.
[183]  In this soil this Christ, who is the element of life to His Body, is growing.
[184]  Some have wrongly said that the teaching of the apostles is only those teachings which the twelve apostles learned of Jesus and passed on to the believers.
[185]  The Lord surely taught His disciples much in the Gospels, especially in Matthew and John.
[186]  But in John 16 the Lord told them that He had many things to tell them which they could not bear at that time.
[187]  The word of God here is concerning the mystery v. 26 , which is Christ as the mystery of God Col 2:2 and the church as the mystery of Christ Eph 3:4 . Without Paul s fourteen Epistles, the holy word concerning the divine revelation of this mystery could never have been completed.
[188]  Whatever we are going to do, we should not do it until we realize that we are in the Spirit.
[189]  In this message I would like to coach you in how to contact people and gain people for the Lord.
[190]  We are in contact with our relatives, our neighbors, our classmates, and our colleagues.
[191]  10, 12, 40 , even though he said he did not have the Lord s commandment v. 25 . Then eventually he said, I think that I also have the Spirit of God v. 40 . This shows that he and God the Spirit spoke together.
[192]  As the members of the vital groups, we need to pay off our debt of the gospel Rom 1:14-15 to our relatives, who are our first inner circle, our closest circle of contacts.
[193]  Starting from today, the Lord may lead you to pray for them for six months.
[194]  PREPARING OUR GOSPEL CANDIDATES, AND REDEEMING OUR TIME TO LEARN THE TRUTH BECOMING VITAL THROUGH PRAYER
[195]  Now we have to start our action for the increase.
[196]  I found out that they were not vital and that they do not pray much.
[197]  If we do not pray even for one day, we have the feeling that we are short of the Spirit.
[198]  Question: Would it be more beneficial for us not to invite new ones to our vital groups right away, but rather to spend time with them in their homes first?
[199]  Answer: Whether or not you invite them to the vital groups should not be a rule, a legal regulation.
[200]  In certain cases it might be safer for you to go with another brother to see him for a period of time until you feel he is ready to come to a group meeting.
[201]  Answer: The Bible reveals that we believers in Christ have God s life John 3:15-16, 36 and God s nature 2 Pet 1:4 because we have become God s children and have been born of God John 1:12-13 , but this does not mean that we have His Godhead.
[202]  Since we are lovers of the Lord Jesus, we must realize that we have much to learn in order to be a proper Christian.
[203]  In this message we want to consider the purpose of the vital groups.
[204]  Many of the groups have been coming together to pray earnestly and have been laboring for about seven months, but what has come out of this?
[205]  The outward situation among us may not seem that encouraging because we have not yet seen some definite results.
[206]  The result was the outpouring of the Spirit 2:2-4 and three thousand added to the church v. 41 . We may expect a similar great result after we pray together for a short period of time.
[207]  John tells us they caught one hundred fifty-three fish v. 11 . But without these fish, and even on land, where there were no fish, the Lord prepared fish and bread for His disciples v. 9 . In John 21 the Lord Jesus did not come to charge the disciples to go and disciple the nations.
[208]  Peter responded by telling the Lord that he loved Him, and he eventually said, Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You v. 17 . After Peter s responses to His questions, the Lord charged him to feed His lambs, shepherd His sheep, and feed His sheep vv.
[209]  In verse 16 the Lord said, You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain.
[210]  We need to remember that our groups must be vital groups.
[211]  Now I would like to say a word concerning the baptisms of our gospel candidates.
[212]  I do not think it is wise to baptize our new ones hastily, especially the Caucasians.
[213]  Perhaps we could set up a baptism meeting on the Lord s Day to make their baptism a very stately matter.
[214]  If you feel that some of your candidates can be brought to the church life in the Lord s Day morning meeting, you may do this.
[215]  I was endeavoring to bring us into the God-ordained, scriptural way to meet and to serve for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ.
[216]  Through five years of study, from 1984 to 1989, the Lord clearly showed us the God-ordained way.
[217]  The term the God-ordained way was invented by us, and we saw that this God-ordained way revealed in the Scriptures is of four steps: begetting, feeding, perfecting, and building.
[218]  In the entire time of my ministry, I have not been as burdened as I am in these days concerning how the church should go on.
[219]  Recently, I became clear that we must begin to take action, regardless of whether or not we feel that we have been adequately prepared.
[220]  The first step we need to take is to contact the saints who are not in the groups which we have.
[221]  We should not go to contact them first, but go to contact the ones whom we feel can be made vital and whom we can bring into our vital groups.
[222]  When we bring two more to join our group and we reach ten saints, we should divide our group into two groups of five each.
[223]  We should tell the Lord that we do not want to be dormant and that we do not want others in the church to be dormant.
[224]  FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE OVERCOMING THREE LAYERS OF OBSTACLES
[225]  In this message I would like to give some brief fellowship to help us see the need of the vital groups from a particular angle.
[226]  Probably none of us has ever picked up this angle to look into the need of the vital groups.
[227]  Why were we burdened to have such groups, and why did we pick up the word vital?
[228]  I would like us to consider the reason for this from one particular angle, and this angle is the situation we have gradually come to in the United States.
[229]  The Lord s recovery came to this country in 1961 and we started our ministry in 1962.
[230]  In light of the present situation we are in, what shall we do?
[231]  I have studied our situation thoroughly and I feel that nothing can attract and move the present middle-aged American Caucasians unless they see the vitality among us.
[232]  If we are so vital and some seeking ones come in among us, they will be caught by the Lord.
[233]  If we do not have vital groups, we will have no prevailing way to gain the middle-class Caucasians.
[234]  If we are vital, sooner or later, in our neighborhood and among our relatives, colleagues, classmates, and friends, we will meet some seeking ones.
[235]  If we do not have the vital groups, we will still survive as the Lord s recovery.
[236]  A VITAL GROUP IN THE CHURCH LIFE By one saint to be made vital living and active: Through the absolute, clear, and thorough fellowship with the Lord continuously.
