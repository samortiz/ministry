[1]  Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures, Vol. 6 CONTENTS
[2]  In order for the children of God, especially new believers, to receive a greater supply of the Word, we, by the Lord s grace, wish to present some crucial truths in the Holy Scriptures so that the children of God may receive a foundation in the Word of God.
[3]  CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE THE CHURCH OUTLINE God s plan for the church.
[4]  In God s New Testament revelation, He clearly and definitely shows that the church comes out of His eternal heart s desire and that the church exists because of His eternal desire and plan.
[5]  The economy of the mystery...which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things,...the church ; The mystery of Christ, which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit Eph 3:9-10, 4-5 .
[6]  In eternity past God planned the church according to His heart s desire, and in time He created all things to accomplish His plan for the church.
[7]  Although He wanted to gain the church to satisfy His heart s desire, He did not tell anyone or any creature about His purpose.
[8]  Not only did those who were far from God in the age of the Old Testament not know the meaning of the universe but even the patriarchs who walked with God as His friends and the prophets who spoke His words did not know.
[9]  If we want to know the church today, we need God s subjective revelation, because we cannot know the church, which is a great mystery in God, without revelation from God.
[10]  Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place.
[11]  And Jehovah God built the rib, which He had taken from the man, into a woman and brought her to the man Gen 2:21-22 .
[12]  Ephesians 5 shows that Eve being produced from Adam is a type of the church being produced from Christ.
[13]  Just as God caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep and took one of his ribs to build Eve as his counterpart, God caused Christ to die and pierced His side to release His resurrection life to build the church as His counterpart John 19:34 .
[14]  Just as Adam considered Eve to be bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh, being a part of himself and being joined to her as one flesh, Christ considers the church as bone of His bones and flesh of His flesh, being a part of Himself and being joined to her as one Body.
[15]  Following His death and resurrection, the Holy Spirit brings people to touch the death wounds Christ received on the cross and then imparts Christ s resurrection life so that they will be regenerated to become the pearl, the church, that Christ treasures and loves.
[16]  THE ESSENCE OF THE CHURCH The Body of Christ
[17]  Now the life of the church is hidden with Christ in God, but in the future the church will be manifested with Christ in glory Col 3:3-4 .
[18]  The former expresses the fact that the church is one with Christ, having Christ s life and nature; the latter expresses the fact that the church is one with God, having God s life and nature.
[19]  Just as Christ s Body is composed of all those with the life of Christ, God s house is composed of all those with the life of God.
[20]  Christ is the mingling of God and man, and the principle of Christ is God manifested in the flesh, that is, God mingled with man, divinity mingled with humanity to be manifested in and expressed through humanity.
[21]  The church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all Eph 1:22-23 .
[22]  The church being the Body of Christ not only speaks of her relationship to Christ but also of her function toward Christ.
[23]  According to God s thought, it was not good for Adam to be alone, and it is not good for Christ to be without the church Gen 2:18-24; Eph 5:23-32 .
[24]  The first function of the church in the universe is to inherit Christ, extend Christ, and spread Christ; the church does this in time and space the universe to be Christ s fullness for the expression of Christ.
[25]  The church is God s dwelling place to express His glory and to carry out His will, and the church is also a holy priesthood that offers spiritual sacrifices to God, which includes praise, caring for the needs of the saints Heb 13:15-16 , faith toward God Phil 2:17 , the believers themselves Rom 15:16 , and the practical service of the believers 12:1 .
[26]  Although Satan rebelled against God, damaged the man created by God, and hindered and damaged God s works, God brought forth the church from among damaged humanity to be His dwelling place on earth for His habitation and fullness, to be mingled with Him to express His glory, and to carry out His purpose to deal with His enemies.
[27]  The church is the Body of Christ, which is joined to Christ through His life and nature; false believers cannot be members of the Body of Christ, because they do not have the life of Christ.
[28]  Since the church includes only those who are saved and have the Lord s life, the church includes those who are the Lord s brothers and God s children.
[29]  Before His death the Lord prayed to the Father that His disciples, the church, would be one.
[30]  The divided condition of today s Christianity goes against the Lord s heart s desire and will, and it damages the Lord s plan.
[31]  The church is formed by the Holy Spirit bringing the life of Christ, which is Christ Himself, into the believers, joining them in oneness in Him.
[32]  The Holy Spirit makes the church one Body 1 Cor 12:13 .
[33]  Therefore, the Holy Spirit is the church s intrinsic oneness, which is the essence of the church s oneness.
[34]  Not to mingle with anyone who is called a brother, if he is a fornicator or a covetous man or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or a rapacious man, with such a one not even to eat 1 Cor 5:11 .
[35]  If a believer commits any of the sins listed in verse 11, he should be removed from the fellowship of the church lest he corrupt the entire church vv.
[36]  Those who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh...Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God; he who abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son.
[37]  If a person says that he is a Christian but does not believe Christ is God incarnate, he goes beyond the teaching of Christ and does not abide in it.
[38]  The fellowship of the church is a fellowship of oneness that includes all believers who are saved by faith and have the Lord s life and the Holy Spirit.
[39]  THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH Being the Oneness of the Church
[40]  Whoever loses the oneness of the church, the oneness of the church s fellowship, loses the ground of the church.
[41]  Any ground apart from the oneness of the church and the oneness of her fellowship is not the ground of the church.
[42]  Apostles are the first gifts given by the Lord to the church.
[43]  They represent the highest office that God established in the universal church 1 Cor 12:28; Rom 1:5 , and they have the authority to establish churches in every locality.
[44]  God specially appoints and sends them to work for Him in every place to establish churches Acts 8:14, 25; 13:2; 14:14, 21-23 .
[45]  In addition to these twelve, many other apostles were appointed by God, such as Paul, Barnabas v. 14 , Sylvanus, Timothy 1 Thes 1:1; 2:6 , the Lord s brother James Gal 1:19 , our brothers 2 Cor 8:23 , and so on.
[46]  Whoever has been commissioned by God and has been sent by God to preach the gospel, to bring salvation to others, to impart the Holy Spirit, to increase and spread the Body of Christ vv.
[47]  Whether they foretell the future or preach in an ordinary way, prophets speak for God in the power of the Holy Spirit; therefore, they have the authority of God, the ability to impart the revelation of God, the ability to establish and build up the church, and the ability to convict unbelievers 14:24-25 .
[48]  Although a prophet fulfills his ministry of speaking for God in a local church Acts 13:1 , he can speak for God as a prophet in any place.
[49]  They teach the church according to God s revealed truth so that the believers might be established and built up in the light of God s truth.
[50]  To build up His church God not only gives gifts to the universal church but also provides different offices for a local church.
[51]  The gifts that are given involve God s sending or appointment.
[52]  The universal church emphasizes the aspect of the Body of Christ, and the local churches emphasize the aspect of the house of God.
[53]  Since elders are appointed by the apostles, brothers and sisters should make an accusation against an elder only to the apostles 1 Tim 5:19-20 .
[54]  The ones who sin in verse 20 refers to the elders.
[55]  Since the eldership involves the highest office in a local church, the brothers and sisters do not have the authority to appoint elders or the authority to deal with them.
[56]  God wants every local church to be administered locally so that Christ the Head can have the absolute position in every local church and so that the Holy Spirit can exercise complete authority in every local church.
[57]  Since the local churches are the Body of Christ, their actions should be in one accord for the sake of God s testimony and the Lord s work even though their administration is local.
[58]  When Paul wrote the Epistle to the church in Corinth, he also addressed it to all those who call upon the name of the Lord 1 Cor 1:2 , and when he commanded the church in one locality to do something, he gave the same command to the other local churches 7:17; 16:1 .
[59]  Additionally, the practices of a local church are held by all the local churches 11:16; 14:34 , and a local church should imitate the testimony of all the churches of God 1 Thes 2:14 .
[60]  Furthermore, the word that the Holy Spirit speaks to one local church is addressed to all the local churches Rev 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22 .
[61]  The Bible shows that the God-ordained arrangement of the church is marvelous, spiritual, and simple.
[62]  The church is constituted with all who are redeemed by the Lord s blood, and those who are redeemed by the Lord s blood have been saved to serve Him.
[63]  Just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, so we who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another...Whether prophecy...or service...or he who teaches...or he who exhorts...Be burning in spirit, serving the Lord ; Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love Rom 12:4-8, 11; Eph 4:16; see also 1 Cor 12:12-27 .
[64]  The Lord appointed the church to be His representative on earth, so He gave her great authority.
[65]  If a person does not believe in the Lord, he is a sinner and has no relationship with the kingdom of God.
[66]  Once he repents and believes in the Lord, the church has the authority to determine whether his sins were forgiven and to receive him, confessing that he is one who has been forgiven and received by God.
[67]  The Holy Spirit lets the church know whether a person s sins have been forgiven, whether God has received him, and whether the church can receive him.
[68]  According to the verses immediately following this word in Matthew 18, the church s authority to deal with a sinning brother is in the Lord s name v. 20 . To be in the Lord s name means to be in the Lord.
[69]  Although the church does not have human, earthly authority of this age, she has spiritual, heavenly authority to cause unrepentant believers to lose the blessing of the church, lose the presence of the Lord, and to fall into darkness like worldly people who do not have the Lord.
[70]  Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ Eph 4:13 .
[71]  The Bible shows that even though there is degradation in the church on earth, the church is also growing unto maturity.
[72]  The church will arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[73]  There is desolation because of Satan s corruption; there is growth because of God s operation.
[74]  No matter how much Satan corrupts the church, God continuously operates to cause the church to grow unto full maturity.
[75]  After nearly two thousand years of God s operation, however, many of the things that were lost have been recovered and solidly constituted into the church to the extent that it would be difficult to lose them again.
[76]  God continues to work in this way to cause the church to grow until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God.
[77]  CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO ANGELS OUTLINE The origin of angels.
[78]  Ministered to Him...stood before Him Dan 7:10; see also 1 Kings 22:19 .
[79]  Apart from His salvation and His gospel, God carries out most of the affairs of the universe through angels.
[80]  Saints are children in God s household who inherit His salvation; angels are servants in God s household who serve the saints.
[81]  This means that the four living creatures in Ezekiel are for God s glory, whereas the four living creatures in Revelation are for both God s glory and God s holiness.
[82]  The devil has sinned from the beginning 1 John 3:8 .
[83]  The sins that he committed in the beginning were thinking of himself, including his own beauty, glory, and honor; becoming proud by thinking of himself; wanting to uplift himself because of his pride; and rebelling against God and wanting to usurp God s position as the Most High because of his desire to uplift himself.
[84]  His words I will were spoken entirely out of himself, according to his will, and completely denied God s authority.
[85]  All the kingdoms of the inhabited earth...To You I will give all this authority and their glory, because to me it has been delivered, and to whomever I want I give it Luke 4:5-6 .
[86]  The devil spoke these tempting words to the Lord in Luke 4:5-6, and they show that his authority in the universe is very great.
[87]  When the Lord heard this, He did not deny the devil s words; therefore, what the devil spoke was factual.
[88]  God must have delivered this authority and glory to him before he fell because only God has the authority in the universe to do this.
[89]  Thus, in the beginning God delivered all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth to him so that he would rule over them for God.
[90]  According to the Bible, God originally wanted the devil to rule over the kingdoms of the inhabited earth; consequently, God appointed other angels to be under him as his assistants to help him govern and exercise authority in the air.
[91]  The whole world lies in the evil one 1 John 5:19 .
[92]  God can obtain man s worship only when man worships Him in spirit through the Lord Jesus, but the devil can obtain man s worship in many ways.
[93]  According to the record of the Bible, the devil has been involved in six actions in the universe from the beginning to the end.
[94]  You said in your heart: / I will ascend to heaven; / Above the stars of God / I will exalt my throne.
[95]  The central point in his rebellion was his desire to elevate himself to compete with God as an equal and to be like God by taking His high place in the universe.
[96]  He tempted the Lord by saying, If You are the Son of God, because he was trying to get Him to leave His position as a man and to hold on to His position as the Son of God.
[97]  The dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority ; The coming of whom is according to Satan s operation in all power and signs and wonders of a lie Rev 13:2; 2 Thes 2:9 .
[98]  When the devil is thrown out of heaven to earth at the end of this age, he will realize that his time is short Rev 12:9-10, 12 .
[99]  He will cause them to surround and attack God s saints and God s people, but fire will come out of heaven and devour them.
[100]  HIS METHODS IN HIS WORK Hiding in Persons, Things, and Matters
[101]  And he said to the woman, Did God really say, You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?...You shall not surely die!
[102]  As the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness 2 Cor 11:3 .
[103]  When the devil works, he uses not only persons, things, and matters but also craftiness.
[104]  Despite the fact that the Lord carried out and accomplished God s judgment against the devil on the cross by abolishing his authority, position, and power, the devil will be cast to the ground only at the end of this age when he is dealt with by the overcomers in the church and the angels who did not rebel in heaven vv.
[105]  Who delivered us out of the authority of darkness Col 1:13; see also Acts 26:18 .
[106]  God saves believers out of the devil s kingdom and delivers them out of the authority of darkness so that they are no longer tyrannized by him.
[107]  He who has been begotten of God keeps himself, and the evil one does not touch him 1 John 5:18 .
[108]  If we let God s word of life abide in us and accomplish its life-giving effect in us, we will overcome the evil one, the devil.
[109]  If we live in the church, the Body of Christ, and put on the whole armor of God with all the saints in order to stand against the devil, we will overcome him and bring in the kingdom of God.
[110]  CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR THE WORLD OUTLINE The terms for the world.
[111]  We have studied the topic of the devil, and now we must study the topic of the world because the world is related to the devil.
[112]  The created things of the earth were ordained by God so that man could live for Him, but the systematized things of the world were ordered by Satan to usurp man so that man could not live for God.
[113]  The whole world lies in the evil one ; The ruler of this world kosmos ; The world aion -rulers of this darkness 1 John 5:19; John 12:31; Eph 6:12 .
[114]  Who gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age Gal 1:4 .
[115]  The Lord gave Himself for our sins not merely to save us from our sins but also to rescue us out of the present evil age aion , which is the world that appears before our eyes.
[116]  In the Lord s salvation we were rescued from the evil age that is in opposition to God.
[117]  CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE SIN OUTLINE The originator of sin.
[118]  THE SOLUTION TO SIN The Record of Sin Being Dealt with
[119]  The Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
[120]  In order to deal with our record of sins and our sinful nature, Christ carried our sins to the cross and bore God s righteous judgment on our behalf as the Lamb of God.
[121]  The goat on which the lot for Azazel fell shall be made to stand alive before Jehovah to make expiation over it, that it may be sent away for Azazel into the wilderness ; Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel and all their transgressions, even all their sins; and he shall put them on the head of the goat, and shall send it away into the wilderness...Thus the goat shall bear away all their iniquities on itself to a solitary land Lev 16:10, 21-22 .
[122]  Christ solved the problem of our sinful record by bearing our sin in His body, but sin itself was sent back to the devil for him to bear forever.
[123]  The goat that was killed and offered to God typifies Christ being killed for us, redeeming us from our sins, and being offered to God.
[124]  On the one hand, our sinful record was resolved before God by Christ, who died and shed His blood for us, according to God s righteous requirement, and on the other hand, sin itself was given back to its source, the devil, for him to bear forever.
[125]  The meaning of death: The death of the spirit.
[126]  The first suffering of death is related to the death of the spirit.
[127]  Just as our ears can understand and contact sound and our eyes can differentiate and contact color, the human spirit can know and understand matters concerning God and fellowship with God.
[128]  However, man s spirit was deadened, and it lost the function and blessing of knowing and contacting God.
[129]  The fourth aspect related to the suffering of death is that of the entire person spirit and soul and body being thrown into the lake of fire to suffer for eternity.
[130]  The entire person of those who are not saved will be resurrected, pass through God s judgment, and then be thrown into the lake of fire to suffer the second death, which is to suffer in the lake of fire eternally.
[131]  Death, the last enemy, is being abolished 1 Cor 15:26 .
[132]  Since the devil is God s enemy, death is also God s enemy.
[133]  Just as death includes several aspects in regard to its meaning, there are several aspects of resurrection in regard to its meaning.
[134]  When God raised Christ from the dead, He raised us up together with Him.
[135]  On the first day of the week ; The day after the Sabbath Mark 16:9; Lev 23:11 .
[136]  The Firstborn from the dead ; Which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies...and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body Col 1:18; Eph 1:20, 22-23 .
[137]  CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN JUDGMENT OUTLINE The judgment on the cross: The time approximately A.D. 30.
[138]  According to the Bible, God s first judgment on man was at the cross of Christ.
[139]  Man s sins were judged by God on the cross so that He could forgive and save man.
[140]  Without judging man s sins, God, as the Ruler of man, would have no way to forgive or save man.
[141]  If Christ had not borne God s righteous governmental judgment on our behalf and had not satisfied God s righteous requirement on our behalf, God would have had no way to forgive us or save us.
[142]  That we might become the righteousness of God in Him 2 Cor 5:21 .
[143]  We will no longer be judged by God for our sin, and we are completely pleasing to God.
[144]  Since God caused Christ to bear our sins on the cross and to be condemned on our behalf, receiving God s judgment on our behalf, He will not condemn or judge those who have believed into Christ.
[145]  Since Christ bore God s righteous judgment for us, fulfilling His righteousness and satisfying His righteous requirement, according to God s righteousness, we cannot be judged by Him again.
[146]  A fornicator or a covetous man or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or a rapacious man 1 Cor 5:11 .
[147]  The church s judgment of sinning believers is based on blatant sins committed by a believer.
[148]  The basis for the church to judge believers is related to their committing any of these blatant, gross sins and refusing to repent and deal with them.
[149]  The result of the church s judgment on a sinning believer is to remove the sinning and unrepentant believer from the church and to cut off his fellowship with the church.
[150]  The Basis the Father s Love and Good Pleasure
[151]  What son is there whom the father does not discipline?
[152]  God s disciplinary judgment on the believers is based upon His love.
[153]  Therefore, before God judges the world, He will exercise His discipline to punish and judge His children, as indicated in 1 Peter 4:17, which says that God s judgment begins from the house of God.
[154]  The sins of a believer, which occurred before salvation, were judged in the first judgment of God at the cross of Christ; after a believer s salvation, God continues to exercise judgment upon a believer s sins through the church and through His discipline in order to correct the believers.
[155]  Until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then there will be praise to each from God 1 Cor 4:5 .
[156]  The believers actions and work will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ when Christ returns at the end of the church age.
[157]  He will judge us according to our motives and actions so that we will receive praise from God according to our true condition.
[158]  At the judgment seat Christ will judge from His position of God, as God who is our Judge, just as He will later be the Judge at the throne of His glory and at the great white throne.
[159]  Each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad 2 Cor 5:10; see also Rev 22:12; Matt 16:27 .
[160]  The Lord s judgment of us before His judgment seat will be based on our actions after we were saved.
[161]  There the Lord will judge us according to what we have practiced, whether good or bad, and He will repay us according to His judgment.
[162]  When the Son of Man comes...He will sit on the throne of His glory Matt 25:31 .
[163]  The fifth judgment will occur when the Lord returns.
[164]  Following Christ s return, He will come to the earth and sit on His throne of glory to judge all the people from the nations living on the earth at that time.
[165]  Then the King will say to those on His right hand...inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world...He will say also to those on the left, Go away from Me...into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels...And these shall go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life Matt 25:34, 41, 46 .
[166]  When the living nations are judged before Christ s throne of glory, some will enter into eternal life, and others will go away into eternal punishment.
[167]  Obtaining eternal life means that, on the one hand, God s life enters into us when we believe in Christ, and on the other hand, we enter into eternal life when the Lord returns; that is, we will inherit eternal life in eternity Mark 10:30; Matt 19:29 .
[168]  The judgment before the great white throne perhaps will take place in the air because by then the heaven and earth will have fled away, and no place will be found for them Rev 20:11 .
[169]  In the church, the house of God, believers can receive the judgment of the church related to blatant and unrepentant sins and can also receive God s judgment of discipline in order to partake of and manifest His holiness.
[170]  CHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHT PARADISE AND THE LAKE OF FIRE OUTLINE Paradise: The pleasant section in Hades being Paradise: The spirits and souls of the righteous being in the pleasant section.
[171]  The Lord Jesus being in the pleasant section for three days and three nights after His death.
[172]  Paul going to the pleasant section in a vision.
[173]  for Three Days and Three Nights after His Death
[174]  The city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God ; A better country, that is, a heavenly one Heb 11:10, 16 .
[175]  The first verse speaks of a city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God.
[176]  This is the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem 12:22 , the Jerusalem above Gal 4:26 , the holy city, New Jerusalem Rev 21:2; 3:12 , which God has prepared for His people Heb 11:16 , and the tabernacle of God, in which God will dwell with men for eternity Rev 21:3 .
[177]  A man in Christ...was caught away to the third heaven 2 Cor 12:2 .
[178]  Gehenna is the Hebrew name for a deep valley near Jerusalem called Ge Hinnom, valley of Hinnom.
[179]  It is also called Topheth 2 Kings 23:10; Isa 30:33; Jer 19:13 .
[180]  CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE THE RAPTURE OF THE BELIEVERS OUTLINE The rapture of the overcoming believers: The need.
[181]  Be watchful at every time, beseeching that you would prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen and stand before the Son of Man Luke 21:36 .
[182]  Luke 21:36 is a promise from the Lord to those who are in need of being raptured to escape the tribulations that will come upon the earth.
[183]  In verses 25 and 26, the Lord spoke of the terrible tribulations coming upon the earth, and in verses 34 and 35, He spoke of the difficulty in escaping them.
[184]  To be watchful at every time is to be careful and alert so that one s heart is not dragged down by debauchery, drunkenness, and the anxieties of life v. 34 . To beseech constantly is to approach the Lord and ask Him for an escape from the coming tribulations.
[185]  If we do these things, the Lord will consider us worthy to escape the tribulations that are coming upon the earth, and we will stand before the Son of Man, which means we will be raptured to His presence.
[186]  Third, the overcoming believers who are watching constantly and praying always as they live before the Lord will be counted worthy of escaping the coming tribulation and of being raptured to the Lord s presence; that is, they will be raptured to the Lord s presence before the great tribulation.
[187]  So also will the coming of the Son of Man be.
[188]  I also will keep you out of the hour of trial Rev 3:10 .
[189]  Since the overcoming believers are kept out of the hour of trial by rapture, this rapture must occur before the hour of trial, that is, before the great tribulation.
[190]  Now let us consider the rapture of the majority of the believers.
[191]  The rapture of the majority of the believers involves God s reaping of His harvest on earth.
[192]  The believers are God s crop on the earth that has grown out of the seed that the Lord sowed while He was on the earth Matt 13:24-30, 36-43 .
[193]  CHAPTER SIXTY THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST OUTLINE The promise of the second coming.
[194]  The second coming fulfilling the needs of the believers, the Jews, and the nations: Concerning the believers.
[195]  All Israel will be saved, as it is written, The Deliverer will come out of Zion; He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob Rom 11:26; see also Zech 12:10; 13:1 .
[196]  Although the Jews are God s chosen people, they have strayed far from God.
[197]  Jesus...will come in the same way as you beheld Him going into heaven Acts 1:11 .
[198]  This shows that the Lord s second coming will be an actual coming; it is not just a figure of speech.
[199]  For example, some have said that the Lord s second coming refers to the soul and spirit of a believer seeing the Lord when he dies.
[200]  If the householder had known in which watch the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into ; If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief Matt 24:43; Rev 3:3; see also 16:15 .
[201]  One aspect of the Lord s second coming involves a coming that is hidden and secret, like the coming of a thief in the night.
[202]  The hidden and secret aspect of the Lord s second coming occurs before the beginning of the great tribulation; it is not related to His manifestation at the end of the great tribulation.
[203]  THE PLACE OF THE SECOND COMING The Hidden Aspect
[204]  In the clouds...in the air 1 Thes 4:17; see also Psa 18:9, 11 .
[205]  The Lord will return to the clouds in the air during the hidden aspect of His coming.
[206]  Before the Lord descends to the clouds in the air, He will rapture the overcomers to God s throne in the heavens Rev 12:5 .
