   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE AWAITING CHRIST FOR THE TRANSFIGURATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF OUR BODY Scripture Reading: Phil 3:17-21</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to have an adequate understanding of 3:17-21, we need to know Paul s basic thought in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This requires experience and insight.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>PAUL S BASIC THOUGHT</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In chapters one and two Paul s intention was to have communication, fellowship, between him and the believers in Philippi that he might share his experience of Christ so that the believers might be encouraged to have a full participation in his enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the beginning of chapter three, Paul changes his emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although it is rather difficult to trace Paul s thought in this chapter, my burden in this message is to consider Paul s basic concept in Philippians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we read this chapter carefully, we shall see that Paul refers to two groups of people who were exerting a strong influence in the Mediterranean area.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first group was the Judaizers, the Jewish religionists, who were zealous for their traditional religion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 2 Paul speaks of them as dogs, evil workers, the concision.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The second group consisted of those who held to the Epicurean philosophy, which promoted indulgence in the pleasure of eating and drinking and self-gratification in other things, all of which are contrary to the cross of Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From verse 2 we see that Judaizers were causing damage to the Philippian believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From verse 18 we see that those who practiced according to the Epicureans were also causing damage to them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The former was of Jewish origin; the latter, of a heathen source.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul s underlying thought in this chapter is related to these two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we shall see, in speaking of the Judaizers, Paul deals with the soul, especially with the mind, but in speaking of the Epicureans, he deals with the body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Judaizers did not promote the enjoyment of material things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, they zealously promoted their particular religious philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Both religion and philosophy involve the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For the most part, religious people and philosophical people are not occupied with material things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They do not care to indulge themselves in such things as eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the contrary, they may even restrict themselves in these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we have pointed out, the things to which Paul refers in verses 3 through 7 are not material things, but things related to religion, philosophy, and culture, things which have much to do with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The believers in Philippi had been saved and regenerated in spirit, but there was still the need for them to care for their soul and body in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As Paul was writing chapter three, deep within him was the intention to give certain instructions to the Philippian believers concerning how to deal with the soul and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, he first spoke of the Judaizers in order to edify the Philippians in dealing with the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then he referred to the Epicureans in order to instruct the believers in dealing with the body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>TRANSFORMATION AND THE RENEWING OF THE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we would deal with the soul, we need to count as refuse all religious matters, philosophical things, and cultural elements.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The main ingredients of religion, philosophy, and culture are things which appeal to thoughtful people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This indicates that religion, philosophy, and culture are intimately related to the soul and to the psychological world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the past we have spoken very much about transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We even have a hymn on the subject of transformation Hymns, #750 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, it is still possible that many do not realize that transformation involves the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to Romans 12:2, the renewing of the mind is a basic aspect of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The transformation of our soul depends to a great extent on the renewing of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If our mind is not renewed, our soul will remain unchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To say that our mind is renewed means that a change has taken place in our way of thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The thoughts of many believers are still occupied with religious, philosophical, and cultural things, the very things mentioned by Paul in 3:7 and 8.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These matters are related to the psychological world, to the world of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many are also taken over by a natural way of thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Such saints may be good, but they are the same in soul today as they were many years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A primary reason for our lack of transformation is that a huge rock, the rock of national characteristics, is occupying our soul, taking the place that belongs to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the case of every one of us, national characteristics occupy our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our soul has been taken over by this rock.</S>
