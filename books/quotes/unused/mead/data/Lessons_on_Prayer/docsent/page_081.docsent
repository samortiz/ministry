   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN FASTING AND PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christians are very familiar with the matter of fasting in prayer, but unfortunately, many misunderstand its meaning and treat it as a common thing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I am afraid that there are not many who really know what it means to fast and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now let us come to the Bible and take a good look into this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the Bible first mentions prayer, it does not speak of the need to fast.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You do not see either Noah or Abraham praying with fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The case of Moses is somewhat different.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible does not explicitly say that he fasted and prayed, but it seems certain that he did when he went up to God on Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From that time onward, the Bible frequently mentions the matter of fasting in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Especially in the New Testament, it is very evident that fasting is greatly related to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first man who fasted in the New Testament was John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Matthew 11:18 says "John came neither eating nor drinking."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Of course, that does not mean that John fasted absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It means that he took no part in the worldly enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the one hand, John neither ate nor drank, and on the other hand he still ate "locusts and wild honey" Matt 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In any case, he should be listed among those who fasted.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the New Testament record, the second person who fasted was the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Lord first came forth to minister, He fasted before God for forty days.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Later, in His teaching, He also spoke something about fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He said that while He was with the disciples they did not need to fast, but when He would be taken away from them, they would have to fast Mark 2:18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He also said that some demons cannot be cast out by prayer alone Matt 17:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>So by the example of the Lord Jesus, we can see that He was a real fasting One.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the same time, His teachings show us what fasting actually is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later on, the Bible shows us that during the apostolic age, the Apostles often fasted and prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Acts 13 gives a very clear record of five prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch who fasted and prayed while they ministered to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In particular, when two among them were to be sent to the Gentiles, they fasted and prayed before sending them away.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may say that the record of fasting reaches its climax in Acts 13.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have very briefly pointed out the relationship between fasting and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From these records we can actually see what the relationship is between fasting and prayer, or what is the meaning of fasting in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I. FASTING IS THE SPONTANEOUS EXPRESSION OF MAN RECEIVING GREAT RESPONSIBILITY</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First, fasting is a spontaneous expression as man receives a great responsibility before God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At such a time, man will spontaneously fast.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The experiences in our human life also substantiate this point.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Often when we encounter an important matter in the course of our human living, we become unable to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>True, some matters can make us happy and cause us to eat more, but other matters may press us to a point that we simply cannot eat.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because the matter which we encounter is so great and the responsibility so heavy, we spontaneously lose our appetite for food.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, when the matter is taken care of and the responsibility discharged, we feel relieved and our appetite returns for normal eating.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Likewise, as we receive a great matter from God, we are so burdened within that we fast without purposing to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because Moses received a great responsibility from God on Mount Sinai, he was unable to eat for forty days.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Later on, as the Lord Jesus came forth to minister, having received great responsibility, he was also unable to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This does not mean that He actually could not eat.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It means that He had no heart to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It was as if there were no room in Him to contain food.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Acts 13, a tremendous responsibility was placed upon the prophets and teachers in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, they spontaneously fasted and prayed in order to spare their whole being any distraction from that responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the first meaning of fasting.</S>
