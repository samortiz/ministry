   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Now we need to ask where Christ is today.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to answer strongly, "Christ is in us!"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ has been located.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before Christ became a man, He was merely the universal, omnipresent God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But when He became a man, He became located.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before His incarnation, He was like a bird soaring everywhere in the air, but through His incarnation, He entered into a cage.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He became located.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Jesus was caged, limited.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When He was in Jerusalem, He could not be in Galilee at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was caged in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before we were saved, we were soaring, wandering everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I can testify that I was once wandering everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But one day when I was nineteen years old, I believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At that time, I was caged.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The cage into which Christ entered was the flesh, the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The cage into which we believers have entered is a wonderful cage.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This cage is Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Positionally, we are in Christ, but at times in our experience we get out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes the enemy comes to open the door of the cage.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then we are released.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we get mad, we are out of the cage.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ was caged when He united Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We were caged when we were united with God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Christian theology, this is known as identification, but in our teaching, we do not usually use the term identification.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead, we use the terms union and mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Mingling is deeper than union.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the incarnation, God not only united Himself with man but also mingled Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If I clasp my hands together, my hands are in union with each other, but mingling is much more than this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When one item is grafted to another, the result is mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes in surgery, skin is taken from one part of a person's body and grafted to another part.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, the two pieces of skin are not only united but also mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When a branch from one tree is grafted to another tree, they are mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the same way, God was mingled with man in incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then in Christ's resurrection, man was mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why the New Testament tells us that we were crucified with Christ Gal 2:20a and were resurrected with Christ Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Through Christ's death and resurrection we were not only united to Christ, to God, but also mingled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In our recent life-study of the book of Jeremiah, I pointed out that in God's new covenant Jer 31:33-34 , we have been made God in His nature and in His life, but not in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is because we have been begotten of God John 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Dogs beget dogs; lions beget lions; and man begets man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since your father is a man, and you are born of him, are you not a man?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As believers in Christ, we have been born of God; we have been regenerated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God is our Father, and we are His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since our Father is God, what are we, the sons?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The sons must be the same as their Father in life and in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have been born of God to be the children of God 1 John 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually, when Christ comes, He will make us fully the same as God in life and in nature v. 2 . However, none of us are or can be God in His Godhead as an object of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In a family, only the father has the fatherhood.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The children of the father do not have his fatherhood.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is only one father with many children.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The father is human, and the children also are human, but there is only one father.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the same way, God is our unique Father; only He has the divine fatherhood.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But we as His children are the same as He is in life and in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The early church fathers used the term deification to describe the believers' participation in the divine life and nature of God, but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We human beings need to be deified, to be made like God in life and in nature, but it is a great heresy to say that we are made like God in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are God not in His Godhead, but in His life, nature, element, essence, and image.</S>
