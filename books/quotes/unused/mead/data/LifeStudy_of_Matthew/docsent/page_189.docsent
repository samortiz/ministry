   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>APPLICATION OF THE REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND VISION CONCERNING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Unless we receive light from the Lord, it is difficult to see the connection between verses 1 through 23 and verses 24 through 27.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 17:24-27 we have the matter of paying the half-shekel to the poll-tax gatherers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a test to determine whether or not we know how to apply the revelation and vision concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In chapter sixteen Peter received a clear revelation from the heavenly Father regarding Christ as the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From that time onward, Peter was certain that Christ was the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Following this, on the mountaintop he saw a vision of Christ manifested as the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, he both received the revelation and saw the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is possible to have a revelation without having a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What Peter received from the heavenly Father in chapter sixteen was merely the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In chapter seventeen he saw the Son of God manifested and expressed through the man Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nothing could have been more clear than this revelation and vision.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Peter, however, had to be tested regarding the application of the revelation and the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To receive the revelation and to see the vision is one thing, but to apply them in a practical way is another.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, we probably all have received the revelation from Galatians 2:20 that we have been crucified with Christ and that Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Perhaps even the weakest one among us has received this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, when your wife or husband gives you a difficult time, can you still say, It is not I, but Christ ?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When you are with your wife or husband, the revelation of having been crucified with Christ and of Christ living in you may vanish.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Very few who have received this revelation apply it to the practical matters in their daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Peter might have been like this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He might have said, I have received the revelation that Jesus is the Son of the living God, and I saw Him transfigured on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is very clear to me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Perhaps you have not seen this vision, but I have.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For Peter to receive the revelation and see the vision was wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But now he had to be tested by those who collected the poll tax.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A. Peter s Natural Concept</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 24 says, And when they came to Capernaum, those who received the half-shekel came to Peter and said, Does not your teacher pay the half-shekel?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The half-shekel was a Jewish poll tax for the temple Exo 30:12-16; 38:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Peter was asked this question, he immediately said, Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Peter did not know how to apply the revelation and the vision, and he was exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the mount of transfiguration, Peter heard the voice from heaven charging him to hear Christ 17:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If he had still remembered what had taken place on the mountain, he would have referred the question to Christ to hear what He would say.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But instead of listening to Christ, he gave his own answer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the mountain Peter heard the Father say, This is My beloved Son, in Whom I delight; hear Him!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At that time, Peter talked too much, and he was rebuked for it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now when the poll-tax gatherers asked him whether or not the Lord paid the half-shekel, he still had too much to say and did not hesitate to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If he had learned the lesson, he would have said, Gentlemen, let me go to Him and hear Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I need to ask Him whether or not He pays the half-shekel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I don t have the right to say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Peter, however, did not respond this way, and he was exposed by this test.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After a conference or training, we may proclaim that we shall never be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But I assure you that after you return home, you will be exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, do not let this disappoint you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>B. Christ s Correction</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verses 25 and 26 say, And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said to him, Then the sons are free.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The poll-tax gatherers came to Peter because he was so prominent, like the nose on our face.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The quick ones, the bold ones, are the nose in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whenever the church undergoes a test, the nose is the part that gets hurt because it is the first to bump into things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because he stood out so much, Peter got into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After telling the tax gatherers that the Lord Jesus paid the half-shekel, Peter came into the house.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But as verse 25 says, Jesus anticipated him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Peter was quick, but the Lord was sovereign and did not give him a chance to say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the mountaintop Peter was interrupted by a voice from heaven, and in the house he was stopped by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Peter had spoken presumptuously.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hence, the Lord stopped him and corrected him before he could speak to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord asked Peter whether the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax from their sons or from strangers.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The sons of kings are always free from paying custom or poll tax.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The half-shekel was paid by God s people for His temple.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Since Christ is the Son of God, He was free from paying it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This was contrary to what Peter had just answered.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Peter had received the revelation concerning Christ being the Son of God 16:16-17 and he had seen the vision of the Son of God 17:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now, in application, he was put to the test by the poll-tax gatherers question.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He failed in his answer by forgetting the revelation he had received and the vision he had seen.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He forgot that the Lord was the Son of God who did not need to pay the poll tax for His Father s house.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When the Lord asked Peter whether the kings of the earth received tax from their sons or from strangers, Peter answered, From strangers.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Doctrinally and theologically Peter answered correctly.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When the Lord said to him, Then the sons are free, Peter must have been stunned.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It seems that the Lord was saying, Peter, have you forgotten the revelation that I am the Son?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>On the mountaintop you saw Me as the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The half-shekel was not a tax paid to the secular government.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It was collected for the purpose of meeting the expenses of the temple of God, God s house on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>According to Exodus 30 and 38, every Israelite had to pay a half-shekel to care for the Lord s house.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Because Jesus is the Son of God, there is no need for Him to pay this tax.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When the Lord said that the sons are free, He was indicating that He, as the Son of God, was free from paying the poll tax.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>After hearing this, Peter did not know what to say.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He might have just agreed and said, Yes, the sons are free.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Since You are the Son of God, You are free.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Lord, I am sorry for answering the way I did.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I forgot the revelation and the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I received the revelation that You are the Son of God, and I saw the vision of You as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But when the test came, I forgot all about it.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Lord, please forgive me.</S>
