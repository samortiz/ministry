   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a To Water, Quench Thirst, and Flow Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This river was made to water the garden that the garden might grow things of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Surely it also quenched man's thirst that he might survive.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All this means that this river caused life to flow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In our physical life we must drink enough water to maintain the circulation of our blood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The flow of our physical life depends on water.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Likewise, day by day we must take the water of life to maintain the flow of the divine life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This gives us the spiritual circulation of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>b Flowing out of Eden</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The river flows out of Eden, meaning that it flows out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Revelation 22, the river of the water of life proceeds out of the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is also a flow out of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God as the very life is the source of the living water, flowing into us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>c One River Becoming Four Heads</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This river is one river.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do you have two rivers?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although the believers here may number a thousand, we still have one river because we all are of the same source God the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since the source is one, the course also must be one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This one river was parted and became four heads Gen 2:10-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that the river flows out of God as the source and the center to reach men in every direction.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Bible the number one is the number of God, the Creator, for He is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The number four signifies man, the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because men live in each of the four directions, the one river flows out of God in every direction to reach them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>1 The First Head</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The name of the first head is Pison, which means "flowing free" cf.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Isa 55:1; Rev 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This river flows without price; it is free.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It flows to the land of Havilah which means "to cause to grow."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This branch of the river flows freely to cause everything of life to grow cf.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>47:9, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This flowing also brings in gold, which typifies the divine nature cf.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you have had no experience, you will not understand what this means; if you have had some experience you will say, "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whenever the life of God flows within us, it brings in gold, the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the previous message I said that I do not like to be a man of gold but a man of dust because gold does not grow life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the sense of growing life, it is very good to be a man of dust.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, we need the element of gold to be added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eventually, we will be men of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul warns us to be careful about our building work, telling us to use the proper materials, the first of which is gold.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, in Revelation 1 we are told that the churches are golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The lampstands are not built with clay, but with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Romans 9 we are dust; in Revelation 1 we are gold.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How can dust be replaced by gold?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The divine life must flow within us to bring gold into us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is even true of physical gold which frequently is found at or in a river.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before we experienced Christ as the flowing life, we had no divine nature, no gold.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now through the flowing of the divine life we have some gold within us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Something precious and weighty, the very divine nature, has been brought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The flowing of the river also produces pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At present, we do not have time to cover the definition of pearl except to say that it is a transformed substance.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It typifies the regenerated new man cf.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Matt 13:45 because pearl is not a created element but a transformed substance.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, the flowing of the river brings forth onyx stone, which typifies the transformed man expressing God's glorious image cf.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rev 4:3; 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We will see more of this in the following message.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The first head, Pison, means that the river of life flows freely, making everything grow and bringing in three kinds of precious material gold, pearl, and precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we read through the entire Bible, we will see that these materials are all found in the building of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The materials brought in through the flow of the river of life are for the building of God's habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They can only be brought in by the flow of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In other words, the divine life flowing within us makes us the materials for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the meaning and significance of the first head of the river.</S>
