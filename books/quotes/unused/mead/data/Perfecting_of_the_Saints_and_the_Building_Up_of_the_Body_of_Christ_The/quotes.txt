[1]  The Perfecting of the Saints and the Building Up of the Body of Christ CONTENTS
[2]  The Saints' Direct Building Up of the Body of Christ
[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE GIFTS PERFECTING THE SAINTS Scripture Reading: Eph 4:7-13 OUTLINE The gifts given by the ascended Head who fills all things vv.
[4]  12-13: That the saints may participate in the work of the New Testament ministry, which is the building up of the Body of Christ v. 12.
[5]  After Christ s ascension, He gave many gifts to the church.
[6]  Last week at the elders and co-workers training, my first message covered the basic qualifications of an apostle: first, he must have the revelation of God s New Testament economy concerning Christ and the church Matt 16:16-18; Gal 1:11-12, 15-16; Eph 3:3-4, 8-11; 5:32 ; second, he must be able to preach the gospel of Christ and lead the chosen and called sinners to Him Gal 1:16a; Eph 3:8; 2 Cor 11:2 ; third, he must be able to raise up local churches and to appoint elders to lead, shepherd, teach, and oversee these churches Acts 14:23; 1 Tim 5:17; 1 Pet 5:2 ; fourth, he must be able to define doctrines, open up the truth, perfect the saints, and build up the Body of Christ 1 Tim 2:7; Eph 4:11-12 .
[7]  Daily they lead, feed, and teach the saints with the goal that the saints would be perfected to do the work of the ministry, which is the work of the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.
[8]  This work of the building up of the Body of Christ, when considered separately, involves first, the preaching of the gospel to bring people to the Lord.
[9]  In order to lead the saints to grow into the measure of this stature of the fullness of Christ, we need to help them to grow in life so that they would hold fast the faith and would lay hold of their knowledge of Christ, giving up all the minor and shallower doctrines and concepts that cause division.
[10]  We also make everyone an apostle who knows the revelation, is able to preach the gospel of Christ, can lead the sinners to Him, can raise up a small meeting to express the Lord, and can even define doctrines, release the truth, perfect the saints, and build up the Body of Christ.
[11]  OF THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 4:11-16 OUTLINE By the gifts perfecting vv.
[12]  The church as the Body of Christ expressing Christ.
[13]  Growing up into the Head, Christ, in all things v. 15b: Being subject to the Head, Christ.
[14]  Out from the Head, all the Body causes the growth of the Body of Christ v. 16a: Through every joint of the supply all the particular gifts in the Body of Christ.
[15]  By His death and resurrection, Christ has conquered Satan and death and has rescued man from the enslaving of Satan.
[16]  In His ascension, He made these redeemed sinners the gifts through His resurrection life and gave them to the Body that they would do the perfecting work on the saints unto the building up of the Body of Christ.
[17]  Praise the Lord that through His riches in His ascension, the ascended Head gained a group of people from His redeemed ones and constituted them the gifts, putting them in the church to perfect us.
[18]  After we were saved, God put us in the church for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[19]  However, if we remain in the proper church life and receive the perfecting mentioned in Ephesians 4:11-13, growing up in the divine life to be a full-grown man, having the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and being no longer babes, we will not be deceived and will not be tossed by the craftiness of Satan.
[20]  When these three winds blow among us, they produce three waves which cause difficulties among us.
[21]  Anyone who is swept into these proves that he is childish in Christ and immature in life.
[22]  When we hold to truth in the love of God, we will grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ Eph 4:15 .
[23]  In everything big or small, such as the way we dress, the way we comb our hair, the way we shop, and the way we speak, we should take Christ as the Head, submitting under His headship.
[24]  When we allow Him to be the Head in everything and when we grow up into Him in all things, we, being supplied with the riches of His life, will receive something from Him to transfuse into other members of the Body.
[25]  CHAPTER THREE INTO THE HEAD AND OUT FROM THE HEAD Scripture Reading: Eph 4:15-16; 3:8-10; 1:10, 22-23; 5:23; 1 Cor 11:3 OUTLINE Growing into the Head Eph 4:15: Holding to truth: In love in the element and sphere of the divine love.
[26]  To have the church as the Body of Christ, the expression of fullness Eph 3:10; 1:23.
[27]  Out from the Head Eph 4:16: All the Body causes the growth of the Body of Christ: Through every joint of the rich supply: Every specially gifted part in the Body of Christ.
[28]  Verse 15 says, But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.
[29]  Today, if we want to build up the Body of Christ, we must love God, Christ, and the church in the love with which God loves us and in the love which He put within us.
[30]  In this true God there are three things: the economy of God, the Christ of God, and the Body of Christ, the church.
[31]  In short, He arranged to create the heavens and the earth and to create man according to His image and likeness that man would be like Him, be His vessel, and be prepared for the day when the Creator God would enter into man to be mingled with man, to become the many members of Christ, and to constitute the Body of Christ to express Christ, which is to express the Triune God in Christ.
[32]  To hold to truth is for the purpose of growing into the Head, Christ.
[33]  According to our experience, the growth here is not our growth, but it is the growth of Christ within us.
[34]  After we believed in the Lord and began to love Him, we began to decrease, and Christ began to increase within us.
[35]  When we grow into Christ in all things big or small, and when we become men in Christ enjoying Him, we will spontaneously have something originating from Him that is for the building up of His Body.
[36]  CHAPTER FOUR LIFE AND SERVICE IN THE NEW WAY OUTLINE Life: Being revived every morning: But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day Prov 4:18, RSV .
[37]  The steadfast love of the Lord...his mercies... are new every morning....The Lord is my portion...therefore I will hope in him Lam 3:22-24, RSV .
[38]  In 2 Corinthians 4:16 Paul says that our inward man is being renewed day by day.
[39]  Then you have to help him to know how to call on the Lord, how to pray-read the Lord s Word, how to have fellowship with the Lord, how to love the Lord, how to remember the Lord by breaking bread, how to consecrate himself, etc. You must help him item by item.
[40]  The second item of service in the new way is also a very difficult thing.
