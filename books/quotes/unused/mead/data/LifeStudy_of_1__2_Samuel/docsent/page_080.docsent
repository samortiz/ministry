   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Chapter thirty tells us that David conquered the Amalekites and captured their captives.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. The Amalekites</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Conquering Ziklag and Burning It</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Amalekites had conquered Ziklag and burned it and captured all the women, including the families of David's men and his two wives vv.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>to Pursue after the Amalekites</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>and Capture Their Captives</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The soul of all the people was bitter, and they spoke of stoning David, but he "strengthened himself in Jehovah his God" v. 6b . Following this, he told Abiathar the priest to bring the ephod to him, and he inquired of Jehovah, saying, "Shall I pursue after this band? Will I overtake them?" Jehovah said to him, "Pursue, for you will certainly overtake them, and you will certainly deliver them" v. 8 . Then David and four hundred of his men pursued the Amalekites, with the assistance of a young man of Egypt who was a servant of an Amalekite.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The provision of the help from this Egyptian indicates that the details of David's environment were under God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, David conquered the Amalekites and captured their captives, delivering all that the Amalekites had taken.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Nothing was missed by them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil nor anything that they had taken; David brought everything back.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before the other cattle and of which they said, This is David's spoil" vv.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Who Had Not Been Able to Follow Him</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>David shared the spoil with the two hundred men who had not been able to follow him in pursuing the Amalekites vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>21-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Concerning this David said, "As his share is who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who stays by the baggage; they shall share alike" v. 24 . From that day forward David made this a statute and an ordinance for Israel v. 25 .</S>
