<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS LIFE<br />
FOR THE BUILDING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:11-13</h1>
<p>The Bible reveals that God wants to gain a building in the universe. God in the Son wants to mingle and build Himself into man. For this building, Christ must become everything to man, and the created and redeemed man must cooperate with God (Rev. 21&mdash;22). Christ is the content of the building, and the created and redeemed man in Christ is the expression of the building. Both the element of God and the element of man are in this building.</p>
<p>Through the type of the tabernacle we can see that God&rsquo;s dwelling place is altogether a matter of wood being overlaid with gold, of man being mingled with God. The overlaying of wood with gold, of man being mingled with God, is a matter of Christ as our life. In the Holy Place&mdash;apart from the foundation of silver sockets that refers to redemption&mdash;the table of the bread of the Presence (Exo. 25:23-28), the golden incense altar (30:1-5), and the standing boards (26:15, 29) were all made of wood overlaid with gold. This signifies Christ being in man to be man&rsquo;s life. Furthermore, everything in the Holy of Holies refers to Christ being in man as life in a deeper, more hidden way. Although Christ as life is present in the Holy Place, our experience of this life is not deep or hidden. Once we enter into the Holy of Holies, however, we not only have Christ as life but Christ Himself. All the items in the Holy of Holies typify Christ Himself.</p>
<p>Although we may have heard such a message before, I am concerned that we lack experience in these matters. Hence, this chapter will consider, from the practical, experiential side, how to have the genuine building in the church through Christ as life to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING GENUINE BUILDING<br />
ONLY BY EXPERIENCING GOD AS LIFE</h2>
<p>God has become life to us in His Son through the Holy Spirit. All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily (Col. 2:9), and in the Spirit, Christ can be touched, experienced, and enjoyed to become our element and to be mingled with us (1 Cor. 6:17). Although we are clear about the truth that God is in the Son and that the Son is in the Spirit, we need to focus on our practical experience. In the church there can be no building if we have only the truth; we need the truth to become our experience, to become reality to us. Merely understanding this truth does not mean that a person is built up. A person may understand these truths very well and yet not be built up. In order to be genuinely built up, we must enter into the reality of these truths.</p>
<p>We should examine ourselves concerning this matter. We may know that Christ is our life, but how much do we live in this reality in our daily living and in our church life? This is a very serious matter. When problems arise between a husband and a wife, they often are exhorted to endure, to learn lessons, and to accept the breaking. Although this is correct, we must ask the brother and sister about the life that they are living in response to these exhortations. It is right for a wife to submit to her husband and for a husband to love his wife, but if their submission and love do not come out of the life of the Son of God, they will not be built up with each other in God. The purpose of every spiritual lesson and situation of breaking is to help us live by God&rsquo;s life. If we think that we have learned some spiritual lessons and have accepted God&rsquo;s breaking but still live by our life, it is questionable whether we have truly learned any lessons or accepted any breaking.</p>
<p>If a sister lives by God&rsquo;s life, her submission will come out of Christ being in her as life. Likewise, if a brother lives by God&rsquo;s life, his endurance and acceptance of God&rsquo;s breaking will come out of Christ being in him as life. However, if a wife submits to her husband by her own life, her submission will only make her more individualistic. Similarly, if a husband endures, thoughtfully considers, and loves his wife by his own life, he will become more individualistic. Our human life expresses our self, and our self is individualistic. The more we live by our life, the more individualistic we become. Furthermore, the individuality of the self is manifested in good things as well as corrupt things. Whether good or bad, as long as the self is present, the individualism of the self will be manifested.</p>
<p>The choice between living by our life and living by Christ as our life affects not only our daily living but also our coordination with the brothers and sisters in the church. Any coordination that comes out of our life will not last. In order for our coordination to be lasting, it must come out of God&rsquo;s life. Only God&rsquo;s life is eternal, and only coordination in God&rsquo;s life is lasting and eternal.</p>
<p>Some brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; coordination in the church seems to be very good in the beginning; that is, they bear responsibility and are willing to be restricted. Nevertheless, it is easy for such coordination to stop when a problem arises. Such a situation shows that there are considerable elements of our own life, rather than God&rsquo;s life, in our coordination. If we have learned the lessons of living by the life of God, we will be able to be coordinated and built up with others.</p>
<p>Often we have a problem in coordinating with others because they do not match our preferences or way of coordination. The problem, however, is not with them, but with the fact that we are living by our life. If we learn to live by Christ as our life, our coordination will not be affected by any weaknesses or faults in the brothers and sisters; it will not even be affected by our own natural preferences or ways. Although we may see some faults, shortcomings, and weaknesses in the brothers and sisters, the life of Christ within us will demand and enable us to continue to coordinate with them.</p>
<p>Coordination with others according to our own life never lasts, because it is impossible for the natural man to get along with others. The relationship between a couple who have been recently married is very fresh, but after a short time it can become old. A brother once complained to me about his wife, saying, &ldquo;Before we were married, she was neat, quiet, and submissive, but soon after we were married, her true colors were revealed, and now our marriage is intolerable.&rdquo; A sister likewise complained to me about her husband, saying, &ldquo;Before we were married, he seemed to be proper in everything, but now this is not the case at all.&rdquo; Similarly, when we first entered into the church life, we felt fresh and were able to coordinate well with others. Slowly, however, our natural man came forth, and many problems arose. Our fresh feeling became stale because our living and coordination were based on our own life.</p>
<p>If we coordinate with the brothers and sisters by the life of God, we will not count their strengths or weaknesses or be concerned that they do not match our preferences or ways. We will be able to coordinate with them even when we discover a weakness. If we coordinate with others by the eternal life in us, we will not grit our teeth when we encounter those who do not match our preferences and grudgingly say, &ldquo;God has led me to coordinate with you. This is God&rsquo;s arrangement, God&rsquo;s will. I will obey and accept. The cup which the Father has given me, shall I not drink it?&rdquo; (cf. Matt. 26:42). Even if we can say this, I would still ask whether we are drinking the cup by our own life or by the life of God. If we are drinking the cup by our own life, we will quickly toss it aside. The only thing that matters is whether we are following God&rsquo;s leading and obeying His will by His life.</p>
<p>Hence, we must be persons who live by Christ as our life. We must learn rigorous lessons in all things related to abandoning our natural life and living by another life. We must know this and experience this to such an extent that even our obeying of God&rsquo;s leading and our accepting of His will come out of Christ as our life. Then we will be able to coordinate with any brother or sister, and our coordination will be lasting because it comes out of the eternal life of God.</p>
<p>This is a rigorous lesson that we need to learn. If we want to have enduring and genuine coordination through the mingling of God and man, we must enter into the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies to experience Christ as life. In the Holy Place there is the bread of the Presence, which is Christ as our life supply; the golden lampstand, which is Christ as our light; and the golden incense altar, which is Christ as our acceptable fragrance (Exo. 26:33-35; 25:30; 30:6). In the Holy of Holies the hidden manna in the Ark is Christ as our hidden inner supply; the two tablets of the law are Christ as our inner law of life, our light of life; and Aaron&rsquo;s budding rod is Christ as our authority of resurrection and the power of resurrection in us so that we may be acceptable in God&rsquo;s presence (Heb. 9:4). All these are matters of life in the Son. If we learn these lessons, it will be impossible for us not to coordinate with others. We will be able to coordinate with any of God&rsquo;s children, and our coordination will last.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> </body></html>
