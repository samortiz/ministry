   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN FROM THE GARDEN TO THE CITY Scripture Reading: S. S. 5:2-6, 8, 10, 16; 6:1-4; Isa 53:3-4; Col 1:24; Phil 3:10</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the Song of Songs is clearly divided into two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first section is mainly for the satisfaction and enjoyment of the seeking one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the first three chapters she appreciates and enjoys the Lord, and she is permeated with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the riches of the Lord are for her.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By enjoying all these things, she is transformed by steps from a company of horses to a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the natural things are gone; everything becomes spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In a sense, she attains to the maturity of life, for she is a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we were the writer of this book, we would probably stop here, because the seeking one has reached the utmost attainment of her spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But this is only the first section, which is for herself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>WORK BY GROWING</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The second section is not for her, but for the Lord and for others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this she had to be transferred from a crown to a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This involved at least three turns.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a garden she grows all the things which she had enjoyed of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>She enjoyed the Lord as the myrrh, and now she grows myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She enjoyed the Lord as the henna flower, and now she grows the henna flower.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She enjoyed the Lord as the frankincense, and now she grows the frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>She enjoyed the perfume of all the powders, and now she grows all the spices for making the powders.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the first section the Lord was everything to her, but now in the second section the Lord enjoys everything out of her.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, now the Lord enjoys all that He is through her and out of her.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In today's Christianity, most of the attention is given to the first aspect, that is, individual spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The second aspect is completely neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christians are encouraged to work for God, but are not told that the way to work for God is not by the outer working, but by the inner growth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Lord has been wrought into us, then we will grow out something, and this something will be our working.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not need to work, but we do need to grow something.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After the seeking one is transferred into the second section, she grows and produces all the items of Christ which she herself has been enjoying.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now her producing is just her work, and her producing becomes satisfaction, contentment, and enjoyment for the Lord Jesus and for all His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>LIFE NEEDS DEVELOPMENT</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some would think that all these things are far beyond our experience and therefore are too deep, but I do not believe that this is so.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In spiritual matters, it is really difficult to say what is deep and what is not deep.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not like studying a subject which is learned lesson by lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A baby has all the elements of human life, but they are not fully developed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, we should not think these things are too deep.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In a sense, many of us have experienced all of these turns already.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They simply are not yet fully developed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I believe that many of us are crowns to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are, in a sense, a crown to the Lord in our home, in our school, and at our job.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even the Lord Jesus is satisfied with us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are Solomon with the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But we still need a turn.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In spite of our high attainment, there are still some shadows, and our day has not broken.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must get ourselves to the mountain of death and the hill of resurrection and stay there for a length of time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not think that this is too deep.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all need such a turn.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Let us open ourselves before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I do believe we all have the sense that our day is not yet broken.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We all realize that there are still some shadows.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No matter how much we say, "Lord Jesus, I love You You are altogether lovely," there is still the sense that we are not clearly in the day.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is good.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As long as we have such a realization, we will spontaneously say, "Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense" 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all have such a longing deep within.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is a turn, and this is the Lord moving and working within us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>So we must learn to stay in the Lord's death and resurrection until the day breaks and all the shadows flee away.</S>
