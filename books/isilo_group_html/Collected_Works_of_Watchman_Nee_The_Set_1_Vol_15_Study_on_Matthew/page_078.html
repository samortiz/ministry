"Again" means that this verse is a continuation of the previous parable. This parable is very much related to the parable of the wicked vinedressers, which refers to God's rejecting of the Jews because they had rejected the Lord. The next parable refers to the acceptance of the Gentiles by God after He had rejected the Jews. However, not every Gentile will be saved.</P><P>Verse 2:"The kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son." "The kingdom of the heavens has become like a king." It does not say "the church," but "the kingdom of the heavens." Hence, the sphere here includes the unsaved. The church (the universal church, not the local church) includes only all the saved believers. It does not include the unsaved. (The similar parable in the book of Luke exclusively touches the matter of the gospel. The nature of the parable there is different from the nature of the one here. From this we can say that they refer to different things.) A wedding signifies the establishing of a covenant. The feast signifies the riches of God prepared for man. No bride is mentioned here because the bride is not the goal. (The church is likened to a bride only in this age. In the future the Lamb's wife will be the New Jerusalem and not the church. The Lamb's wife is a type, while the New Jerusalem is an actual description. An actual description cannot be considered a type nor can it be used to typify something else. For example, the seven golden lampstands are a type; they equal the seven churches as an actual description. The seven churches equal seven actual churches at the time.)</P><P>Verse 3:"And he sent his slaves to call those who had been called to the wedding feast, yet they would not come." The slaves refer to the disciples of the Lord and of John the Baptist. "Those who had been called" are the Israelites. God sent the slaves to invite the Israelites to come and enjoy the riches of God. Such is the ministry of the twelve apostles and the seventy disciples and of the disciples of John. "Yet they would not come." They would not believe their testimonies.</P><P>Verse 4:"Again, he sent other slaves, saying, Tell those who have been called, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatted cattle have been slain, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding feast." "Other slaves." At Pentecost the apostles and the disciples testified to the Jews the second time. They worked all the time in Jerusalem and did not even go into Samaria. Therefore, God allowed persecution to come upon them to scatter them among the Gentiles (Acts 8:1, 4). When Paul first began to work, he was the same; he worked only among the Jews until all the Jews in the diaspora [dispersion] had rejected the Lord. At that point he declared his turn to the Gentiles (Acts 13:46-48). Verse 3 only gives the call, and then in verse 4 it says, "My oxen and my fatted cattle have been slain," which means that the Lord Jesus has already died and resurrected. (The Gospel of Luke does not stress His Messiahship; hence, it does not mention this matter.)</P><P>Verses 5-6:"But they disregarded it and went off, one to his own field and another to his business, and the rest took hold of his slaves, treated them shamefully, and killed them." "Disregarded it." This was the situation at Pentecost. Although three thousand and five thousand were saved, that was still a small number. It was only a small remnant. Josephus said that the day when the Lord was crucified there were three million people in Jerusalem. "Field" signifies agriculture, whereas "business" signifies commerce. "Took hold of his slaves...and killed them." They killed Stephen, murdered James, and imprisoned the apostles (Acts 7:58-60; 12:2-4). "The rest" are those who were neither in agriculture nor in commerce. This means the chief priests, the scribes, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, etc. Both verse 4 and verse 5 were fully fulfilled.</P><P>Verse 7:"And the king became angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city." This was fulfilled in A.D. 70 when Titus destroyed Jerusalem; blood was shed all over the streets.</P><P>Verse 8:"Then he said to his slaves, The wedding feast is ready, but those who have been called were not worthy." "Those who have been called" refers to the Jews. The riches of God cannot be wasted just because of their refusal.</P><P>Verse 9:"Go therefore to the crossroads, and as many as you find, call to the wedding feast." The previous called ones were preassigned. We, the Gentiles, seem to have received our salvation by accident and by grace. "As many as you find." Whoever believes shall have eternal life; the Gentiles received the grace.</P><P>Verse 10:"And those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found, both evil and good, and the wedding feast was filled with those reclining at table." "Both evil and good." The calling today does not depend on how good or bad a person's past history was. The riches of the gospel have nothing to do with the good or evil in the past. The final goal of the gospel is the glorifying of His Son.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_077.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_079.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 15: Study on Matthew &nbsp; pg 78</div><br></body></html>
