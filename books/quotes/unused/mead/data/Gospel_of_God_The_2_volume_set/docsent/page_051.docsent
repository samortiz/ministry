   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE COMING OF CHRIST BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD'S REQUIREMENT IN RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to the earth was God's requirement in righteousness; it was not God's requirement in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is a very serious word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If there had been love without righteousness, the Lord Jesus would not have needed to come to the earth, and the cross would have been unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because of the problem of righteousness the Lord Jesus had to come.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without righteousness, God could save us any way He wants to.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He could overlook our sins, or He could forgive them lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He could take a permissive attitude toward our sins, or He could be completely unconcerned about them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If God said, "Since all have sinned, I will let you go this time; just do not sin again," there would be no need for a Jesus of Nazareth in the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Apart from the requirement of righteousness, there was no need for Jesus of Nazareth to come.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The coming of Jesus of Nazareth was a requirement of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When sin entered the world, God's government was damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His prescribed order in the universe was broken; His glory was trodden under; His holiness was profaned; His authority was rejected; and His truth was misunderstood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When sin entered the world, Satan laughed and the angels testified that man had failed and had fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If God were to judge sin mercilessly, He would be without love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if He were to let man's sins go without judging them, He would be without righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because God loves the world and, at the same time, He is righteous, He had to send the Lord Jesus to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because He is righteous, He had to judge sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because He is love, He had to bear man's sins for him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I must emphasize these two statements: God must judge because He is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And God bears man's judgment and punishment because He is love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without judgment, we see no righteousness; with judgment, we see no love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, what He did was to bear the judgment on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this way, He manifests both His love and His righteousness in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE CROSS MANIFESTING</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS AND LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the cross is where God's righteousness is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The cross shows us how much God hates sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is determined to judge sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was willing to pay such a great price as to have His Son nailed on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God was not willing to give up His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If God were willing to give up His righteousness, the cross would have been unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because God was not willing to give up His righteousness, He preferred to have His Son die rather than give up His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The cross is also the place where God's love is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The burden for our sins should be on us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do not bear it, it is unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But to bear such a burden is too much for us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For this reason, He came and bore it for us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That God was willing to bear the burden shows His love.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That God actually did bear the burden shows His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For God to have us bear the punishment is righteousness without love.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For God to have us not bear the punishment is love without righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because He takes away the punishment and bears it for us, there is both righteousness and love.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The cross meets the requirement of righteousness and the requirement of love.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our salvation today is not "backdoor merchandise"; we have not received it fraudulently or improperly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have not been saved illegally.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have been saved in a clear and definite way through judgment.</S>
