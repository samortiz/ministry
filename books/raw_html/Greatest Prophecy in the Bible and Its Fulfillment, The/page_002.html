<h1 class="title">THE GREATEST PROPHECY IN THE BIBLE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:13-16; 5:26-27; Rev. 19:7-8</h1>
<p>In this book we want to see when and how the great prophecy concerning the church will be fulfilled. Please take note of these words: <em>when</em> and <em>how.</em> We have to ask the Lord, our fellow Christians, and ourselves, &ldquo;When and how?&rdquo; In the Bible there are many prophecies, and many Bible teachers have pointed them out. In particular, G. H. Pember wrote a book on the great prophecies in the Bible. But strictly speaking, it is hard to find anyone who has pointed out that the building up of the church is a great prophecy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;I WILL BUILD MY CHURCH&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I will build My church.&rdquo; You may say that this is a promise, yet we still have to realize that this is a prophecy. Probably none of the disciples, including Peter, had ever realized that there was such a thing in the universe. Suddenly the Lord Jesus told Peter, &ldquo;I will build My church.&rdquo; At the time the Lord spoke this word, this was a great prophecy concerning the church, and it still is a great prophecy. This is because nearly twenty centuries have passed since the Lord spoke this word, yet we still cannot see that the church is fully built up. The fulfillment of this prophecy in Matthew 16:18 has not been fully realized, so even today this prophecy still remains unfulfilled.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;UNTIL WE ALL ARRIVE&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Some may say that in the book of Acts, the Lord Jesus fulfilled this prophecy by building up the church. Many Christians say that on the day of Pentecost, the Lord Jesus at least partly fulfilled His prophecy because He did build up something on that day. We need to go on, however, from the book of Acts to the Epistles to read what Paul says in Ephesians 4:13-16: &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error, but holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By reading these four verses, we can realize that there is a prophecy in them. Paul says, &ldquo;Until we all arrive&rdquo; at something. This means that at that time and even now, all the saints, including Paul, were going on and pressing on until they would all arrive. We have to consider whether or not any Christians have arrived at these three things: the oneness of the faith, a full-grown man, and the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Have we seen or can we see the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love? There are thousands of Christians, Christian groups, and so-called Christian churches, but can we see what is prophesied in Ephesians 4:13-16? We have to say no. This was not only a prophecy in the past but also a prophecy that remains unfulfilled today. Even among us, we cannot say that we have had such an arrival. What we can say is that we are pressing on. We are going on toward that goal at which we have not yet arrived. Have you ever realized that in Ephesians 4 there is a great prophecy? This prophecy is not concerning the ten horns, seven heads, seven seals, seven trumpets, or seven bowls, but just concerning one thing&mdash;the building up of the church.</p>
<p>Thank God that in these last days He has pointed this out to us. In the past a great number of Christian teachers have seen the prophecies concerning Israel, the prophecies concerning the nations, and the prophecies in a general way concerning the church, the coming millennial kingdom, and the eternal age of the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem. But in these days the Lord has pointed out to us one practical prophecy. This is not just a prophecy concerning the church in a general way but a prophecy concerning the building up of the church in a specific way. We need to emphasize <em>the building up.</em> We are talking about the building up of the church. The prophecy on the building up of the church started by the Lord in Matthew 16 is continued by the apostle Paul in Ephesians 4.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST SANCTIFYING THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In the following chapter of Ephesians, chapter 5, there is also a kind of prophecy. Here it says that Christ will sanctify the church (v. 26). This sanctification is not by the blood, because that has already happened (Heb. 13:12). The sanctifying of the church is by the washing of the water in the word, not the word of letters but the living word. In the living word, there is the living water that sanctifies and purifies the church. This living water washes away not only the dirt of the church but also the spots and wrinkles (Eph. 5:27). A person&rsquo;s face may be clean, but it can still have some spots and wrinkles. When you hurt your skin, this can leave a spot, and wrinkles come from oldness. How can the spots and the wrinkles be washed away? The precious blood of Jesus surely washes away our sins, but even this precious, prevailing, and powerful blood of Jesus Christ cannot wash away the spots and wrinkles. This is not the function of the blood. This is the function of the water of life. Only life can wash away the spots and the wrinkles. We have such a life within that can wash away these defects in a living way.</p>
<p>When we get the living word from the written Word, we experience the washing away of the spots, wrinkles, and such things so that Christ may present to Himself a glorious church, holy and without blemish. Is there such a thing today on this earth or in the heavens? There is not such a thing, but it is prophesied in Ephesians 5. Here is another prophecy about the perfecting of the church. There is a prophecy about the building up of the church in Matthew 16, and a continuation of this prophecy in Ephesians 4. In Ephesians 5 there is a prophecy of another aspect of the church, that is, of the perfecting of the church as the Body to make it holy, without blemish, and sanctified, without spot or wrinkle or any such things.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
