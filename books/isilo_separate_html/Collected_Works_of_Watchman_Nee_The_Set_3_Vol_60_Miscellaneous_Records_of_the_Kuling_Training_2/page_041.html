Is there a difference between preaching the gospel on the podium and preaching to individuals in private?</p><p>Answer: The most important lesson in preaching the gospel is to learn to cooperate with the Holy Spirit. We should follow the Holy Spirit and work as He works. The most important thing is not to act contrary to the Holy Spirit. In saving men we should not try to save only those who are easy to work on. We should also try to save those who are hard to work on. By working on the hard ones, we can learn many lessons. If we can save one who is hard, we can save others who are hard later.</p><p>Preaching in private should be the same as preaching in public, but we have to bring the sinners to the Lord. We must always bring them to their knees to pray. Once a person prays, he is brought to the Lord.</p><p>Question: Can we concentrate on only one of the five ways spoken of earlier?</p><p>Answer: Actually there are six ways to preach the gospel. The sixth way is through a living faith. This last one supplements and complements the first five ways. We can use the first five ways to preach the gospel, but in the end we have to say, "The Lord is a friend of sinners. You have to come just as you are." We should encourage those who have faith to come and encourage those who do not have faith to come as well. Those who repent can come, and those who cannot repent can come as well. Anyone can come to the Lord for help because He is a friend of sinners. As long as a sinner exercises faith to touch the Lord, he receives grace, and once the Lord grants grace to a man, he is saved.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> </body></html>
