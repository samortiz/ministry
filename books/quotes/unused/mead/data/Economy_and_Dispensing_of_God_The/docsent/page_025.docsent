   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Chapter one of the Gospel of John tells us that Christ was God in eternity past v. 1 . This very God who was the Word became incarnated to be a man v. 14 .

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ as the life-giving Spirit is dispensing life as food to His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Within our physical food there is medicine; the nourishment in the food kills the germs.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Within Christ as the food there is the real "medicine" that kills all the spiritual germs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Greek the word for spirit is pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This word can also be translated breath.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the night of His resurrection, the Lord came back to visit His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He did not give them a message or any teaching or instruction.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even the anointing is a dispensing.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In eternity past, God had only divinity; He did not have humanity, and He did not have the elements of death and resurrection.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In His incarnation He added humanity; in His crucifixion He added the element and effectiveness of death; and in His resurrection He added the divine power of resurrection.</S>
