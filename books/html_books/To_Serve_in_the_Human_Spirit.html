 <h2 class="head1">FOREWORD</h2>
 <p>As the Lord&rsquo;s children, we need a proper spiritual life. We also need the proper spiritual service. This book, which contains messages given by Witness Lee in 1963 and 1969 in Los Angeles, California, covers the three basic matters crucial to serving the Lord in the church. It shows us that for the proper Christian service we must serve in the Body, in our human spirit, and by prayer. The Bible reveals that the foundation of all genuine Christian service is the built up church. God&rsquo;s unique goal is to gain a Body for Christ. He did not regenerate us to be individual units complete in ourselves (Col. 3:15), but to be members of this unique Body (1 Cor. 12:12, 20) which is a corporate entity, a spiritual house, a holy and royal priesthood (1 Pet. 2:5, 9). Having been placed in the Body (1 Cor. 12:18), as members we must be tempered together (1 Cor. 12:24), and as living stones we must be built up together (1 Pet. 2:5). Our service should never be carried out in an independent way or in an individualistic manner, but in coordination with the other members in the Body (Rom. 12:4-5). Our service must be something <em>of</em> the Body, <em>in</em> the Body, <em>with</em> the Body, and <em>for</em> the Body. To enter into the reality and practicality of this service, growth in life is necessary. Without the growth in life the church cannot be built up (Eph. 2:21; 4:15-16), and without the built up church there cannot be the genuine service. Also, without the Holy Spirit we do not have the way to serve. However, to apply the Holy Spirit in our service, we must serve God in our human spirit (Rom. 1:9), even in newness of spirit (Rom. 7:6). When we were regenerated, we were born of the Holy Spirit in our spirit (John 3:6), and we became one spirit with the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17). From this time onward we need to live, to walk, to act, and to serve in the spirit. The main purpose of our service is to minister Christ as life to others; thus, as we serve the Lord in the Body, we must use our spirit to contact the Triune God (John 4:24). In the book of Ephesians, a book on the Body of Christ, Paul speaks of our regenerated human spirit in every chapter (1:17; 2:22; 3:16; 4:23; 5:18; 6:18). Whether we serve the Lord in preaching the gospel, offering a prayer, ministering the Word, visiting the saints, or calling a hymn in a meeting, we must exercise our spirit. By the exercise of our spirit we appropriate the Triune God every time we serve. Furthermore, we must serve by prayer. The book of Acts reveals that the Christians in the early days of the church age served by prayer (Acts 1:14, 24; 2:42; 3:1; 6:4; 10:2-4, 9; 11:5; 12:5; 13:1-3; 14:23; 16:25; 20:36; 28:8). This was the only means used by them to carry out the Lord&rsquo;s work. Thus, we all need an appetite for prayer, for without prayer there is poverty in our service. We need much prayer individually and corporately, never initiating or doing anything without it, and always praying in our spirit (Eph. 6:18). Today, we need the prevailing prayer which is of the Body, identified with the Body, and in our spirit. The concepts about service and the teachings concerning service that most Christians have received have become veils that frustrate their vision and confuse them. Very few have entered into the reality of the proper Christian service. May the Lord take away all our veils and show us the vision portrayed in this book. May we all become those whose service is in the Body, in our spirit, and by prayer. We all must pray that in these days the Lord will gain this unique and genuine service in many localities throughout the world.</p>

The Basis<br />
of Our Service</h1>
<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">SERVE BY BEING BUILT UP IN THE BODY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:1-5, 11; 1 Pet. 2:5; 1 Cor. 12:18, 20, 24-27; Col. 3:9-15</h1>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention in the whole universe is to gain a Body for Christ. In the Scriptures this Body is also called a spiritual house and a priesthood (1 Cor. 12:27; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9). These different terms signify that we, the believers, have been regenerated into the Body, and now we need to be tempered together and built up as one Body to fulfill God&rsquo;s intention. When we come to the matter of serving the Lord, we all need to be very clear that we need the Body, and we need a heavenly vision concerning the Body. May the Lord grant us all such a vision that will bring us into a full realization that we need to be in the reality of the Body, even that we cannot serve without the Body, and, in fact, that we cannot live, we cannot exist spiritually in life, outside the Body. Only by such a heavenly vision of the Body can we be brought into the genuine service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, in the New Testament the service is not touched clearly and definitely until Romans 12. In this chapter both the words service and serving are used. In Romans 12:1 Paul exhorts us to present our bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is our most reasonable service. In verse 7 he mentions the service, and in verse 11 he speaks of serving the Lord as a slave. It is not until Romans 12 that the matter of service is so definitely revealed to us. From this chapter we can realize that, as Christians, our service to the Lord must be in the Body. The Christian service is not something individual; it is something corporate. The Christian service is something of the Body, in the Body, with the Body, and for the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A HEAVENLY VISION OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>If we are going to serve the Lord, our service must be in the Body. We are burdened that all of us may be brought into this heavenly vision, the vision that no one can serve the Lord without the Body. All of our service must be in the Body because, as Christians, we all have been regenerated to be members of the Body. Each one of us is one member of the Body. Not one of us is a complete unit, a complete person, a complete being&mdash;not one of us alone is the Body. All of us have been re-created, regenerated, to be members of the Body.</p>
<p>The members of our physical body give us an illustration of how much every member needs the Body. It is impossible for the finger to be a complete unit by itself. Likewise, the eyes and the ears are not complete units. Every member needs the body, and every member needs to be attached to the body. The very part of the body we may consider the most beautiful would become terrifying if it were separated from the body. We appreciate the beauty of the human eyes, but if we saw some human eyes outside the body, we would be terrified. If they were detached from the body, not only would their beauty be gone, but their function also would be gone, and they would be useless.</p>
<p>Today there are many dear Christians who should have a genuine beauty in the Body. However, they do not have this beauty simply because they have been detached from the reality of the Body. Due to this one thing, the separation from the reality of the Body, certain members that should be beautiful and useful become terrifying and useless instead. This is the subtle work of the enemy.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention in the universe is to have a Body. You may use different words to express this one thing&mdash;the Body, the house, or the priesthood&mdash;but they signify one thing, that we, the regenerated ones, need to be tempered together and built up as one Body. This is God&rsquo;s intention. If we are going to serve the Lord, we need to be very clear about this one point.</p>
<p>First of all, we need the heavenly vision concerning the Body. In these days may our eyes be opened that we all may be brought into a full realization of our need to be in the reality of the Body. May we realize that we cannot serve without the Body, and that we cannot even have a spiritual life outside the Body. Such a vision will capture us, wreck us, and spoil us for all the individualistic works, for all the independent services. We will be brought into a genuine service by the heavenly vision, by what we see of the Body. We all need to pray that we may see this vision.</p>
<p>For the Christian service, we need the Body, and we need to see the Body. This is the first point we need to cover if we are going to speak about the service. I do believe that a good number among us have seen that there is no way, no base, no foundation, no ground for any one of us to serve the Lord without the Body. We need the Body, and we praise the Lord that we have already been regenerated into the Body. The only thing we need today is the heavenly vision that will cause us to realize that we are already in the Body. We are in the Body, but we are short of the realization. We cannot gain such a realization of the Body by being taught. I do not trust in my teaching, and I do not believe that my teaching will work in this matter. However, I do look to the Lord, the Head of the Body, that He would grant you even a little glimpse, that your eyes would be opened to see the fact that you are in the Body. You are in the Body! When you see this vision, it will seem so foolish that you could have been a Christian for years without realizing that you are in the Body. You have been regenerated into the Body, and by a single glimpse of the vision, you will have the clear realization that you are in the Body.</p>
<p>Some of us immigrated to the United States from other countries and obtained United States citizenship. After we obtained the citizenship, we received congratulations from the President and from a number of government officials. However, we need to celebrate the fact that we are members of the Body much more than we celebrated the fact that we became citizens of the United States. We need to celebrate the &ldquo;Body-ship,&rdquo; and rejoice that we have seen the Body and that we are in the Body.</p>
<p>It was a number of years after I was regenerated that I came into the realization that I was in the Body and began to appreciate the &ldquo;Body-ship.&rdquo; I was regenerated in 1925, but nearly seventeen years passed before my eyes were opened to see the Body. Between 1940 and 1942 I came into the realization that I was in the Body. For nearly seventeen years I had been a genuine seeking Christian, and I studied, searched, and even researched the Bible. Nevertheless, I did not have the realization that I was in the Body. When I saw the vision of the Body, the whole universe became a new heaven and a new earth to me. I had been in the Body already for some time, but I did not have the realization of the Body. We all need to see the reality that each one of us is a member of the Body. We are in the Body. Once you have seen the vision of the Body, you can never deny that you have seen it, just as once you have seen the city of Los Angeles, you cannot say that you have not seen it. We all need to see the vision of the Body.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICALITY OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>After you see the Body, spontaneously you will ask, &ldquo;Where is the Body?&rdquo; There are many Christian organizations, and many Christian groups. But where is the Body? Many Christians are still wandering because they have not seen the Body. They may talk about the Body life, but they have not seen the Body. Once they have seen the Body, they will raise the question, &ldquo;Where is the Body?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Ground of the Church</h2>
<p>The question of where the Body is involves the matter of the ground of the church. <em>Further Talks on the Church Life</em> by Brother Watchman Nee covers the matter of the ground of the church in detail. I strongly recommend that you read and reread this book until you are very clear concerning the ground of the church. Then you will know where to find the Body. The matter of the church ground is very serious; it is something of life and death, not merely a matter of doctrine. I would even encourage you to read <em>Further Talks</em> over and over so that through it and through these messages you may be brought into the heavenly vision concerning the Body and the place where you can find the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Body Presented, Our Soul Transformed,<br />
Our Spirit Burning</h2>
<p>Suppose that we have seen the Body, we have found the Body, and we are in the reality of the Body. At this point we need Romans 12. This chapter was written for the purpose of telling us what we should do at this point. The first two verses of Romans 12 say, &ldquo;I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your most reasonable service. And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind, that you may prove by testing what the will of God is, that which is good and well-pleasing and perfect.&rdquo; First, we need to present our body. Then we need to have our soul transformed by the renewing of the mind. Eventually, we need to have our spirit burned and burning all the time (v. 11). The body needs to be presented, the soul transformed, and the spirit burned and burning, on fire all the time. You may have presented your body already, but you may be short of the transformation of your soul by the renewing of the mind. In addition, you need to be burning in spirit. Even so, there is something more.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LOSING THE SELF-LIFE<br />
FOR THE SAKE OF THE ONENESS</h2>
<p>If your eyes have been opened and you see the Body, if you have found the Body and realized that you are in it, it will be necessary for you to give up the self, to lose the self-life. The self is a real problem. The self is the real division, the real sin, and the real sect. If you have seen the Body, this vision will require that you lose your self-life, that you give up the self. Christians are divided because they are so much in the self. The self divides, but the spirit unites. Therefore, if we would give up the self, lose the self, and turn to the spirit, right away we would be in the reality of the Body. When you are out of the self and in the spirit, you are in the reality of the Body. It is necessary for us to give up the self, to lose the self. It is not adequate merely to know the doctrine concerning losing the self; it is necessary to lose the self in a practical way, to let go of the self-life. On this point we need more prayer. We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, be merciful to me in Your Body, that I may lose the self, that I may let go of my self-life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you intend to argue with the church or with some of the saints about a certain point, you need to check yourself to find out whether your arguing has its source in the spirit or in the self. Your point may be right, but your motive may be wrong, and the instrument or means that you are using may also be wrong. The right thing must come out of the right source and be done by the right means. Merely for your point to be right is not adequate. It is necessary to have both the proper source and the proper means. The spirit is the proper source, and the spirit is also the proper means. If your arguing for a certain point has its source in the spirit and is done by means of the spirit, there is no problem with your arguing. Otherwise, you need to give it up. In the Body we all need to lose the self.</p>
<p>We may talk about oneness, but we all need to realize that the genuine oneness is nothing less than Christ Himself as our life in a practical way. Christ is the oneness, the unity. When I am living in Christ as my life and not in myself, I have the oneness, and I am in the unity. When we all are living in Christ as our life, Christ is the oneness. If this is our situation, then we have the reality of the Body, and then we are also equipped for the service. Romans 12 stresses that without the Body we cannot serve, because each of us is only one member.</p>
<p>Peter tells us that the Body is the building, the house, and that we are living stones. &ldquo;You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, into a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ&rdquo; (1 Pet. 2:5). Without being built up, the living stones can do nothing, and they are useless. Stones that are not built up are useless. The stones need to be built up into a house that will be useful to God. This usefulness is the service, and this house is the priesthood.</p>
<p>Two different Greek words are translated into the English word priesthood. The Greek word translated priesthood in 1 Peter 2:5 and 9 means a priestly body, a body of priests, but the word translated priesthood in Hebrews 7 means priestly office, priestly function. The spiritual house mentioned in 1 Peter 2:5 is the priesthood, the priestly body, not the priestly office. Strong&rsquo;s <em>Concordance</em> gives the meaning of this Greek word as a priestly fraternity. There is the need of a priestly body, a priestly group, to offer spiritual sacrifices. If we are not built up as such a priestly body, we are not qualified to offer anything to God. Therefore, if we are not built up, we are not qualified to serve. For the service, we need the Body.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING TEMPERED TOGETHER</h2>
<p>Here we need to go into more detail. The matters we are touching are not so simple. It is not sufficient to say that we have seen the Body and we are living by Christ as our life, and therefore we have the oneness and are in the unity and in the Body. We have Romans 12, and we have 1 Peter 2, but we need to go on to 1 Corinthians 12, especially to take note of one word in verse 24: &ldquo;But God has tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked.&rdquo; How much I appreciate the word tempered. God has tempered the body. We need to check ourselves to see how much we have been tempered. We are all here together, we have seen the Body, we are in the Body, we are living in Christ and by Christ as our life, but we need to check ourselves to find out how much we have been tempered together.</p>
<p>Those who cook know how to temper the different ingredients together in their cooking. To be tempered means more than to be mixed together or blended. The <em>Amplified New Testament</em> supplies several words for the word tempered in this verse&mdash;adjusted, mingled, harmonized, and subtly proportioned the parts of the whole. In the practical application, to be tempered means that a quick person needs to be put together with a slow one so that the quickness of the one is tempered with the slowness of the other. Then in the Body there will be nothing too quick and nothing too slow.</p>
<p>In the church both pride and humility need to be tempered out until only Christ is left. One brother may feel that he is very humble and that others are very proud. When his humility is tempered with their pride, there will be nothing humble and nothing proud in the church. Some of the brothers and sisters find it very easy to stand up in the meetings to function, and others find it easy to remain in their seats and be quiet. These saints also need the tempering together. In these days I have a deep realization that I need more tempering with all the saints. Whatever characteristic you may have, I need to be tempered with you in that matter. All of us need to be tempered together.</p>
<p>Without the tempering together, there is no way for us to be built up together. Without the tempering, a quick person could never go along with a slow one, and there could never be any building between them. Without being tempered, you could never be coordinated with others. One brother is too proud, but another is too humble. These two could never be coordinated together unless both of them are willing to be tempered. God has not only set the members in the Body; He has tempered the Body together.</p>
<p>In cooking it is not sufficient merely to mix certain ingredients together to prepare a dish that has a pleasing taste. In the preparation of certain dishes it is necessary to temper the ingredients together to give them a delicious taste. All of us have been placed into the church here together, but the delicious taste will be lacking if we have not been tempered together. God has placed the members, each one of them, in the Body, and He has also tempered the Body together (1 Cor. 12:18, 24). Our need today is not merely to be brought in and placed in the church here, but to be tempered together with others of the Lord&rsquo;s choosing who may be quite different from us in their dispositions. Time after time the Lord puts us together with just the right person for us to be tempered in the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VIRTUES OF CHRIST FOR THE BODY LIFE</h2>
<p>Now we come to a particular phrase in Colossians 3:15, &ldquo;you were called in one Body.&rdquo; For years I read Colossians 3 without realizing that all the virtues mentioned there are for the Body life&mdash;compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, longsuffering or endurance, forbearance, forgiveness, love, and peace. The phrase, &ldquo;you were called in one Body,&rdquo; clearly indicates that all of these items are for the one Body, for the Body life. As Christians, we have the natural concept that we need to be humble in our human living. However, according to the Bible, humility is not for the human life, but for the Body life. Compassion is not for the human life, but for the Body life. In the Body you need to have compassion. In the Body you need kindness, humility, meekness, endurance, and forbearance. We should not think that it is impossible for us to bear a particular brother or sister. Even though we may feel that to stay with that particular saint is like being put into death, we should not try to escape our situation. What the Lord requires is that our natural life be put to death. We need to remain where we are that we may bear and even forbear, that we may take the cup our Father has given us. It may seem like a bitter cup, but it will become so sweet. It may seem to be a cup of curse, but it will become a cup of blessing. In this way we will see the Body life.</p>
<p>We should not think that it is easy for human beings to stay together. No matter how much we love one another, the longer we stay together the more we will realize that we need not only endurance but also forbearance and forgiveness for the Body life. If we stay together to have the meeting life for a period of time, surely we will offend one another again and again. None of us could be so holy, so perfect, that we would not offend others. When the offenses come, we need to forgive one another. Instead of complaining, we need to forgive again and again. Colossians 3:12-13 says, &ldquo;Put on therefore as God&rsquo;s chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, longsuffering; bearing one another and forgiving one another, if anyone should have a complaint against any; as the Lord forgave you, so also should you forgive.&rdquo; I appreciate compassion more than mercy. Compassion is so tender. After compassion, verse 12 mentions kindness, lowliness, meekness, and longsuffering. Verse 13 continues with forbearance, and then forgiveness. Then you have love, and following love, peace. &ldquo;And over all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of Christ arbitrate in your hearts, to which also you were called in one Body; and be thankful&rdquo; (vv. 14-15). If you do not forgive others, you could never have peace. Instead of having peace, you will be troubled all the time. You will be disturbed by the offenses of others, and there will be no peace arbitrating within you. But if you forgive others and forget their offenses, if you love them no matter how much they offend you, you will have peace. You will simply receive whatever another does to you as something from the Lord for you, something that you need. You will not care for the offenses, but you will care for all the dear brothers and sisters. When you have such a love, peace will follow.</p>
<p>All the items in Colossians 3 are detailed expressions of Christ as life. With such an expression of Christ in a practical way, we have the Body life. Then we will be built up together and qualified to serve the Lord. Without the proper building up together, whatever we do to have some outreach, to preach the gospel, or to help other Christians, does not work. Only when we are qualified by being built up together will it be easy to bring someone to the Lord or to help other members. For the service it is necessary for us to be in the reality of the Body, to be built up, to be qualified, to be equipped. From our experience we know that the real equipment for us to fight the battle as the service to the Lord is to be built up in the Body.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE TESTS OF OUR SEEING THE BODY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:1-4; 1 Cor. 1:10; 3:1-4; Phil. 2:1-4; John 17:21, 23</h1>
<p>The genuine Christian service is based upon the building up of the Body of Christ. The base, the foundation, of all genuine Christian work is the building up of the Body. The real Christian service stands upon the basis of the Body. God&rsquo;s unique intention in this universe is to have a corporate Body to serve Him. God wants us to serve Him, but He does not want us to serve Him in an individualistic way. God&rsquo;s intention is to have a priesthood, a priestly body, a corporate people built together, to serve Him. Therefore, we need to see clearly that if there is no building up, there is no possibility of having the genuine Christian service. We should not consider what has been called service in the history of the church as something normal, and we should not take what we see among today&rsquo;s Christians as a pattern. Most of what we find in the history of the church and in the present situation is something out of order, something altogether contrary to God&rsquo;s way. God&rsquo;s intention is to have a Body serving Him. Therefore, He has not regenerated us to be perfect units, each complete in ourselves, but He has regenerated all of us to be members of one Body. How much we all need to see the Body!</p>
<p>You may presume that you have seen the Body because you have heard messages on the Body or because we have spent so much time on this one point in these days. However, I do not have the confidence that you have seen the Body. I have a deep question concerning this matter; I doubt that you have really seen the Body.</p>
<p>During a period of at least two years, from 1940 to 1942, Brother Watchman Nee gave a message each week on the seeing of the Body. His word was not on the Body, but on the seeing of the Body. Have you seen the Body? Every week during that time he gave a message, and every week he spent one morning with us, the trainees. In that morning training time of more than three hours Brother Nee did not do much speaking in the way of a message. Rather, when we came together with him after he had given a message to the whole congregation, he would ask each of us to give a testimony one by one concerning how we had seen the Body. After each testimony, he would shake his head and tell us that we had not seen the Body. Then he would point out how our own words exposed us, how our own words proved that we had not seen the Body. Out of so many trainees there may have been only one or two who received his approval in the matter of seeing the Body. Brother Nee could be very bold with us as trainees because we had given him our permission when we were accepted for the training. I am not as bold as Brother Nee was, but I do ask you to consider seriously this question of whether or not you have seen the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NO LONGER DIVISIVE</h2>
<p>There are some simple ways to test yourself to see whether or not you have seen the Body. I encourage you to test yourself by these few means. In the first place, I would say that if you have seen the Body, you will never be divisive. To be divisive means that you have not seen the Body. If you have seen the Body, you would never be divisive and you could never be divisive from now on. Divisiveness means you have not seen the Body. Could there be more than one Body in this universe? There is only one. Have you seen this one Body, the unique Body? If you have seen this unique Body, this vision will bind you so that you could never be divisive.</p>
<p>The reason there is so much division among Christians today is that they have not seen the Body. When Christians who meet together are not happy with each other, often some stop meeting with the others and start a meeting of their own. This is division, and it indicates that the ones who do such things are divisive. They have not seen the Body. Anyone who has seen the Body could no longer be divisive.</p>
<p>There is only one Body, and I am a part of this Body. It is impossible for me to be separated from this Body and impossible for me to separate myself from this Body. It is crucial that we all see the Body. However, there is the possibility that we will think we have seen the Body when we have not seen it at all.</p>
<p>From the time I began my ministry in this country in 1962, I heard many people talking about the Body life and the Body ministry, but within me I realized that they were talking about something which they had not seen and which they did not know. Of course, I was not so bold as to tell them that they had not seen the Body, but I would ask you now to check whether or not you have seen the Body. Have you seen the Body? If you have seen the Body, you have seen the oneness, and you could no longer be divisive.</p><h2 class="head2">The Church Ground</h2>
<p>Seeing the Body very much involves the matter of the ground of the church. The Body is one, and this unique Body is expressed in and by the local churches. Where is the Body? Where is this unique Body? The Body is in the local churches. Both the reality of the Body and the practicality of the Body are in the local churches. If you do not have the local churches, you do not have the reality of the Body. You may have the terminology, the teaching, the concept, of the Body, but you do not have the reality. Before the New Jerusalem comes, the reality of the Body will not be in the so-called heavenly church or the universal church, but in the local churches. Today the reality and practicality of the Body are in the local churches. We could only put the Body into practice by having the local churches. The local churches are the practicality of the Body.</p>
<p>What is a local church? Some of the denominations and Christian groups consider themselves local churches, but they may have several groups independent of one another all meeting within the same city. Although these groups may consider themselves local churches, each one would have to be the church on a particular street, not the church in a particular city. Therefore, according to the Scriptures, we have to say that these are not local churches. In the Bible there is the church in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1), the church in Antioch (Acts 13:1), and the church in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:2; 2 Cor. 1:1). The Apostle Paul established or appointed elders in every church (Acts 14:23), and he told Titus to appoint elders in every city (Titus 1:5). In the Bible there are the elders of the church and the elders of the city, but there are no elders of a church on a particular street. Others may use the same terms that we use, but they use them according to different definitions.</p>
<p>When we use the term the local church, we use it according to the Scriptures. In Revelation 1:11 John was told, &ldquo;What you see write in a book and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.&rdquo; To send something to the seven churches means to send it to the seven cities, and to the seven cities equals to the seven churches. John was not told to send the book to a certain street, then to another street. He was told to send it to the seven cities of the one province of Asia. The revelation in this verse is very clear. We treasure the book of Revelation, and we especially treasure this revelation in chapter one: seven churches equal seven cities.</p>
<p>What is a local church? A local church is the Christians meeting on the unique ground of unity in their locality, in their city. Christians who meet as a group on a certain street, in a certain area, on a certain campus, or in a certain home cannot be considered a local church. A local church is the Christians who live in a city meeting together on the ground of unity, the unique ground of unity, not on any other ground. This is the local church in that city, and the reality and the practicality of the Body are in such a local church. If you have seen the Body in such a way, you will no longer be divisive.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Dependent on Condition</h2>
<p>We need to see this one point&mdash;how the vision of the Body keeps us from divisiveness&mdash;in a detailed way. In these days all the meetings of the church here have been very living, very uplifted. But suppose the level of the meetings goes down, even to a very low level, and the meetings do not seem to be living, but are slow and even very poor. Then what would you do? Would you talk to another brother about the poor condition of the meetings and consider starting another meeting in his home? Just to have such a consideration proves that you have not seen the Body.</p>
<p>Sometimes the physical body is very healthy and very strong, but at other times it is weak and sick. Even though I have a strong physical body, not long ago I was sick for several weeks. However, when my body became weak, it was still the same body as it was when it was strong. I could never say that I would give up that weak body because of its weakness and start to have another body that would be strong. To have such a consideration would mean that I did not know what my body is. If I have seen and do know what my body is, no matter whether it is strong or weak, I would realize that my body is my body, and that it is the only one I have.</p>
<p>Beginning in the fall of 1943 I was seriously ill for thirty months. During that time I did not work at all; I absolutely rested. Nevertheless, my weak body was still my body, even though it was weak to the uttermost and very sick. I did not give up my weak body. Rather, I did whatever I could during those thirty months to nourish it, to cherish it, and to love it more. My body has never been so precious, so dear, and so valuable to me as it was in those thirty months. I have never loved my body more than I did during that time.</p>
<p>Today do you love the church here in Los Angeles? All of us surely love the church here very much in these days. But I would check with you to see why you love the church. It is easy to love the church because it is very living, very encouraging, very uplifting, and the meetings are wonderful, even marvelous. If the church were merely a physical building, it could remain the same year after year, with very little change. However, the church can be compared to our physical bodies, sometimes living and strong, and at other times, weak and not so living. We need to love the church because it is the Body; it is even our Body. If you love the church because it is wonderful and very living, I would ask what you would do if the condition of the church is not so good after a period of time. Would you go somewhere else where the situation is not so poor? If you would, this proves that you have not seen the Body.</p>
<p>If you have seen the Body, it will make no difference to you whether the meetings are living and wonderful, or they are weak and poor, and it will make no difference whether or not the ones who take the lead are good in your eyes and according to your feeling. Whatever the condition, you will acknowledge that this is the Body. At the present time the leading ones in the church here are learning how to take the lead. We praise the Lord that they are willing to learn and they do not presume that they are the best leaders. However, if a day should come that the attitude of some of the leading ones is not so proper, you would be tested by that situation to see whether or not you have really seen the Body. If you could leave and start another meeting because the situation is poor, it is clear that you have never seen the Body. When my physical body is strong, it is my body. When it is weak or sick, it is nevertheless my body. I cannot give up my body because of its weakness. Have you seen the Body? If you have seen the Body, it will be impossible for you ever to be divisive again.</p>
<p>We should not expect the church life to be like a honeymoon all the time. In the married life, a honeymoon lasts only a short time. According to our experience, it may be the same in the church life. I have been in the church life for more than thirty-seven years. Do you think that I have been having a honeymoon all these years? Do you think that everything has been wonderful and even marvelous in the church life all of this time? Nevertheless, no matter what has happened in all these years, I can testify strongly that this is the Body. I have seen the Body, and I cannot say that I have not seen it. Whether it is good or bad, whether it is strong or weak, rich or poor, fruitful or unfruitful, it is the Body. Oh, I have seen the Body! I have no choice. There is only one Body in the whole universe.</p>
<p>Here we have a clear test concerning the seeing of the Body. Nothing is so binding as the Body. When you hear others who are still very free talk about the Body, you may realize that they have never seen the Body because they are so free. They have no restriction. If you have seen the Body, you could never be divisive. The members of the Body could never be replaced. It would be impossible to change the position of the ear in your physical body even a little bit. The vision of the Body will keep us from divisiveness.</p><h2 class="head1">NO LONGER INDIVIDUALISTIC</h2>
<p>Now we come to another point. If you have seen the Body, you could never be individualistic, you could never be independent. As a Christian, you will realize that you cannot live without the Body. You cannot move, you cannot work, you cannot serve without the Body, because you have seen the Body, and you realize that you are simply one member of the Body. In the physical body, it is impossible for the nose to exist, function, or serve without the body. Neither could the hand live, move, or work without the body.</p>
<p>I praise the Lord that, by His mercy, in my service for over thirty-seven years, as a brother among you, I have never been independent and have never been individualistic. I may feel that I am one hundred percent right, and the others are one hundred percent wrong, but I have to go along with the feeling of the Body. Whenever the Body feels that something should not be done, I do not do it. It is not a matter of right or wrong, but a matter of either being individualistic or being in the Body.</p>
<p>If you keep in mind all these tests, you will realize that you have not seen the Body because you are so individualistic. It seems that you can do anything you like independently. If you see the Body, it would be impossible for you to behave yourself in an independent way.</p>
<p>During that time from 1940 to 1942, all of us were surprised when Brother Nee shook his head and told us that we had not seen the Body. We had given strong testimonies to prove that we had seen the Body. Right away some of us asked Brother Nee how we could see the Body. He was not one to answer our question directly. He simply replied, &ldquo;If you have seen it, you have seen it.&rdquo; Then we would ask him to tell us how we could see the Body. &ldquo;If you see it, you see it. If you don&rsquo;t see it, you don&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo; Then he would ask another one, perhaps a sister, to give a testimony about seeing the Body. We thought we had already seen the Body. Likewise, if you test yourself, you will realize that you have not seen the Body. If you see the Body, it would be impossible for you to be individualistic.</p>
<p>Whether we see the Body, or we do not see it, is all a matter of the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. Eventually, this was the ultimate answer Brother Nee gave us. He told us not to try by ourselves to see it, but to look to the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. If you see it, you see it; if you do not see it, you do not see it&mdash;that is all. I believe that this is absolutely true. May we all look to the Lord for His mercy to be brought into the seeing of the Body.</p>
<p>At this time I have the burden from the Lord to take away your self-confidence in this matter of seeing the Body. You think you have seen the Body already, but actually you have not seen it. Be prepared to be a little disappointed, and recognize that you have not seen it yet. Look unto the Lord for His mercy, and trust in Him for His mercy; He will show you His Body.</p>
<p>How could you know that you have seen the Body? The strongest proof that you have seen the Body is that you can no longer be individualistic. When you cannot be individualistic, you have seen the Body. As long as you are not restricted, as long as you are free, as long as you are independent, as long as it is so easy for you to have your own choice, no matter how much you know about the Body and how confident you are that you have seen the Body, you have not seen the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WILLING TO BE TEMPERED</h2>
<p>Now we come to a further test concerning seeing the Body. If you have seen the Body, you will be willing to be tempered together. Paul used the word tempered in 1 Corinthians 12:24, &ldquo;God has tempered the body together.&rdquo; A lack of willingness to be tempered is another proof that you have not seen the Body. God has not only placed us together in the Body, but even the more, He has tempered us together.</p>
<p>There is no way for two believers to be one in a practical way without being tempered together. In our experience many times the tempering together comes out of practical situations in working together in coordination. For example, another brother and I worked together to prepare the hymnal. There were many details that required fellowship, and many decisions to be made. In point after point we depended on one another, and neither of us worked in an individualistic way. We selected hymns written by others to be included, we translated a number of hymns from Chinese into English, and we improved the meaning in the lines of many hymns. The brother I was working with had certain preferences because of his background, and I had a number of difficulties because English is not my mother tongue. There were problems with the meter, problems with the accents, and problems with the rhymes. In the process, both of us made many mistakes, and many times we corrected each other. In the detailed coordination necessary to prepare the hymnal, we two brothers learned many lessons and we were very much tempered together. I cannot tell you how much blessing we two received through the tempering together in that work on the hymnal.</p>
<p>In practical work together such as this, there are many lessons for us to learn. We all need to learn not to insist too much on a certain way. There may be some mistakes made, but that is not the crucial point. The church life is a life of being tempered all the time. Even if you are one hundred percent right, you still need to be tempered.</p><h2 class="head2">No Murmuring, Complaining, or Criticism</h2>
<p>If we have really seen the Body, we would not murmur or criticize any of the other members. Even a little murmuring that shows your dissatisfaction proves that you have not seen the Body. Even a little word of criticism about a certain member of the Body proves that you have never seen the Body. If you have seen the Body, you would never complain, murmur, criticize, or say anything against any of the members. The condition of some of the members may be quite poor, but, on your side, for you to say that their condition is poor is a proof that you have not seen the Body. This is a real test. A little complaint, a little dissatisfaction, or a little criticism proves that you have not seen the Body. For this reason, Paul speaks of lowliness, meekness, and longsuffering in Colossians 3:12-15 and in Ephesians 4:2-4. We need longsuffering to bear our dear fellow members in love. Longsuffering in Ephesians 4:2 is not toward the persecutors, but toward the fellow members, and it is suffering over a long period of time, not a short period of time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Forgiveness with Love</h2>
<p>If we have seen the Body, there will be no more complaints, no more quarrels, no more murmurings, no more criticism. In the place of all these there will be forgiveness. This does not mean that no one will be offended. Many times someone may be offended, but all of the offending will be swallowed up by forgiveness. There will be no complaining, but all of the offending will be chased away by forgiveness with love and with sympathy. A brother may offend me, but I would sympathize with him. I would realize that he has a certain kind of disposition, a certain kind of natural makeup, and I would sympathize with him. Instead of criticizing and complaining, we would have sympathy and forgiveness. Instead of condemnation, we would have love. I would forgive my brother, and I would love him.</p>
<p>Although many people think that it is the youngest child in a family who is loved the most, my mother told me years ago that parents always love the weakest child the most. Now that I am a father, I agree with what she said. The strong ones do not need the parents to love them as much, because they are able to take care of themselves. The weaker ones, however, have many problems. They need the parents&rsquo; sympathy, and they need their love.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many times in the church life we love the strong ones, and we fail to care for those who may need our love more. In our eyes, there are some in the church life who are weak and poor. Their disposition may not match ours, and perhaps they have some peculiar trait. You should not complain about them, for they were made this way. If you want to complain about them, you will have to complain to God, for He created them the way they are. We all need to learn to sympathize with the weak ones, with those who have a peculiar trait. I need to sympathize with you, and I ask you to please sympathize with me, for I have my own peculiarity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Longsuffering for the Body&rsquo;s Sake</h2>
<p>If we learn this lesson and are willing to suffer even the wrongdoings of the fellow members of the Body, this means that we have seen the Body. We are willing to suffer the wrongdoings of the fellow members because they are members of the Body. If we have seen the Body, we will experience the longsuffering, the suffering that extends over a long period of time, even until the New Jerusalem. This suffering is not related to unbelievers or to things, but to the fellow members of the Body. If a certain member of my physical body is weak, it is nevertheless a member of my body. I need to love this member, protect it, and do everything I can to keep it in good condition.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPACT OF THE SERVICE IN THE BODY</h2>
<p>In this message I have given you three tests concerning seeing the Body. If you have seen the Body, you will no longer be divisive, you will not be individualistic, and you will be willing to be tempered, without any complaining, murmuring, or criticism, but with love, forgiveness, sympathy, forbearance, and longsuffering. If such is the case, you will have the Body life. It is with such a Body life that there is a real impact in our service. Although there may be times that the Body is weak, it is only out of the genuine Body life that there can come the service to the Lord with a real impact. In John 17:21-23 the Lord Jesus said that if all the believers would be one as the Triune God is one, as He and the Father are one, the world would believe. This is the impact of the oneness. If the believers are perfected into one, by this the world will know that the Son has been sent by the Father. The oneness is the impact that will cause the world to believe. Being tempered together is the power of the service; the real power in the service comes out of being tempered together.</p>
<p>Suppose there are three brothers serving together, coming together to preach the gospel and take care of the new believers. However, the first brother has been somewhat critical of the second, and the second has been somewhat dissatisfied with the third. When they come together, they cannot pretend that they are one. Sooner or later, the lack of harmony among them will be exposed before the unbelievers and the new beginners. A small amount of criticism will tear down whatever has been built up by their preaching, and the impact will be lost.</p>
<p>However, if we have the genuine oneness with love for one another, this oneness with the love is the impact of our preaching. Praise the Lord, today here among us in the church in Los Angeles there is a genuine oneness and love. Many reports have come back from others who have been influenced and impressed with the love and the oneness they have experienced here. However, what if a day would come that we would lose this oneness and yet still claim to be the church here in Los Angeles? We would still be the church in Los Angeles, but we would lose the impact in our service. There would be no power, because there would be no ground, no base, no foundation for our service. We would have lost the foundation of our service. May the Lord be merciful to us.</p>
<p>We all need to see the Body. For the service it is necessary for us to see the Body. May the Lord reveal this matter to all of us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE RELATIONSHIP OF OUR SPIRIT<br />
TO THE BODY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:17; 2:22; 3:16; 4:23; 5:18; 6:18; 1:22-23; 2:6; Acts 2:32-33, 36</h1>
<p>In this message we come to six crucial points in the book of Ephesians, which is a book on the church, the Body of Christ. We have seen that the building up of the Body of Christ is the foundation of all genuine Christian service, and we have been emphasizing our deep need to see the Body. May the Lord be merciful to all of us that we may see the Body in order that we may serve Him in a proper way.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ is not a small thing, and the Christian service is a matter in the Body. Eventually we shall see that Christ and the church, the Head and the Body, are the administration of the whole universe. Our service to the Lord is based upon this fact.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BODY OF CHRIST AND OUR REGENERATED SPIRIT IN EPHESIANS</h2>
<p>First of all, we need to see that the Body is a matter absolutely in the spirit, in our human spirit. Our regenerated spirit is indwelt by the Holy Spirit, but the emphasis with the Body of Christ today is on our human spirit rather than on the Holy Spirit. Therefore, in every chapter of the book of Ephesians there is something mentioned about our regenerated human spirit. Ephesians is a book on the Body, and every chapter contains a verse concerning the human spirit. We need to pray-read these verses again and again.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A SPIRIT OF REVELATION TO SEE THE BODY</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 1:17 Paul spoke of God as &ldquo;the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory.&rdquo; Such a title is different from all the titles the Jewish people used for God. Paul referred to God not as the God of the Hebrews, but as the God of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Father of glory. Such a word is meaningful and profound. In incarnation the Lord Jesus Christ, God Himself (Phil. 2:6), became a man. As a man He is related to God&rsquo;s creation; therefore, God the Creator is His God. His incarnation brought God the Creator into man, God&rsquo;s creature. He is a man with God incarnated in Him. Moreover, because glory is God expressed, the Father of glory is God expressed through His many sons.</p>
<p>Paul prayed that the Father of glory &ldquo;may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation&rdquo; (Eph. 1:17). The spirit here is our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God. It is necessary for you to see the Body, but you could never see the Body unless you are in the spirit. If you do not have the vision in your spirit, if you do not have a spirit of revelation, a seeing spirit, you could not see the Body. If your eyes do not have sight, you could not distinguish one color from another, and you could not view the scenery. The Body of Christ is something different from all the scenes we could see, something different from all the colors we could see naturally. It is a heavenly vision. Therefore, we need a spirit of revelation, a spirit of seeing, a seeing spirit, to see the Body. I do not mean that we need a clever mind to understand. What we need is a spirit transparent to see, a spirit of revelation, a seeing spirit to see the Body. The spirit of revelation to see the Body is the first point concerning our spirit in this book on the church.</p>
<p>Many expositions of the book of Ephesians have been written by different Christian teachers. However, I have not been able to find any that stress this one point, that the Body is something in our spirit. Although you may talk about certain sights or certain views, if you do not have eyes to see, how could you see? The church is something too profound, too high, too mysterious, far, far beyond our human understanding!</p>
<p>In the following verses Paul speaks of the surpassing greatness of the power that God wrought in Christ in raising Him up and in seating Him at the right hand of God, in subjecting all things under His feet, and in giving Him to be Head over all things to the church (Eph. 1:19-22). You need to pay special attention to the word &ldquo;to&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;to the church&rdquo; in verse 22. It is not an insignificant word here, but one of the most important words in the whole chapter. Paul did not say &ldquo;for the church,&rdquo; but he said &ldquo;to the church.&rdquo; The church is the Body of this One (vv. 22-23). This is the Body! The Body is the Body of such a One who has been enthroned and made the Head over all things to the church. This matter is profound and mysterious, and it cannot be seen by our physical eyes or understood by our natural understanding. To see this mysterious thing we need another organ; we need a spirit of revelation. Our spirit must be a spirit of revelation.</p><h2 class="head2">Using the Proper Organ</h2>
<p>In order to see the church or know the church, you cannot remain in your mind. To use your mind is to use the wrong organ to see the church, and you cannot see it. As long as you remain in your mind, you are through with the revelation of the church. Your spirit must be a spirit of revelation. You could never understand the church simply by using your mind. The more you try to figure it out, the more you will be confused. Although you may listen to different people and read different books, yet you find yourself more and more confused. However, if you would simply close your eyes from all the books, close your mind from all the teachings, close your ears from the voices of the different teachers, and turn yourself to your spirit and remain there, you will be clear concerning the church.</p>
<p>However, many times we Christians are foolish in that we fail to use the wonderful spirit we have within us. We have a spirit, and this spirit is a spirit of revelation, but when it comes to the matter of the church, the matter of the local church, we do not even realize that we should use our spirit. Instead of turning to our spirit to be clear concerning the church, we go to teachers or to the writings of the great teachers of the past. But some of the writings may be a veil over our eyes that would keep us from the vision of the church in our spirit. To be clear concerning the matter of the church, we need to use the proper organ. Only in the spirit can we see the church.</p>
<p>To use our mind to try to understand the matter of the church instead of turning to our spirit to see the revelation of the church can be compared to trying to see a particular color with our eyes closed instead of opening our eyes to see that color. With your eyes closed, without the faculty of vision, you cannot see any of the colors. The faculty of understanding does not work for the colors. But if you open your eyes, all the doubts are gone, all the questions are gone, and you do know what the particular color is. You may not be able to explain what you see, but your eyes can substantiate the colors and can distinguish one color from another. To see the colors, we need to open our eyes. To see the church, we need to turn to our spirit.</p>
<p>We need to turn to our spirit and respect the fact that our spirit is a spirit of revelation. To see the church is simple when you use the proper organ. In the spirit the matter of the church is very clear. The local church is different from all the denominations. You may not be able to explain the difference, but when you turn to the spirit and see the church, you will know the difference, and you will know that you have seen the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Taking Away the Veils</h2>
<p>We may talk about Ephesians 1:18-23, but neglect the spirit of revelation in verse 17. The spirit of revelation is not something that descends on you from the heavens after you have prayed for three nights. The spirit of revelation is within you already, but you need to take away all the veils that you might see. In order to know what a particular color is, it would be foolish for you to fast and pray, to cry out and weep, and to wait for the Lord to give you a vision. You have eyes to see; you simply need to take away all the veils and open your eyes. In the same way, if you take away all the veils from your spiritual eyes and turn to your spirit, you will see the church. Within you is the spirit of revelation, created by God and regenerated by the Holy Spirit. From my own experience and the experience of many others, I can tell you that our need is to turn to this spirit and take away all the veils that hinder our vision.</p>
<p>Many of our concepts and the teachings we have received in the past have become layers of veils that frustrate our vision and confuse us. In the matter of seeing the Body, it is as if we all see it through colored glasses. Our vision is colored by some of our particular experiences, or by the teachings of those who brought us to the Lord. Sometimes it seems as if this influence is in our very blood, and it is hard to get rid of those concepts and that influence in order that we may come to the Word with a pure spirit, with nothing coloring our vision and nothing veiling our sight. If we come to the pure Word with a transparent spirit, without any concepts from our background, it will be very easy for us to be clear about the Body. I can testify that it took me nearly twenty years to get rid of the influence of all the concepts and teachings from my background. May the Lord grant us all such a spirit to see the Body.</p>
<p>The matter of the Body is a matter in the spirit, not a matter in the mind or the emotions. It is natural for the brothers to be in their mind, and for the sisters to be in their emotions. Many believing sisters are hindered from being clear about the church because of their emotions. They make a decision about meeting with Christians based on their emotions, on their feelings. Unless these sisters would turn themselves to the spirit and forget their emotions, they cannot be clear about the local church. Their decision concerning the church is not based upon the spirit, but upon the emotion. We can never be clear about the church as long as we are not in the spirit.</p>
<p>The brothers need to turn themselves to the spirit, forgetting about the mind, and the sisters need to turn themselves to the spirit, forgetting about their emotion. In addition, there are some who are so strong in their will, so stubborn in their will, that they could not be clear about the Body either. When they make a decision, when their will is set, they would not be willing to be changed forever. It may seem that even the Lord could not change them. Such a person is so strong in the will that he could never be persuaded even by the clear word of God. Those who are stubborn in their will in this way could never be clear about the Body. All of us need to forget about what we feel, what we think, and what we decide, and turn ourselves to the spirit without any veils. If we turn to the spirit, if we turn to the Lord in such a way, then we come to the Word, right away we will be clear about the Body.</p><h2 class="head1">BUILT TOGETHER IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The matter of seeing the church is in the spirit, and the building up of the church is also in the spirit. In Ephesians 2:22 Paul says that &ldquo;you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; As long as we stay outside of the spirit, we are divided, and we are also divisive. As long as we are not in the spirit, we are individualistic. It is not at all hard to be divisive or to be individualistic. Simply by staying away from our spirit, simply by lingering in our mind to consider or by lingering in our emotion, we are divisive, we are individualistic, and we are not willing to be tempered. We have our likes and dislikes, our tastes and preferences, our opinions about the brothers and sisters, and we would rather stay at home than be in the meetings with the saints. As long as we stay away from our spirit, we see no need to be tempered together, and we feel it is necessary for each of us to maintain a distinctiveness from others, to take care of our individual personality created by God, and to hold on to our own prestige. It is impossible for us to be tempered together as long as we stay outside the spirit with such concepts. However, if we would turn ourselves to the spirit, right away we would see that we need to be tempered, we would be willing to be tempered, and we would even cry out to the Lord for His mercy that He would temper us together.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, within a few hours after praying such a prayer, you may come back to your understanding, to your mind, and to your emotion, and it will seem that you are another person. In the morning watch you were a person in the spirit fully for the building up together, but after five hours you are outside the spirit and there is no building. If we are going to be built up together, we need to be in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STRENGTHENED IN THE INNER MAN</h2>
<p>Furthermore, we need to be strengthened in the inner man, in our regenerated human spirit. In chapter three of Ephesians Paul prayed, &ldquo;That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man&rdquo; (v. 16). Not only is the seeing of the Body in the spirit, not only is the building up together of the Body in the spirit, but the strengthening in the inner man is also in the spirit. In order to be strengthened in the inner man we need to be in the spirit. We are too strong in the emotion, in the will, and in the mind, but we are not strong enough in the inner man, in the spirit. We need to be strengthened in the inner man. The strengthening of God is in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RENEWED IN THE SPIRIT OF THE MIND</h2>
<p>Then in chapter four of Ephesians, after the strengthening in the inner man, there is the renewing of the spirit of the mind (v. 23). Every part of your mind needs to be completely renewed, renewed in the spirit that takes over, occupies, and possesses your mind and becomes the spirit of your mind. You may not realize how much your mind controls your spirit and even controls the Holy Spirit. Without the cooperation of your mind, the Holy Spirit could not get through in you. In this sense, the Holy Spirit is under the control of your mind. However, this is not the proper order. Both the Holy Spirit and our human spirit should be over our mind and should take full control of our mind. The mind should be set upon the spirit (Rom. 8:6), and the mind should be governed, possessed, occupied, taken over, controlled, and subdued by the spirit. Then this spirit is the renewing spirit.</p>
<p>All of us need to be renewed again and again, daily, hourly, moment by moment, all the time, in, with, and by such a renewing spirit. If such is the case, the local church life will be real and precious to you, and you will realize that there is no other way for you to go on, no other way for you to take.</p><h2 class="head1">FILLED IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In the first four chapters of Ephesians there is the seeing in the spirit (1:17), building up in the spirit (2:22), being strengthened in the spirit (3:16), and being renewed in the spirit (4:23). In chapter five Paul indicates that we need to be filled in spirit. According to 3:19, to be filled in spirit means to be filled unto all the fullness of the Godhead. When Christ makes His home in our heart, and when we are strong to apprehend with all the saints the dimensions of Christ and to know by experience His knowledge-surpassing love, we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God. All this fullness dwells in Christ (Col. 1:19; 2:9). Through His indwelling, Christ imparts what God is into our being. We can be filled with God to such a measure and standard, even unto all the fullness of God.</p>
<p>Paul says in Ephesians 5:18 that we should not be drunk with wine, as the unbelievers, filled with wine in their body, but we Christians need to be filled with God in our spirit. It is a matter of not only seeing the church in our spirit, not only being built up in the spirit, not only being strengthened in the spirit, not only being renewed in spirit, but also being filled with all that God is in Christ in our spirit.</p>
<p>It seems that we often are full in our mind, but empty in the spirit. Our spirit seems somewhat like a flat tire, but our mind and emotion are both filled up. We need to pray that we would be emptied in the mind and emptied in the emotion, but filled unto the fullness of God in our spirit. Then the church life will be very valuable to us. We will treasure the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Finally, in chapter six of Ephesians, Paul says that we need to pray at every time in spirit (v. 18). This prayer is the prayer of a member of the Body identified with Christ on the throne, all the time claiming, proclaiming, giving command to the Lord, and binding the enemy. This is not the prayer of a beggar, not begging prayer, not the prayer of the poor sinner, not the prayer of the poor, weak saints pleading with the Lord, but the prayer of the Body, the prayer of members of the Body identified with the Head.</p>
<p>These six points in the six chapters of Ephesians are crucial, and we could spend much more time on each of them. We need to see the Body in the spirit, to be built up in the spirit, to be strengthened in the spirit, to be renewed in the spirit, to be filled unto the fullness of God in the spirit, and to pray in spirit as members of the Body, identified with the Head. If such is the case, spontaneously we will have the church life. If not, it will be hard to have the church life. We may have a lot of talk about the Body life and a lot of teachings about the church, but we will have no way at all to realize what the church life actually is. I urge you again and again to turn to the spirit because the church life is in your spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SERVICE OF THE BODY<br />
IDENTIFIED WITH THE HEAD</h2>
<p>You may wonder what this matter has to do with the service. The service is a matter in the Body, and the matter of the Body is not a small thing. The Body is the Body of Christ, the One who has been enthroned and given the lordship and authority in heaven and on earth, and even under the earth. He has received all authority, and as the Body we are identified with Him. Therefore, we are in the heavenlies, we have the authority, and we can exercise the authority. If such is the case, as those who are serving the Lord, we shall serve not only with power, but also with authority.</p>
<p>Look at the situation on the day of Pentecost. Peter and the others served God with authority, not merely with the power that is according to the concept of many Christians today. Peter and the others declared, &ldquo;Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ&rdquo; (Acts 2:36). He is the Head, and we are the Body. We are one with Him. Therefore, we have not only the power, but the authority over all things.</p>
<p>Authority is much greater than power. We may illustrate in this way. Automobiles are very powerful, and there are many of them on the street. But at the signal of one policeman, all the powerful cars come to a stop. The cars have power, but the policeman has authority.</p>
<p>Are you going to serve the Lord merely with power, or are you going to serve Him with authority, which is in another category? And how could you have the authority? The authority in all the heavens and on the earth has been given to the Head, and the Head is identified with the Body. If you are not in the Body, how could you have the authority? But if you are in the Body, how could you lack the authority?</p>
<p>If we have seen the Body and we realize that we are members of the Body, we will say, &ldquo;Hallelujah, there is no need for me to serve merely with power. Authority is in the Body. I have the authority that is greater than power.&rdquo; In Luke 10:19 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;Behold, I give unto you authority...over all the power of the enemy&rdquo; (lit.). What the enemy has is merely power, but the Lord has given us the authority. The way to preach the gospel is with authority. In Matthew 28:18-19 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations.&rdquo; We need to preach the gospel not only with power, but with authority.</p>
<p>How much we need to realize that we are the members of the Body, the Body that is identified with the Head. Whatever the Head has accomplished, whatever the Head has obtained, whatever the Head has attained to, all are to the church, which is the Body. All these are not only for the church, not merely for the church, but to the church. All these are being transmitted by and in the Holy Spirit to the church, which is the Body. If you realize that you are members of such a Body, which is identified with the Head, you will say, &ldquo;There is no need for us to beg any longer. We will give the command to the Lord and to the enemy. We are members of the Body that is identified with the Christ who is enthroned as the Head and the Lord of all. There is no need for us to beg. Rather, we give the command. We bind, we loose, we command, we proclaim, and we claim.&rdquo; This is the authority for the service, the authority that is greater than power. And this is the way for us to serve the Lord. The real service is in the Body.</p>
<p>To be in the Body is not a small thing. We need to realize what kind of administration there is in this whole universe. Christ and the Body, Christ and the church, the Head and the Body, are the administration of the whole universe today. The question is whether or not you are in this administration. How can you say that you are in it? We can say that we are in this administration today because we are in the Body. Have you realized that Christ and His Body today are the administration of the whole universe? It is based upon this fact that we serve. It is based upon this fact that we preach the gospel, and it is based upon this fact that we build the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

<h1 class="title">SERVING IN OUR HUMAN SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 17:16; 18:25; 19:21; 20:22; Rom. 1:9; 2:29; 7:6; 12:11; 1 Cor. 2:4; 4:21; 5:3-4; 2 Cor. 2:13; Gal. 6:1; Col. 2:5; 2 Tim. 1:7</h1>
<p>In a number of verses the Apostle Paul tells us that he served God in his spirit, that he exercised his spirit in many different ways in the service of the Lord. By pray-reading all these verses, we receive a deep impression concerning the way the Apostle Paul served the Lord. In Paul&rsquo;s record of how he served the God of his forefathers in the Jewish religion before his conversion, he did not mention anything about his spirit in relation to serving God. (See Acts 22:2-4; 26:4-5, 9-11; Phil. 3:5-6; and Acts 9:1-2.) However, there are many verses telling us by what way, or by what organ, he served God after he met the Lord Jesus on the road to Damascus. It is very clear that the Apostle Paul served God in his spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOW TO SERVE: SERVING IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In these messages we are considering the matter of how to serve. The first point we have covered is that we need to serve in the Body. In this message we come to the second point, that we need to serve in our spirit. We are speaking here of our spirit, our human spirit. We may consider that serving in spirit means serving only in the Holy Spirit, and we may altogether neglect the matter of serving God in our human spirit. There are many verses in the New Testament which make the matter of the human spirit clear.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Holy Spirit and Our Human Spirit:<br />
The Power and the Switch</h2>
<p>As Christians, we all know that to serve God we need the Holy Spirit. Without the Holy Spirit, there is no possibility that we could serve God. However, we need a vision, a revelation, that to serve God it is necessary for us, in addition, to know our human spirit. The Holy Spirit is the power for us to serve God, and the human spirit is the organ, the means, the instrument, for us to receive and contain the power and to apply it.</p>
<p>The way to use our human spirit can be illustrated by the application of electricity. First of all, it is necessary for electricity to be installed into a building. After the electricity has been installed, what should we do when we need to use it? It would be foolish to call the power plant and ask them to send some electricity. What we need to do is simply use the switch in order to apply the electricity. If we realize that electricity has been installed already, we simply need to go to the place where there is a means for us to apply the electricity. When we turn on the switch, immediately the electricity works for us.</p>
<p>We may compare ourselves to the building, and the Holy Spirit to the heavenly, divine electricity. This spiritual &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; is the Lord Himself, and He has already been installed into us. We need to realize that we already have the heavenly electricity installed into us. Hallelujah, we do have this installation! We received this wonderful installation of Christ into us when we accepted Him. Now we know that we need the Holy Spirit, but we may not be so clear as to the way to apply the Holy Spirit who has been installed into us as the heavenly electricity. There is no need for us to fast and pray for three days and nights without sleeping. There is no need for us to pray with a loud voice in a zealous way, with tears flowing down. The heavenly electricity has already been installed into us, and there is a switch within us. When we need electricity for any purpose, we simply go to the proper place to touch the proper organ, the means to apply the electricity. We touch the switch just a little bit, and the electricity is turned on. It is so simple. This is the wonderful secret of applying the heavenly electricity.</p>
<p>The crucial question then is where to find the switch, where to find the organ, the means to apply the heavenly electricity. It is clear that neither our eyes, our mind, nor even our heart is the proper organ. God created the human spirit as the specific organ for this purpose. &ldquo;God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit,&rdquo; in the human spirit (John 4:24). Some have opposed our emphasis on the human spirit because they pay their attention only to the Holy Spirit, and they do not recognize the difference between the spirit, the mind, and the heart.</p>
<p>There is no way to tell people how they can be regenerated if you do not recognize that God has created our human spirit to contact Him. Surely an unsaved one could not be regenerated in any other part of his being, in his mind or in his heart! Regeneration is a matter in the human spirit. In John 3:6 we are told, &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; In this verse there are two spirits, the Holy Spirit and the human spirit. That which is born of the Holy Spirit is the human spirit. The human spirit is a specific organ for us to have contact with God, who is the Spirit. Our human spirit is the switch, the proper organ or the means to apply the heavenly electricity that has been installed in us.</p>
<p>Today we know where to find the switch, and we know how to use the switch, how to use our human spirit to contact the Lord, who is the divine electricity. How pitiful it would be if we could not find the switch and did not know how to touch it, how to use it to contact the Lord! The switch is the human spirit. When we speak of handling the switch, using the switch, or touching the switch, we are talking about the exercise of our human spirit. It is so simple. If I could plant a deep impression within you concerning this one matter of the exercise of our human spirit, there would be no need for me to speak any further. How crucial it is for us to learn how to exercise our human spirit, to know how to use the switch!</p><h2 class="head2">Paul&rsquo;s Human Spirit Provoked by Idols</h2>
<p>Not only was the Apostle Paul one who could say that he served God in his spirit, but he was also one who could be provoked in his human spirit when he saw the whole city of Athens full of idolatry (Acts 17:16). He was not provoked in his emotion, or in his zealous heart, but in his spirit. The pronoun &ldquo;his&rdquo; definitely indicates that it was Paul&rsquo;s spirit that was provoked. It was not the Holy Spirit within Paul that was provoked by the idols, but it was Paul&rsquo;s human spirit, regenerated and indwelt by God the Spirit. Such a human spirit was provoked at the sight of the idolatry in Athens.</p>
<p>We may not know how to be angry in the spirit, in the human spirit. There is a big difference between being angry in the emotion and being angry in the spirit. We know how to be angry in the emotion, but we may not know how to be angry in the spirit. Suppose a brother looks at me with a long face. This may offend me and cause me to be unhappy with him. My unhappiness is surely in my emotion. Then suppose he rebukes me a little bit. His rebuke may cause me to be angry with him. My anger is also in my emotion. Then suppose sometime later I see a weakness of this same brother exposed, and, in a sense, I am somewhat happy to see that brother&rsquo;s failure because he is the one who rebuked me, offended me, and caused me to be angry with him. My pleasure in condemning the brother for his weakness is likewise in my emotion. All these feelings&mdash;my unhappiness, my anger, and my happiness&mdash;are in my emotion. On the other hand, suppose you cause me to be unhappy, and you even rebuke me. Yet, when I see you as a dear brother in a situation of failure, deep within my spirit I feel genuinely sorry for you. Such a feeling must be in my spirit. Although you have offended me, I am deeply pained when I see your weakness. There is a big difference between the feelings in the emotion and the feelings in the spirit.</p>
<p>Many times in the church life our feelings are those in the emotion, not those in the spirit. When something fits in with our likes or dislikes, we have a certain feeling in our emotion, and we just give up our spirit. Even when we come to the meeting, it may be as if we had left our spirit at home. Our presence is in the meeting, but all of our feeling is in the emotion, not in the spirit. We all need to learn to exercise our spirit to the extent that we even know how to be provoked in our spirit, to be angry in our spirit. We could never be offended if we learn how to remain in our spirit. We should have no anger except the anger that comes from the exercise of the spirit.</p>
<p>If you are a person who is always in your emotion, you will be offended by people from every direction. Sometimes I offend people by not speaking to them, and sometimes I offend people just by speaking to them. Eventually I do not know whether to speak or not to speak, because others are so easily offended. It is so easy to offend anyone who is in the emotion. If you are naturally so much in the emotion, you will be very easily offended. However, I would tell the brothers, and the sisters even more, that if you are in the spirit, no one could ever offend you. Even if someone rebukes you, instead of being offended, you will praise the Lord and receive it as something for your good, something measured to you by God on the throne.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Exercising the Spirit to Terminate Gossip</h2>
<p>In any kind of human society, and in the church as well, it is so easy to have gossip. As a word of gossip spreads more and more, it will always be changed a little bit. Either some part will be left out, or something will be added. This is always the case when a rumor is spread. For example, one person may tell another that a certain thing will probably happen soon. The second person may repeat the story but omit the word probably. The third person may repeat the same story as if it had already happened.</p>
<p>Gossip, rumors, and the twisting of words are all means of spreading death. Even among the brothers and sisters it is quite possible to have problems of this kind. As an example of the twisting of words spreading death, in some of the meetings I told people that to pray in the Lord&rsquo;s name should be a reality, not a formality. Simply to add the words, &ldquo;In the name of the Lord Jesus,&rdquo; at the end of a prayer may be a formality. My words were twisted, and I was later accused in writing of saying that there is no need to pray in the name of the Lord Jesus. I never told people that there is no need to pray in the name of the Lord Jesus, but I did tell them not to make this a formality. Actually, I myself many times do say in my prayer, &ldquo;In the precious name of the Lord.&rdquo; This is an example of the way rumors twist the words and spread death.</p>
<p>If we learn to be in our spirit, we will be on guard against the death-spreading rumors. From years of experience and from suffering I have learned one secret to avoid these situations. I do not like to pass on a word from one person to another. Rather, I have learned to advise the brothers and sisters to write down their messages and mail them to one another instead of depending on me to pass on a word. I do not consider myself trustworthy, for it is easy for me to forget, and, even if I remember, I may leave out some point, or I might even add something to their word. This would damage their message. If we never pass on words for others, we will be spared that kind of suffering in the church life.</p>
<p>If we are in the spirit, many things will be terminated. There could never be deadness or deadening in the church life through gossip. In the natural life we like to know things about others and their affairs. The result is gossip. If we are in the spirit, we will be so simple. We would not care to know things about others, and gossip would be terminated. We would prefer not to know anything about others unless it is necessary because the Lord has burdened us for them.</p><h2 class="head2">The Divine Riches in the Mingled Spirit</h2>
<p>We need to spend time reading and pray-reading all the verses related to the way the Apostle Paul served God in his spirit. Paul had been a person zealous in serving the God of his forefathers, but he was zealous in his natural emotion. Now he is no longer zealous in his natural emotion, but he is burning in his regenerated spirit and burdened in his spirit.</p>
<p>Acts 19:21 tells us that &ldquo;Paul purposed in the spirit...to go to Jerusalem,&rdquo; and Acts 20:22 says that he was going to Jerusalem &ldquo;bound in the spirit.&rdquo; Some versions capitalize the word spirit in these two verses, because in Greek there is the definite article&mdash;the Spirit. It is rather hard for anyone to say whether the spirit mentioned in Acts 19:21 and 20:22 is the Holy Spirit or Paul&rsquo;s human spirit, because by that time the Holy Spirit was one with Paul&rsquo;s spirit. Paul the apostle was a person with a mingled spirit. According to 1 Corinthians 6:17, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; Who can say whether this one spirit is human or divine?</p>
<p>We need to see that all that the Father is, is now in the Son, and all that the Son has obtained, attained, and accomplished, with all that the Father is, is now in the Holy Spirit (John 16:14-15). And the Holy Spirit as the heavenly electricity has been installed into our spirit. This is too wonderful, too marvelous! We are joined to the Lord as the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, we are one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). Whenever we exercise our spirit even a little bit, the all-inclusive divine Spirit with all the fullness, the riches, of the Trinity of the Godhead, moves right away within our spirit. All that is in this heavenly electricity moves and works in us. It is not a small matter to switch on. When you switch on, you get every element of the electricity. If you exercise your spirit, all the riches, all the fullness, of the Trinity of the Godhead&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;are available to you.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT FOR THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>We have seen clearly that the Body of Christ is absolutely in the Holy Spirit, and that the Holy Spirit is absolutely in our spirit. Therefore, the Body of Christ is altogether a matter in our spirit. The book of Ephesians confirms this. Ephesians 1 tells us that we can see the church only in our spirit (vv. 17-23). Ephesians 2 tells us that the building of the church, the Body, both universally and locally, is in our spirit (vv. 20-22). Then chapter three tells us that we need to be strengthened into our inner man, the regenerated human spirit (v. 16). Chapter four tells us that we are being renewed in the spirit of our mind (v. 23), and chapter five tells us that we need to be filled in our human spirit unto all the fullness of God (v. 18, with 3:19). Finally, chapter six tells us that we need to pray as the church, as the Body, in the spirit (v. 18). From all these verses we can see that the Body is altogether a matter in our spirit.</p>
<p>Whenever we turn to our spirit and exercise our spirit, we touch the Body, because the Body is in our spirit. When we exercise our spirit and touch the Body, not only do we have power, but we have the authority, because the Body is identified with the enthroned Head, with the lordship, with the headship, and with the kingship. The authority of the Head is with the Body. When you exercise your spirit, you touch the Body, and when you touch the Body, you are in the authority of the Head. In doing any business, there is the need of capital to work with. We may say that the authority of the Head is the capital for our service. The capital that we need for service is the authority of the Head, and the way for us to touch this authority is by exercising our spirit. We touch the power in electricity by switching on. In a similar way, we touch the authority of the Head when we exercise our spirit. This is not a small thing.</p>
<p>Many dear saints are weak because they damage their spirit. Then, speaking in a practical way, they are out of the reality of the Body. When you are out of the reality of the Body, you are powerless. You have no power because you lose the practical connection with the Body. Your spirit can be damaged by only a little bit of gossiping, a little bit of murmuring, or a little bit of dissatisfaction. Even a very thin piece of paper that gets into a switch can cut off the flow of electricity. When this happens, the power is lost. A little bit of murmuring, a little bit of gossiping, or a little bit of dissatisfaction with certain brothers is enough to cut you off from the flow of the divine electricity.</p>
<p>You may think that a little gossip or a little criticism of others is not very important. But just as a piece of very thin paper can cut off the flow of electricity, only a little gossip or criticism is sufficient to cause you to be out of the spirit and, therefore, out of the reality of the Body. From experience I know too well that a very small thing in my spirit disconnects me from the flow of the heavenly electricity. Then I am through, I am finished, as far as the power and authority are concerned. There is no power and no authority, because the power and the authority of the Head are in the Body, not in me individually, and the Body is absolutely a matter in the spirit. Therefore, all the time we need to keep ourselves in our spirit connected to the Holy Spirit. Then we will have not only the power but also the authority of the Head. When we turn to the spirit, we get into the reality of the Body, and in the Body we are empowered and authorized by the Head.</p><h2 class="head2">Ministering Christ to Others<br />
by the Exercise of the Spirit</h2>
<p>The main purpose of the spiritual service is to minister life to others, to minister Christ to others. This Christ as life is in our spirit. If we do not know how to exercise our spirit, how to apply our spirit, it is impossible for us to minister Christ as life to others. We may not minister life, but instead minister knowledge, teaching in letters, because we do not know how to exercise our spirit and because we are not in our spirit. In that kind of ministry there is no life and no ministry of the living Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Demonstration of the Spirit</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 2:4 Paul says that, when he came to the Corinthians, he did not use enticing words, persuasive words, but he came to them with the demonstration of his spirit. &ldquo;And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.&rdquo; Enticing words of wisdom issue from the human mind and come out of the mouth; the demonstration of the Spirit comes forth from the human spirit. Paul&rsquo;s words came from his spirit with the release of the Spirit and therefore with power. The Corinthians may have thought that Paul was a fool, but there was a demonstration of the spirit. Where there is the demonstration of the spirit, there is power. It is not a matter of speaking enticing words of wisdom by exercising our mind, but a matter of exercising our spirit to release Christ as life and minister Him to others.</p>
<p>In the church meetings we all need to behave ourselves by the demonstration of our spirit. We should not care for eloquent speaking. We all need to demonstrate our spirit. Instead of eloquence, we need utterance. Utterance is different from eloquence. Eloquence is something natural. Some are born with eloquence, whereas others lack eloquence and are awkward in speaking. Yet they may know how to demonstrate the spirit and have the utterance. Utterance comes from the spirit.</p>
<p>Our one need is to learn how to exercise our human spirit. Christ has accomplished everything, He has obtained everything, and He has attained to the headship. Everything is completed, everything is ready, and, thank Him, everything has been installed into us. From my experience I can tell you that what we need is to learn how to exercise our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Baptism of the Holy Spirit on the Body</h2>
<p>Today many Christians talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit. For more than forty years I have been paying attention to this matter with different groups of believers who were trying in different ways to realize the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Now I can tell you the good news that the baptism of the Holy Spirit has been accomplished absolutely on the Body already, just as the crucifixion of Christ has already been finished. On the cross at the very end the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;It is finished&rdquo; (John 19:30). Crucifixion to accomplish redemption is finished. Therefore, redemption today is an accomplished fact. There is no need for you to do anything or for Him to do anything. You simply need to take it. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is the same in principle. The ascended Head has baptized the whole church, His Body, into the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13). This baptism is an accomplished fact, and it has been accomplished on the Body.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost the Head baptized the Jewish part of His Body directly into Himself (Acts 2:4). Then in the house of Cornelius the ascended Head baptized the Gentile part of His Body into Himself (Acts 10:44-47). Because the Head baptized the Body directly on these two occasions, there was no laying on of hands. By these two steps, with these two portions of His baptizing, the ascended Head has accomplished the baptism of the Holy Spirit on the Body already. From that point on, whoever is saved and joined to the Body enjoys the baptism on the Body. With some particular cases there is the need for the laying on of hands, as in Acts 8:14-17, 9:17, and 19:2-7. To lay hands on someone is to represent the Body in accepting the new member and to transmit what is upon the Body to the new member. As we have seen, the Body is in our spirit. Therefore, whenever we turn to our spirit, we are entitled to claim the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is ours. The one thing we all need to learn is to exercise our spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">A Flexible Life in the Spirit</h2>
<p>We have covered two main aspects of the exercise of the spirit. Number one, to touch the Body and to be authorized in the Body you need to turn yourself to the spirit. Then, number two, to minister Christ as life to others you need to turn to the spirit. On this point we need some further illustrations.</p>
<p>Suppose I have the burden to visit a certain brother. As a rule, before I go I would pray and consider what I should do and what I should say to him. Then I would carry out what I had decided. But I say emphatically that this is wrong. Eventually I learned the lesson simply to pray, &ldquo;Lord, I am going to see my brother. Lord, You go with me. I don&rsquo;t know what to say, but You know.&rdquo; Many times in the past I made a decision to say a certain thing to a brother, but when I was with him, there was something different in my spirit. If I had carried out what I had decided, I would have been in the mind, not in the spirit. We should not do this. We need to be available to the Lord&rsquo;s present leading, flexible toward Him. Many times before I went to see a brother, I had a burden to say a certain thing, but when the time came I said nothing. I was simply there&mdash;that is all. The brother would ask me why I had come, and I would tell him that I had come simply to be there with him. Eventually this proved to be the best way. We all need to learn to be in the spirit. Sometimes I had to change what I was going to say in the middle of a sentence. After I had uttered the subject, the predicate had to be changed from what I had intended. Without such a change, I would have done some damage. But by that change, some profit came instead of the damage. We all need to learn to be living in our spirit, flexible in the spirit, with nothing decided, nothing settled, nothing fixed. Here is a lesson for us to learn. If we exercise our spirit, we are in the Body, we are entitled, we are authorized with the Body, and we have something of Christ to minister to others as life because we are in the spirit with Him. He as the life-giving Spirit is now in our spirit. If we exercise our spirit, He will come out along with our exercise of our spirit, and that will be life ministered to others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">No Longer Dust to Be Food for the Serpent</h2>
<p>On the negative side, we all know that in the Bible Satan, the evil one, is likened to a serpent. In Genesis 3, God destined the serpent to eat dust. Dust is the food of the serpent. We all need to realize that our natural life is a life of dust. Our natural life, our soulish life, is very dusty, very earthy, and it is good to be food for the serpent, the Devil. Whenever you behave yourself in the soul, you are qualified to be the food for the serpent. You should not think that a little bit of gossip is a small thing. Just a little gossip makes you good food for the serpent. First Peter 5:8 tells us that the Devil, like a roaring lion, is walking about on this earth seeking those he can swallow up. However, he is not foolish. On the contrary, he is very clever, and he is subtle. He can get into you without you realizing what he has done, just as germs that you cannot see can come in and make you sick. Before you know that the serpent is there, he has eaten you already.</p>
<p>The only way to escape being eaten by the serpent is to turn yourself to the spirit. Whenever you live, behave, act, move, do things, and say things in the soul, you are good for the serpent to eat. This is why there are many members in the Body, but only a few function. Many are food for the serpent. The little foxes are so cunning, so subtle! Some brothers and sisters are offended just by a long face. Others are offended by a little instruction or a little fellowship that is not according to their liking. Then the offended ones try to vindicate themselves by going to this one and that one to maintain that they are right and others are wrong. It might be that they are right, but only right to become food for the enemy. Once you get even a little bit involved in this kind of thing, you are deadened within as a result.</p>
<p>From experience we have learned that the problem today in the practice of the church life is absolutely a matter with us. If you would keep yourself in your spirit all the time, you would never be good for food to feed the serpent. May the Lord be merciful to us. No matter how long others&rsquo; faces may be toward me, no matter what kind of instruction or fellowship may come to me, I would be in the spirit. As long as I am in the spirit, I am no longer food to feed the serpent.</p>
<p>Only the earthy things, only the dusty things, are the food of the serpent. The fleshly life and the soulish life are good to be the food of the serpent. This is why in the church life there is no possibility that we would be living in the spirit and yet have complaining, self-vindication, and self-justification. All of us know that whenever we say something for ourselves, whenever we vindicate something of our own, we are through with the spirit. It might be that we are right according to the tree of knowledge of good and evil, but we are good to be food for the serpent. We spread death to others, and we ourselves are swallowed up by the enemy. Then we are through. You may come to the meeting and may still partake of the service, but there is no life and no ministry of life. There is no spirit and there is nothing living. Life cannot be imitated; it cannot be copied. If you stand up to speak without life, others will sense the death and the deadening because you are not in the spirit, but in the soul. To practice the church life is absolutely a matter in the human spirit.</p>
<p>As long as we are in the human spirit, we are in the Body. We are authorized, not only empowered, but authorized in the Body, and we are one with Christ to minister Him as life. We are delivered from the subtlety of the little serpent. His eating could never damage us because we are in the spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">SERVE BY PRAYING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 1:14; 2:42; 3:1; 4:31; 6:4; 10:9; 11:5; 12:5, 12; 13:2-3; 14:23; 16:25-26; 20:36; 21:5; 22:17; 28:8</h1>
<p>To serve the Lord and to serve the church, it is necessary for us to be in the Body and to serve in the Body, and it is also necessary to serve in our human spirit. We have already covered these two points. The third point of the service is that we need to serve in prayer, to serve by praying.</p>
<p>If we consider all the verses in the book of Acts related to the matter of prayer, we will see that the first group of Christians in the early days served the Lord by means of prayer. If we look into the content of all the verses, if we read and pray-read them, we will see that the serving ones took the way of prayer. We may be surprised how much the service in the book of Acts is a matter of prayer. The book of Acts is a long book, covering quite a long period of time, and it includes many serving ones: Peter and the other disciples who took Jerusalem as a center, and later, Paul the apostle with his co-workers who took Antioch as another center. In all the chapters you could not find one verse that tells you they had some plan, some program, some schedule, or even some convention or conference to have a discussion about organizing their service to the Lord. In every case all the different serving ones took only one way, and that was the way of prayer. Every part of their service, every bit of their work for the Lord, was initiated by prayer. This is a crucial matter. They had no other way, used no other method, and took no other means for the Lord&rsquo;s work, for His service, but the unique way of prayer. Their way was absolutely different from the way of the religious organizations today. In the early days of the churches, the apostles and all the saints served the Lord in the way of prayer. We need to be impressed with the crucial point that they had no other way, no other method, no other means.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF PRAYER FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE</h2>
<p>In relation to a practical matter among us, we do sense the leading of the Lord that some of the saints would move out from Los Angeles to some other cities next year, 1970. In our fellowship we have called this move of the Lord among us a migration. Many dear ones are ready to make such a move for the spreading of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in this country. However, I have a deep conviction within me that we all need to be very clear that the migration is not a matter of human organization, not a movement under the human hand, but absolutely something in the spirit. We need to be clear concerning many practical items&mdash;who should stay here in Los Angeles to maintain a strong testimony, who should go out to other cities, which cities should be covered, and who should go to which city. We do believe that this is the Lord&rsquo;s move among us, but with each one of us it must be a matter in the spirit. The only way we can be clear concerning all of these practical matters is by prayer, not by the way of organization, not by the way of human assignment.</p>
<p>Those who are clear that they should move out need to pray very much about the place where they should go. No one can tell what the Lord will do, and no one can predict where the Lord will lead. We all must pray. It would be wonderful if the Lord would lead so that some could go out to cover all the leading cities of this country. However, in the initial stage He may grant the guidance to some of the brothers and sisters to cover only the leading cities along the west coast. Perhaps in the first stage the Lord would lead the saints to cover only some of the strategic points, and then maybe something further in the next stage. The whole matter is not in our hand. We are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and we need to drop the old way of religion and be delivered fully out of the influence of that old way.</p>
<p>In practical matters such as these related to the Lord&rsquo;s move, we should not expect the leading ones or anyone else to tell us what we should do or where we should go. That way of organization is wrong, and we need to be delivered from the influence of that way, the old way practiced in religion. We need to come back to the pure Word to see the way taken in the early days by the first group of Christians in serving the Lord. There was no organization, no arrangement, no schedule, no plan, and no raising of funds. There was hardly any mention of money or finances, and no one exercised control over the situation. The conference in chapter fifteen of Acts did not concern the work, but the teaching, the doctrine, and the faith of the church.</p>
<p>If you take away all the schedules, the programs, the plans, and the conventions, the conferences, and the fund-raising, the talk about money, and the human manipulation&mdash; if you take away all these things, there may be very little left in today&rsquo;s religious organizations. I believe that we are quite clear that we do not want to take that way in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Although we may have no intention of following that way, I am nevertheless concerned that something of that old way still remains within us, unconsciously, subconsciously, influencing us. Due to such an influence, we may have some consideration within us that after a period of training in Los Angeles we would be sent out to another city. In our consideration, we would then make our training the same as a seminary, a Bible school, or a Bible institute. This is absolutely not the Lord&rsquo;s way, and it is not the way we are taking. The Lord&rsquo;s way is a way in prayer. How much we need a deep realization that the Lord&rsquo;s way is absolutely a way in prayer.</p>
<p>In relation to the practical matters of who should go to which city, who will go together with whom, when will be the right time for some to go, and by what means some shall be able to go, it is altogether up to the Lord. Concerning these matters, we should simply pray. We should not expect some of the leading ones to make some arrangements and then make assignments. Actually, it would be easy for the leading ones to assign a certain number of families to this city, and a certain number to that one, but this is not the Lord&rsquo;s way. How much we need to be impressed with the need to take the Lord&rsquo;s way. The Lord&rsquo;s way is absolutely a way of prayer.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF PRAYER FOR OUR SERVING</h2>
<p>Not only is the Lord&rsquo;s way of prayer the way to carry out the matter of moving out to other cities for the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, but it is also the way to take care of such matters as the cleaning of the meeting hall and arranging the chairs for the meeting. For these practical everyday matters, we need much prayer. How good it would be to see so many saints coming into the service in the church here without any arrangement and without any assignment, but coming to serve by praying. How wonderful it would be to have all the service carried out by means of prayer.</p>
<p>To serve by praying, it is necessary for us to serve in our human spirit. This is the number one item. To pray is altogether a matter in the human spirit. Just as seeing is a matter of the eyes, hearing, a matter of the ears, and walking, a matter of the feet, in the same way, praying is a matter of the spirit. To serve by praying means to serve by using our human spirit. The way to use our human spirit, to exercise our spirit, is to pray. To pray is the best way to exercise our spirit. Therefore, to say that we serve by praying is to say that we serve in the spirit.</p>
<p>We do expect that every member would be a functioning member, but we do not like to see the functioning under the assignment of the leading ones. The unique way for us to come together and serve together is the way of prayer. How much prayer we need in our serving together. When we come to arrange the chairs for the meeting, each one of us has to come with much prayer. Then before we begin to take care of the chairs, we need to pray together, to pray very much for the arranging, pray for the seating, pray for our service, pray for everything we are going to do in the church service. There is a great difference between the service that is full of prayer and the service that is done without prayer. These are two entirely different kinds of services; one is a service full of prayer, even with a lot of prayer poured out over the service, and the other, a service that is merely doing many things. There is a great difference between the two.</p>
<p>In the same way, there is a great difference between visiting the saints or visiting the unbelievers with the visitation that is full of prayer and the visitation that has very little prayer. Without prayer, there will be poverty in the service. The riches, even the enriching power in the service, come with much prayer. We need an appetite for prayer. Not only do we need to pray individually, but we need to come together to pray. We should not try to initiate anything, to start anything, or to do anything without adequate prayer. We need to learn to pray adequately.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF PRAYER IN ACTS</h2>
<p>If we read through the book of Acts, even if we read through this book again and again, we may be surprised that we cannot find one hint that in the early days the apostles and the disciples tried to use any means other than prayer to solve their problems and to carry on their work. The more we read through this book, the more we realize that prayer was the only way, the unique way, for them to meet every situation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Continuing in Prayer in One Accord</h2>
<p>If we look into the verses in Acts related to prayer, we will find many crucial points concerning prayer. The beginning of the Christian service in the whole universe is recorded in the first chapter of Acts, and that beginning was entirely a matter of prayer. The early Christians started the service by praying. &ldquo;These all were continuing steadfastly with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren&rdquo; (Acts 1:14, lit.). All the words in the original text of this verse are very meaningful, especially in helping us understand by what way the early disciples prayed. This verse begins with the words &ldquo;these all,&rdquo; which indicates that the prayer here was the prayer of a corporate body, not the prayer of individuals. There were one hundred twenty people, including the twelve and the other disciples. It is significant that the sisters are mentioned here, even one of them by name. This prayer in the upper room is corporate prayer, the prayer of a corporate body, not the prayer of individuals.</p>
<p>Two points here are particularly striking. The first is that they were continuing steadfastly in prayer, and the second is that they prayed in one accord. The translation is not adequate to convey the full meaning of the Greek words in this verse. They gave themselves, they devoted themselves, to the matter of prayer with a persevering spirit. They persevered in the matter of prayer. They even gave themselves up to the matter of prayer. Of course, we could realize that what is indicated in this verse is not a matter of praying occasionally within those ten days. I do believe that within those ten days they did nothing but pray. They devoted themselves steadfastly, continually, and perseveringly to the matter of prayer.</p>
<p>I do hope that some of the brothers who are burdened to move out to other cities for the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery would come together to devote themselves to this kind of persevering prayer for the Lord&rsquo;s move.</p>
<p>The second striking point is that the early disciples prayed in the way of being in one accord. The Greek word <em>homothumadon</em> here is quite meaningful. It indicates that they all had the same one mind, will, and purpose. They were all one, not only in one spirit to pray in the spirit, but they were in one mind, in one will, and in one purpose. When we come to pray in the church service, we need to come in the way of being in one accord. We may come together to serve, but each one of us may come in the way of having our own mind, our own will, and our own purpose. You have your mind, and I have mine. You have your will, and I have mine. You have your purpose, and I have mine. Then in the prayer we may even fight with one another. In the prayer you fight for your mind, will, and purpose, and I fight for mine. But how could this kind of prayer be prevailing? This kind of prayer could not touch the throne of authority. When we come together to pray, each one of us needs to forget our own mind, will, and purpose. We need to take the mind of Christ, take the will of the Lord, and be burdened for the purpose of God. Then we will be one. We will be one not only in the spirit, but also in the mind, the will, and the purpose.</p>
<p>We may not realize that the Holy Spirit was already with the disciples before the day of Pentecost. However, if the indwelling Spirit were not with the disciples, it would have been impossible for one hundred twenty people to be one in praying for ten days. It is true that they had not yet received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, the outward baptism of the Holy Spirit. But on the day of resurrection, when the Lord breathed on them and said to them, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit,&rdquo; they received the indwelling Spirit of life (John 20:22). Therefore, here in Acts chapter one, before the day of Pentecost, they were very spiritual. They may not have been powerful, but they were very spiritual. In no other way could one hundred twenty people have been one in their mind, will, and purpose for ten days.</p>
<p>How much we need this kind of prayer among us! The brothers and sisters need to follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading to come together to pray and to devote themselves continually, perseveringly, to this kind of prayer with one mind, one will, and one purpose. There should not be the activity of a human hand to arrange the practical things for the service, to make assignments; rather, all of the service should come out of this kind of prayer.</p><h2 class="head2">A Continuation of Praying Ones</h2>
<p>Not only did the apostles, the first group of serving ones, pray in this way, but the first group of new converts after the day of Pentecost continued to pray in the same manner. &ldquo;They were continuing steadfastly in the teaching of the apostles and in the fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in the prayers&rdquo; (Acts 2:42, lit.). They continued to pray in this way because they saw the example. They were brought to the Lord by a group of serving ones who prayed in this way. Therefore, after they received the Lord, they became the same as those leaders. Those serving ones prayed, and these who were converted through them prayed in the same way. In the first chapter of Acts there are the praying serving ones, and in the second chapter there are the praying converts.</p>
<p>If we are not persons who pray all the time, we could never cause one that we bring to the Lord to pray continually. What kind of person we are determines what kind of person we could beget. Those we bring to the Lord, the new converts, will be a reflection of what we are. Only one who prays all the time could bring others to the Lord and cause them to pray all the time. The point we need to see here is that if the leading brothers in the church are not praying ones, the others in the church will not be praying ones either. No matter how much the leading ones may exhort the saints to pray, their exhorting is in the realm of doctrine and teaching if they do not pray themselves. Their exhorting is not the leading of the flock. In a flock, the first few sheep go ahead in a certain way, and all the others follow in the same way.</p>
<p>In Acts 4:31 there is the demonstration of the power of corporate prayer. &ldquo;And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with boldness.&rdquo; By praying they shook the earth, and by praying they received the power. By praying they could speak the word of God with boldness. I am afraid that many times there is a shortage of boldness in the functioning of the dear ones in our meetings. The sisters may try to excuse themselves by saying that they are the weaker ones. But there should be no excuse. All of us need to have adequate prayer so that we will be equipped and enabled to speak forth in the meetings with boldness.</p>
<p>In Acts chapter six we are told that it is not right for the apostles to leave the word of God and prayer to take care of matters related to eating. The apostles told the people again that they would give themselves to prayer <em>(proskarteresomen,</em> the same word as in Acts 1:14). &ldquo;But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word&rdquo; (Acts 6:4). They devoted themselves perseveringly to prayer. Here prayer is mentioned before the ministry of the Word, which indicates that the prayer is more important than the ministry of the Word. The power, the life, and the impact of the Word come from the prayer. Therefore, we need to pray before we minister the Word, and we all need to pray before we come to the meeting to prophesy. Without a praying spirit, it is rather hard to have a prophesying spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Speaking in Our Prayer</h2>
<p>In Acts chapter ten we need to be impressed that both Peter and Cornelius had a specific hour set aside for prayer, the prayer hour. This matter was mentioned already in Acts 3:1, when Peter and John went to the temple at the hour of prayer. At that time they were not so clear. In the beginning, they did not realize that there was no need for them to go to the physical temple. But later on, in chapter ten Peter was on the housetop, and the housetop became his temple (Acts 10:9). Cornelius prayed within his house, and that house became a temple to him (Acts 10:2-4). Both Peter and Cornelius had specific times, certain hours, for prayer, and they kept the hours of prayer. The vision concerning the Gentiles being brought into the Body was revealed to both sides through prayer. At one end, Cornelius received the vision by prayer, and at the other end, Peter likewise received the vision by prayer. We need to take note that the whole matter was carried out by means of prayer.</p>
<p>There should be many testimonies among us concerning how the Lord has spoken to us through our prayer and how He has joined us together for the service through our prayer. I long to hear such testimonies before the time comes for the moving out to other cities, for the migration. We may hear that the Lord has put together a certain number of families for His move not by their discussion, but by their prayer. Such things have happened among us in the past. Once when I was praying, the Lord spoke something to me concerning a particular brother. At the same time, while that brother was praying, the Lord spoke something to him about me and about both of us. Then, when we came together, we found that the Lord had spoken to each of us in our prayer in the same way. According to this principle, many times the Lord confirms His speaking by speaking the same thing to two persons separately in their prayer.</p><h2 class="head2">A Testimony of Experience</h2>
<p>I received the Lord&rsquo;s calling in 1925, but it was not until eight years later that I had the boldness to give up my job to enter into fulltime service for the Lord. In August, 1933, the Lord had raised up things in my environment to force me to drop my job. I was pressed not only outwardly but also inwardly. I was burdened because of the need around me, and I was pressed because of the Lord&rsquo;s pleasure in my spirit. There was real pleasure within my spirit at the prospect of giving up my job. However, at that time, thirty-six years ago, in my part of the country there was no such thing as anyone taking this way of serving the Lord without being hired by anyone or supported by any organization. It was rather hard to contemplate such a venture.</p>
<p>During that month there was a real struggle going on within me. Inwardly, I was pressed and bothered to the point that I felt I could not go on, even I could not live, if I did not give up that job; nevertheless, I did not dare to do it. To me that little job was just like the little boat to Peter. If I gave up the boat, I would be the second Peter to jump into the sea. Therefore, I had decided that I would not be that foolish; I would keep the little boat. In the first three weeks of August I was extremely troubled and perplexed, and I was having a very difficult time in my struggle with the Lord over this matter.</p>
<p>After the church prayer meeting on Wednesday, August 23, I went to my study room and was alone there with the Lord until midnight. At a certain point I found it impossible to pray. It was as if the Lord said to me, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re through talking. If you take this way, take it. If you don&rsquo;t take it, that&rsquo;s all; I am finished with you. I am through with you.&rdquo; I did not say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to my prayer. With tears I simply said, &ldquo;All right, I take it.&rdquo; That was all.</p>
<p>The next day I submitted my resignation from my job, and the following day I received a letter from Manchuria inviting me to go there. This was my first invitation to go to a distant place to minister the Word of the Lord. That was a definite confirmation of my decision. But notice what followed. When I returned from Manchuria in the middle of September, there was a letter waiting for me at home. It was dated August 17, just the middle of those three weeks during which I was struggling with the Lord. The letter was written by Brother Watchman Nee. He had written it on board ship while on the Mediterranean Sea on his way from England back to China, and it reached me the middle of September, after I returned from my trip to Manchuria for the Lord&rsquo;s ministry.</p>
<p>The letter was brief. We were not in the habit of corresponding with one another, and a long time had elapsed since we had last heard from one another. Within a year&rsquo;s time we may have written to each other once or twice. All of a sudden such a short letter came to me, written at exactly the time I was struggling with the Lord. I could never forget what it said. &ldquo;Dear Brother Witness, As to your future, I feel you have to serve the Lord with your full time. How do you feel? May the Lord lead you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was excited and full of joy! I said, &ldquo;Lord, You are too gracious to me. This is the second confirmation.&rdquo; Two letters confirmed my resignation from my job, first the one from Manchuria, and then the one from Brother Nee.</p>
<p>On the day I received that letter I made the decision to go to Shanghai to see Brother Nee and find out why he wrote that letter. He told me that one day while on the Mediterranean, he was with the Lord concerning the Lord&rsquo;s move and His recovery in China. During that time he had a deep realization within him that he must write me that letter. In this way the Lord spoke to two persons far removed from one another concerning the same matter.</p>
<p>I long to see things like this happening among us again and again. In the past, I have seen this kind of thing. In the Lord&rsquo;s service, any kind of arrangement, any kind of organizing, is a handicap to the Lord&rsquo;s move. We all need to avoid frustrations of this kind. Therefore, we need to learn to pray.</p><h2 class="head2">Prayer Bringing Us into an Ecstasy</h2>
<p>Now we come to Acts 11:5, where Peter tells us something quite strange: &ldquo;I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in an ecstasy I saw a vision&rdquo; (lit.). The King James Version translates the word &ldquo;ecstasy&rdquo; as &ldquo;trance&rdquo;; however, the word ecstasy is an anglicized form of the Greek word used here. Ecstasy may be defined as great joy with the spirit uplifted. To be in ecstasy you need to be beside yourself. Peter prayed, and he was in an ecstasy. He was beside himself with great joy with his spirit uplifted. In the past I have had a number of experiences like this. All of us need to pray and continue praying until we come to the point that we are beside ourselves with great joy and with our spirit not only uplifted, but transcendent to the third heaven. At that point, you would forget your name, forget who you are, and forget where you are. All of us need this kind of experience.</p>
<p>If you have never had such an experience in prayer to be brought into an ecstasy, you could be compared to Peter in the Gospels, but you could not be compared to Peter in Acts 11. We all need to pray, to continue in prayer, to release our spirit to such an extent that we do not know where we are or who we are, but we are full of joy, transcendent, beside ourselves, and even outside of ourselves. How could we come into such an experience? The unique way is to learn to pray and to continue in prayer. When your prayer brings you into an experience that could be entitled an ecstasy, surely the vision will come. At that point, your whole being will be changed. Your concept, your understanding of the things of the Lord, even your understanding of the words we are speaking, will be different because you will no longer be concealed in yourself, in such a small self, but you will be outside of yourself. If you are walking on the street in Los Angeles, you have a certain impression of the city of Los Angeles. But if you get into the air and look down, your impression of the city is quite different. We all need to be outside of ourselves, to get into the heavenly vision, and to look down at the situation. Then everything will be different, and everything will become very clear to you.</p>
<p>Now we come to Acts chapter twelve, where Peter was imprisoned, and the church was praying. &ldquo;Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him&rdquo; (v. 5). The church prayed not only unceasingly; the word used here also means that they prayed fervently and earnestly. Here is a real picture of the service of the Christians in the early days. They did not try any other way to release Peter. Their unique way was to pray, to pray earnestly, fervently, unto the Lord. Then the angel came, the prison was opened, and Peter was freed. &ldquo;And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying&rdquo; (v. 12). I like this verse. Peter went to a sister&rsquo;s house, a sister named Mary, a sister who was also a mother. I do hope all the sisters would have a home for prayer, and I hope you all would be the mothers to the younger saints. Peter went to the home of Mary, where many were gathered together praying. The earnest prayer for Peter&rsquo;s release is a picture of their service to the Lord.</p>
<p>In Acts chapter thirteen we see that the way the apostles received their leading, how they were sent out, how they were coordinated, was altogether the way of praying and fasting. &ldquo;Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas,...and Saul. As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them. And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away&rdquo; (vv. 1-3). We all need to pay our full attention to this matter, that we may learn this unique way for the Lord&rsquo;s service. No one can tell you with whom you should go out, where you should go, or what is the right way for you to carry out the ministry. Not even the church here can tell you these things. We all need to pray and continue to pray until the Holy Spirit speaks to us within our spirit and makes us clear what is the way to go out, who are the ones with whom we will be coordinated, and where we shall go. The way of prayer is the unique way for the Lord&rsquo;s service.</p>
<p>In Acts 14:23 with the appointing of the elders, the apostles prayed with fastings: &ldquo;And when they had appointed them elders in every church, and had prayed with fastings, they committed them to the Lord, into whom they believed&rdquo; (lit.). They prayed not merely with one fasting, but with several, perhaps many, fastings.</p>
<p>Now we come to chapter sixteen. It was midnight, and Paul and Silas were in prison. &ldquo;And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them&rdquo; (v. 25). The literal meaning here is that, when Paul and Silas were praying at midnight in the prison, they sang hymns to God. In their praying, the two apostles sang hymns to God. It may not seem logical to us for them to cause such a disturbance at that hour with so many other prisoners there trying to sleep. As servants of the Lord, we have the concept that we should behave properly and not disturb anyone. However, that night in the prison Paul and Silas were beside themselves. In their prayer I do believe at a certain point they were also in an ecstasy, and they started to sing hymns. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! They created a real stir, and all the people were disturbed. Then suddenly there was an earthquake: &ldquo;And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one&rsquo;s bands were loosed&rdquo; (v. 26). The singing may have caused the first disturbance, but the earthquake caused a bigger one! The fetters fell down, the doors were opened, and the prisoners were released.</p>
<p>We need to learn that there are times we should not be too logical, too well-behaved. Our prayer may bring us into an ecstasy that will cause us to make some noise that could disturb others, that could even cause them to think that we are beside ourselves. Out of your prayer you may be led to do something on the campuses. Those on the campus may be disturbed by your singing. Perhaps at a certain time out of your prayer you may be led to stand up in one of your classes to say something about Jesus Christ. These matters are not related to some kind of teaching concerning how to carry on a work on the campuses. That kind of teaching does not work. Everything must come out of your prayer, even the prayer that brings you into an ecstasy.</p>
<p>In Acts 20:36 we see that the Apostle Paul again did something that was not logical. All the believers had gone to the seashore to send him off on his journey, and, after he had finished speaking, he knelt down to pray, and all the others knelt down also. &ldquo;And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.&rdquo; In the next chapter, the believers again came to the seashore with all their families to see Paul off. &ldquo;We departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed&rdquo; (Acts 21:5). When we go to the airport to see someone off, have you ever considered that we all might kneel down to pray right in the airport? No doubt that would create a big stir.</p>
<p>In 1935 we had public gospel preaching on the streets in the evenings, with a good number of the brothers and sisters there. Some would stand there preaching, others maintained the order, but most of the saints knelt down on the street to pray. Again in 1946 in Nanking, the capital of China, we did the same thing. Before the preaching, many brothers and sisters knelt down on the street to pray, to shout, to cry to the Lord. Even while the preaching was going on, a good number continued to kneel there supporting the preaching until it was over. That was really a wonderful display of prayer that subdued the evil spirits and conquered the rebellious spirit.</p>
<p>Truthfully, Christians are enthusiastic people, not logical people. We need to be beside ourselves. In a proper sense, we should not be people so much in our sober minds, but people of prayer in a heavenly ecstasy. To do these things in an outward way to follow a teaching does not work. But if we have adequate prayer in the spirit, our prayer will bring us into an ecstasy just as in the case of Paul and that of Peter. Paul told us that he was in an ecstasy when he was praying in the temple (Acts 22:17).</p>
<p>Then in Acts 28:8 we see the Apostle Paul praying for the healing of a sick person: &ldquo;Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.&rdquo; That was not the demonstration of a gift of healing, but the normal activity of one who served the Lord. Whether you have some special gift of healing or not, wherever you go, you need to pray for any you meet who are sick. The healing in Acts 28 was not anything unusual, but the result of the normal prayer of the serving one.</p>
<p>If we consider all these verses from the book of Acts, we will see many aspects of the prayer life for the Lord&rsquo;s service. We could pray at any time, in any place, and in any way&mdash;at the seashore, in the temple, at home, on the top of the house, in the city, alone or with others, in any place, at any time, at the sixth hour, the fourth hour, the ninth hour, or at midnight. We need to pray to such an extent that the prayer brings us into an ecstasy. If we have never had this kind of experience, we simply need to pray, to pray forgetting about ourselves, forgetting about our environment, looking to the Lord, praising, declaring, proclaiming His transcendency and His virtues. If you will do this, without doubt you will find yourself in an ecstasy.</p><h1 class="series">Part II<br /><br />

<h1 class="title">THE SERVICE<br />
OF THE PRIESTHOOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rom. 12:1-2, 4-6</h1>
<p>In the Christian life there are always two aspects, the matter of life and the matter of service. As the Lord&rsquo;s children, we need a proper spiritual life, and we need the proper spiritual service. The proper Christian service is a matter of life, and it is in the Body. Such a spiritual service is presented as the priesthood in 1 Peter 2:5. &ldquo;You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, into a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The holy priesthood in this verse is the spiritual house. The spiritual house built up together with the saints is the holy priesthood. The house is the priesthood, and the priesthood is the house. These are two aspects of one thing, two aspects of the building up together of the saints. This building up is the house of God, and it is the priesthood of God&mdash;not merely priests, but a priesthood.</p>
<p>Verse 9 continues with the royal priesthood: &ldquo;But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a possession, so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.&rdquo; This royal priesthood is the spiritual house. These three matters are crucial: the spiritual house, the holy priesthood, and the royal priesthood. On one hand, the priesthood is holy; on the other hand, the priesthood is royal.</p>
<p>Paul deals with the matter of the Christian life and the matter of the Christian service in the book of Romans. The service is in Romans 12. &ldquo;I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your most reasonable service. And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind, that you may prove by testing what the will of God is, that which is good, well-pleasing, and perfect&rdquo; (vv. 1-2). Many bodies are offered as one unique sacrifice, not many sacrifices, but one sacrifice with many bodies.</p>
<p>This good, acceptable, and perfect will of God is continued in verse 4. &ldquo;For as in one body we have many members, and all members have not the same function, so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another. And having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us exercise them accordingly: whether prophecy, according to the proportion of faith; or service, in the service; or he who teaches, in teaching.&rdquo; All the Christian services are in the Body. If you have the Body with the Body practice, the Body expression, and the Body life, then you have the Christian service.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE AND SERVICE</h2>
<p>In this chapter we are dealing with the practical aspect of the Christian life, that is, the service. With us as Christians there are always two aspects. The first aspect is a matter of the Christian life, a life matter, and the second aspect is a matter of the Christian service, a service matter. As the Lord&rsquo;s children, on the one hand we need a proper life, a spiritual life, and on the other hand we need a proper service, a spiritual service.</p>
<p>In Matthew 25 the Lord Jesus gave two parables, the parable of the ten virgins, which deals with the Christian life, and the parable of the talents, which is related to our service. As far as our life is concerned, we should be as the virgins with the testimony of light in our hand as we go out of this world to meet our Bridegroom. This is our life, the life aspect. We need the oil, and we need the testimony of light. We need to go out of this world, to wait for the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, and to go on to meet His coming. This is the Christian life.</p>
<p>Immediately following this parable, the Lord gave us the parable of the talents, which is something related to our service. We need to use the talent, the gift, which the Lord has given us, to do some business and to make some profit for the Lord. With the Lord&rsquo;s children there are always these two aspects, the life and the service. We need to grow in life with the oil, with the light, and with the going out of this world to meet the Lord in His coming back. We also need to exercise in a proper way what the Lord has given us as a gift, as a talent.</p>
<p>In the Epistle to the Romans the Apostle Paul covers these two aspects. In the greater part of this book, the apostle deals with the aspect of life. Romans gives the sequence of the Christian walk, the Christian life. At the very beginning, in the first two and a half chapters, there is a sinner before God. Then in chapters three, four, and the first part of chapter five, this sinner is justified, forgiven, redeemed, and saved through the redemption of Christ. In the second part of chapter five through chapter eight, this redeemed, justified, and forgiven person is walking in the new life, in the Spirit. He realizes the fact that the old man has been put to death and the fact that with the old man there is nothing good. The old man, the old nature, has been put on the cross. Now the Holy Spirit of Christ, as the embodiment of Christ as life to us, is living within us. We must walk after Him and walk in Him. So this very one who was originally a sinner is now a saint, walking after the Spirit. Then in chapter twelve so many redeemed ones who are walking in the Spirit are composed together in the Spirit as one Body. They are members of this one Body.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GROWTH IN LIFE</h2>
<p>First we have the aspect of life, then the aspect of service. We have the life matter settled first, then, based on that fact, we have the matter of service. Without life and the adequate growth in life, we cannot have the service. The little children can do many things, but they cannot serve, because they simply do not have the adequate growth in life.</p>
<p>To serve the Lord, the growth in life is required. The service is not mentioned in Romans 6 or 7. It is not mentioned until chapter twelve, where sinners have been redeemed, justified, and delivered from the old nature, and they are walking in the Spirit. They have the real growth in life. Now they are the practical and functioning members of the Body. The Christian service is an issue of the growth of life.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have life, you cannot serve. Even if you have life, but are short of the growth in life, still young, childish, even like a babe, you cannot serve. The service requires life and the growth of life, the maturity of life. It is a life matter, and it is a matter of the growth in life. We cannot serve the Lord without growing in the life of the Lord. This is something very basic. This is why we have been stressing the matter of life in view of our expectation of having a church life with the service. Without the growth in life, there is no possibility for the church to be built up. And without the building up of the church, there is no possibility of having the church service, the Christian service.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVICE IN THE BODY</h2>
<p>The Christian service is a matter of life and in the Body. It is a matter in the Body and a matter of the Body. You cannot serve the Lord as an individual Christian. To serve the Lord, you need to realize that the Lord&rsquo;s service is something in the Body.</p>
<p>Every believer is a member of the Body, a part of the Body. An individual is not the Body. A member of the Body cannot function without the Body. The hand is good, quite useful, but if it is cut off from the body, it becomes not only dead, but also ugly, terrible, and even terrifying. You may love to shake my hand, but if this hand were detached from the body, it would be terrible.</p>
<p>Today many Christians are detached, separated from the reality of the Body. It is as if they are disembodied members. The members of the body are beautiful as long as they are attached where they belong in the body, but in any other place they are terrible. How sad it is that many Christians today are like ears that have been detached and put on the shoulders. How could they serve the Lord? How could we serve the Lord without being built up together as members of the Body? It is impossible.</p>
<p>I am not speaking on this point according to knowledge or doctrine. By the mercy of the Lord, I can testify to you from my experience that for many years I have simply been unable to serve the Lord without the Body. It is impossible to serve the Lord without the Body, without the church life, without the church practice.</p>
<p>The Body life is in Romans 12, and the church service is in this Body life with the members of the Body, of the church, functioning, serving. This matter is very clear in the Word. We need to check ourselves to see whether or not we have the reality of the Body life. If not, we are wandering saints. If you say that you are in the reality of the Body, you need to consider seriously where the Body is, practically speaking. If we could give up the service of the Lord, there would be no need for us to talk about the Body, the church life. But if we do have the sincere heart to serve the Lord, we need to realize that the service is in the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRIESTHOOD AND THE BODY</h2>
<p>The Christian service is the service of the priests. We know that all the believers are priests, and that the function, the duty, the responsibility, of the priests is to serve the Lord. The service of the priests in the Old Testament was not that of individual priests serving the Lord. All the priests serving the Lord need to be built up together as a body. The priestly service is not a service of individuals, but a service of a corporate body. To serve the Lord, we need to be built up together with others as a corporate body. Peter told us that we will be the priesthood after we have been built up together as the spiritual house (1 Pet. 2:5).</p><h2 class="head1">BUILT UP AND COORDINATED</h2>
<p>The Greek word rendered priesthood is rather hard to translate. But according to the spiritual reality, the priesthood is the building up of the priests, the coordination, the cooperation of all the priests. Not one of the priests serves individually, but all serve in coordination.</p>
<p>While I am ministering, my whole body is serving in a coordination. My mouth does not speak without any expression in my eyes or without any gestures with my hands. The mouth even needs the feet with the legs and the whole body to support it. The mouth needs the hands and feet, and the hands and feet need the mouth and the eyes. This is the whole body in coordination, and this is the basic principle of the Christian service.</p>
<p>Many of us are concerned about the gospel preaching. If we are going to preach the gospel, we need to be built up together. We need the coordination first. When we are built up together as a spiritual house and have the coordination of the priests, then we can preach the gospel.</p>
<p>The first gospel preaching was on the day of Pentecost, when one hundred twenty people were built up together, coordinated. Those one hundred twenty people were one hundred twenty priests, just as one body acting in coordination. And I believe that on that day, when Peter stood up, it was not only Peter himself, nor even Peter with the other eleven, but actually Peter with the one hundred twenty. When Peter told the Jewish people, &ldquo;You people put this Jesus on the cross,&rdquo; I believe all the one hundred twenty said, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; &ldquo;You put Him to death, but the God of our fathers raised Him up.&rdquo; Again they said, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; It was not merely a single member of the Body, not merely the mouth of Peter speaking, with all the others sleeping or talking, leaving poor Peter to speak in a poor way by himself. This is not the way the gospel was preached on that day. Rather they preached the gospel in a prevailing way, in a coordination of all the saints, all coordinated as one. Therefore, their preaching was powerful and prevailing.</p>
<p>To have the gospel preached in a prevailing way, spiritual giants or powerful evangelists are not so much needed as the Body, a built-up Body under a coordination. Groups of people will be brought to the Lord through the built-up church. If we would all be joined together in the Body and stand together, even the weakest one among us would be stronger in the coordination than any individual strong one.</p>
<p>Some may be concerned that they do not have a special gift or do not know how to serve the Lord. Those things do not matter. As long as we are in the reality of the Body, that is wonderful. We all need to be built up in the Body. If we become a built-up house, then we will be a serving priesthood, a serving priestly coordination. This is what we need, a coordination by building up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOLY PRIESTS<br />
AND ROYAL PRIESTS</h2>
<p>We are the holy priesthood on the one hand, and the royal priesthood on the other hand. In the Old Testament types there are two different orders of priests, the order of Aaron and the order of Melchisedec. The order of Aaron is the holy order. To be holy is to be separated from the common things, the worldly things, unto the Lord. The holy order is an order separated from the world, from the common things, unto the use of the Lord. To have the church service, all of us need to be built together, and we should be separated people, separated from the world, from the common things, from the ordinary way. To be separated unto God is to be holy unto God. To be holy simply means to be sanctified, and to be sanctified simply means to be separated from the common things unto the divine things. This is the holy order, the holy priesthood.</p>
<p>The order of Melchisedec is the royal order. Melchisedec was a king, and he was a kingly priest. On one hand, we are the sons of Aaron, the holy priests separated from the world unto the Lord. On the other hand, we are Melchisedecs, the kingly priests.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate in this way. Suppose the church here is going to preach the gospel. First of all, we need to be built up together as one body; we must be formed together as an army. Then we all should be separated from the world unto the Lord. We all need to go to the Lord and pray for a period of time, like those one hundred twenty in Acts who prayed for ten days. They separated themselves from the worldly things unto the Lord, and they stayed with the Lord for ten days. As a result, they were all filled with the Lord. At that moment they were the holy priests. After those ten days, when they came out to the people to tell them that Jesus is the Lord, the Savior, they did this in a royal way. When they went to the Lord, they were holy. When they came out from the presence of the Lord with the heavenly authority, they were kings, they were royal.</p>
<p>When we are built up together, separated from the world unto the Lord, and we pray before the Lord, we will be the holy priests. After much prayer, we all will be filled with the Lord, and filled with the Lord of authority. Then we come out to tell the people something about the Lord as royal priests, kingly priests, with the heavenly authority. When we as a Body go to the Lord and remain in His presence, we are the holy priests, the holy, separated ones before God. After we pray and are burdened by the Lord and equipped with the heavenly authority, we come out of the presence of the Lord to the people, serving them, even ministering the Lord to them. At that time we are the kingly priests, the royal priests, the heavenly ones with the heavenly authority as heavenly kings to minister the Lord to others. What comes out is not merely preaching of the word, of the gospel, but preaching the gospel with the kingly, heavenly authority.</p>
<p>The priests of the order of Aaron always bring the need of the people to God. They are holy. But a priest of the order of Melchisedec brings something from God to supply others, to meet the need of others. This is the kingly priesthood.</p>
<p>When we give up the whole world and go to the Lord to pray for sinners, &ldquo;Lord, be merciful, remember them, save them, deliver them,&rdquo; we are the holy priests. But when we come out of the presence of the Lord after much prayer to minister something of the Lord as life in a powerful way, in a way of heavenly authority, we are royal priests.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE VITAL MATTERS</h2>
<p>If we are going to serve the Lord in the way of the church service, we need to pay our full attention to these three matters. First we need to be built up as a Body. You cannot have any service outside the church life, outside the Body. You need to be built up.</p>
<p>Second, each one of us needs to exercise to put everything worldly aside. We should be separated from the common things unto the Lord and learn how to remain in the presence of the Lord, how to bring the need of the people, the need of the sinful world, to the Lord and pray. Then we will be the holy priests.</p>
<p>After offering sufficient prayer to the Lord, we will come out from the presence of the Lord to minister the Lord to the world as the Savior, the life, the life-supply, and the light in a powerful way. At that very moment we will be the royal priests.</p>
<p>There is the need of coordination, the need of separation, and the need of the heavenly authority. We need the coordination of the Body, the separation of the holy priests from the world unto the Lord, and the heavenly authority of the royal priests. Then we will be qualified, empowered, to minister the Lord to others as the royal priests, the kingly priests, with the heavenly authority. To have the real church service, these three things are basic, even vital.</p>
<p>If you have a burden to minister a word to the church, first you need to check whether you have been built up in the reality of the Body and are in the coordination. If not, it is as if you are a detached member. How then could you function?</p>
<p>Then you need to check whether you are separated unto the Lord, and check whether you have spent sufficient time in the presence of the Lord to pray. Without this, you are not qualified to serve, because you are not a holy priest.</p>
<p>Then check the third item: Do you have the authority, the heavenly authority? Do you have something really committed unto you by the Lord? If so, you will minister to the Lord&rsquo;s people not only by word but by authority. Whenever or whatever you minister, there will be the weight. The message, the word, the ministry, will be weighty because there is the heavenly authority of the royal priest.</p>
<p>The coordination, the separation, and the authority&mdash;these three are the qualifications, the equipment we need to minister. It is not merely a matter of knowing something or having a burden to do something. You need to check whether you have been built up in the reality of the Body, whether you are in the coordination of the priesthood. This is something vital. You can never stand by yourself against the evil forces of darkness. The evil forces, the evil spirits, know where you are.</p>
<p>In Acts 19:13-16, the seven sons of Sceva attempted to cast out the evil spirits by using the name of the Jesus that Paul preached. However, the evil spirit told them, &ldquo;Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?&rdquo; The name of Jesus in the mouth of Paul is powerful, but it may not be powerful in your mouth. Paul was coordinated, built up together, with the saints. He was in the coordination of the priesthood, and he had the separation and the authority.</p>
<p>Even to offer a prayer in a prayer meeting or around the Lord&rsquo;s table, you need these three basic things: the coordination, the separation, and the authority. If you are one in the coordination of the saints, separated from the world unto the Lord, and one with the heavenly authority, when you pray just a short word, others will sense dominion, power, and reality in your prayer. Otherwise, you pray in vain words, without weight, without power, authority, to back up your words.</p>
<p>The real service, the prevailing service, does not depend upon knowledge, ability, eloquence, or so-called gifts. Although these things have a certain place in the service of the Lord, they are not basic. The basic matters are these three: coordination, separation, and authority.</p>
<p>If you would be willing to be built up together with others, simply lose yourself, let yourself be lost, in the building of the church. When you give up yourself to realize the building of the church, you are in the coordination. Then you realize the separation with the saints from the world unto the Lord, and you do have the authority of the heavens. This is the way to have the church service that is powerful and prevailing.</p>
<p>Peter was just an unlearned fisherman. Before the day of Pentecost I doubt that Peter had any gift. But on the day of Pentecost Peter was one in the coordination and was one with the separation and one with the heavenly authority. How powerful he was! He spoke a brief word with short sentences, without much knowledge, but his word was full of power. He had the coordination, the separation, and the authority. He was in the coordination, he was one of the holy priests, and he was one of the royal priests.</p>
<p>When those one hundred twenty people stayed in the presence of the Lord for ten days, all of them were the holy priests. When the day of Pentecost came, they all came out to the people to meet their need with the heavenly supply. Because they were royal priests, even the highest power on this earth was afraid of them because of their authority. They had the heavenly power with the heavenly authority.</p>
<p>This is the way to have the church service. Until we take care of these three basic matters&mdash;the coordination, the real separation, and the heavenly authority&mdash;we simply are not ready to begin any service in our locality. We need the building up, we need the coordination, we need the separation, and we need the heavenly authority. We need the reality of the Body, we need the holy priesthood, and we need the royal priesthood. When a group of saints are built up together as one Body in coordination, with the separation and the heavenly authority, at that time the real church service will begin.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">SERVING IN THE SPIRIT<br />
TO MINISTER CHRIST TO OTHERS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 7:6; 2 Cor. 3:6, 8</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THREE VITAL POINTS</h2>
<p>In an earlier chapter we saw three vital points regarding the matter of service. The first is that in the church all the serving ones must be built up together as a spiritual house, the priesthood (1 Pet. 2:5).</p>
<p>All the Old Testament priests served the Lord in a corporate way. Not one served the Lord in an individual, independent way. They were all coordinated, and they all cooperated one with another. They were built up together as one body. By that Old Testament type we know that the New Testament saints need to be built up together as a spiritual house, and that this spiritual house is a body of priests, a priesthood.</p>
<p>The priesthood is a building up of all the priests, all the serving ones, as one body. Among them there is a priesthood, a priestly body, a corporation, a coordination of a group of believers built up together, serving the Lord. To serve the Lord we first need to be built up together.</p>
<p>Second, we should be the holy priesthood, the separated ones, the saints, the believers, the serving ones, separated from the system of the world unto God, unto the service of the Lord. We need to be separated so that we can be holy.</p>
<p>Then we need to be the royal priesthood. We have seen the difference between the holy priesthood and the royal priesthood. The holy priesthood is a group of serving ones who have been separated from the satanic system of the world unto the service of God. The royal priesthood is a group of priests, a group of serving ones, who have spent time in the presence of the Lord, who have been anointed and committed with the heavenly authority. They are the Lord&rsquo;s ruling channel with heavenly authority. When they come out of the presence of God to the people, they come with heavenly authority as royal priests.</p>
<p>On one hand, the priests are holy; on the other hand, they are royal. They are those separated unto God, and they are those committed with heavenly authority to serve the Lord. Because they are separated from the world and entrusted with heavenly authority, they are qualified and equipped to serve the Lord. These three points we have seen already.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO SERVE IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Now we come to a crucial point; that is, we need to learn how to serve in the spirit. This is the fourth point in the church service. Romans 7:6 says, &ldquo;But now we are discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held, that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter.&rdquo; We need to learn to serve in the spirit&mdash;not in the letter, not in the law, not in doctrine, but in the spirit.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:6 indicates that the New Testament service is a matter of the Spirit, not of the letter: &ldquo;Who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, not of letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.&rdquo; Verse 8 continues, &ldquo;How shall not rather the ministry of the Spirit be in glory?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Regenerated Spirit</h2>
<p>I am afraid that many believers simply do not know what it means to serve in the spirit. Before we were saved, we were dead in our spirit. On one hand, we were very active in the mind and in the emotion; yet we were dead in the spirit. But, praise the Lord, at the time we were saved, the Lord regenerated our spirit and made it alive. From that time, we need to learn to live, to walk, to act in the spirit, not in the mind or emotion, not in the soul.</p>
<p>We need to learn not only to walk, to live, in the spirit but also to serve in the spirit, and to serve in the newness of the spirit. My burden is to help you know something in a practical way, not in the way of doctrine or theory.</p>
<p>What does it mean to serve the Lord in the spirit and in the newness of the spirit? A spirit has been created within us, and we have been regenerated. Our spirit has been renewed, and the Spirit of God is now dwelling in this quickened, renewed spirit. Therefore our spirit is now a strong factor in our being. Because this spirit has been renewed and made alive, and because it has been strengthened by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, it surely is a strong factor in our being. Yet, due to the fact that we lack the proper teaching, we simply do not realize that we have such a renewed spirit with the Holy Spirit indwelling it. However, we should have some realization because of all the speaking in the ministry concerning this matter.</p>
<p>On one hand, we need to walk, to live, in this spirit. We are not speaking of the Holy Spirit, but of our renewed spirit in which the Holy Spirit dwells. To walk, to live, in our spirit means that we will be in the Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit is now indwelling our spirit. We need to live in the spirit, and we need to learn to serve in the spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Choosing a Hymn in the Spirit</h2>
<p>Suppose you plan to choose a hymn for a meeting. There are two ways to choose a hymn&mdash;the way in the letter, and the way in the spirit. Suppose on the Lord&rsquo;s day morning we are having a morning service in the way of the letter, and we have one to take charge of the service. We have invited another one to come to give us a sermon. Before the service you may find out what topic that one will use for his sermon. From this you consider what hymns we should sing, perhaps two or three, and you write all the hymn numbers on the board for everyone to see when they come. This is a way in the letter.</p>
<p>You may think that you would never do anything in such a way in our meetings. But at least in principle you may have this kind of practice in the meetings. For the prayer meeting, you may look in the index of the hymnal and select a good hymn related to prayer just according to the letter. A way in the letter is a way of death.</p>
<p>Then what is the other way to choose a hymn? There is a way that is not according to your mind, your mentality, but according to the inner feeling of your spirit. You need to exercise to sense the inner feeling of the spirit. If there is no inner feeling for a certain hymn, you should not select it. When you have a proper hymn, you will sense it by the inmost feeling of your spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Ministering a Word in the Spirit</h2>
<p>We need to learn not to act or serve according to knowledge, but to act and serve according to the inmost feeling. Suppose you are going to give a message in the meeting. You need to learn the lesson not just to speak according to your knowledge.</p>
<p>The first time I was asked to speak before a large congregation was in 1927. I was a young man, about twenty-two years of age. I prepared a sermon and practiced for quite a number of days. I went to the seashore and practiced giving the sermon to the ocean. Then I went to the pulpit on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning and delivered that message according to the mentality. Afterwards, I realized I had forgotten a good portion of it. Later on, I found out that my way was absolutely a way in the letter. That was something dead. At that time I was so young, so immature. I simply didn&rsquo;t know how to minister in the spirit.</p>
<p>But gradually the Lord brought me to a point where I had to minister in the spirit, according to the spirit, not according to the mentality or to knowledge. And I can testify to you that many times in the past years, even on the way to the meeting, I did not know what to minister, simply because I was planning to serve in the spirit. When the hymns and prayers were over, I had to stand up to minister. While I was standing to speak, even while I was speaking the words, &ldquo;Let us read,&rdquo; up to this point I myself did not know what to read. I spoke slowly, &ldquo;Let us read.&rdquo; While I was pronouncing the word &ldquo;read&rdquo; so slowly, there was a feeling&mdash;a book, a chapter, a verse. While I was reading that portion, there was some anointing within me. Word by word, sentence by sentence, the message came out, not according to the mentality, but according to the anointing. Oh, that is wonderful and that is powerful! I cannot tell you how many times this has happened.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Offering a Prayer in the Spirit</h2>
<p>Likewise, there are two ways to offer a prayer in the meeting. One way is to offer a prayer according to knowledge, according to a routine, much like coming to an office to do routine work. Sometimes I have an impression when certain brothers are praying that it is as if they have come to the office to do their routine work. But we need to forget about all kinds of routine, all kinds of knowledge, and all kinds of letters. When we come together to pray, we need to exercise our spirit to sense the inner anointing. We should not pray according to knowledge or routine, but according to the inner feeling, the inmost feeling of the anointing.</p>
<p>Many times we can sense when a brother is ministering in letters. We can also sense when a brother is ministering from the anointing, when he is ministering in the spirit. In such a case we can sense something living, something anointing, something enlightening, not merely something of teaching. The same is true of prayer. By the inner sense we know when a brother or sister is praying in the spirit or merely praying in the letter, according to knowledge.</p>
<p>Many times, when I was praying together with some living ones who prayed in the spirit, after just one sentence I had to say, &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; because there was a deep echo in my spirit to their prayer in the spirit. I could not hold back my &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; because something was burning within me. When anyone utters a prayer from the spirit, there is a spontaneous expression of agreement from the spirit of the others.</p>
<p>Some Christians would not agree with the saying of &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; while others are praying. Within them there is an &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; but they suppress it, they would not release it, simply because of their opinion. But whether they would utter it or not, when anyone prays in the spirit, there is always an echo in the spirit of others.</p>
<p>However, many times a brother prays in the mentality, in knowledge, in the letter, in the mind, and brings in death. The more he prays, the more people are deadened. When we are praying, we need to sense whether there is an echo in the spirit of others. When there is no echo, we need to close the prayer right away. We need to learn how to exercise our spirit while we are serving and learn how to serve in the spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Visiting the Saints in the Spirit</h2>
<p>When you are going to visit one of the saints, you need to learn to visit in the spirit. Whenever you meet another saint, there is a serious need for the exercise of the spirit. Merely talking according to your mentality, according to your knowledge, does not edify others in the spirit. You need to learn to exercise your spirit, to sense the anointing within you and to follow it. Because you have a renewed spirit which is indwelt by the Holy Spirit, you have the anointing within you. You need to take care of this anointing and fellowship with the saints according to the inner feeling, the inner sense. Then you will serve and have fellowship with the saints in the spirit and not in the letter.</p>
<p>We need to consider some details because this matter is very important. Suppose a sister you are visiting opens herself to you concerning her family problems. To tell her something according to the teachings of the Scriptures does not work. During the very time you are listening to her, you need to exercise your spirit to sense her spirit and to sense the anointing within you. If you would do this, while you are listening on one hand and sensing on the other hand, the anointing, the Holy Spirit within you, will reveal to you something so spiritual and so heavenly. Then you will be able to help her in a living way. At that very moment, you need to forget your knowledge of the Scriptures, your knowledge of the Christian teachings, and give up that knowledge. You need to exercise your spirit, looking to the Lord. While you are listening, you need to fellowship with the Lord and to sense both what is in her spirit and what is the anointing in your spirit. This is the way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching the Gospel in the Spirit</h2>
<p>We all need to learn to practice, to exercise, to conduct ourselves in the spirit in the service of the Lord. Suppose we are preaching the gospel. We need much more exercise in the spirit. We should not preach merely according to the gospel truths or according to the knowledge of the gospel. Merely to preach that we are all sinners and that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God who died on the cross for our sins does not work. That is the preaching in letters. Our preaching must be in the spirit.</p>
<p>We need some experiences to illustrate this point. Many times in the gospel preaching I have spoken a word that exactly met the need of someone who was listening, although I had no knowledge of the situation. I have described their case and exactly what they had done, along with their feelings and reactions step by step. Such a speaking has been used of the Lord to bring the needy ones to Him.</p>
<p>In one gospel meeting after we had taken the way of preaching according to the inner feeling of the spirit, while I was speaking I felt I should say, &ldquo;You say you are not a sinner? I tell you, you stole the chalk from the school.&rdquo; A few days later I learned that a young high school student had been brought to that meeting by his mother. While I was speaking, he was thinking, &ldquo;Well, I am not a sinner. I haven&rsquo;t committed any sins.&rdquo; Just as he was saying this to himself, I spoke the words, &ldquo;You say you are not a sinner? You stole the chalk from the school.&rdquo; He had actually stolen chalk from the school, but when he heard these words, he said to himself, &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; At that very moment I said, &ldquo;You say that doesn&rsquo;t matter? You brought this chalk home and drew circles upon the floor.&rdquo; This statement caused him to tremble, because that was exactly what he had done. As a result, he was saved. Later he asked his mother whether someone had told me his story and how I could have known everything he had done. Actually, I did not even know his name or anything he had done. We have had other experiences similar to this one.</p>
<p>Another time in the gospel preaching I turned to a particular part of a large congregation and said, &ldquo;You say you are a good person? Just look how cruel you are. Your husband works hard to earn a living for you, and at the end of the year you forced him to buy a pair of high-heeled shoes for you. He did not have the money, but you forced him to do it.&rdquo; A week later, one of the sisters who did the visitation work told us that a young lady was saved by that word. At first that word had made her very angry, because she thought her neighbor had reported her story to me and that I had scorned her publicly. When she learned that this was not the case, that young lady was convinced by the Lord.</p>
<p>In an illustration on another occasion I said, &ldquo;Suppose you are seventy-six years of age.&rdquo; Later I learned of someone just that age who received the help. There are living stories of such experiences in the gospel preaching according to the inner feeling of the spirit.</p>
<p>We all need to learn to serve in the spirit, not in knowledge or in the letter. If we take this way, many times while we are serving in the spirit, the Holy Spirit will be so living to us.</p>
<p>Whenever you stand up to speak, you need to forget about your knowledge. On one hand, you need the knowledge, but when you stand up to serve, you should forget the knowledge. If you would keep your knowledge in your memory at that time, you will do a lot of damage, and you will hinder the Spirit. While you are speaking, you need to forget about your knowledge and come back to the spirit to minister in the spirit. This is a lesson which requires much exercise. You may think that you will not know what to say if you let go of your knowledge. This may be true, but all of us need to exercise to serve, to minister, in the spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">MINISTERING CHRIST<br />
IN THE PRACTICAL SERVICE</h2>
<p>The purpose of all we do in the church service is to minister Christ to others. Everything we do should minister life to others. This is the fifth point in the church service.</p>
<p>Suppose you come to the meeting hall to take care of some practical matters, to arrange the chairs, to do some cleaning work, or to take care of the kitchen. Whatever you are doing, you should take that as an opportunity to minister Christ to others. If you are cleaning, your cleaning should minister life to others. You need to minister Christ by cleaning. If you are teaching, your teaching should minister life to others. Merely to minister some knowledge to others is not enough. You need to minister Christ by teaching. It is the same with cooking. Even by cooking you should minister Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Way to Minister Christ</h2>
<p>An illustration may help us understand how to minister Christ by taking care of all the practical things. In 1948 there was a conference in Shanghai with many co-workers from many places throughout the whole country, and there was a fellowship dinner for all the co-workers with the local saints. A very capable sister, who was at that time a head nurse in a large hospital, took care of many things related to the serving, the preparing, the cooking, and the arranging. She was very strong in character, and she was very prominent in everything that was done for the whole evening. Yet no one could sense Christ in her. She was highly qualified, and she did many good things, yet nothing of life was ministered through her, and the saints did not receive help from her.</p>
<p>Another sister was serving at that same dinner, and she was the only one of the serving ones who did anything wrong. She did something seriously wrong, and everyone there realized what she had done. Yet in this sister everyone could sense Christ. She had learned something of Christ, how to live in Christ, how to act in Christ, and even how to adjust her wrongdoings in Christ. All the co-workers there were helped by the one who did something seriously wrong, but they were not helped by the capable sister who did so many good things. It is possible to do many things in the Lord&rsquo;s service and yet have nothing of Christ ministered through you or by you.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Goal and the Means</h2>
<p>There are many lessons to learn in ministering Christ to others by cleaning, by cooking, and by doing many different practical things. It seems that we are so spiritual, so Christ-like, when we come together for a meeting, but when we are in the kitchen it seems that we are anything but Christ-like. We need to learn the lesson to serve others and to serve God by ministering Christ to others no matter what we are doing. If you are in the spirit when you are playing the piano, by playing the piano you will minister Christ to others. As the church we are here to do nothing else but minister Christ to others. To cook a good meal for the saints, to prepare a good place for meeting, to play the piano in a skillful way&mdash;none of these things are meaningful unless they minister Christ to others. Whatever we do in the service of the Lord should minister Christ to others. We have much to learn in this matter.</p>
<p>In Shanghai there was an elderly sister who was very much with the Lord. It was her habit to invite the young missionary ladies who had just come to China to have tea with her in the afternoon. By serving tea to those young missionaries, this sister ministered Christ to them. A number of those young sisters could testify how much the life of the Lord was ministered to them by the serving of that tea. This sister did not teach them or say anything to adjust them, but she ministered life to those younger ones.</p>
<p>At one time some of those young missionaries were wearing stylish dresses, with the skirts a little too short. This elderly sister invited them to tea. While they were drinking tea, several times this sister pulled her skirt down so that she was more fully covered. Finally the other sisters began to check their own skirts. Without a word being spoken, those young ladies received a great adjustment. To serve tea was not the purpose of this elderly sister. It was simply the means by which Christ could be ministered.</p>
<p>To minister Christ as life to others should be the purpose of all the things we do, whether we are cleaning, arranging, cooking, visiting, ministering the Word, singing, or praying. All the practical things in the church life are nothing but the channels, the means through which, by which, and in which we would minister Christ to others.</p>
<p>If others cannot sense Christ in the kitchen while you are cooking, it is doubtful that they will sense Him in the meetings in a real way. To have Christ ministered in the meetings we need to exercise ourselves in such a way in doing all the practical things that Christ will be ministered in the practical things. Every part of the service of the church must minister Christ as life.</p>
<p>We need to learn to serve in the spirit, and we need to learn to do all the things in the service of the church in a way that ministers Christ to others. This is our aim and purpose.</p>
<p>Unless we learn the lessons in these matters, the church life will be damaged, and death will be brought in through the practical matters. On the one hand, the saints may be taking care of the practical things together, but on the other hand, they may be talking nonsense or gossiping. The channels of talking and gossiping during the church service will bring death into the church life and scatter the death if the saints do not learn to serve in the spirit and minister Christ to one another. In that case, the more the saints come together for the practical service, the more the church life will be damaged.</p>
<p>May we all learn to minister Christ as life to others whenever we come together to serve in the church life. May we all learn to serve in the spirit to minister Christ as life to others.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>

<h1 class="title">SERVING IN COORDINATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 7:6</h1>
<p>We have already seen that we need to serve the Lord in the spirit, and that in our service the one thing we need to do is to minister Christ to others as life. Whatever we do in the Lord&rsquo;s service, we must do it in the spirit. In Romans 7:6 we are told that we need to serve the Lord not only in the spirit, but also in the newness of the spirit: &ldquo;But now we are discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held, that we should serve as slaves in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is at least some difference between the spirit and the newness of the spirit. However, if you serve the Lord in the spirit, you will surely have the newness of the spirit. Anything in the flesh is old; anything in the spirit is new. Whenever a brother or a sister serves in the flesh, there is a sense of something old, even six thousand years old, as old as Adam. But when anyone serves in the spirit, there is something new, something fresh and refreshing.</p>
<p>A good number of times I have seen the brothers and sisters who are quite young serve in an old way. There are some nineteen-year-olds who serve as if they were ninety-nine years old. Their serving is old because they serve in the flesh. On the other hand, some older brothers and sisters serve in a way that is fresh and new. They serve in a new way, a refreshing way, because they serve in the spirit. Whatever is in the spirit is fresh, new, and refreshing. Whatever is in the flesh is old. It is not refreshing, but rather it is tiring.</p>
<p>When you are listening to a message that is given in the spirit, you simply do not care about the time. After listening for half an hour, you want to hear more. The time goes by quickly. But when you are listening to a message given in the flesh, in the oldness of the letter, ten minutes may seem like an hour, and you are relieved when the message is over. All of us need to learn to serve in the spirit and in the newness of the spirit.</p>
<p>It is necessary to be mature, but we should never be old. To be old is one thing; to be mature is another. We should seek to be mature, but never to be old. God is never old. On the contrary, He is always new. In the Bible the Lord&rsquo;s maturity is portrayed in one way, and His newness is pictured in a different way. But the Lord is never old. Therefore, we should learn to serve in the spirit and in the newness of the spirit.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, you need to do it in the newness of the spirit. Whatever you do, you need to do it in the way of ministering Christ as life to others. You should not minister doctrines, religion, rules, regulations, or forms. You should not even minister any kind of sound teachings to others without Christ as life. Our goal is to minister Christ as life to others. We take care of sound teachings simply because those teachings have much to do with the matter of Christ as life. If doctrines and teachings are not related to Christ as life, we would not take care of them and would not talk about them.</p>
<p>We need to learn to serve in the spirit, and we need to minister Christ as life to others. These two matters we have seen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF COORDINATION</h2>
<p>There is more to say about serving in the newness of the spirit and ministering life to others. However, in this chapter my burden is another point of the service, that is, the matter of coordination. In the service we need to be coordinated with others. I do not say that we need to be organized. To be organized is one thing, and to be coordinated is another. What we mean by the word coordination is simply to be built up together, to serve in the way of being built up together.</p>
<p>The more you serve, the more you will be built up together with others. In these days we are talking about the building up of the church. The building up of the church is in the service of coordination. If we are serving the Lord in the way of coordination, while we are serving we are being built together.</p>
<p>We need to see what this means in a practical way. Suppose I am a sister serving the Lord among the saints in the church. I need to serve the Lord in such a way that the more I serve, the more I will be built up together with others, and the more I serve, the more others will be brought in to be built up together with me. In other words, the more I serve, the more the church is built up.</p>
<p>In many places today, however, the more the people serve, the more they become independent. The more gifted they are, the more they become a giant, and the more they become independent. Some of the gifted ones would think that they are so high that others cannot follow them. They consider themselves so high and everyone else so low. They would put themselves on the top and others on the bottom. As a result, they would be independent. This is not the right way.</p>
<p>The right way is that while you are serving, you are being built together with others. The more you serve, the more you exercise your gift, the more you will be united, the more you will be coordinated with others. In the Lord&rsquo;s service you never act in an independent way. Here there are lessons for us to learn.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate in this way. Suppose I am a brother with a gift, and the more I serve, the more I will learn, and the more I will know how to serve. The more I serve, the more I will become strong, and the more I will become big. Then I will become proud, thinking that I know this, I know that, I know everything. Therefore I must do everything, because I am the only one who knows how to do it. In a sense, I am becoming almighty. I can do everything, and I do everything. The more I serve, the more everything comes into my pocket and everything is in my hand. The more I can do, the more I am independent, and I can do everything in my way. I have no more lessons to learn, and no one can teach me anything. In the meeting I announce the hymn, play the piano, start the hymn, lead the prayer, and do the preaching&mdash;I do everything. There is no need for anyone else. I can accomplish the whole job. I am on the top, and I am the most independent. Others may admire me as such a wonderful brother. Nevertheless, you all need to realize that this kind of brother simply damages the church life. The more he does, the more he delays the building up of the church; he even spoils and frustrates it. Since such a brother is so capable in himself, there are no lessons for him to learn, and there is no need for him to coordinate with others. This is not the right way.</p><h2 class="head1">LETTING THINGS PASS<br />
INTO THE HANDS OF OTHERS</h2>
<p>The right way is this. On the first day that I come here to serve, I may do ninety percent of the things, and leave ten percent in the hands of others. But after one month, I am taking care of only sixty percent, and the other forty percent has passed into the hands of some others who have come in to serve with me. After another month, I may take care of only thirty percent, and another month later, maybe only five percent, then a little later, only one percent. The rest of the job of the service goes to all the serving brothers and sisters. One sister takes care of the piano. A brother takes care of the hymns. Another takes care of this, and another takes care of that. To serve the Lord in this way I need to learn many lessons. Each one of us naturally thinks that he is the best, and would never let others do the same thing he does. But if you would learn the lesson to be coordinated with others, you need to learn how to look down on yourself, how to be limited by others. Otherwise, you could not bring people more and more into the building.</p>
<p>There was a sister in China who was quite capable, educated, and experienced in doing things, and she loved the Lord very much. However, when she came into the service of the church, the more she served, the more everything came into her hand. After two or three months, it seemed that all the others had been dismissed. One day the elders asked her why it was that there were only two or three left in the Lord&rsquo;s service, when a few months ago there had been quite a number. They asked where the others were. Her answer was that they did not know how to do things, and they did not do them well. The more she served, the more all the others were dismissed, dismissed because of her ability and her capability. No one could work as fast as she could. In everything it seemed she was right because she was so capable. But in spiritual reality she damaged the church life very much. She acted independently. Later on, with this sister there was a great spiritual cancer.</p>
<p>A cancer is a part of the body that overdevelops, a group of cells that goes wild, that goes too far. You need to be limited by others so that you will not be a cancer to the Body of Christ. You need to be limited by others so that you will be a member coordinated with others, not a cell gone wild.</p>
<p>The best way for us to serve the Lord in the church is this way. The first week that you come to serve the Lord, you may take care of seventy percent of the things, and the others take care of thirty percent. The next week, you take sixty-five percent, and the others thirty-five percent. The third week, you may take sixty, and the others, forty. With you, the percentage is always being reduced, and with the others, it is always being increased.</p>
<p>From another angle, the first week that you come, only five percent of the saints are serving with you. After one week, there are eight percent, then twelve, twenty, and eventually, maybe after one year, one hundred percent. The percentage of the work in your hands is always being reduced, yet the number of the people serving with you is always increasing. After maybe one or two years, the service will be absolutely out of your hands and one hundred percent in the hands of all the brothers and sisters. The number of the serving ones will be increased from just a handful to more than a hundred. This is the right way.</p>
<p>If you take this way, you will learn to be limited, to be broken, and to submit yourself to others. If you don&rsquo;t serve the Lord with others, you will never know yourself, but when you serve with others, you will be exposed how &ldquo;good&rdquo; you really are. In this kind of service there are many lessons for you to learn.</p><h2 class="head1">TESTED BY THE COORDINATION</h2>
<p>In my experience I have always been tested by the brothers in the service. This kind of testing is very hard to take, but you simply need to take it. You may tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, this is a cup from You, and I have no choice but to take it.&rdquo; This is the way for you to learn the lesson of serving the Lord in the way of coordination.</p>
<p>When you do things by yourself, it seems that everything is convenient. But when you do things with others, it seems that nothing is convenient. For example, I would always prefer to travel by myself in the Lord&rsquo;s work. However, in China, under the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty and under the coordination of the co-workers, I always had to travel with two or more brothers, and even to be the leader among them for the traveling. I am a person who always likes to have everything ready ahead of time, to leave nothing to be done at the last minute, and I would urge the brothers to have everything prepared for our trip. Every time there would be someone who was not ready. Eventually I would need to help him get ready, take care of things for him, and do everything for him, and we would not be ready on time. I encouraged everyone to take responsibility for their own things and not to burden others, but whatever way I tried, nothing seemed to work. Eventually I had to submit to the Lord and learn to be patient, and I had to take care of all the suitcases and all of the problems for the others. The more people you have traveling with you, the more problems you have&mdash;the luggage, the things others forget, all the special needs. You have no choice but to help. It seems that the others have come to help you, but you need to help them. They become a burden instead of a help, but they are really a help for you to learn the lesson.</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems is to visit a church with several co-workers to be received for hospitality by the church. Many co-workers simply do not know how to be a guest. There are many problems and many lessons for us to learn in the coordination.</p>
<p>What should you do in all these situations? You cannot dismiss your co-workers and send them home. You simply need to learn the lesson in the coordination. This is the only way for you to serve the Lord with others, to build up the church. You should not be a giant. You should not be the one who is on the top. You always need to be coordinated with others. If you will try this way, you will surely see where you are. It is not so easy.</p>
<p>We are always ready to dismiss others. When some matters of the service were assigned to certain brothers or sisters, many times they would say that they wanted to make it clear that no one should come to the place where they were to serve. If they were to do the cooking, they would insist that no one else come to the kitchen. On the one hand, this is right. But on the other hand, they needed a few not only to help them but also to be a burden to them. Otherwise, there would be no lesson for them to learn. If you have some helpers that are a burden to you in the service, then you will be limited, broken, and adjusted. You need someone to be your burden. You may be too quick, and you need someone to burden you to slow you down. Then you will learn the lesson, and you will bring people in.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SURROUNDED BY SERVING ONES<br />
WITH THE WORK OUT OF YOUR HANDS</h2>
<p>In serving the Lord in the way of coordination, the best test of your service is to check, after a certain time, how much of the service is in your hand, and how many more people have been brought into your part of the service. After six months, if all of the service is in your hand and nearly all of the people are gone&mdash;you are almost the only one left&mdash;that is serious. You may be much better than others in doing the job. However, although the job is done in a much better way, the situation in the church life has actually become worse. By doing a better job by yourself, you have actually brought damage to the church life.</p>
<p>You need to bring more people in, and eventually not even one percent of the work should be left in your hand. Everything should be in the hands of others, and eventually there may be hundreds of people serving with you. This is the way of coordination, the way to bring people in and to have the church built up. The more you serve, the less is in your hand. The more you serve, the larger is the number of serving ones.</p>
<p>You should not consider the job that you have done. Rather you need to consider the percentage of the service that is in your hand, and the number of the serving ones. There are some real lessons to be learned regarding this matter. The biggest lesson in this matter is brokenness. We may talk about being broken, but the way to be broken is to serve the Lord with your brothers and sisters in the way of coordination.</p><h2 class="head1">OPENNESS FOR THE COORDINATION</h2>
<p>We do need the training in this matter, and we need the practice. What we have been talking about is mainly on the practical side. If you would take these matters and put them into practice, you will realize how much is involved here. Just this little word is enough for you to practice for your whole life. You will find that there is a nature within you that is always independent, a nature that is always secretive. You don&rsquo;t like to open yourself to others. Something in your blood always likes to be independent and to keep things secret, hidden from others.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters are able to talk about a lot of things without opening themselves to others. They talk, but they always keep themselves closed. You may serve the Lord with them for quite a period of time and still not know where they are.</p>
<p>If you would take this word to serve the Lord in a way of coordination, then you will find out where you are. By nature you are an independent person, a secretive person, even a person of mystery. You like to keep yourself hidden in yourself as a mystery. God caused the church to be hidden in Himself as a mystery in the Old Testament, but today you are keeping yourself as a mystery within yourself. It is not so easy for you to open yourself to others.</p>
<p>If there is no openness, this means that there is no brokenness. The more brokenness, the more openness, and the more openness, the more blending with others. Unless we learn the spiritual lesson of being broken, of being open, and of being blended with others, it will be impossible for us to have the church life. We can come together week after week, month after month, and year after year, but we can never have a church life. We can never be built up together to express Christ in a corporate way. We can never be blended as one in the spirit because our natural life, our soulish life, our human nature, has never been broken. There is only one way for you to experience the real brokenness of the natural life, and that is to be coordinated with others. You cannot merely close yourself in your room to read the Scriptures and pray and praise the Lord that you are broken. The more you declare in your room that you are broken, the more you are not broken. Whether or not you are really broken is tested by the coordination with others.</p>
<p>Suppose there is a sister who always likes to close herself in a room to seek after the Lord. She is very faithful to read the Word, to meditate, to kneel down to pray day by day. Her practice is very good, but the real test is whether or not this sister is really broken. It is possible for a person to be very spiritual alone with the Lord and yet never have the self broken.</p>
<p>Suppose that, under the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty, this sister is placed in some kind of coordination and put among seven sisters. Each of the seven is a Martha, and they simply do not know how to be quiet. In fact, all they know is work and more work, doing and more doing. Sovereignly these eight are put into a situation where there is so much that needs to be done that there is no time for this dear sister to seek the Lord alone in her room. This will become a real test to her. She may even lose her temper because she has no time for this. This is a proof that she has never been broken. After passing through such a testing, how could this sister close herself in her room in her old way and praise the Lord that she is broken? Actually, the sovereignty of the Lord brought her into such a situation to show her that she has to be broken in this very matter.</p>
<p>The teachings among today&rsquo;s Christians place too much emphasis on individual spirituality, making Christians into antiques and showpieces instead of preparing them as materials for the building. God never intended that you should be individually spiritual. Individual spirituality spoils and does much damage to the building of the church. If you realize that God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, God&rsquo;s ultimate intention, is to have a Body, a corporate vessel to contain Christ and to express Christ, you will say, &ldquo;Lord, save me, deliver me from my individual spirituality. I have to be broken even in this matter of individual spirituality. I need to be delivered from this kind of individuality. I need to learn the lesson to be broken so that I could be coordinated with others, so that I could be blended with others, and become a real help to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proper way for such a spiritual sister to serve the Lord is to learn the lesson of brokenness, to learn how to be delivered by the Lord from her individual spirituality, to learn to go along with others. Then, gradually, the others will learn the same lesson, and this sister will be a help to them and minister the life of Christ to them in the proper way. All of these eight will then be built up together, and they will bring more and more people to be coordinated with them. Then they will be spiritual in a coordinated way, not in an individual way. Surely this is a much-needed lesson.</p>
<p>We need to stress this matter so much simply because by experience we realize that if we would not learn this lesson, we can never have a real church life. Without this, our church life would be a false one. We can come together on the Lord&rsquo;s Day and sing a hymn, have some prayer, and hear a message&mdash;but that is all. We can never have a church built up. We cannot have a group of believers built up together as a living corporate Body. We need to learn to serve in a way that we could be coordinated with others and others could be coordinated with us. There are many lessons here for us to learn.</p>
<p>Besides brokenness, you need to learn always to make it possible for others to coordinate with you. If you all would simply take this word and go on to serve the Lord in a way of coordination, there is no need for me to say anything more. There are many lessons ahead of you, but you should not give up. The more lessons you have, the more you need to learn, and the more you learn, the more the lessons will continue to come. This is the way the Lord builds up His church.</p>
<p>If three persons can do a particular job in the Lord&rsquo;s service, you should not reduce the number to two. It would be better to have four or even five. Never reduce the number, but always increase it, because the more the number is increased, the more lessons there are for you to learn and the more building will be realized.</p>
<p>Some brothers have said, &ldquo;I simply cannot do anything if some sisters are here. If you would ask me to do something, you must tell these sisters not to come to me.&rdquo; I am afraid that we may still have some brothers in such a situation. If you are such a brother, the Lord will send you more sisters; and probably, under His sovereignty, He will send you the most troublesome ones. The Lord will test you to show you where you are. You need to learn the lesson to do the work in the service in a corporate way. The church is a test to you, and the real service of the church is also a test.</p>
<p>We all should try to know the church. We need to practice to know the way of the church service, which is a service of coordination, never a service of an individual person. All the service in the church is a service of coordination.</p>
<p>Many times I like to fellowship with the brothers about my message before I deliver it. This is the best way. It is good to come together with the brothers to fellowship about the message you are going to give, taking the attitude of being open to others and being ready to be adjusted. If the brothers would give you just a little hint that they would not have you minister, you should be willing to take it. You should not act in an independent way. In everything, in every job, in every part of the Lord&rsquo;s service, you need to try to open yourself to others to be coordinated with them, and to do everything in the service in a way of coordination. Then you will learn the lesson and the church will be much profited in the matter of building up. Otherwise, we may have a lot of meetings, but we could not have the real church life.</p></body></html>
