   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DYING TO LIVE OUT GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second point concerning the way to die is that God wants us to live out not our human life, but the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In other words He does not want us to live out ourselves; He wants us to live out Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to live out God, we need to die.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The only part of our being that is useful to God is our will.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God wants us to exercise our will to choose Him to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Again, I say, He does not want us to live out ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more we live out ourselves, the more we offend God and rebel against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's economy is to have Himself lived out by us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, we are doing our best to live out ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some say, "I shall live out myself by loving others and by helping them."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But God says, "Your loving of others and your helping them are rebellion against Me. I don't want you to love others or to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I want you to take Me as your life and to live Me out as your living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you fail to do this, you are against My economy, and that is rebellion."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How important it is for us all to see that God's economy is that we must die in order to live out God!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>WHAT IS MOST PLEASING TO THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The next thing we need to see about how to die is that nothing pleases God as much as our living by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the most pleasant thing to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we take Him as our life and live Him out, His heart is touched, and He is joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Marriage is an illustration of this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nothing touches a husband's heart more than having his wife live according to him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How happy a husband is whenever his wife lives according to him!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Likewise, the Lord is very pleased when we live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1933 I was invited to a province in southern China where we were served rice to eat three times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As a northerner, I was accustomed to eating wheat instead of rice.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Realizing that I was exhausted by the strenuous work of ministering in several meetings a day, some sisters decided to prepare some wheat bread for me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although, they made this bread out of love, it tasted so bad that I could not eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I did not say a word to them, but inwardly I thought that I would rather eat their rice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This illustrates the fact that even though we may do something for others in a loving way, what we do may be not at all pleasing to them because it is done according to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a wife loves her husband in this way, she will kill him with her love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is most pleasing to others is that we live according to them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In like manner, the most pleasing thing to God is that we live by Him in order to live Him out.</S>
