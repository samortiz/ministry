   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Most Bible teachers interpret the Lord's words in verse 3, "I am coming again and will receive you to Myself," to refer to His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, in verse 18 the Lord again says, "I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then He adds, "Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you shall live also.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the Lord went to prepare a place for the believers by death and resurrection, He came again in resurrection to them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His going was His coming!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He came back to enter into the disciples by going into death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"I go away, and I am coming to you" v. 28 . This coming is not His second coming, but His coming in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For a little while they lost Him, but they would behold Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because He lived, they also would live.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In that day they would know that He was in the Father, they were in Him, and He was in them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"In that day" is not the day of His second coming; if it were, we would all be here as orphans!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"That day" came after three days.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the day of resurrection He brought us not to the heavens but into the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Father was the place where He was and where He promised to bring us v. 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord's concept is that He was in the Father, but that we were not.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We were outside.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He would die to take away our sins, to destroy the Devil, and to release the Father's life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then in resurrection He would bring us into His Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus where He was, we also would be.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through His death and resurrection He has brought us into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For this Triune God we are the many abodes of the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the church!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church is implied in John 14 in this wonderful way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church is our home, yet we are all rooms abodes in which the Father and the Son may dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may never have heard such an interpretation of John 14 before.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I hope you will not pass off my words as a peculiar way of looking at these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you take the traditional interpretation, you will destroy these four chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To consider these verses as referring to literal heavenly mansions is too low, too physical.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such an interpretation is off.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John 14 through 17 reveals that we the redeemed ones, through the death and resurrection of Christ, have been brought into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The thought here is the Triune God, not heavenly mansions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because we have been brought into Him, we become Christ's mystical Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As His mystical Body, the church is the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this house of God, which is the real temple of God, are many abodes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Each of us is one of these abodes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church is the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For centuries 14:2 has been wrongly interpreted.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the Father's house is mentioned in 2:16, Bible teachers do not connect it with the heavenly mansions.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They all recognize that the Father's house refers to the temple on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Why, then, do they think the Father's house in 14:2 refers to heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is a principle of biblical interpretation that we must understand the Bible by the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God's dwelling place in this age on this earth is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Father's house in John 14, then, refers to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We, the regenerated ones, are the abodes in this house.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE BRANCHES OF THE VINE</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is My commandment, that you love one another, even as I have loved you" John 15:5, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The branches of the vine are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the Lord said that we should love one another, He was implying that fruit-bearing is not an individual matter.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we each go our separate ways and seek to bear fruit, there does not need to be any love for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To bear fruit while we love one another means that together we bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The fruit is brought forth in a collective way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The branches of the vine form a corporate entity, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If our concern is only to win souls and we have no regard for the church life, we are being individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are killing the Body while we are "bearing fruit"!</S>
