   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Preserving Our Soul Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After reminding us of Lot s wife, the Lord Jesus goes on to say, Whoever seeks to preserve his soul life shall lose it, and whoever shall lose it, shall preserve it alive v. 33 . To preserve the soul life is to allow the soul to have its enjoyment and not to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To lose the soul life is to cause the soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the followers of the Man-Savior allow their soul to have its enjoyment in this age, they will cause their soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If they allow their soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in this age for the sake of the Man-Savior, they will cause their soul to have its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age, that is, to share the Lord s joy in ruling over the earth Matt 25:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To preserve our soul is related to lingering in the earthly and material things mentioned in Luke 17:31.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We linger in the earthly things because we care for the enjoyment of our soul in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This will cause us to lose our soul; that is, our soul will suffer the loss of its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Rapture in Relation to</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our Practical Living</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 17:34 and 35 the Lord says, I tell you, in that night there will be two on one couch; the one will be taken, and the other will be left.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There will be two grinding at the same place; the one will be taken, but the other will be left.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In these verses the rapture of the overcoming believers is revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It will occur secretly and unexpectedly, at night to some believers who are sleeping and in the daytime to some sisters grinding at home and to some brothers working in the field.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are chosen because they have overcome the stupefying effect of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 14:25-35 the Savior charges us to pay the price insofar as we are able that we may follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 16:1-13 He charges us to overcome mammon so that we may serve Him prudently as a faithful steward.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here in 17:22-37 He charges us to overcome the stupefying effect of self-indulgent living in this age so that we may be raptured into the enjoyment of His parousia presence, coming .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These charges are all related to overcoming in the believers practical living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In both 17:34 and 35 the Lord says that the one will be taken.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Greek word for taken literally means taken with.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This word denotes the rapture of the overcomers, who do not preserve their soul life by loving the worldly things of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who are taken in this way will be raptured before the great tribulation Matt 24:21 , which will be a severe trial upon the whole inhabited earth Rev 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be thus raptured is to be kept out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth Rev 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The words grinding in Luke 17:35 and in the field in Matthew 24:40 signify working for a living.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although the believers should not be stupefied by the necessities of this life, they need to work for a living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Any thought of giving up proper work for a living is another extreme of Satan s tactics.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not All Believers Raptured at Once</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 17:34-36 we see that some who are sleeping will be raptured in the night, and some sisters grinding and some brothers farming will be raptured in the day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here we see that the rapture will involve saints who are in different places at different times.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the rapture takes place, some will be raptured in the night, and others will be raptured in the day, depending on where they live on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Perhaps the saints in the Far East will be raptured in the night, and the saints in the West will be raptured in the day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In these verses we see that not all those who are sleeping, grinding, or farming will be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This indicates that not all the believers will be raptured at once.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord says that two will be on one couch, and one will be taken and the other will be left.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The same will be true of two grinding at the same place and of two laboring in the field.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In each case, the one who is left may not know the whereabouts of the one who has been taken.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the rapture of the watchful believers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Certain fundamental teachers of the Bible do not believe in the rapture of the overcomers as distinct from the general rapture of all believers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In other words, they do not believe in what has been called the partial rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These fundamental teachers believe only in what is mentioned in 1 Thessalonians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They do not believe that Matthew 24 and Luke 17 speak of the rapture of the watchful, overcoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, as we consider these chapters, we realize that the only way to interpret such portions is to regard them as speaking of the rapture of the overcoming believers.</S>
