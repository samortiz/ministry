We like to be on the alert as to what the Lord is doing, what He wants today, and what He wants to do among His children
According to their thought, mankind could be improved in society and adjusted by culture, by education, and by the teaching of the Bible
Many of the Bible teachers began to write something concerning prophecy, Christ's second coming, and the millennium
The Keswick Convention speakers and the inner-life teachers were quite prevailing and wrote a number of good books
They do not want to live merely in a scientific or material way, but they are seeking something very logical and even philosophical
They may be very much involved in their university studies, yet deep within they are seeking the reality of human life
All of this indicates that deep in the human heart and the Christian heart there is a need, a thirst, and a hunger after the truth
They do not have the burden to preach the superficial, religious things, nor even to preach the shallow gospel
Many people cannot express exactly what they are seeking after yet we know that what they are seeking after is the reality of the Triune God
Thank the Lord that at the end of 1984 with twelve years of labor we finished the Life-study of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament
Since the recovery came to the United States in the early sixties, we began the publication work on a very small scale
Even the dear brothers who were with us for some time and left still recognize the worth of what they received in the recovery
Recently, a certain sister among us went with some others to the airport to meet some other brothers and sisters
The wife of that couple saw this sister's Recovery Version of the New Testament and asked if she could look at it
While this sister was talking to the wifes husband and to others the wife could not stop reading the notes on the text of the New Testament
We have to see the need of today's world, and we have to realize what the Lord has given us and how much we have today
A good number of saints have been very faithful in the recovery to learn the truths, attend the meetings, and keep a good testimony
Some of the saints may wonder, though, why we are seemingly so small with very little increase in the churches
Generally speaking, Latin America is devoid of the truth and many people are tired of Catholicism and Pentecostalism
The Lord's recovery has been firmly founded on a rock, which is a standing of the divine truth and the divine life
In the past forty-one years since the end of World War II, nearly every nation has endeavored to educate its people
If you are going to understand this section, you have to know how to section the entire twenty-one chapters of the Gospel of John
The second section of John's Gospel begins in chapter twelve and is concerning the Lord's multiplication for His glorification
At that time Andrew and Philip thinking that this warm and wonderful welcome was glorious came to tell Him that the Greeks wanted to see Him
Andrew and Philip may have understood the people's wonderful reception and welcome of Jesus as His being glorified
John 13:31 says, 'Then when he went out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him'
Remember that the section from chapter twelve through chapter seventeen of John is concerning the Lords multiplication for His glorification
The first case was the Father's house , the second case was the grapevine , and the third case was the new child
Approximately ninety percent of these elders are under forty years of age, and some are a little over thirty years of age
We realized that we had been on the island of Taiwan for over thirty-six years and we had still not evangelized the entire island
As a result we made a decision to rise up and evangelize, 'gospelize,' and 'truthize' the entire island of Taiwan within five years
We are calling for five hundred full-timers every year for the next five years, giving us up to twenty-five hundred full-timers
We acquired thirty-seven and a half acres on which to build this center, which cost about eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars
On the Lord's day nearly the entire amount of cash came in to purchase the property from each offering box in the twenty-one halls
In December of 1985 we had two big gospel meetings in a stadium in Taipei that can seat twelve thousand people
To my surprise, this stadium was filled over its seating capacity with fourteen thousand people for the first gospel meeting
We are those who have the truth concerning this processed and consummated God, and we are experiencing the Lord's blessing wherever we go
In the last book of the New Testament, Revelation, there is a call for the thirsty sinner to come and drink the water of life
Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
The Lord charged us to go to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the Triune God, the processed and consummated Triune God
Soon before His ascension, the Lord told the disciples to wait in Jerusalem until the Holy Spirit would come upon them
Now all of us as the disciples of the Lord have the Spirit within us essentially and the Spirit upon us economically
Jesus breathed His Spirit into His believers and Jesus poured out the Spirit economically upon all His believers
Merely to say that we need to claim the essential and economical aspects of the one Spirit by faith, though, is still too objective
Acts 2:38 and 5:32b tell us that if we are going to receive, enjoy, and experience the Spirit, we need to repent and we have to obey
He is ready to forgive us and wash us all the time, yet the forgiveness and the washing of the blood need our repentance
John 19 tells us If we confess our sins He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
In the spiritual realm, we also need much washing, but the washing, the forgiveness, depends upon our repenting
You cannot say that because you washed your hands two weeks ago that you do not need to wash your hands anymore
According to Matthew 12:36-37, every man shall have to render an account in the day of judgment of every idle word which they speak
It would be wonderful if all of us could spend one or two hours with the Lord personally to make a thorough confession
Since He knows the record of all our sinful doings, it is best for us to ask Him to rid us of that record by confessing
In order to have a fine forgiveness, you must make a fine confession, confessing to the Lord in a detailed way
Since we are members of His Body, surely the pouring out of the Spirit is our inheritance, our lot, our portion
Experientially we will be filled within and without with the Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God
A husband and a wife can even make an agreement with one another that they are going to have such a time and would not like to be disturbed
In nearly all of the things related to the practice of the church, the church degraded from taking the divine way to taking the human way
In Matthew 16 and 18 the universal church and the local church are unveiled not in a doctrinal way but in a very experiential, practical way
In Matthew 18 the Lord unveiled the local church in an experiential way by telling us how to recover a backsliding or sinful brother
Due to tradition and to our environment we do not consider a gathering of two believers as a Christian meeting or as a church meeting
In Matthew 18:20 the Lord does not say that the two or three meet together in His name, but that these two or three are gathered
The proper translation of Matthew 18:20 is not that two or three are gathered together 'in My name' but 'into My name'
The Lord, however, did a lot of pushing to rescue you out of your tiredness and bring you into Himself with the other saints in the meeting
Sometimes the Lord may rescue a sister out of her husband and children or a brother out of his wife and into His name
In Ephesians 5:19 and in Colossians 3:16 the psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are not mainly for singing but for speaking
We must pick up this habit and forget about our background, what we have learned in the past, and about our present environment
The reason why the situation among many Christians today is so weak, poor, low, cold, and far off is altogether due to the lack of speaking
If you are the only one on a basketball team who plays, there is no encouragement for you to play and it is hard for you to play
We all have to learn to speak Christ as our word, the Word of God, and to speak His word, the word as revealed in the Bible
We should not merely say something concerning Him but we must 'say Him'; we must say something that is Christ Himself
She probably studied the Old Testament thoroughly in order to pick up the various points and terms which composed her praise to God
The tragic thing about most Christian meetings is that very few of the attendants have an adequate knowledge of God's Word
In the Life-studies and in the notes of the Recovery Version are many high, deep, and profound terms which we should learn and use
In describing the wonderful Spirit which we have received and which we now enjoy we have used seven marvelous adjectives
All the ones among us who are under twenty-five years of age are in a golden time to acquire a rich spiritual vocabulary
The book of Acts shows us that we need to be filled with the Spirit and we need to receive the outpouring of the Spirit
Inwardly we do not have much of the divine essence, and outwardly we do not have much of the Spirit for God's economy
All the saints in the Lord's recovery have to rise up to seek after the filling of the Spirit and after the outpouring of the Spirit
Generally speaking, fundamental Christians do not care for the Spirit and some even dare not to talk about the Spirit
On the other hand, the practices of Pentecostalism related to the so-called Spirit are not built upon the divine Word
Today the Triune God is not raw but He has been processed through incarnation human living crucifixion burial resurrection and ascension
Today our God is the Spirit; our Savior is the Spirit; our Redeemer, our Master, our Lord, our Jesus Christ, is this Spirit
We need to speak the word of Christ, the words of the New Testament, and sometimes even the word quoted from the Old Testament
If we mean business with the Lord for His recovery, especially concerning the meetings, we all have to learn the Word
In the Old Testament, whoever came to the tabernacle to contact God had to offer the sin offering and the trespass offering
If you would confess your wrongdoings, one wrongdoing after another will rise up within you for your confession
If you feel that you are wrong with others or that you have wronged others, you had better make some restitution
You do not need to wonder what your feeling or sensation will be after you have made a thorough confession and are filled with the Spirit
A number of saints can testify that when they practiced making a thorough confession to the Lord, they experienced the Spirit in a rich way
At the most, all we will be able to have as the contents of the small group meetings is a little talk which we may term fellowship
In our small group meetings we should speak with the Word of God, and we should speak the Word with the Spirit
When you have the adequate word and the infilling and the outpouring of the Spirit you have something urging pushing burdening you to speak
We have discovered that these small group meetings really work to bring people in, to touch people, and to take care of people
It may be that in your small group everybody is speaking, but you do not know how to speak and have nothing with which to speak
There is no need for you to discern whether you are experiencing the essential aspect of the Spirit or the economical aspect
We also need to study the footnotes and the Recovery Version and the Life-study Messages along with some other helpful reference books
You may not feel that you are so sinful, yet you have to realize you are so filled up with things other than Christ
From the time that we rise up in the morning until the time that we retire at night, we need to wash our hands many times
As Christians who are walking and living on this earth, we must realize that no place, no person, and no thing we touch is clean
We get dirty by touching all these worldly things so we need to get ourselves cleansed and cleared up from within and from without
To do this we need to deal with the Word all the time, and we need to have the infilling and outpouring of the all-inclusive Spirit
Even among us, not many have ever realized that in the New Testament there is such a thought, the thought of being experienced in the word
Because they stopped there and did not go on, there was the need for the Apostle Paul to write the book of Hebrews
It may be easy for us to understand what the word of grace is and what the words of life and the words of truth are
They had never become experienced in the word of Gods righteousness the word concerning Gods dispensational dealing with His chosen people
We need to know the truth, not just the beginning of the truth, but the advanced truth which is the word of righteousness
In Hebrews 5:13-14 is the thought of being experienced in the word, and in Acts 4:31 is the clear fact concerning the filling of the Spirit
Those statistics show that in the past ten years the rate of increase in the Lord's recovery has not been encouraging
On the first day of use during the training on Revelation the hall in Anaheim was filled with over four thousand saints
Now there are approximately ninety-eight churches in the Lord's recovery in the United States, and seven more in Canada
They all came to the meeting in groups, singing on the way, shouting, 'hallelujahing,' and 'amening' on the way
Regrettably, in many of today's meetings only a few are sitting on the front row at 7:30; most of the saints have not yet come
They said that at any cost we must uplift the rate of increase; at any cost we must uplift the atmosphere of our meetings
At that time the church in Taipei had over eleven thousand meeting in twenty-one halls, with only less than six elders
On the day of Pentecost, those three thousand all began to meet from house to house on the same day they were saved
They were all Jews filled with the old religion of their fathers, but on the day of Pentecost they heard something new
They all heard the message, they received the word, they repented, they were baptized, and they received the Holy Spirit
That was not a method, but an issue, an overflow from their being filled with these two things: the word and the Spirit
All the young saints received the help to repent and to make a thorough confession to receive the filling of the Spirit
Philip in Acts 8 had the privilege, the right, and the position to preach the gospel to that eunuch and to immediately baptize him
Acts 2:47 is now the experience of the church in Taipei-'the Lord added together those who were being saved from day to day'
Within those ten weeks over three thousand were baptized, and these baptisms took place nearly every day and everywhere
For the Lord's recovery to spread, there is the need of more increase, and there is the need of meetings with a higher atmosphere
All the saints in the Lord's recovery today need to be filled with the Spirit and to be poured out upon by the Spirit
My burden is that we would not follow the fundamental way or the Pentecostal way in dealing with the Word and the Spirit
Most of the saints in the Lord's recovery are at a standstill, not dealing with the Word and not dealing with the Spirit
Some may say that they are dealing with the Word by reading the Bible and even by studying the Bible and reading the Life-study Messages
How many of us could say that we are really experienced in the Word of God and that we do mean business in reading the Word?
We all must become experienced in the word, and we need to have the real experience of the infilling and outpouring of the Spirit
When the one you were contacting referred something to you, you did not understand and did not know what to say
Whatever you are asked, you should have the right answer immediately, not out of your own thoughts, but out of the Word
If you have a pocket-sized version of the Bible, you can open it up and say, 'The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 15:45
The thoughtful people, especially the young college students, are desirous of knowing things and substantiating them
Since the time we were saved, we have had the Holy Spirit within us, but He has not been within us enough in an experiential way
If you have such a dealing with the Lord every day, even every moment, the Spirit within you will be so fresh in your experience
When you talk to people even though they may not know what is there they will realize that something within you is quite new and convincing
Nicodemus came to the Lord Jesus, but in John 4 the Lord went purposely from Jerusalem to Samaria to the very well of Jacob
They use Bible verses through the Spirit, and they touch people's heart, feeling, conscience, and understanding
These full-timers do not use vain talk, for they have learned that people frequently say that they are busy and do not have time
Once within one week some of the saints in Taipei plus the full-timers, baptized eleven hundred and four new believers
You may practice speaking, practice the exercise of the spirit, and practice the belief in the infilling and outpouring of the Holy Spirit
It will not be difficult for you in the home meetings, regardless whether the attendants are unbelievers or believers
In Taipei at the beginning of the year they had three hundred ninety-nine small home meetings, and they may have more today
For you to speak a hymn you must be experienced in the holy Word because a good hymn is always composed according to the biblical revelation
Whenever one comes into such a meeting he will never give up coming, but will continue to come again and again
By meeting in such a living way we can keep people teach people educate people and build people up with the proper supply of life and truth
It will be so easy for each one of us to gain a person monthly, to bear fruit every month like the tree of life
Those who make profit will receive a reward to be the co-kings with Christ and to enjoy His joy in the coming kingdom
The kingship and the Lord's joy will be a reward to the faithful ones, but the unfaithful ones will be put into darkness
The Lord is calling us to rise up to serve God as His priests, as the branches of Christ, and as the slaves of the Lord
To be cut off from the vine indicates that we will miss and lose the enjoyment, the fellowship, of the vine tree's riches
Also, the branches who do not bear fruit by abiding in the vine are gathered and cast into the fire for burning
We will firstly be cut off from the participation in and enjoyment of the riches of Christ and then be cast into the fire
We all have to rise up, but this does not mean that only the full-timers who give up their jobs are priests, branches, and slaves
We must come back to the pure Word, which tells us that we all are priests of God, branches of Christ, and slaves of the Lord
Again, the Lord's speaking for all of us to rise up is not just to those who can offer all their time to the Lord
In the New Testament there is no hint that those three thousand who were saved on the day of Pentecost gave up their jobs
Acts 18:1-3 tells us that Aquila had the trade of making tents as did the Apostle Paul, who labored with him in this trade for a while
When the circumstances under God's sovereignty allowed him to serve as a priest of the gospel with his full time, he did it
To work for the preaching of the gospel on the college campuses in the United States requires full-time laborers
We all are priests who should serve God by ministering the gospel to the sinners to make them offerings to God
We all are branches who should bear fruit for the multiplication, the glorification, the expression, of God the Father
We are responsible for what we do with this talent and we have to give an account to the Lord at His coming back
To rise up does not mean that you will be a full-time worker, and to go out does not mean that you need to be a full-time worker
In 1985 some full-time workers went to Berkeley, California, and caught approximately two hundred contacts for the Lord
Many of the saints in the Bay Area who were not full-timers picked up the burden to care for these two hundred contacts
Some of the brothers here in the United States may have thought that the saints in the Far East were helping to take care of my living
Many Christians from different denominations, from different countries, and other sources donated a lot for his work
He did not organize the money to hire people, but he told his co-workers that they were not sure how much they could receive of the Lord
Whatever material supply was received by the China Inland Mission headquarters was sent to all the missionaries on a percentage basis
Because we made a resolution to do everything according to the Bible when we were young, we took the Biblical way
We cannot find any hint that the Lord wants us to organize something to control the finances in a center to hire people
When these ones began to serve the Lord full-time in their localities, the church spontaneously took care of their need
It has been proven in Taiwan that the full-time workers' going out to spread the truth has been much blessed by the Lord
At the very beginning of the church life recorded in the book of Acts, the saints were, no doubt, under the Holy Spirit's move
On the day of Pentecost at least over three thousand saints were touched by the Lord to have everything in common
The practice to have all things in common could not go on too long because there are many practical things involved
In Acts 20:34 Paul told us that he worked to take care of his needs and to take care of the ones who were with him
Nearly all the possessions of the approximately eight hundred saints in the church in Chefoo were offered to the church
They must use everything for the Lord, but their possessions must still be in their hands and not in the church's hands
It was through this offering that seventy saints, including husbands, wives, and children, were sent to inner Mongolia from Chefoo
Another thirty were sent to the city of Antung in Manchuria with the church supplying their daily needs for three months
Other Christian groups throughout the course of church history also tried to practice having everything in common, but no one has succeeded
It does not remain in the way practiced in Acts 2 and 4, but in the way practiced by Paul in Acts and taught by him in his Epistles
There is an old proverb which says, 'There has never been a rich family that has lasted for three generations'
If you want to make much money and retain it for your children and grandchildren, the end result will be a failure
The manna that some of the children of Israel tried to save so they could have some excess 'bred worms and stank'
Some may feel that since God keeps equality and that we will never lack anything, that there is then no need for them to do any work
If we support the full-timers, we are participating, sharing in, their work for the truth, and we become 'fellow workers in the truth'
Even the wives whose husbands are full-time workers could work to support their husbands and other full-timers if possible
They gave much support to Paul financially to further the preaching of the gospel and the spreading of the gospel
When we give to support the full-time workers for the furtherance of the spreading of the Lord's truth, many will be saved
The Lord Jesus concludes His fellowship regarding the prudent steward in Luke 16 by saying that no steward can serve two lords
Thank the Lord if He has given you a high education and a high position with a very good opportunity to make a lot of money
At the same time we need to make money not to be rich and not only for our living but also for the support of the fulltime workers going out
Suppose a church can only support one full-timer, but two among them are burdened and qualified to be full-time
The leading ones should fellowship with the saints concerning giving five percent of their income for the full-time workers
If a church of one hundred saints only has three full-time workers, they should have an extra supply for two other full-time workers
Through fellowship with the other churches, they will be able to realize where there are places with full-time workers who need support
The church needs to take care of the principle of setting aside five percent of the offerings for the full-time workers
If you feel that you should go full-time, fellowship with the leading ones in your locality and with all the other full-time workers
We do not control or take the way of organization, but leave the matter of support completely in the Lord's hands
When Brother Nee was young and serving the Lord full-time, he lived in poverty, not receiving that much support
He said that his going into business was like a widow remarrying, but that he did this not for himself but for his children
Today the United States and Taiwan are rich countries and there is no need for us to suffer the way we did in China
We do not want to practice anything in the past or even anything practiced among us in the United States in the past twenty-three years
We need to be filled with such a Spirit inwardly and outwardly, essentially and economically, for life and for work
Some saints in Taiwan began to call our Recovery Version 'the gold bar' because of the precious, valuable truths it contains
We should only spend about five minutes to read the front page of the newspaper to get the proper knowledge of the world situation
Besides eating, sleeping, exercising for our health, and working, we should use all our time to dive into the Word
We need to get ourselves saturated, infused, filled, and soaked with all the truths contained in these writings
We need to somewhat forget about our own enjoyment and think about the Lord's propagation and the Lord's increase
The leading ones should not be the only ones who enter into the preaching of the gospel and the teaching of the truths
Hundreds of young boys and girls can go to the campus to tell others who the Triune God is and why He created them
If they cannot explain that much, they can open the Recovery Version to let the ones they contact read something for themselves
By reading some of the titles of the booklets to a new one, they will be attracted to the truths contained in them
If you would spend five minutes with your neighbor to give him these booklets and read the titles to him, you have done a marvelous job
We should fill, saturate, and soak the homes in our localities with all the truths we have in our hands, in our hearts, and on all the tapes
We are printing every day in Irving and Taiwan to create more and more weapons, but we need some soldiers to use them
The full-timers may receive their support from the church or from individual saints, but they should take nothing from the Gentiles
When he heard the news about our plan to build a training center at Lin-Ko, he decided to give this entire amount for that purpose
Everyone should offer five percent of his income for the full-timers' support and the church should put this into a separate account
We have to keep a proper budget and we should do well in our job to take care of our wife and children properly
If we would all practice giving in this way, many things could be done for the Lord, and He will have a free way to go on
Some of the brothers from Canada went back and made a big poster of this statement and put it in their meeting hall
The elders need to fellowship with all those who intend to go full-time to find out whether or not they are qualified
They also may not possess the adequate spiritual vocabulary and utterance to preach the gospel and to teach the truths
The producing of full-timers also involves moving in the Body as the one new man by fellowshipping locally and universally
One who becomes a fulltimer will not pass a formal exam but a spontaneous test through all the churches as to whether or not he is qualified
A person must be trained and disciplined and his character must be built up; otherwise, he cannot be a soldier in the army
Based on the elders' discernment, some of the saints should be told that the time is not right for them to go full-time
If you are the right person to be a full-timer and you cannot get through in your locality, you will get through in the Body
If your speaking in the meetings edifies, builds up, and saves people, even the angels will testify that you are the right one
The elders should do their best to promote the matter of being full-time and if possible to raise up some to be full-time
Mostly we hold the concept that we come to the meeting for our enjoyment, but we neglect the fact that our enjoyment should be for others
Some saints would say that they do not come to the church meetings because they do not have any enjoyment when they come
The purpose of the meetings is not for our enjoyment, but for the spreading of the truth and the ministering of Christ to others as life
We must utilize this time in the same way that the Lord Jesus took advantage of the Sabbath to preach the gospel to people
There are four levels and each level contains forty-eight lessons for a total of one hundred ninety-two lessons
All the saints in the church should get themselves registered according to their choice of the appropriate level they need
Many of the Sunday goers are already regenerated and a gospel meeting may not interest them or meet their need
We all need the faith to believe that in every big city after three years the church will be filled with one thousand people
The care for the twenty-one halls of the church in Taipei is now in the hands of these so-called unqualified ones
If the mothers would always keep the kitchen under their strict control, none of their daughters would learn to be good cooks
Every week the saints will fellowship over a message of life supply and of the spiritual principles of the Lord's service
The home meetings are not mainly to help ourselves but for us to spread the truth and preach the gospel to have the propagation the increase
Many churches in the United States have been awakened to the fact that they have been too independent, especially since 1977
With the raising up and supporting of the full-timers we need to enter into the experience of the Lord's one move
In your place you may feel that a certain brother is not qualified to be full-time, but the Body may feel he is the best one
The reason why we call our version of the New Testament the Recovery Version is because this refers to the recovery of the lost truths
To merely be saved with your sins forgiven to have a right to go to heaven is a salvation in the degradation of Christianity
One scene on the television showed many Arabs throwing away their new guns and only one Israeli soldier chasing them
Matthew 24:39 says, 'And they did not know until the flood came and took all away; so also shall the coming of the Son of Man be'
Both 'watch therefore' and 'your Lord' prove that the two men and two women in verses 40 and 41 are saved believers
Householder' refers to the believer, and 'house' to the believers' conduct and work which he has built up in his Christian life
The two men or two women in 24:40-41 are the living saints because they are still working in the field and grinding at the mill
Matthew 25:1-13 addresses what will happen to the majority of the believers who will have died before the Lord's coming
The fact that their lamps were 'going out' proves that their lamps were lighted, having oil in them, but not having an adequate supply
While Christ has been delaying His coming back, millions of believers and lovers of Christ became sick and died
After resurrection our life for the Lord's testimony still needs to be dealt with if it is not perfect before we die
After resurrection, the foolish believers discovered that they were short of the Spirit of God and needed the fullness of the Spirit of God
But the prudent answered, saying, Lest there be not enough for us and for you, go rather to those who sell and buy for yourselves'
The price involves items such as giving up the world, dealing with self, loving the Lord above all, and counting all things loss for Christ
By the time the unready ones are raptured, the door to enter into the enjoyment of the Lord's marriage feast was shut
By reading the context of Matthew 25:1-13, we can see that to be watchful is to be filled with the Holy Spirit
Every day our lamp is burning and every day our soul, our being, is filled with the extra portion of the Holy Spirit
We Christians have two kinds of statuses before the Lord-we are virgins in life and we are slaves for our service to the Lord
If we do mean business with the Lord's present-day move, we must be filled with the Spirit every morning of every day
The Spirit who came into our spirit was given freely, but the saturating Spirit to fill our entire being, especially our soul, is not free
No doubt, your lamp is burning because you have been saved, but is there an extra portion of oil in your vessel, your soul, your being?
You may say you are tired and that you do not have the time, but you may have a lot of time to make phone calls and to gossip
When Christ comes, light, life, salvation, satisfaction, healing, freedom, rest, comfort, peace, and joy, all come with Him
From this point on, the whole New Testament is a full expounding of this wonderful Christ, who is everything to us
You spend time after time to meet for ministry meetings and in your locality in the church meetings, yet have you been watchful?
Have you ever realized that according to Matthew 25 after resurrection some believers will get into the tribulation?
Those who sell' must be the two witnesses during the great tribulation, the two olive trees and the two sons of oil
They are working for their livelihood, but while they are working they should not forget about their spiritual situation
You have to make a living, but even the early raptured ones were watchful to make themselves ready while they were making a living
In the last chapter we covered the matter of our being watchful in the spiritual life so that we may have an extra portion of oil
To speak of an extra portion of oil in our soul to saturate our entire being is another way to express the transformation by the Spirit
Here in Matthew 24 and 25, especially in these two portions concerning being faithful in service, this is not the case
All the other items in these two portions are requirements and demands, demanding your watchfulness and demanding your faithfulness
We have not only to recognize these portions of the Lord's word, but also to regard them as something not so simple
In these two chapters we have two things to take care of-our watchfulness in life and our faithfulness in service
In this parable of the talents the Lord said clearly that 'after a long time the lord of those slaves comes and settles accounts with them'
How could a false believer be raptured to the air and go to the judgment seat of Christ to be judged by the Lord?
When the Lord comes, He will send the angels to bind the tares, the false believers, and cast them into the lake of fire
If we mean business with the Lord that He is real, that He is living, and His word is altogether trustworthy, we have to be sober
Panton, who taught concerning the kingdom reward, said that many Christian teachers are giving tickets for the entrance into the kingdom
If you bring such a ticket to the entrance of the kingdom, you will discover that your ticket will not be honored
The Lord charged us, commissioned us, to minister something to His household, that is, to the believers in the church
Verse 45 says Who then is the faithful and prudent slave whom the master has set over his household to give them food at the appointed time
Verse 14 says, 'For it is as a man who, going into another country, called his own slaves and delivered to them his possessions'
The Bible does not refer to the church of the apostles the church of the elders the church of the prophets or the church of the evangelists
If we are like this in the spiritual realm, we will be poor servants to minister the life supply to the master's folks at the appointed time
Whenever we meet together, this is one of the appointed times for you to minister the proper food to the Lord's folks
We have the appointed time on the Lord's Day morning, on the Lord's Day evening, Tuesday evening, and Friday evening
The possessions not only denote the church with the believers as the Lord's possessions, but also all the sinners
The Lord has surely delivered to us the church with all the believers and all the sinners that we may take care of them for His sake
Every day is an appointed time for us to minister the proper food to anyone, and every day is a proper time for us to make some profit
My burden was to stir up the saints to adequately care for their obligation in the matter of preaching the gospel
The gospel teams going out to the nearby villages baptized thirteen hundred new believers in less than two weeks
To some degree it might not be so easy in the cities with educated people because the educated people are not so simple as the villagers
Please do not think that those people in the villages in Taiwan are uneducated; they all have a certain amount of education
In the cities, in the schools and offices, we still have a great possibility to feed people with the food of the gospel
You had better quietly consider why, within one year of at least two hundred working days, you could not gain one
As we read these portions concerning the watchfulness in life and concerning the faithfulness in service we should be warned
We must be enlightened that to have an extra portion of the oil, the Spirit, in our whole being, is not as simple as getting saved
All the dead saints will resurrect to be raptured with the living ones to the air to meet the Lord and to stand before His judgment seat
Many Christians think that the Gospels are not deep books, and that Matthew is merely one of these four Gospels
We gave many messages on this subject in 1972 in Los Angeles which are contained in a book of fifty chapters entitled The Kingdom
The kingdom of the heavens is used by God to stir us up to take care of our Christian exercise and responsibility after being saved
We all should desire to be kings and rulers in the millennium with our Lord Jesus , but are we exercised in everything?
Especially in the Lord's recovery, we have no excuse to say that we have not been warned to take care of the exercise of the Christian life
We have to realize that in our private Christian life not to pray is more serious than not to come to the meeting
Even if you never have a praying spirit toward the Lord for half an hour, in that half an hour you can never be watchful
The beginning of the parable in chapter twenty-five says, 'Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened to ten virgins
In the kingdom of the heavens, the believers are likened to virgins, not to wrestlers, boxers, or football, basketball, or baseball players
We are chaste virgins bearing the Lord's testimony in the dark age and going out of the world to meet the Lord
The foolish ones have oil in their lamps, their spirits, but they do not have the extra portion of oil in their vessels, their souls
He may be driving to a certain destination and then suddenly run out of gas because he did not watch the gas gauge
They also said that the Lord gave us the time to be joyful, which to them meant to enjoy the worldly pleasures
You may not believe that the Lord will come back in the next twenty-five years or that you will die within this time
You may desire to live carelessly as a Christian, loving whatever you like and doing whatever is a pleasure to you
We have not been that much in the proper exercise every day to exercise ourselves even every minute to buy the oil
During their meeting there was much so-called speaking in tongues and prayer, but after their meeting probably no one was watchful
If you are going to get the Holy Spirit to saturate your soul, you must pay the price in dealing with your soul
Every time we pray we have the deep sensation that some amount of the Spirit has been gained by us in our prayer
The foolish virgins discovered that they did not have the adequate supply of oil, so they wanted to borrow from the wise ones
At the end of the day you may not feel so good, but when you come to the meeting and function in it, you feel so happy
In many things we do not buy the Spirit, so we miss the chance to accumulate more and more of the Spirit in our being
You may need to stop your excessive talking on the telephone and stop your further reading of the newspaper from the first page to the next
How much have we been doing in these past few years in the matter of contacting others and speaking the Lord Jesus?
According to my observation, the Presbyterian missionaries who went to China one hundred years ago were some of the best
To be watchful is not to let your time go, not to waste your time, but to take every time as a chance to buy the oil
Whether or not we will be raptured early to enter into the wedding feast depends upon our daily buying of the Spirit from this moment
We believers in Christ all need to have a serious realization that the Lord has given us a double status, a twofold status
It is at the conclusion of the easy book along with picking up serpents and not being harmed if one drinks poison
Many ancient manuscripts, even the best ones, omit the final twelve verses of Mark, in which the aforementioned items are listed
In these two chapters two heavy and sobering items are mentioned-the portion which is appointed for the hypocrites and the outer darkness
In the very night before His death, He gave another message, which is recorded in John 14-16 with a concluding prayer in chapter seventeen
The message in John 14-17 is very deep, unveiling to us all the riches and depths of the divine life, of the Triune God, for our experience
We are virgins going out of the world with a bright and shining testimony, waiting for His coming back and getting ready to meet Him
Another group of Bible teachers, among whom were Pember, Panton, Govett, and Lang, repudiated the Brethren teaching
The truths in Matthew 24 and 25 have been adequately covered in the Life-study of Matthew and in the notes of the Recovery Version
Have we been faithful and are we still being faithful in His service that we could be at peace when He comes back to settle accounts with us
In John 10:28-29 the Lord assured us that He gave to us eternal life and that we shall by no means perish forever
The Lord did not say that believers would perish, but that many of them will be in a place where they will weep and gnash their teeth
If we believe in this portion of the Word and that the Lord will return, we must consider the seriousness of our readiness to meet Him
Everything related to these main parts of our being has to be saturated and filled with the Spirit who is the very oil
Even the Son, standing in the position of the Son of Man, does not know the day and hour of His coming back; only the Father knows
It is not a matter of when the exam for the students will be, but a matter of whether the students have prepared their lessons
If you would try to seduce them to play some sports or watch television, they would say that they must take care of their studies
A student may behave well and study for the final two days of his schooling, but that does not mean he will graduate
It is not a matter of when we will die or when the Lord Jesus will come, but a matter of how much oil we have accumulated
A student's accumulated learning and knowledge over a long period of time is what qualifies him for graduation
All of us should be those who are feeding the Lord's people at the appointed time and using the Lord's talents in full
You may not do your duty to perform your service, but instead you are criticizing and sometimes even strongly opposing the brothers
Sometimes you may have a subtle way of praying for a saint who is in a negative situation in the prayer meeting
Because you are so 'burdened for the church' and so interested in the church life, you criticize the brothers and the sisters
All these points we have fellowshipped should be a mirror to us to 'see what is on our face,' to see where we are
As a result, our editing and printing of these booklets through the Living Stream Ministry office has become a real burden
We may have many excuses, but when we appear before the judgment seat of Christ , the Lord will settle accounts with us
Their excuse is that if the Lord would return right now, everything would be solved; they would not have the time to love the world
The portion of the unbelievers is eternal perdition, while the portion of the slothful slaves is a temporary, dispensational punishment
The Lord will not listen to our excuses, but instead will cut us off from His presence and take away the gift He has given to us
Of making so many telephone calls, use the time to go to contact your next door neighbor and give him a rainbow booklet we have published
We cannot say that many have been poisoned against us or that our particular area is a place full of Christians
We must ask ourselves how much time we have spent in visiting others with gospel tracts with the Bible and with some of the rainbow booklets
George Whitefield, who was more powerful than John Wesley, was once preaching the gospel, telling people about the lake of fire
One of the listeners stood up and ran to embrace a big column in the hall and cried out that he was afraid of falling into the lake of fire
George Whitefield did not merely talk about the lake of fire, but he showed that the unbelievers would go there
On the white throne, the Lord will be the judge of the dead to make a final decision for all of the sinners to go to the lake of fire
It is good if we have many full-timers in the gospel, but many of us have to make a living by working in the world
Paul went full-time and was supported by the churches, but quite often no church and no saints took care of him
When he was making tents, he was very busy in writing the Epistles and very busy in caring for the hungry ones
Many Christians are nearly void of the truth; they have the Word of God, but they do not care for it nor do they realize how much is in it
We all should have the spirit and the burden to spare some money to get some copies of the Recovery Version into others' hands
Some of us may not be able to afford to purchase extra copies of the Recovery Version, but all of us can distribute the rainbow booklets
Also, by His mercy and through His grace we must do the best not to beat the fellow slaves, the fellow believers
