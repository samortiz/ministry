<p>If there is some time left, you could go back to pray-read the main verses quoted in the lesson in order to impress them with such verses. In Lesson One, John 6:47 is quoted which says, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me has eternal life.&rdquo; You have to lead the new contact to pray-read this verse. You may say, &ldquo;Thank You, Lord, I believe in You.&rdquo; Ask him to repeat this. This is a kind of leading pray-reading. You may continue by saying, &ldquo;Has eternal life...has eternal life. Lord, this is Your word. Now, I believe in You, so I have eternal life.&rdquo; To impress them, ask them to pray this word. Then this word will get into them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE NEW CONTACTS<br />
TO SING THE PROPER SONGS AND HYMNS</h2>
<p>To lead people to sing the proper songs or hymns is a little harder. This is because you have to learn the hymns and songs and also learn to choose the proper ones. The full-timers as well as all of the saints have to learn the songs, the hymns, the gospel songs, and the gospel hymns. In our hymnal there are a lot of good songs.</p>
<p>The message and the song do not have to match exactly in wording. In wording the song might not be the same as the message, but in actuality it is the same. For instance, there is a song whose first line of the chorus is: &ldquo;Since Jesus came into my heart&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> 309) and the phrase from John 6:47 says, &ldquo;He who believes in Me has eternal life.&rdquo; You can sing this hymn because it could be considered as a proper song on the assurance and joy of salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE NEW ONES TO CONFESS THEIR SINS<br />
THAT THEY MAY BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>While you are helping the new ones to pray along with the lesson, you must take the lead to train them in their prayer to confess their sins. You have to take the lead to confess your sins. You may say, &ldquo;Lord, I was born a sinner. Lord, even this day I have been mistaken, having done some things wrong.&rdquo; Do not make your prayer wordy or too long. Lead them into an atmosphere where they may spontaneously say, &ldquo;Lord, I am also sinful. Lord, even today I made a mistake with my wife.&rdquo; You could not do this by one visit but after many visits. If you go four times in a month to visit this family, surely you could train them. You will bring them into the Spirit, leading them to confess their sins. If they would confess their sins with a long prayer, do not stop them. That is a good sign. Let them pray, confessing their sins. They may say, &ldquo;O Lord, I offended my father. That was wrong. And I did something wrong with my mother.&rdquo; If they confess many things, let them say it. The more they would confess, the better. The ultimate consummation of a &ldquo;sin-confessing prayer&rdquo; is the filling of the Spirit. You do not need to teach them to seek after the filling of the Holy Spirit; they will have it.</p>
<p>I hope that every time you go to a home, after a meeting has been set up, that your visit will end with the filling of the Holy Spirit. Every time bring the new contacts into the experience of the filling of the Holy Spirit. However, you do not need to point out to them so quickly that this is the experience of the filling of the Holy Spirit. Let them experience it a few times. There will be a time to let them know that what they have experienced is the filling of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HANDLING THE WORD, TOUCHING THE SPIRIT,<br />
SINGING, AND PRAYING<br />
ACCORDING TO THE LEADING OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>When you go to nourish them, you must use these few steps which we have shared. It is hard to say which step should be first. It may be that the Holy Spirit will lead you at the opening of the meeting to nourish them or you may take the lead to confess your sins. You have to get yourself acquainted with all the <em>New Life Lessons,</em> and get yourself ready, going to the home meetings as a prepared and trained person. As a trained person, you can use all the &ldquo;weapons and bullets&rdquo; in any way. This does not mean that you use this gun first, and that gun second, and this bullet last. It all depends upon the atmosphere and the leading of the Holy Spirit within.</p>
<p>In the past, our reading of the word was not so living. We might have said, &ldquo;Let us read John 6:47.&rdquo; Then you might say, &ldquo;Let me read the first verse, and then you read the second.&rdquo; This is to read in a somewhat dead way. You must learn how to read a verse in a living way. It is not just that you read and someone else listens. It is better for you and him to work together. Make the reading living and coordinated. This requires much practice.</p>
<p>To set up a meeting you must use the word, the Spirit, singing, and praying. It is hard to say which point should be first. But you must use these four things. The <em>New Life Lessons</em> are the word. Leading them to sing the proper songs and hymns involves singing. Leading them to pray-read the Bible verses involves praying. Leading them to pray along with the lesson by confessing their sins that they may be filled with the Spirit involves the Spirit. The word, the Spirit, singing, and praying are the basic things involved in the meeting. You must be able to practice these four things. If you can handle the word, touch the Spirit, know how to sing, and know how to pray, then you will have a good meeting. Every point in this chapter needs our practice.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GAINING PEOPLE BY NOURISHING THEM</h2>
<p>All of the nourished children love their mother. Spiritually speaking, others will love you because you nourish them. Because the mothers nourish the children, they spontaneously respond with love for her. Do you want your new contacts to love you? You have to render them the best nourishment. If you continue to visit one home and establish a meeting full of nourishment, after five times that home will love you. This means that you have gained them. If you would gain homes in this way the Lord will gain something and His recovery will be increasing and spreading.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
