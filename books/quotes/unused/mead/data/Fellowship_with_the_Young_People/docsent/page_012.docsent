   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRACTICAL WAY TO CARRY OUT THE LORD'S RECOVERY IN AND BY THE MINGLED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous chapter, we saw that the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we consider that this is the work of one man, we do not know what the recovery is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The young people must be the ones to carry out the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, we need to know the practical way for the young people to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we do not take the practical way, we will repeat the history of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We will merely be a congregation coming together to listen to a good speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The practical way to carry out the Lord's recovery is in and by the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We began by the Spirit Gal 3:3 , and we should continue by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the New Testament the spirit is of two aspects, the Holy Spirit and our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These two spirits are mingled as one Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God is Spirit John 4:24 , Christ our Redeemer has become a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b , and the third of the Godhead for God to reach us is the Holy Spirit Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God does not reach us as the Father or as the Son but as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moreover, there is no other way for us to contact God, to contact Christ, to contact the Spirit, but by our human spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the young people must concentrate their whole being on the divine Spirit and our human spirit mingled together as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the last chapter, we saw that the church must have the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The real ground of oneness is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the Old Testament, Jerusalem was the unique place where all the people of God had to come to worship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There was only one temple, and that temple was in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All God's people had to go there because that was where God's habitation was.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In typology the place of oneness was Jerusalem, but today in actuality it is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The unique place in which we meet is our human spirit because God's habitation today is in our spirit Eph 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not merely meet at a certain address; we meet in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If I were not in my spirit, I would be separated from all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christianity is divided because many Christians have been scattered away from their human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many do not meet in the real Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The way to carry out the Lord's recovery is by the divine Spirit and the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The young people should come together in their groups to research the matter of the two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They should know 1 Corinthians 15:45 and be able to explain how Christ became a life-giving Spirit and why Christ needed to become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our understanding concerning the divine Spirit and the human spirit is too general.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We lack the basic building of a proper foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The reason that many young people do not function in the meetings is that they have not been in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The way to get into the spirit is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At First it may be difficult to pray by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why the groups of five are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The five need to pray together.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A group may even make the decision to fast and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They may meet for a long time to pray themselves into the spirit and to stir up their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our spirit is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must get into the spirit and learn to exercise and touch our spirit in every situation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we have prayed ourselves into the spirit, it will be easy to function in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do not need to seek a special experience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We just need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we pray to stir up our spirit and pray ourselves into our spirit, we will experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To pray in this way is the best way to experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Life is the Spirit, and life is in our spirit Rom 8:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Holiness is the Spirit, victory is the Spirit, power is the Spirit, and the anointing is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even the church life and our function are a matter of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Everything spiritual, divine, and heavenly is a matter of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God, life, and light are the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Without the Spirit we have no reality; we have only terminology.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The reality is the Spirit, so the Spirit is called the Spirit of reality John 16:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This Spirit can only be realized in our spirit, by our spirit, and with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This Spirit is even one with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We may know some of the verses on the spirit, but we may have never thoroughly researched this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The young people must lay a good and basic foundation in the life experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I am burdened that you would have a proper realization of the way to carry on the church life.</S>
