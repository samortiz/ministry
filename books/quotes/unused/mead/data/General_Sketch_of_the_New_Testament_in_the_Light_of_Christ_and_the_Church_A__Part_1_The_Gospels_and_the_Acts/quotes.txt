[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE SEVEN MAIN ITEMS IN THE GOSPELS 1 Scripture Reading: Matt 1:23; 3:2; 15:30-31; John 6:57; 19:34; 20:22; Acts 2:1-4
[3]  If we look carefully into the New Testament with much spiritual insight, we will realize that the twenty-seven books it contains are divided into three groups.
[4]  The first four books reveal the Head of this universal man Christ, while the last book in this group shows us His Body.
[5]  THE KINGDOM FOR THE EXPRESSION AND AUTHORITY OF GOD The Kingdom of the Heavens Drawing Near
[6]  The first matter in the New Testament is the incarnation, including the birth and growth of Christ.
[7]  While the Lord Jesus was on this earth, the kingdom was here already.
[8]  In Matthew 12:28 the Lord also said, "But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you."
[9]  Because we must be born again in order to enter the kingdom, the gospel is called the gospel of the kingdom.
[10]  The gospel of the kingdom requires human beings to receive God as life to fulfill His kingdom requirements with authority to subdue all God's enemies and with glory to express Him.
[11]  If, on the negative side, we are to subdue all God's enemies and, on the positive side, glorify God in a full way, we must have God Himself in us as our life.
[12]  If we consider the four Gospels and the Acts, we will realize that the gospel preached by John the Baptist, by Christ Himself, by the disciples sent by Christ, and by the apostles after the day of Pentecost was the gospel of the kingdom, which brings people into God's kingdom with His authority to overcome all His enemies and express Him in His full glory Matt 3:2; 4:17, 23; 9:35; 10:7; Acts 8:12; 19:8 .
[13]  The fifth thing that the New Testament shows us is the living of Jesus.
[14]  On the one hand, such a living conquers all the enemies of God, and on the other hand, it expresses God, manifesting Him in a full way.
[15]  These are incarnation, the kingdom with its requirements, the miserable condition of fallen man, the all-sufficiency of Christ to meet man's need, the living of the divine life through and in the human life, Christ's imparting of Himself into man, and man being brought into God through Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension.
[16]  The books which comprise the first part of the New Testament first reveal that God has mingled Himself with man and has become a man, putting man on Himself to live with man and as man.
[17]  There had been the living of the vegetable life, the animal life, and the human life, but there had never been the living out of the divine life in the human life, a living which is a combination of the divine life with the human life as God Himself living in man and through man.
[18]  The principle of the New Testament is that man would not live by the human life but by the divine life.
[19]  The living that the Lord Jesus had while He was on earth was the living of the divine life mingled with the human life.
[20]  Although this wonderful Jesus had His human life, He did not live by that human life; rather, He lived by God as His life.
[21]  When this man worked, He did not work by His own life but by God as His life 5:17, 19; 10:25; 14:10b .
[22]  The first few books of the New Testament reveal a wonderful, real man living on this earth not by His own life but by God as His life.
[23]  The Lord's death and resurrection are a matter not only of Christ imparting Himself to us but also of His redemption.
[24]  By His death Christ redeemed and recovered us, bringing us back to God.
[25]  CHAPTER THREE THE SIGNIFICANT ITEMS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT AND THE PROPHECIES OF THE OLD TESTAMENT Scripture Reading: John 1:14; 6:57a; Eph 1:22-23; John 3:29; Rev 21:9-10; Gen 3:15; 22:18; Isa 11:1, 10; 7:14; 9:6; 53:2; Micah 5:2; Gen 2:21-24; Psa 22:22; Isa 8:18
[26]  The focus of these messages is a general sketch of the New Testament in the light of Christ and the church.
[27]  The third great matter that the New Testament reveals is a universal man, a man so great as to fill the entire universe Eph 1:23 .
[28]  The Head of this universal man is Christ, and the Body is the church composed of millions of believers as His members v. 22 . The entire New Testament record is a portrait of such a universal man.
[29]  Old Testament Prophecies concerning Christ The Seed of Woman
[30]  They said to Him, David's. He said to them, How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies underneath Your feet'? If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son? And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone from that day dare to question Him anymore." On the one hand, Christ is the Son of David who came out of David, while on the other hand, He is the Lord of David, the Root of David out of whom David came.
[31]  The fourth great prophecy concerns Christ as Immanuel Isa 7:14 .
[32]  The central thought of all the prophecies is realized first in Christ and then in the church.
[33]  In Christ we see God mingled with man, and in the church we also see God mingled with man.
[34]  The above prophecies emphasize that Christ is the mingling of God with man, and the church is the counterpart of Christ, the many brothers with Christ the Firstborn, and the children given to Christ.
[35]  As we saw in the previous chapters, we may express this subject in four terms: a universal man with Christ as the Head and the church as His Body, the history of this universal man, the definition and explanation of the universal man, and the consummation of the universal man.
[36]  In summary, the church as the bride of Christ is a part of Christ, the church as the many brothers of Christ is Christ's multiplication and duplication, and the church as the children given to Christ has the same life and nature as Christ.
[37]  THE SEVEN MAJOR POINTS IN THE FOUR GOSPELS Incarnation
[38]  When we come to the first four books of the New Testament, we can see seven major points.
[39]  The Impartation of the Divine Life through the Redemption of Christ
[40]  Sixth, the four Gospels tell us that this wonderful life was imparted into man based upon the redemptive work of Christ.
[41]  Man's being brought into God is the last major item unveiled in the four Gospels.
[42]  CHAPTER FIVE THE BASIC THOUGHT OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN Scripture Reading: John 14:1-20, 23; 15:4a; 16:19-23; 20:19-22
[43]  In this chapter we will continue our general sketch of the New Testament by looking into the Gospel of John, especially chapters fourteen through sixteen.
[44]  As we have seen, by His coming He brought God into man to live as a man on this earth, and by His going He brought man into God, causing man to be one with God and enabling man to live in God.
[45]  The Lord Coming on "That Day," the Day of Resurrection
[46]  In verses 19 to 20 the Lord goes on to say, "Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live.
[47]  John 16:16-17 says, "A little while and you no longer behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me. Some of His disciples then said to one another, What is this that He says to us, A little while and you do not behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me; and, Because I am going to the Father?" In verses 20-23 Jesus replied, "Truly, truly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.
[48]  In John 14:16 the Lord said that the Father would give the disciples another Comforter.
[49]  On the contrary, the Gospel of John is a complete book showing us that the Triune God was incarnated to be a man, bringing Himself into man, mingling Himself with man, and living on this earth as a man.
[50]  Christ's Coming and Going to Produce the Mutual Dwelling of God and Man
[51]  The Gospel of John reveals that the Father is in the Son, coming to be among humanity, and the Son became the Spirit to enter into humanity.
[52]  His entering into man was accomplished by means of His going in death and His coming in resurrection.
[53]  CHAPTER SIX CHRIST, THE SPIRIT, AND THE BODY IN THE BOOK OF ACTS Scripture Reading: Acts 9:1-17; 22:6-16; 1 Cor 12:13; Luke 24:49; John 7:37-39
[54]  These are incarnation, the kingdom, the condition of man, Christ meeting every man's needs, the divine living in humanity, the imparting of Christ as life, and man being brought into God.
[55]  To persecute the disciples of Christ is to persecute Christ Himself, because all the disciples of Christ are the members of the Body of Christ, and the Body of Christ is Christ Himself.
[56]  BEING FILLED INWARDLY AND CLOTHED OUTWARDLY WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT
[57]  Many Christians today have a wrong understanding concerning the baptism in the Holy Spirit Acts 1:5 .
[58]  The real meaning of the baptism in the Holy Spirit is that we as human beings are immersed in God.
[59]  In the same way, to be baptized in the Holy Spirit is to be immersed in the Spirit, so that whatever we are, whatever we do, and the way we live and work are not out of ourselves but by the Lord Christ as the Spirit.
[60]  LIVING AND MOVING BY THE PRESENT GUIDANCE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
[61]  The book of Acts shows us that none of the disciples did anything according to rules, regulations, or orders.
[62]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE CRUCIAL TRANSITION FROM THE GOSPELS TO THE ACTS Scripture Reading: John 20:22; 1 Pet 1:3; Acts 1:5; 2:1-4; 11:15-16; 2:36; Psa 2:6; 1 Cor 12:13
[63]  Moreover, 1 Peter 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."
[64]  THE INAUGURATION WITH AUTHORITY BY THE ASCENSION OF CHRIST The Need for Authority, Equipping, and Qualification
[65]  The resurrection life imparted into us is the inward aspect of life.
[66]  Two Procedures for Our Mingling with the Triune God
[67]  Second, this very Triune God who accomplished everything and put everything into Christ's hand, giving Him all authority, came down upon His Body, including all the believers, as their authority and equipping.
[68]  Being Experienced in the Principle of Laying on of Hands
[69]  In Acts 8, Peter and John laid hands on the Samaritan believers v. 17 . In the following chapter even Saul of Tarsus did not receive the baptism directly from the Head; he received the experience of the baptism through the laying on of hands by a small disciple, Ananias 9:17 . Later, Paul laid hands on the Ephesian believers 19:6 .
[70]  Romans 6:3 and Galatians 3:27 speak of being baptized into Christ.
[71]  We must learn always not to live by ourselves, to reject ourselves, to deny ourselves, because within us is the living One, the Triune God.
[72]  We may consider the Acts to be an easy book, relating the story of how the disciples of Christ after His ascension into heaven exercised extraordinary power to do things in a miraculous way, convincing people, bringing people to Christ, and setting up churches.
[73]  How can the wonderful, objective facts accomplished by the resurrection and ascension of Christ be our experience?
[74]  LIVING IN THE ACTS BY DENYING OURSELVES AND LIVING BY THE TRIUNE GOD
[75]  The book of Acts is a record of a group of people who are resurrected and ascended with Christ, having Christ within them as their life and Christ upon them as their power and authority.
[76]  The entire record of the book of Acts also shows us a group of people who always acted as the Body.
