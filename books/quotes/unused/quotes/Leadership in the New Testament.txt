We have the leadership of one controlling revelation in the one ministry through those who bring in the revelation of the ministry
The controlling and restricting revelation in the Lord's recovery is the revelation of God's New Testament economy
What the Lord said about leadership in Matthew 20:20-28 and 23:8, 10, and 11 shatters the human thought of leadership
Prior to that time, he practiced the truth concerning eating with Gentile believers according to the vision he received in Acts 10
When Paul saw that Peter and the others did not walk uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, he rebuked Peter before all
Through his weakness, Peter was damaging the truth of the gospel, the truth that both Gentile believers and Jewish believers are the same
We are told that Paul and his co-workers went not to Peter but to James, for all the elders, including Peter, were in James's home
In God's New Testament economy the leadership among His children is not official, permanent, or organizational
At one time that capacity may be with a certain brother, but at another time it may be with a different brother
When they were on their mission, Paul spontaneously took the lead because he had the greater spiritual capacity
Because Barnabas realized that Paul's capacity was greater than his, he did not argue with him over taking the lead
All these cases prove that the leadership among God's children today should not be official, permanent, or organizational
If the saints had been clear about the truth concerning leadership and had practiced the truth, no one would have accepted such a claim
If we are clear about the truth and practice the truth, from now on no one will dare say that he is the leader
If you take the janitor's word blindly, you cannot help but be deceived, for you are in darkness and are short of the truth
Whenever someone thought of Brother Nee as the leader and came to him for instructions, Brother Nee would never say a word
If the elders see that the floor has not been vacuumed, they should not sit on the throne and summon the servants to vacuum it for them
Not only the young ones submit to the older ones, but all, including the older ones, submit to one another in humility
According to my knowledge of the New Testament, the apostles have no authority in themselves to control the churches
If the churches and the saints go on according to the word, according to God's oracle, the apostles have no authority to touch the churches
Among the children of God in today's New Testament economy, there is actually no leadership in the natural sense
All the apostles, all the local churches, all the elders, and all the regions of the work are on the same level
If we see this, we shall be cutting straight the word of the truth concerning leadership among God's people today
Although there is the truth of the leadership in the New Testament ministry, the Lord did not officially appoint someone to be the leader
The leadership was something spontaneous according to life, according to the real need, and according to the situation
John 1011 says If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching do not receive him into your house and do not say to him Rejoice!
In the New Testament we cannot see an organization with board members, a chairman, a secretary, or other officers
Sometimes in the New Testament Paul told some of his co-workers to go to certain places or to remain in other places
The leadership which is shown in the New Testament is mainly in the teachings of the ministers, not in the acts of co-workers
As the Lord's recovery is spreading throughout the entire world, who can direct the acts of so many co-workers and serving ones?
They must pray and seek the Lord's leading and fellowship with the dear saints who are so concerned for the Lord's move on this earth today
Through prayer and fellowship with the saints, they will be clear whether they should stay where they are or go to another place
In the recovery in God's ministry, there is no freedom to preach whatever we like to preach or to teach whatever we like to teach
Our preaching and our teaching have to be restricted under the leadership by the revelation of God's New Testament economy
There would never be confusion in the Lord's recovery if all of us had a clear revelation of the ministry in God's New Testament economy
In the early years of the Lord's recovery in mainland China, we suffered a great loss when we tried to practice speaking in tongues
Eventually the co-workers there spontaneously concluded that tongue-speaking was not a profit to the Lord's move on this earth
The writer encouraged them all to go on speaking in tongues regardless of their doubts about the genuineness of what they were uttering
The greatest damage of Pentecostalism is that it makes it difficult for believers to appreciate the inward organic union with the Triune God
The saints who have a vision of God's New Testament economy would not care for teachings that stress and emphasize other things
We have the leadership of one controlling revelation in the one ministry through those who bring in the revelation of the ministry
The Lord's move on this earth is through His unique ministry, and we are all participating in this unique ministry
We must cooperate with the Lord to pick up the new way, the God-ordained way, to practice the New Testament economy
Through His move in the book of Genesis, God gained some important persons and eventually He gained the house of Israel
In Exodus 19 at Mount Sinai the Lord told the children of Israel that He wanted them to be a 'kingdom of priests' and a 'holy nation'
They did not come out of Egypt one by one as individuals, but they came out as a corporate people, even as a nation and a kingdom
Among the children of Israel, these agents were the priests and the elders working together for God's theocracy
The law, like the United States Constitution, may be considered the first written constitution of God's people written by God Himself
The very crucial part in God's government was God's instant speaking through the Urim and the Thummim on the breastplate of the high priest
Although the Scripture does not clearly indicate how the elders were produced, it does tell us how the priests were produced
On the breastplate, with the additional piece called the Thummim, all twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet could be found
According to this article, the Urim, which means light, was an illuminator inserted into the breastplate underneath the twelve stones
When the priest went into God's presence with the breastplate, suddenly a stone inscribed with a certain name became dark
The writer of this article said that it was through the Urim and the Thummim that the sin of Achan was discovered in Joshua 7
The breastplate of the high priest is called the breastplate of judgment in Exodus 28:30 because it speaks for God instantly
After the high priest received the instant speaking from God, he did not directly execute or carry out what God spoke
He passed on the word he had received to the elders, and the elders became the direct administrators among God's people
When the priests became weak, such as at the time of Eli , the prophets were raised up to strengthen God's speaking
There is also not a direct word in the New Testament to tell us how the first group of elders in the New Testament church was produced
Either through seeing the Lord's death or through the appearing of the Lord to him in His resurrection , James believed in the Lord
When the apostle Paul was raised up by the Lord and sent out by the Holy Spirit, the Lord used him to establish new churches
Acts 14:23 tells us that Paul returned to appoint elders in each of these new local churches probably within the same year
The elders were established among the saints by the apostles who had preached the gospel to them and had formed them into a local church
Titus 15 tells us that the apostles who established the churches had the position and the right to send a representative to establish elders
These apostles should be the ones who appoint the elders to carry out God's administration in each local church
At the very beginning of the Lord's recovery in mainland China, we adopted at least eighty percent of the Brethren's practice
By 1935 we realized that we could not fully follow them, because we realized their serious mistake in the matter of the church practice
When Brother Nee began to see the light concerning the scriptural practice of the church life, he was still somewhat held by our humility
He said Today we are the unofficial apostles yet the unofficial apostles still have the unofficial right to appoint the unofficial elders
After a short time, another book was published in Chinese by Brother Nee entitled The Normal Christian Church Life
He said that if those of us who preach the gospel, teach the truth, and establish and form churches are not the apostles, then who are?
We know that Christ replaced the law, but we are referring to the aspect and sense of replacing the law in God's administration
The first group of apostles were charged by the Lord Jesus to teach the new believers what the Lord had taught them
At the conclusion of the book of Revelation, John tells us that no one should add anything or take away anything from the divine revelation
If you add something, you will suffer the plagues; and if you deduct something, you will suffer the loss of the divine blessing
The entire New Testament, which is the complete teaching of the apostles, must be considered the constitution of God's New Testament kingdom
Paul, in his first Epistle to the Corinthians, made this matter of God's administration in the New Testament very clear
By the New Testament teaching and example, we can realize that some elders had been established in the church in Corinth
If there is a problem in the church, we have to come to the New Testament to see what it says about this particular problem
We should not say we are for or against something until we go to the New Testament constitution to see what it has to say
When any problem arises, we must learn to be silent and go to the written Word of God, the New Testament constitution, without any opinion
We have to get into the presence of the Lord, stay in His presence, and wait on Him, asking Him to show us what to do
As an elder, you have the High Priest within you, and you can share in His loving capacity as symbolized by His breast
Besides the elders as the priests and as the administrators, there are the prophets and teachers as illustrated in Acts 13:1-4
After the apostles appoint the elders and commit the church into the hands of the elders, what shall the apostles do in the future?
We saw that Paul wrote a letter to the church in Corinth charging them to remove a certain sinful man from the fellowship of the church
In this sense Paul as an apostle kept his hands off of the church administration but not from teaching instructing and charging the church
There is another aspect to the apostles' relationship with a local church, which Brother Nee talked to us about, in 1 Timothy 5
Timothy 5:19-20 says, 'Against an elder do not receive an accusation, except based upon the mouth of two or three witnesses
Corinthians 11:34 says, 'If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, that you may not come together for judgment
Even after charging the church to take care of so many things, Paul says that he will set in order the remaining matters when he comes
All the states of the United States have their own administrations and governments, but they are not strictly independent
When the apostles kept their hands off of the affairs of the churches this did not mean that each local church became one independent entity
It also did not mean that since the churches were under the teaching of the apostles, they became a federation
Concerning this matter, we need to look at the seven epistles to the seven local churches in Revelation 2 and 3
Every epistle was a particular word to a certain church, yet this particular word was to be heard and taken by all the churches
On the other hand, all the local churches are still the one Body of Christ which is an organism, not a federation which is an organization
We have the leadership of one controlling revelation in the one ministry through those who bring in the revelation of the ministry
Paul was very burdened to help the Corinthians solve their problems, and their problems involved him and Apollos
Paul was not the leader in the New Testament move of God in the sense of commanding the co-workers to do things
In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach differently from God's New Testament economy
The aged apostle John, in his second Epistle, told the saints not to receive anyone who brings a teaching other than the teaching of Christ
They go beyond the teaching concerning Christ, which is the basic teaching of the New Testament, the teaching of the apostles
In the same way that our physical body is in such a proper order, there is also an order in the church, which is the Body of Christ
When God's people in the Old Testament became a collective entity, there was a proper situation of order among them
Especially during times of trouble or even at times when something good happens to us, the first thing we often say is, 'O Lord'!
Jesus was also made the Christ in His resurrection and ascension to carry out God's commission, His plan and eternal economy
Acts 5:31 says, 'This One God has exalted to His right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins'
He has the authority and power, if He should so desire, to remove a king in order to save even one of His people
The account of Pharaoh and the people of Israel in Exodus is a demonstration of the Lord's authority and power to save
In Egypt Pharaoh kept all the children of Israel in slavery, and God sent Moses to tell Pharaoh to let His people go
The Lord's authority and power as the Leader over all the rulers can be seen in His control over the world situation
If both the parents and the older children are away, a baby-sitter is left with the remaining children to be a leader for them
If on the other hand the elders do not take the lead to go out but simply exhort the other saints to do it not many of the saints will go
The leadership in the New Testament ministry is in the New Testament teaching more than in the leading ones of the New Testament ministry
The churches followed the apostles' teaching, and they followed the apostles because the apostles had the New Testament teaching
What the ministry in the Lord's recovery has brought to the churches is according to the New Testament teaching of the apostles
He told the elders in verses 29 and 30, 'I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice'!
Without delegated authorities, the whole earth would be in anarchy and disorder and would be unsuitable to live in
Today a wind of teaching is blowing in the Lord's recovery saying that there is no delegated authority in the church
Even among the children of Israel in the Old Testament, God had a government for His administration to fulfill His purpose
Humanly speaking, democracy is wonderful, but to bring democracy into the church brings in the opinions of the people
In the United States government, congressmen and senators represent the states to express the people's opinion
The theocratic government among the people of Israel in the Old Testament was through the priesthood with the Urim and the Thummim
God could open Himself to them, and they could open themselves to God so that there could be a mutual understanding between them and God
The high priest wore a breastplate with twelve precious stones bearing the names of the twelve tribes of Israel
The names of the twelve tribes of Israel on the twelve stones contained only eighteen of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet
The theocratic government among the people of Israel in the Old Testament was also through the coordination of the prophets
The result of this divine coordination of the New Testament priests and prophets in the Body of Christ is the God-commanded blessing
