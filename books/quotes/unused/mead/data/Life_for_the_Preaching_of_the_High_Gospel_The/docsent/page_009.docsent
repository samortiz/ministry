   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Now when the young people ask me about whom they should marry, I answer, "I don't know.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Only the Lord knows."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I can only tell them that if they feel led of the Lord to marry that sister or that brother, then they should just go ahead and do it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I cannot say whether that brother or sister is good or not.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only the Lord knows.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Young brothers and sisters, you have to trust in the heavenly Father for your future, including your marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only He knows.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Your destiny is not in your hand; it is in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Leave all things to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Just learn to say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have a heavenly Father taking care of me in all ways."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, do not be deceived any longer by material things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Surely you need to study to get an education or learn a trade.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But you should not be deceived by these things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not be preoccupied by these things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not seek these things first.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We first seek the kingdom, the dominion, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We also seek to have His righteousness, to be right with Him, to be agreeable with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We desire to be perfect as He is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We desire to bear His image and be under His authority all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are not here to be moral, religious, or spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We care only for one thing, that is, to be under His authority and to be agreeable with Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We care only to be under God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If God gives you the command to shout in the meeting, you should shout.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you say, "Oh, maybe it's not good to shout so loudly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I should take care of others," this is to be religious.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I care only to be under the Lord's dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I care only to be right and agreeable with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not be deceived by religious things, which are even more deceiving than material and moral things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even the desire to be spiritual can be a kind of deceiving.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why I feel compelled by the Lord to tell you these things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord has no intention to gain a group of people who are "spiritual."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, His intention is to have a group of people who are under His authority, who are always right according to the Lord and agreeable with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You can be like this only by taking Him as your person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Take Him not only as your life but also as your person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then day by day you can declare to the whole universe, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" Gal 2:20a .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then you have the real righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You are right and agreeable with the Lord, because you are Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is no more you, but it is Christ, so you have the righteousness under God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I have no intention to advise you to do this or not to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>My burden is to help you realize that today the Lord is going to get a people, mainly of the young generation, who do not care for anything material, anything moral, anything religious, or anything spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Of course, they also do not care for anything immoral, unreligious, or unspiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They care only for God's dominion and God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brothers and sisters, the Lord is going to gain a people of the young generation who truly seek first God's kingdom and God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, God will give them the material things, and they will be the most moral and spiritual people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if you are just seeking after spirituality, you might be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today what you should seek after is not religion or spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You need to seek the kingdom of God as well as His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all need to be under His dominion and bear His image continually.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Matthew 5:3 says, "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then Matthew 5:10 says, "Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>First, you need to be poor in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not consider that you know something or have something.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You have to prostrate yourself, bow down, before the Lord, saying, "Lord, I have nothing and I know nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I don't like to retain or hold on to anything old in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I like to be poor in my spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If so, yours is the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You also have to be ready to suffer, to be persecuted, for the sake of righteousness, that is, for the sake of being right according to God, agreeable with God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you want to be right according to God, you will be persecuted, because the whole world, which lies in the evil one 1 John 5:19 and is filled with unrighteousness, will rise up against you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In a sense, if you are seeking to be religious, many people will admire and welcome you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Also, in a sense, if you are seeking to be spiritual, many people will appreciate and speak well of you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But if you are seeking to be right with the Lord, to be right according to God, be prepared to be opposed and persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But praise the Lord, the kingdom of the heavens is yours.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You are in the kingdom of the heavens and are under God's dominion where you have the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today what the Lord is doing is to gain such a people as a preparation for His coming back to take over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then Revelation 11:15 will be fully fulfilled: "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We will also reign with Him 2 Tim 2:12 .</S>
