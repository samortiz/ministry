<p>Concerning the teaching of <em>Truth Lessons,</em> the first thing we must remember is that we are not teaching a class in the public schools, we are teaching <em>Truth Lessons</em> in the church. This is altogether a matter of life and spirit. With a secular class, it is sufficient for the teacher to make the points clear. But with regard to teaching <em>Truth Lessons,</em> the focus is on the transmission of the Spirit and the dispensing of life. The Spirit is mysterious and intangible. How can we transmit the Spirit? Life is abstract and incomprehensible. How can we dispense life? Both the Spirit and life are in the truth. The reality of the truth is spirit and life (John 6:63). The real teaching of the truth is the transmitting and dispensing of the Spirit and life that is in the truth into people. For this reason, we must be those who live in the Spirit and in life.</p>
<p>Second, I have pointed out again and again that each lesson of <em>Truth Lessons</em> is a message in itself that does not need expounding or additional comments by the teachers. The materials in <em>Truth Lessons</em> are rich and clear. The teachers should take the lead to learn. The teachers should have this attitude: &ldquo;I am not a teacher. I am a student who is learning with everyone else.&rdquo; If the teachers take the lead to learn and to lead the saints to read and absorb the lines, main points, outlines, big headings, and small items in <em>Truth Lessons</em>, what is read will become a supply to the saints. This is the reason I say, &ldquo;Do not expound; simply read.&rdquo; However, the reading should not be done in a dead way but in spirit. Moreover, we should not ask only one person or even several persons to read the whole lesson. Rather, all the saints should read as one person with one voice. This will provide all the saints the opportunity to open their mouths to read, and this will also help them to practice speaking in the meetings. The reading must be done livingly. The saints can ask questions and answer them in a mutual way. This can be compared to playing basketball; when the players pass the ball smoothly to one another, they play a beautiful game.</p>
<p>Third, the teachers must release their spirit. They should not be shy or cowardly. Their spirit must come out to stir up the spirit of the saints so that everyone will not be loose but will enter into the lesson seriously and receive a transfusion.</p>
<p>Fourth, the teachers must be prepared before coming to the class. Their preparation is mainly in studying the outline, not in searching for material. They must learn how to work the outline into the saints so that the saints may be deeply impressed.</p>
<p>Fifth, the teachers need to look for the important words in each paragraph and point them out to the saints.</p>
<p>Sixth, the summary at the end of each lesson is the key to entering into the lesson. Every point in the summary is the truth, every word is precious, and every sentence is excellent and full of life and light. The teachers should lead the saints to enter into the summary to enjoy it.</p>
<p>The <em>Truth Lessons</em> are rich in content, complete, and concise. Whether we can teach these lessons successfully altogether hinges on how we teach them. If we teach well, many will come to the meeting. There will be an atmosphere of desiring to attend these truth classes among the saints. The content of our ordinary meetings is a kind of communal cooking and is not too specific. The teaching of <em>Truth Lessons</em> is very practical and has a certain progression. This will help the saints to be solidly equipped with the truth and give them a taste of the riches of the Spirit and life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SHARING AT THE END OF THE MEETING</h2>
<p>For many years we have received a burden from the Lord to rid ourselves of the traditional way of meeting and have a proper practice. Therefore, at the end of a meeting, we should have a time for sharing. Without sharing, the meeting will be inadequate. The meeting for teaching <em>Truth Lessons</em> is no exception. There should be a period for sharing at the end of each lesson. Although we should ask one another questions and mutually answer and study in groups, we must still emphasize the sharing at the end. The purpose of learning the truth is to minister life and transmit the Spirit; it is not to find fault or simply study the wording. In particular, the prophecies and types require much time and effort to study; they cannot be thoroughly understood in three to five minutes by the saints in their groups. Consider the prophecy of the seventy weeks for example. The new believers do not need to understand everything about it. All they need to know is that there is the prophecy of seventy weeks in Daniel 9, and they should not try to be concerned with finding out its deep significance in the group study time. We all are &ldquo;high school students.&rdquo; It is sufficient for us to understand the &ldquo;high school curriculum&rdquo;; we do not need to know the things that will be taught in &ldquo;graduate school.&rdquo; The most crucial thing is not to give knowledge but to minister life and transmit the Spirit. Therefore, the saints must have a time for sharing at the end of the meeting.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_078.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_080.html">Next</a> </body></html>
