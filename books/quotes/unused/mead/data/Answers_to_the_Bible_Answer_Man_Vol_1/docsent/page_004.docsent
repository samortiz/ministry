   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A PROTEST CONCERNING HISTORICAL MISREPRESENTATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On behalf of Witness Lee and all the local churches, we go on record before the Christian public to protest against the meeting held at Melodyland on October 2, 1977.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The speaker grossly misrepresented the truths of the gospel that we have experienced and proclaimed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our speaking and writing are our response to these misrepresentations, lest silence be construed as agreement with the Melodyland meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The reason the speaker and his research associates make such false charges and distortions concerning what we believe is obviously ignorance on their part of what we believe and mean.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This ignorance has led them into the error of misrepresentation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The areas of ignorance and misrepresentation are as follows: A. Ignorance concerning Biblical Theology</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The speaker and his associates have read into our quotations of 2 Corinthians 3:17a, "Now the Lord is the Spirit," and 1 Corinthians 15:45b, "The last Adam became a life-giving spirit," and given them a modalistic meaning that we ourselves do not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In March of 1977, we had a personal talk with the speaker's associates in which we related that our use of the above verses did not mean modalism.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They refused to accept our clear testimony on this point.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then we inquired of them if they were aware of the area in biblical theology called "Pneumatic Christology."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The associates of the speaker were totally ignorant that such an area existed in the study of biblical theology.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We challenged them to go outside the local church and study the contemporary theological discussions on this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The emphasis of "Pneumatic Christology" is a fresh attempt to come back to the simple and clear statements of the Bible concerning the action of Christ as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>An example of other biblical theologians speaking to this issue is Dr. Hendrikus Berkhof of the University of Leyden in Holland in his book, The Doctrine of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The following is a sample found on page 21:</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Spirit as the action of the exalted Christ: So far our main interest has been focused on the consequences of Christ's being the bearer of the Spirit, and as such also the sender.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now we have to shift our attention and to lay full emphasis on that second aspect: Christ the sender of the Spirit, the Spirit sent by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How are Christ and the Spirit related here?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This difficult question is of the greatest importance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It has found different answers in the course of church history, and these answers have created different types of Christian life, institutional as well as individual.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then continuing on pages 24 and 25 he says:</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the field of biblical theology, several studies have been published in the last years which throw a new light on the relation between the Spirit and Christ, primarily in the letters of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From these studies and from an open-minded examination of the New Testament, we must draw the conclusion that we have to think of the Spirit in strictly christocentric terms.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that we have to start where the first group starts and to say that the Spirit is always and everywhere the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we go a step beyond the traditional position, it is not to weaken it but to strengthen it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That the Spirit is bound to Christ is far more true than is meant and expressed in classical pneumatology.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In John 14:18, Jesus, aiming at the sending of the Spirit, says: "I will not leave you desolate; I will come to you."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We find a parallel saying in the last words of Matthew: "I am with you always, to the close of the age" 28:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This identification of the Spirit with Christ is found in all the New Testament traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We think of 1 John 3:24 which says that we know Christ abides in us "by the Spirit which he has given us."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the letters to the seven churches, it is the risen Christ who speaks, but who at the same time says: "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches" Rev 2:7, etc. . We think, however, mainly of Paul's words: "Now the Lord is the Spirit" 2 Cor 3:17a . Some think that we have to reverse subject and predicate, and to translate: "Now the Spirit is Lord," the Spirit wields lordship; but the word "Lord" in verses 17 and 18 always means Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He himself is the Spirit; as the close of verse 18 repeats: "this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Other features of this conception in Paul are found in 1 Corinthians 6:17: "he who is united to the Lord becomes one Spirit with him," and in Romans 8:9-11, where the divine principle which dwells in the faithful alternately is called the Spirit, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is also clear that the Pauline expressions en Christoi and en pneumati are synonymous.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Dr. Berkhof s book is sold at Melodyland Bookstore.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In fact, we would encourage the speaker, his associates, the faculty and students of Melodyland School of Theology, and the Christian public to make an objective and honest study of the history of the exegesis of 1 Corinthians 6:17, 1 Corinthians 15:45, 2 Corinthians 3:17, Romans 8:9-11, and Acts 16:6-7 from the great expositors of the Bible in the past centuries to see whether on the level of experience others have not said the very things for which we have been charged as heretical.</S>
