<p>John 8:3-11 speaks of the salvation of a woman spared of her judgment. She was a sinful woman, and there was no question that she should be condemned. Yet the Lord said to those who caught her, "He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her." In this picture we see three parties. There was the sinful woman, fearfully waiting for the pronouncement of her judgment. There were the prosecutors and the crowd. As soon as they were challenged by the Lord, their consciences pricked them. They knew that they were sinful, and they left one by one. Finally, there was the Lord Jesus. Only He was without sin, yet He would not condemn the woman. Instead, He forgave her and granted her salvation. We have to pay attention to this picture. The Lord was sinless, while the woman was sinful and in shame. Both the sinless One and the sinful one were there. When the Lord asked, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?", she immediately replied, "No one, Lord." Here was a tender spirit, a stricken spirit. The woman did not do anything; she only said, "Lord..." The Lord replied, "Neither do I condemn you." She was saved. As long as a person humbles his spirit and acknowledges the Lord as Lord, he will be saved. How wonderful are God's accomplishments and how simple are man's requirements!</p><p>Acts 2:14-36 tells us how the apostles preached and how men were saved through the gospel at the time of Pentecost. In his preaching, Peter did not give lucid orations. The words he spoke were words taught by the Spirit. He only spoke about the humbling and exaltation of Christ, about Jesus of Nazareth, the despised One, being made Lord and Christ by God. As he spoke, the listening Jews were pricked in their hearts. There is no need to use articulate teachings to bring men to salvation. All that is needed is a little speaking. The first thing one should do is to save men; expounding the truth comes afterwards. We have to save the greatest number of people with the least belaboring of truth. As long as we can turn men's hearts back to God, our job is done. Peter did not give a clear presentation of the gospel truth at Pentecost; he waited until the book of 2 Peter to do this.</p><p>Acts 10:34-43 gives us an account of Peter's preaching in the house of Cornelius. All he did was to recount the Lord's acts on earth. When he said at the end, "Through His name everyone who believes into Him will receive forgiveness of sins," the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard the gospel (v. 44). In preaching the gospel, all that one has to do is to bring the sinner to God; there is no need to insist that they understand too much of the teaching concerning salvation. The same can be said of our own understanding of the truths of salvation; we only understood them gradually after we were saved. All that a sinner needs is a little word concerning salvation. In Cornelius's house, the Spirit was waiting to come down. Today the Lord is waiting for sinners. As soon as their hearts are touched, they will be saved. In the past we have paid much attention to Christ's accomplished redemption for us before God. Today we are studying how the gospel brings about salvation in the heart of sinners. Being saved is not a question of knowledge but of a sinner touching God.</p><p>Romans 10:8-13 shows us that when a man believes unto salvation, he is not believing in the reason, the doctrine, or the history of salvation. In preaching the gospel, the main thing is not to preach a doctrine but to tell men that this salvation is now in our mouth and even in our heart. The gospel is a matter of the mouth and the heart. It is a hard thing for men to be saved by any kind of work. Today the word of the gospel is for all men; everyone can receive it. As long as a man confesses with his mouth and believes in his heart, he will be saved. "For whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." Once a man calls and says, "Lord Jesus," he is saved, and salvation comes into him. All it takes is for a man to believe in his heart and confess with his mouth. How perfect is the work of salvation before God, and how simple it is for man to receive it.</p><h2 class="head1">STUDYING THE WAYS PEOPLE ARE SAVED</h2><p>In addition to studying the examples in the Bible, we have to study how salvation has come about in the brothers and sisters. If we check with many brothers and sisters, we will realize that they were all saved through coming to God once in a genuine and sincere way. It takes some time to study their history one by one. After we have studied them thoroughly, we will find that some were saved one way and some were saved another way. We will know the kind of things we should do when we meet certain kinds of people. In preaching the gospel, we would rather sacrifice our sermon for the sake of saving more men. Never try to present a clear doctrine at the expense of bringing men to God. We are not here to preach a beautiful message on the gospel; we are here to save men. We have to open their hearts to the Lord, and we have to open their mouths to Him. Once a man opens his heart to the Lord and calls on Him, he is saved.</p>
