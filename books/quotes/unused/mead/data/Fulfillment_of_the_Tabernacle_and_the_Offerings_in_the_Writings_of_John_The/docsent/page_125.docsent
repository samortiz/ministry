   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Although we may experience all the matters revealed in chapters three through twelve of the Gospel of John, we still need the foot-washing in chapter thirteen.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is not sinful for our feet to be unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, it was not sinful for the leading ones to be bothered by the way that sister prayed in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But that feeling was a frustration to our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We all felt that we should write that sister a note in order to wash her feet.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I wish to point out that she was not offended by what we did.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I can testify that afterward this elderly sister and I became quite close.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a proof that she was helped by the note we sent her.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Yes, when she first spoke to us about it, she complained that the "water was too hot."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I also had the feeling that the water was too hot.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I would have preferred to have spoken to her directly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, because Brother Nee was taking the lead and because this situation concerned his own mother, I did not want to express my opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this matter, Brother Nee set an example of the way to deal with relatives, and we all learned much from it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No one was hurt, and the "muddy" situation was cleared up.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This illustrates that in the church life we need foot-washing to clear away everything that hinders our fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the past we have also had some experience of literal foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One day, I believe in 1954, the elders in the church in Taipei were led of the Lord to wash the feet of all the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That literal foot-washing recovered many who were weak.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although we washed the brothers' feet on that occasion, this has never been a regular, ordained practice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But spiritually we need to wash one another's feet all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One way to practice spiritual foot-washing is to be frank with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may say that frankness is equal to foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This does not mean, of course, that we should rebuke others out of anger.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But it does mean that we may wash one another's feet by speaking frankly to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do this, the situation among us will be clear, and we shall have excellent fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, if our fellowship with one another is clear, our fellowship with God will also be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This will strengthen our spirit, cause us to grow in life, and truly build us up together.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the church life we need such a spiritual foot-washing all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead of washing one another's feet, some brothers in the church life are political or practice politeness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, suppose brother A is having fellowship with brothers B and C. Brother A may be very nice to brother B and speak politely to him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nevertheless, the fellowship between them is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After brother B leaves, brother A may turn to brother C and tell him that brother B is hypocritical.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What should brother C do in this situation?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He should look to the Lord for His grace and then, in love, speak a frank word to brother A and say, "Brother, you said that this brother is hypocritical.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But when he was here, you were very nice to him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now you tell me that he is a hypocrite.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brother, you are not being honest.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whether this brother is hypocritical or not, I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, I am certain that your behavior is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If this situation is not cleared up, how could all of us have the peace to attend the Lord's table meeting together?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To speak in such a frank, honest way with a pure spirit is to practice foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have pointed out that in both secular and religious society today, there is no foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose brothers A, B, and C are members of a religious organization.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brother C may hear brother A's criticism of brother B. But instead of saying anything honestly to brother A, he may first keep the matter to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Later, he may go to brother D and tell him about brother A. This kind of behavior is common in human society, including religious society.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the church life our practice must be different.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need continual foot-washing in order to maintain our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not easy to wash someone's feet.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Neither is it easy to have our feet washed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In other words, it is difficult to be either a washing one or a washed one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the reason that many behave in a political way and do not wash the feet of others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sometimes others are offended when we wash their feet.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At least a few times I have offended saints simply because I washed their feet.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because others may be offended by our foot-washing, we should never be in a hurry to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we would wash someone's feet, we need much grace.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We also need to be clean ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is easy for the flesh to come in while we are dealing with someone else's defect.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, we need to be careful to be absolutely in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is just as difficult to receive foot-washing as it is to administer it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we are willing to be washed, we shall be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need mercy and grace both to wash another's feet and also to receive the washing of our own feet.</S>
