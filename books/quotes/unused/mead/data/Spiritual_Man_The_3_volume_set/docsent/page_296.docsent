   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO PASSIVITY AND THE DANGER OF PASSIVITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today Christians lack two kinds of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because of this lack, they fall into endless misery that they cannot recover from.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These two kinds of knowledge are: 1 the condition for evil spirits to work, and 2 the principle of spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because of ignorance, Satan and his evil spirits are given the greatest advantage, and the church of God experiences the greatest suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"My people are destroyed / Because of a lack of that knowledge" Hosea 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is truly a word written for today's believers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Much of what man regards as knowledge is merely his ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, they are of no use.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Apart from this knowledge, godly knowledge is indispensable to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The absence of godly knowledge will result in grave damage.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is sad that in a time of widespread ignorance as today, believers still do not humble themselves before God and seek after the truth that God would reveal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are still proud and boastful of their familiarity with the Scriptures and the abundance of their experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the one hand, they fall into danger and do not know how to turn back; they fall into a hopeless situation and have no idea of the need for deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the other hand, they boast of the richness of their knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How pitiful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>DEMON-POSSESSION</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the four Gospels there are many accounts of demon-possession.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are still many cases of demon-possession among the "heathen" today.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we tell a believer that Christians can be possessed by demons or evil spirits , he will be greatly surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>An ordinary believer in China thinks that only heathens have the possibility of being possessed by demons and that it is not possible for Christians to have the same experience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is also a misunderstanding that once a person is possessed by demons, he is like a lunatic.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the Bible tells us that demons not only caused people to fall suddenly into water and fire Matt 17:15 ; they also caused a woman to be bent double Luke 13:11 while she was still very gentle and quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Believers realize that there is a possibility for them to be seduced, tempted, attacked, or deceived, but they do not realize that there is also a possibility for believers to be attached to to be possessed by demons.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When they first believed, they received many wrong teachings; now they think that as long as a Christian has Christ, he will not be possessed by demons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They say this because they think that a Christian would never lose his mind like some heathen.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, this teaching is not found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Neither is it confirmed by the experience of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God's children are very unclear that evil spirits can change their appearance and attach themselves to the believers' bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today there is an unexpectedly great number of believers who are possessed by demons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The unalterable fact is that many believers are possessed by demons.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What exactly does it mean to be possessed by demons?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After a believer understands the meaning, he will realize that it is possible for Christians to be possessed by demons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Being demon-possessed," or simply "being possessed," means that evil spirits have attached cleaved themselves to the whole or part of man's body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Evil spirits attach themselves to the ground they have gained.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As long as they have a footing, no matter how small it may be, they can keep on working until they gain the entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Common believers think that demon-possession must be as severe as the cases recorded in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They do not know that those were all extreme cases.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, according to the Gospels, the degree of suffering was not the same in those who were possessed by demons; their suffering was quite different from each other.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The two cases we spoke of earlier were entirely different from each other.</S>
