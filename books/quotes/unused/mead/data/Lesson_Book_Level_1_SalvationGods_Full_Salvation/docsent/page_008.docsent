   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Rev 20:15; Eph 2:1-2; 4:17-18a; 2 Tim 3:2-4;</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rom 7:17-18a; 6:6b; 7:24; John 8:44 Outline The objective problem before God Under God s condemnation Under the wrath of God Awaiting God s judgment The subjective problem within himself Deadened in his spirit Ruined in his soul Corrupted in his body Text I. THE OBJECTIVE PROBLEM BEFORE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a result of the fall, man s first problem is before God, and it is objective.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Objective means something having to do with us but outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do you remember the illustration of the child who disobeyed his mother and took in the poison?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His problem of disobedience to his mother was objective, having to do with him but not something inside of him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By disobeying his mother, he was now in trouble with her and would be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because of our fall in Adam, our objective problem before God is very great, and we will soon face God s punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. Under God s Condemnation</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because of Adam s disobedience, or transgression, we have all come under God s condemnation Rom 5:18a .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When God created man, he did not create many men, but only one man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All men were included in this one man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>So in God s eyes, when Adam sinned, we were included in this one sin, even though we ourselves may never have sinned in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because of this, when Adam was judged and came under God s condemnation, we were all judged and came under God s condemnation with him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>B. Under the Wrath of God</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because we were condemned by God in Adam, we are all under the wrath of God John 3:36b .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because of Adam s sin, all men today are under the wrath of God and awaiting His final judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>C. Awaiting God s Judgment</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, because of Adam s sin, man will be judged by God and cast into the lake of fire to suffer God s judgment for eternity Heb 9:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Bible tells us that God prepared the lake of fire not for man but for Satan and his fallen angels who followed him to rebel against God Matt 25:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But, because man was deceived and followed Satan to rebel against God by disobeying Him, man must now also suffer God s judgment in the lake of fire with Satan Rev 20:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Outwardly, and before God, this is the terrible condition into which man fell because of Adam s transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather than enjoying God s life and expressing Him, man has been condemned to die and to suffer Satan s judgment with him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE SUBJECTIVE PROBLEM WITHIN HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man s second problem resulting from the fall is subjective, that is, within himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Using our earlier illustration of the disobedient child, this is the problem of the poison that man took into him, not the problem of his disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By taking in the tree of knowledge, man did not merely do something wrong which could be solved by God s forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He actually took in the very life of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When this satanic life entered into man, his entire being was deadened, ruined and corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A. Deadened in His Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First, when the satanic life entered into man, his spirit was deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He became dead in sins Eph 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because man s spirit was deadened, it lost its function to contact God and to receive Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today, because man s spirit has been deadened, men have lost their ability to contact God, and so many do not believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>B. Ruined in His Soul</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the satanic life entered into man, it ruined man s soul for God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His mind, which God had created to know God, became darkened and blinded, unable to know Him Eph 4:17-18a .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His mind became filled with vain thoughts and foolish reasonings that have turned him away from God and His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His emotion, which was created to love God, was turned away from loving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now, man s emotion loves anything and everything else but God and even hates Him 2 Tim 3:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Finally, his will, which God created for man to choose Him and obey Him, became rebellious against God Eph 2:2b .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now man s will has forsaken God and is one with the will of God s enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because of this, man himself has become the enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>C. Corrupted in His Body</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When Adam took the fruit of the tree of knowledge into him, the sinful life of Satan entered into his body and changed it into the sinful flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now, the sinful life of Satan is in man s body Rom 7:17-18a .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is this life, full of lusts and every evil thing, that makes man s body a body of sin, so strong to sin, and a body of death, so weak to serve the Lord and to please Him Rom 6:6b; 7:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can see from this that man was condemned by God outwardly, or objectively, and ruined by the satanic life inwardly, or subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because this sinful life has entered into man, he has even become a child of the Devil John 8:44; Eph 2:2b .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In such a pitiful and ruined condition, man is helpless to save himself and utterly hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All that he has to look forward to is a life full of sin and God s eternal punishment in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the condition that all men, including you and I, fell into as the result of Adam s sin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It was such a horrible condition that caused God, in His love, to come to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Questions Define the words objective and subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What caused man s objective problem before God?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What is man s objective problem before God?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What is the cause of man s subjective problem within himself?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How has man s three-part being been ruined by the fall?</S>
