   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEW CLOTH AND THE NEW GARMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we need to look into these four new things that the Lord mentioned in these verses, realizing that He used these things to illustrate something of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First of all, there is the new cloth for the new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The new cloth is for making the new garment, and the new garment is a covering that we put on outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, the new garment is our outward expression.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This signifies that Christ is our outward expression as the new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is fasting?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That is an old garment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That may also be an old garment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In that case you may ask me whether or not I pray.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Certainly I pray, but I do not pray in an old way, in a religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The religious prayer of the disciples of John was an old garment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Their fasting also was an old garment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now, however, Jesus is here.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is here first to be a piece of new cloth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word used for new here means untreated, undressed, or, as one version says, unshrunk.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This new cloth is a cloth that has never been dealt with or used.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is raw material.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This refers to the Lord Jesus before He was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>While the Lord Jesus was on this earth, what He was and what He did was somewhat like an untreated, unfulled cloth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, by His death and resurrection the new cloth became the new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before His death and resurrection, He was a piece of new cloth, not treated, not dressed, not completed for wearing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, when redemption was accomplished through His death and resurrection, He became the finished, completed new garment for us to put on as our covering.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not try to take a piece of the Lord Jesus as the new cloth to patch up our old garment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That will surely rend the old garment and cause the damage to increase.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We could not damage Him, but our old garment would be damaged by our trying to use Him as the new cloth to patch it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Matthew and Mark use the expression new cloth, but Luke uses new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The new cloth is the incarnated Christ before He was dealt with by death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The new garment is the crucified and resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was a piece of new cloth, but now He is no longer a piece of unfinished new cloth; He is a completed new garment that we can put on.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He as the new garment is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are under His covering and we are in Him; therefore, eventually He is our expression.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not try to adjust or improve ourselves by taking something of Christ to patch up our holes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to forget about what we are and put on the whole Christ as our new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then we can say, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is our garment, He is our covering; therefore, He is our expression.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are not going to express our own humility, our love, our kindness, or our goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are only going to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is not the unfinished new cloth, but the completed, whole new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE WHOLE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There are many people today who say that Jesus is a good example to follow and imitate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, in so doing they are simply cutting out a piece of the Lord Jesus as the new cloth to put upon their old garment to patch up the holes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That will never work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The new cloth is for making the new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Praise the Lord, He is no more a piece of untreated cloth!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is now the finished, complete garment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Neither should we cut a piece of this complete garment to patch the holes of our old garment, for that will simply damage the old garment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our old garment is too old.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is good for nothing but to be thrown away.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should put on the Lord Jesus as our new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we take Him, we should take Him wholly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should not try to take only pieces or parts of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we are going to take Him, we need to take Him as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord, in effect, was telling the disciples of John and the Pharisees: Do not cut Me out and apply Me to your old religion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Your fasting and prayers are an old garment.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do you not realize that your old garment is already worn out and full of holes?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not try to use Me to patch your old and tattered garment.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The best way is simply to abandon it and take Me as your new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you take Me, you need to take Me wholly.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you do not take Me, then forget about Me, but do not cut Me into pieces to patch your old garment.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today many people are doing what the disciples of John and the Pharisees did.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They are trying to take the new things of the Lord to patch up their old ways.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, the holes in their old ways are made larger and larger.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should not cut out any piece of the Lord Jesus to patch up our old ways.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Either we keep the old ways, or drop them completely.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Either we forget about the Lord Jesus, or take Him wholly.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should not put the new together with the old.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It simply does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord said, The patch from the new will not match the old Luke 5:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we take something new, we should take it wholly.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Otherwise, we should forget about it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Either old or new, there is no compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We need to be in the realm of either black or white there is no gray.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should take Christ as our whole, complete new garment.</S>
