   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Divine Presence Being in Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Triune God passed through the processes of incarnation and resurrection in order to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Through incarnation He could be Immanuel outside of His believers, but this would fulfill only part of His intention in being with us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His being with us outwardly does not fulfill His purpose to dispense Himself into our being, so He had to go through another process.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second process was His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In resurrection His physical form became a spiritual form.</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the life-giving Spirit, He is Immanuel, the presence of the Divine Trinity.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The divine presence is the life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This presence is Immanuel, who is the real, practical Jesus, the Triune God with the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We live with Christ as Immanuel and walk by Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to walk by Christ as the life-giving Spirit, we must live with Christ as a person, who is Immanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today Immanuel is the very life-giving Spirit, who is the consummated Triune God as His presence with us moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to realize that all day long we have another One with us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is not only with us outwardly but also with us inwardly in our spirit every minute of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do and say things one way when we are alone, but when we have someone else with us, we do and say things differently.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must ask ourselves, "Are we doing things in our own way, or are we doing things in another way because we realize that another One is with us?"</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are very few Christians who walk, live, speak, and do things with Immanuel as another One with them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have the doctrine of Immanuel, but we have very little experience of Immanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we had more experience of Immanuel, we would not do many of the things we do today, such as gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On some occasions, while I am walking, I may see two sisters or two brothers talking together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Often as I approach them, they stop their conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They would not continue their conversation because another person was there.</S>
