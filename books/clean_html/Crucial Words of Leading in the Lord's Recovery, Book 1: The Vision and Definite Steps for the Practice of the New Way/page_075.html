<h2 class="head1">A PERSONAL TESTIMONY</h2>
<p>At the present time in Taiwan, my goal, on the one hand, is to study how to advance in the new move with the co-workers and elders. On the other hand, I have a great burden to work on the Recovery Version of the New Testament in Chinese. It has been difficult to have a proper version of the Bible for our meetings. The existing translations require much editing work. Since the publication of the Recovery Version in English, the Chinese saints, especially those overseas, have unanimously demanded a Recovery Version in Chinese. The saints in Taiwan are also very eager to have such a version. A few years ago I was hoping that some Chinese-speaking saints would pick up the burden to take care of this responsibility. I was even ready to spend the money to hire someone to take care of this work. However, after considering this for a few years and looking around, I realized that it was impossible to hire anyone to do this job. Such a one would need much spiritual education and should know theology as well as spiritual terminology and expressions, such as <em>the Triune God, the person of Christ, God&rsquo;s dispensing, God&rsquo;s economy, the essential Spirit, the economical Spirit,</em> and others. At the same time, it was impossible to recruit some useful ones from the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and put them to use immediately. Even if we selected a few young ones and started training them, they would still need to pass through a period of training and perfecting. Consequently, I became clear that I had to sacrifice the work in the West and devote a year&rsquo;s time in Taiwan for this task. Based on our experience in the last few decades, I know I must enter into this work thoroughly in order to establish a good foundation.</p>
<p>For me to engage in this work is also a kind of warfare. It has been two months since I started this work. I have used every ounce of my energy on this. I can say that I have exhausted the strength in my spirit, soul, and body. Every day I work eight to ten hours. Although I am more than eighty years old, I still feel that I need to give myself in this way. May the Lord cover me with His blood. After two months we were finally able to lay a foundation. The serving ones now have some realization of what it means to translate the Bible, how they should use the reference books, and how to consult other material or versions. In the past they had the means, but they did not know how to use them. However, at the present time I have personally taken the lead to work through everything with them. While I worked, I also asked questions and directed them. In two months we finished the Gospel of Matthew, and then we moved on to the Gospel of Mark. Now the foundation is laid, but I am exhausted.</p>
<p>While I was working on the Recovery Version, I was also working on <em>Truth Lessons</em> and taking care of the English publications. For example, the messages for the International Elders&rsquo; Conference have all been polished and are ready for me to read and review. After working hard this way, I was suddenly overcome two weeks ago by a general feeling of fatigue. Since then, I have been resting. Thank the Lord that He has given me a healthy body. If I did not have such a body, the result would have been unimaginable. I rested for four days, and by the fifth day I was able to resume meeting.</p>
<p>My point is that the enemy is attacking. When I was walking down to the basement of the meeting hall to join a truth class, I missed the last step of the stairs. Thankfully, the Lord protected me; my hand was still on the rail, but my body sustained a shock. At that time I did not feel anything, and I continued with the meeting. Since that time, however, I feel that my two feet have been weak and wobbly. I thought that it was caused by my fatigue and that with a little rest I would recover. The doctors suspected something was wrong with my heart and suggested an examination. The result of the examination was good, and the doctors declared that everything was normal. Still, I felt that my two feet could not bear my weight. The doctors suggested that I exercise more; they thought that I was tired from the desk work and that I needed exercise. But the more I exercised, the worse I felt. I could not explain this.</p>
<p>Last Friday I felt that I had to come and speak about the burden of prayer. Thank the Lord! Through this I realized that there is a spiritual battle here. On the one hand, the prayer last Friday sustained me, and on the other hand, it triggered something. The next day while I was in bed, I suddenly recalled a similar experience I had previously had with a backache. It was similar to this experience. I became clear that this was Satan&rsquo;s attack. He was doing a hidden work. I stopped all my work and lay quietly on my bed.</p>
<p>I give this little illustration to show that we need to pray. Do not think that Satan will work only a little. He sends these frustrations to us one after another. After my backache was somewhat healed, two days later I caught a cold and had a fever as well as diarrhea. The co-workers prayed for me on Monday morning for two hours, and then the full-timers prayed for me for one hour. The prayers were very effectual. In the past when I had a cold, I would struggle with it for at least a week, but this time I recovered in a day.</p>
<p>Do not think that all these things are accidental. We need to realize that we are in the midst of a spiritual battle. Yesterday I walked around my study for half an hour, and then I sat down to work on the manuscripts. The more I worked, the more alert and energetic I became. Now as I am speaking, the more I speak, the more strength I have. This shows that I am not sick. This is altogether Satan&rsquo;s attack in darkness. Of course, he does have some ground to attack; two months of work has drained all my energy. This gave Satan an opening to attack me. But thank the Lord for His protection! I was not hurt in any way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FIGHTING SERVICE</h2>
<p>The brothers and sisters must realize that our work here is a fighting service. The elders in particular must receive the burden to build up the church in the homes. This is our undisputed goal. We need to make this successful. I hope that one day there will no longer be any big meetings among us, but we would have only home meetings. We can have more than three hundred thousand saints here in the church in Taipei without having a big meeting. Instead, everyone will meet in the homes. Yearly we can have a few special corporate gatherings, but we must never forget that the basis of the church is built upon individual families. This requires a long-term warfare. The co-workers in particular must see this and must endeavor in this way. We must build up the home meetings, teach the truth well, and give up the big meetings. If we do this, the clergy-laity system will be gone, and all the saints will know, speak, preach, and teach the truth. If we do this, we will no longer need a preacher among us; every saint will become a preacher.</p>
<p>A society is not propagated through teaching but through the begetting of offspring. Offspring are produced from the family, and they are also raised in the family. Through begetting, nourishing, and teaching, the offspring then produce their own families. In this way society continues generation after generation. Sixty years ago I was a single man. Later I married and had a family with eight children. Now these eight children have begotten more than twenty grandchildren in the third generation. This is the proper multiplication. It is the proper way for a society to propagate as a whole. The same is true with the church. It is through multiplication in the family that the church continues to prosper and spread generation after generation.</p>
<p>However, it is not easy to do such a work. Christianity is with us, and it affects us constantly. This &ldquo;custom of the nations&rdquo; is constantly frustrating us. This is what happened to Nehemiah when he rebuilt the city; Sanballat constantly opposed him (Neh. 2:19; 4:1-8; 6:1-9). This requires all of us to rise up to see this light and to struggle to fight. I do not mean to say that all of us must quit our jobs to serve as elders. I am saying that we must have an attitude of fighting. Even if we hold a job, we need to be for the Lord. If we do this, the Lord will bless us and our career. We are the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. If the Lord does not bless us, whom will He bless? If any man loves the Lord, this one is known by Him (1 Cor. 8:3). Those among us who have been loving the Lord and serving Him for decades have surely witnessed our families being blessed by the Lord. Today if we fight for His building, will He not bless us even more?</p>
<p>It is a great blessing for our families to be gained by the Lord and for our offspring to serve the Lord. We do not need to quit our jobs. God ordained that man labor to sustain his livelihood. Because this is God&rsquo;s ordained rule for man to exist after the fall, we need to keep our jobs. The young people especially should do their best to study well. After they graduate from school, they should take up a proper job. However, we should not fall into the trap of mammon once we take up a career. We should not try to become rich or to raise our standard of living. When we take a job, we must pray that the Lord will guard our heart for Him. Our time must be consecrated to the Lord. If we do this, the Lord will have a way in us. When Jacob was about to go down to Egypt, he first offered a sacrifice in Beer-sheba and consecrated himself to the Lord. God told him not to be afraid when he went down to Egypt, because He would make him a great nation (Gen. 46:1-4). We must have an aspiration and a burden from the Lord that even if we hold a job, we are still a full-timer. We are a money-making full-timer; we give all that we earn to the Lord for His use. The purpose of doing this is not only to save a few more souls and edify some saints but to build up the Lord&rsquo;s church in the homes. Today in Taiwan we have forty to fifty thousand brothers and sisters. If we can build up the church in every saint&rsquo;s home, we will replace the work of many preachers, and we will effectively teach the truth to the saints.</p>
