   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Handing Oneself Over</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Bringing in the Power of Explosion</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I hope that one day we can break open Hong Kong with explosive power.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We do not have to wait for a big co-worker to come to do the job.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to hand ourselves and all we have over and coordinate together to preach the gospel in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No one should be for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everyone should offer up everything for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let me shout this into our ears: We cannot crave one single thread in this world, while asking the other brothers and sisters to give up the world or to see the vanity of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We cannot love money ourselves, while telling them to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we do not hand ourselves over, we cannot demand others to sacrifice their life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Perhaps some will feel that this is a bit too extreme, but in this matter, it does not hurt to be extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have been extreme in many things in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Should we be careful to stay within the bounds when it comes to our consecration to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we have never been extreme once, we will never be able to lead others to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Making Friends with Mammon</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must not hesitate in handing ourselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once we procrastinate, our mind will come under the attack of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some may think that we are mad when we hand over our possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Actually, this is not madness; this is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The demand of the gospel is so great that it calls for our very life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this world only two kinds of people are willing to give up their possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first are the mad and insane.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The second are those who sacrifice for love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We hand ourselves over because we love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not care about criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We only care for the Lord's commands.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do not uphold this truth, we will end up suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Always remember the Lord's word that we have to make friends with the mammon of unrighteousness Luke 16:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once we hand ourselves over, we will have a share when the church gains people through the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We will be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do not hand ourselves over, we will not have a share even if the church gains many people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today the Lord's timing is ripe.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whether or not we are actually doing the preaching, we will have a share in the Lord's work as long as we hand ourselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once the gospel breaks out, we will see the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Perhaps when that day comes we will no longer be here, but our offering will still be here.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today brothers everywhere are adding their share to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I hope that we all will join them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once this flame is ignited, it will never go out.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I hope that the flame in Hong Kong never goes out.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Handing Over Being the Responsibility</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>of Every Brother and Sister</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Handing over oneself is not just a responsibility of the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is a responsibility that is on all of our shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have gathered too much for ourselves, yet our eyes are always on the purse of the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Criticism and gossip about this and that co-worker often come to my ears.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have to say a word for the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These workers are God's workers; they are not your workers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you can be God's counselor, you can manage the co-workers' purses.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If I say this word to the co-workers, it is not worth much, but it is good for you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If all of us, young and old, will consecrate our all, the cheap way with us in the past will be gone once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to make up our mind to have a share in the gospel of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to hand over our occupation, our time, and our money for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the only way to bring in the power.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord will not be satisfied until we preach the gospel this way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The only thing that will satisfy the Lord is for the entire Body to be consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The only thing that will satisfy us is this very same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our handing over will satisfy the Lord, and it will satisfy us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Time is short.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord's coming is near, yet the responsibility of the gospel is still great.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many places in China still have not heard the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If the church does not rise up together to preach the gospel, the Lord will delay His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I hope that from this day forward we will drop all dissenting thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Let us abandon all care for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should have only one profession preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should have only one goal letting all sinners hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we do this, it will not be difficult to gospelize Hong Kong and all of China.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The handing over that we are speaking about is more demanding than just offering up all of our possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Handing ourselves over means offering up our entire being, including our time and occupation, for the coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Our eyes are not set on our wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our God is not a poor God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He is the God of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We expect the Body to rise up to preach the gospel; the church should rise up to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When the church rises up to preach the gospel, we will be perpetually short of meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>One meeting hall will not be enough; even ten meeting halls will not be enough.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Today we are seeing the light.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is not a matter of eight or ten being called to forsake everything to preach the gospel by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>All the brothers and sisters have to rise up to preach the gospel together.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Today this fire has started.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I hope none of us will run away from this fire.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Brother Weigh: Lord, some of us have come to Hong Kong as travelers.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Some have come as refugees.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We have become loose because we have been greatly influenced by the Babylonian environment around us here in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>For all these years the church has not been absolute enough to rise up to preach the gospel together.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Forgive us and grant us the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Lord, You have come to cast a fire upon the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You said this when there was a baptism awaiting You; Your spirit was pressed!</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>You have gone through that baptism, and Your life has been released.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The fire has been released, and it has been burning during the past centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Today in China this fire has started in Chefoo, Shanghai, Foochow, and Chuenchow.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Now we ask that You start this fire in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Start it within all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>May Your love and mercy continue their great work.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Today, we have to catch up with You or else we will be cast aside.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>May Your great love and mercy enable us to catch up.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Amen.</S>
