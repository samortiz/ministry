For two thousand years Christians have acknowledged one thing, that no one can know the Lord well without knowing the Bible
If we only have the Scripture without, but do not have the Holy Spirit within, we will become dead, without vitality or livingness
Having these two aspects-the inward and the outward-coordinating together, the train can move, even move very well
He told us that the words he spoke were the speaking of the Spirit of God through him, and that it was God's word that was in his tongue
Not only the Holy Spirit spoke through him, but also God's word was in his tongue and was spoken from his mouth
The Old Testament is God's speaking in the prophets; the New Testament is God's speaking in the Son, our Lord Jesus
The Lord's word here also proves that after the Spirit's descension, what His disciples spoke and wrote was disclosed to them by the Spirit
The entire Bible originates from God; every word and every sentence, every iota and every tittle , are God-inspired
The Lord Jesus is the subject and contents of the Bible; the Bible is the explanation and expression of the Lord Jesus
The Bible Gods written Word must have the Lord Jesus the living Word as its reality otherwise it is but mere doctrines and empty letters
The functions of the Bible are of two aspects: one aspect is to serve the Lord, and the other aspect is to serve us
On the one hand, it testifies of the Lord Jesus and, on the other hand, it causes us to receive grace and be built up
A newly regenerated believer must long for the word of the Bible, like newborn babes longing for the guileless milk of the word
We must take the word of God as food and eat it , even regarding the word of the Bible as more important than our food
The Bible also records many things as warnings to us that we may be admonished, be on the alert, and not repeat the former mistakes
John was a Galilean fisherman with little education, yet he was called by the Lord to be one of His twelve apostles
He was a man of great learning; he was talented, competent, aggressive, and capable of outstanding achievements
Peter was also a Galilean fisherman with limited education, but he was called by the Lord to be the first of His twelve apostles
In the completion of the entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, there was a time separation of 1500-1600 years
Following the Pentateuch, throughout the generations some among God's people were inspired to write the word of God
Not only the writing of the Old Testament was completed, but the Old Testament had also been confirmed and generally recognized
, when seventy scholars translated the Old Testament into Greek, all the books of the Old Testament must have been established
After the passing away of the apostles, confusion arose due to some who wrote books by assuming the identity of others
Each book of the Bible is God's revelation with every line and word coming from the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
Small and finite as we are, we human beings cannot understand it thoroughly; even less can we define it in a full way
Many things relating to the matter of life are not within the comprehension of men; men can only have a general idea of them
Although we cannot find the term 'triune' in the Scriptures, we can see the fact concerning the Trinity of the Godhead
Both in the Old Testament and in the New, there are many passages which clearly and definitely tell us that God is only one
Corinthians 8:4 says, 'There is no God but one,' and Isaiah 45:5 says, 'I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God besides me'
That God is one is a clear and definite revelation of the Scriptures; it is also a fundamental and consummate principle
That the only God, in His divine word, speaks of Himself a number of times as Us is truly a mystery which is hard for us to understand
The Lord says in Matthew 28:19, 'Baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
When He speaks here of the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit, the name which is used is in the singular number in the original text
Is the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, as spoken by the Lord here, the name Father, or Son, or Holy Spirit?
In verse 3 Peter told Ananias that he had lied to the Spirit; but in the next verse he said that he had lied to God
Praise the Lord, we can simply receive and enjoy this mysterious One according to what the Scriptures have said!
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
Coinherence, as applied to the Trinity, means that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are in one another and thus exist together
When the Son comes, the Father does not come with Him outwardly; rather, the Father comes with Him inwardly and subjectively
These verses prove that when the Son is living on earth, both the Father and the Spirit are with Him; the Three are inseparable
John 14:7-11 says, 'If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him
The last Adam, of course, is the incarnated Lord Jesus, and the life-giving Spirit, of course, is the Holy Spirit
The Lord was made flesh and became the last Adam, and later, after death and resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
The fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the flowing into us of the grace of the Son, together with the love of the Father, for us to enjoy
The result is that everything that is of the Three-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-becomes the enjoyment within us
The fellowship of the Holy Spirit brings the grace of Christ, and in the grace of Christ there is the love of God
The Father, Son, and Spirit are not three Gods but one God with the aspect of three for us to possess and enjoy
To the believers, the Father is the source, the Son is the manifestation, and the Spirit is God reaching and entering into them
God's purpose in creating the universe is entirely for His Son, that His Son may have the preeminence and be glorified in all creation
Not only so, Christ the Son is God's embodiment because all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily
In Genesis 1:1 the word 'created' is bara in Hebrew, which means to bring something into existence out of nothing
The Word of God is the explanation of God; the things created through the Word of God are for the explanation of God, the revelation of God
Although God's eternal power and divine characteristics are invisible, man can understand them by the things that were made
Genesis 1:2b does not refer to God's original creation-that was completed with verse 1-but to God's restoration
After God created, some things happened, causing the harmonious and beautiful universe created originally by God to become damaged
In the restoration, it was not firstly the heavens, and then the earth; it was firstly the earth, and then the heavens
In the creation of the things with life, He also started from the lowest life, going up level by level, until He reached the highest life
These animals that bear their young alive possess a life that is higher than that of the animals that bear eggs
The record in Genesis chapter one shows that it took six days for God to do the work of restoration and further creation
After the appearance of the dry land, God went on further to create the different plant lives, each after its kind
On the fifth day, God created the living creatures in the water and the birds, the fowl in the air, each after its kind
On the sixth day, God created the living creatures on the earth: the cattle, the creeping things, and the beasts, each after its kind
Man has the desire to have love, light, holiness, and righteousness, and these virtues are sometimes expressed in his behavior
Before God was incarnated to be a man, He appeared frequently to people in the Old Testament in the form of a man
God created such a corporate man in His own image and after His likeness so that man might express God Himself
The first aspect of God's intention is to deal with His enemy, to deal with Satan, who is typified by the creeping things
He created man in His own image that man might express Him, and He gave him dominion that man might deal with His enemy
The third aspect of God's intention in giving man dominion is to bring in God's authority, to exercise God's authority over the earth
The will of the soul is the organ for decisionmaking man decides judges proposes chooses and refusesthese are the functions of the will
Zechariah 12:1 says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him
If there were no man on this earth, the earth would be void and, as far as man is concerned, the heavens would become meaningless
When man first came out of God's creating hands, he was not crooked, evil, or defiled, but upright, good, and pure
Although man was created in God's image and after God's likeness, his life is but a created life, unlike God's life which is uncreated
God's life is divine and glorious; man's life is, at the most, pure and good, but without God's glorious nature
Although man has a spirit which enables man to know God and have fellowship with God, man's spirit does not have God's life nor God's nature
In order to give man an opportunity to choose, God put the tree of knowledge of good and evil beside the tree of life
The tree of life denotes God as the source of life; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan as the source of death
We have seen already that God's original creation is fully covered in Genesis 1:1, 'In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth'
Satan is not only God's enemy outside of God's kingdom, but also God's adversary from within God's kingdom, rebelling against God
Enemy refers to the foe outside of God's kingdom, whereas adversary refers to the foe from within God's kingdom
From Ezekiel 28 we see that Satan was not only one of the angels, but the highest archangel, the head of all the angels
Ezekiel 28:12-14 says, 'Thus saith the Lord God; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty
His position and rank were so high that even Michael the archangel did not dare to bring a reviling judgment against him
Also the four living creatures in Ezekiel are similar to the four in Revelation which took the lead among the creatures in worshipping God
From this we may infer that the anointed cherub was also specially privileged to move in the realm where God's glory was
Now God has chosen us to be His priests and kings, to take over Satan's position and offices, to put him to shame, and to glorify God
Ezekiel 28:17 says that his heart was lifted up because of his beauty, that he corrupted his wisdom by reason of his brightness
Gird yourselves with humility toward one another, because God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble'
In Revelation 12:4 and 9 we see that one-third of the heavenly stars, that is, one-third of the angels, followed him
Ephesians 2:2 describes Satan as 'the ruler of the authority of the air,' and Ephesians 6:12 tells us of 'the rulers
When Satan rebelled against God, most of his angels followed him in his rebellion, becoming the fallen angels, the evil spirits
Matthew 1243 says Now when the unclean spirit goes out from a man it passes through waterless places seeking rest and does not find it
Geologists and archaeologists have discovered that the earth is not merely six thousand years old, but much older
After studying this matter thoroughly, Pember inferred that at a certain time after the original creation, Satan and his angels rebelled
In the pre-Adamic age, the evil angels and the living beings followed Satan in his rebellion against God to form the kingdom of Satan
Today, in Satan's kingdom there are the fallen angels in the air, the demons in the water, and the fallen human beings on the earth
When the morning stars saw it, they were excited and sang, and when all the angels saw it, they shouted for joy
Whenever these two words 'waste' and 'empty' are used together in the Old Testament, they always denote a result of judgment
Through the church's executing work, the Devil will be cast to the earth, and his angels will be cast out with him
The heavens, the earth, and the universe were corrupted because of Satan's rebellion and fell under God's judgment
He tempted man to contact the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and caused man to have an illegal union with him
Even to this day, Satan still uses the same method to tempt man into sin or to instigate him to reject God's salvation
The reason Eve was tempted by the serpent was that she assumed the headship, made the decision on her own, and fell into Satan's snare
Even before she ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, she was already ensnared by the evil one
Whenever we assume the headship in dealing with any situation, denying the headship of God and of Christ, we will surely be deceived
Whenever man does not use his spirit to contact God he bypasses God and puts God aside consequently he falls into the hand of the evil one
In our daily living, we should use our spirit first, and then let our spirit direct our soul, which, in turn, directs our body
Eventually, her mind was fully occupied by the evil one after she ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
The third result was that man's spirit was deadened, becoming insulated from God and losing its function toward God
Because of one man's sin, all of creation is subjected to vanity, groaning and travailing under the slavery of corruption
Abel was an example of believing the gospel and living for the gospel, while Cain was an example of turning from God's way of salvation
Cain rejected God's way in his service and offering; he invented a religion of man's concept, according to his own ideas
No wonder the Lord Jesus says, 'An hour is coming when everyone who kills you will think that he is offering service to God'
The question is not whether we serve God or we commit sin, but whether we act according to God's way or according to our own opinion
He will become a vagabond wandering on the earth, and he was cast out of the presence of God, unable to see God's face
The angels that married the daughters of men were those who did not keep their principality, as recorded in Jude 6 and 7
Genesis 6:3 says, 'And the Lord said, My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, for that he indeed is flesh'
The second step was that man was not only evil but corrupt to such a degree that even the most tolerant God could not tolerate it any longer
In the rebellion at Babel, man declared that he denied God's right and that he was absolutely free from God's authority
At his fall in the beginning, Satan's intention was to overthrow God's authority, but he was not successful in his attempt
He came again into the fallen human race to inject the same thought into man, inciting man to rise up collectively against God's authority
Since they rebelled against God collectively, God came in to scatter them that they might no longer live together in one place
On the one hand, he had sinned before God, and on the other hand, he now had the sinful nature, Satan's evil nature, within him
According to His foreknowledge and foresight, that is, according to His foreknowledge of man's fall, He planned to redeem man after the fall
Before redemption came, in the Old Testament God promised it many times, clearly foretelling the different aspects of His redemption
At the time of man's fall, God promised that Christ would come of a woman to destroy Satan, the one who deceived and damaged man
Solomon, the son of David, built the temple of God; Christ, as the seed of David, builds the temple of God-the church
On the one hand, it tells us that the coming Christ, as promised in Genesis 3, was not to be born of a married woman but of a virgin
When He comes to be man's Savior, God comes to be man's Savior; God Himself comes of a virgin to be man's Savior
Although He was manifested to be the Son in time, He is also the self-existing and ever-existing Father in eternity
The earthly human living of this Redeemer promised by God was clearly foretold to us in every aspect in detail
He came from a poor family, as a root out of a dry ground, without a rich supply and without a comfortable living
He was destined to be despised and rejected, to endure suffering and hardship, and to grieve daily for the sinner's soul
Not only would He not cry out in the streets, but He also would not break the bruised reed nor quench the smoking flax
Man's evil intention was that He make His grave with the wicked, but God's arrangement was that He be buried with the rich
The year in which He died was the seventh year of the sixty-ninth week after the order was given to rebuild Jerusalem
It pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin'
The Spirit of Christ, in Christ's own words, describes both the terrifying scene around Him and His painful feelings inwardly and outwardly
At that moment, because He bore our sins, God forsook Him; He then cried out, saying, 'My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me'?
He hung on the cross for several hours, so that even His bones were out of joint and He could tell all His bones
Because He is the Holy One of Jehovah, God would not leave His soul in hell, neither suffer Him to see corruption
He will impart His life to men, and make them His seed, that through them He can fulfill the pleasure of the Lord
In the promise of God's redemption, Christ not only died for us and was resurrected for us, but He also ascended for us
Those' refers to the redeemed saints, who, before they were saved through the death and resurrection of Christ, were captured by Satan
In His ascension Christ captured them; in other words, the Lord delivered them from the captivity of Satan unto Himself
These gifts are the gifted ones mentioned in Ephesians 4:11-the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
In the promise of God's redemption Christ's second coming is clearly mentioned: 'one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven'
In His first coming, Christ manifested His power in healing the sick and in casting out demons, proving that He is the heavenly King
At the pressing moment, Christ will come with myriads of His saints , and His feet will stand upon the Mount of Olives
Immediately after the fall, Adam and Eve realized that they had violated God's prohibition against eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge
Before the fall man did not need blood to redeem him, but after the fall he needed the bleeding sacrifice to redeem him
In Genesis 3:20, after Adam heard the glad tidings, he immediately called his wife's name Eve, which means living
After Adam believed in the glad tidings, God made coats of skins of the sacrifice for him and his wife and clothed them
In order to make coats of the skins of the lambs, God probably killed the lambs in the presence of Adam and Eve
If the lambs and Adam and Eve had been separated from one another, the lambs could not have substituted for them
When Adam and Eve put on the coats of skins made by God, this typifies that they had believed into Christ and become one with Christ
During Abel's time sheep were not to be eaten by men, because before the flood men were allowed to feed upon vegetables and fruits only
Abel did not present his sacrifice according to his concept, thought, or way, but according to God's way of salvation
He needed an offering with the shedding of blood to satisfy Gods righteous requirement and the skins of the sacrifice to cover the naked man
According to Numbers 1817 the firstling of a cow or sheep a type of Christ could not be eaten by the Israelites it had to be offered to God
When we see that our life is vanity and that we ourselves are frail, spontaneously we will call upon the name of the Lord
Men did not call on the One who created all things, but on the One who was so near to them, on the One who was closely related to them
Genesis 5 is a record of the living and begetting of some saved people, but they still lived under the ultimate result of the fall-death
Man went from Adam to Abel and from Abel to Enosh, then he began to call on the name of the Lord to enjoy all His riches
Noah's life and work were not simply a matter of walking with God or of building the ark, but also one of changing that age
If we want to understand that Noah's life was a life that changed the age, we must see God's economy and purpose when God first created man
If you read the latter part of Genesis 1, you will see that God created man in His own image for the purpose of expressing Himself
Man was entrusted with God's authority that he might represent God and set up a dominion on earth over all God's creatures
On the second day of His work, God did not say anything, because on that day there were fallen angels in the air and demons in the water
Only on the sixth day, the day in which God created man, God looked at His work, especially on man, and said, 'Very good'!
Satan was glad to hear that God was going to destroy man from the face of the earth, but Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
In Abel we see an illustration of God's way of salvation-being acceptable to God by relying on the shedding of the blood of the sacrifices
One day the God of glory appeared to him and called him to leave his country and his kindred and to go into a land which God would show him
Abraham however did not accept that calling immediately and God sovereignly caused his father Terah to bring the family from Ur to Haran
God appeared to Abraham the second time and told him to leave his country, his kindred, and also his father's house
In God's second calling, He not only told Abraham to leave his country and his kindred but also his father's house
In His promise, God turned again from Abraham back to all the families of the Adamic race through Christ, the seed of Abraham
From Haran Abraham brought Sarah his wife, Lot his brother's son, and all their substance and people into the land of Canaan
His dwelling in a tent also shows that he did not belong to the world, but lived the life of a sojourner on the earth
The Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels;
Before the children were born, God had already said that the elder would serve the younger, for God had chosen the younger Jacob
Romans 9:11, referring to Jacob and Esau, says, 'The children not yet being born, nor having done anything good or bad, '
Although Jacob was defeated in his mother's womb by his brother and was born second, he kept struggling to seize the birthright
During his escape to Laban's house, Jacob one night lay down to sleep in the wilderness, taking a stone for a pillow
Jacob took the stone that he had put for his pillow and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it
When Jacob heard in his old age that Joseph had become ruler over all the land of Egypt, what was his reaction?
When he heard the good news concerning Joseph, his reaction was that his heart became numb yet his spirit was revived
Jacob also blessed Joseph and Joseph's two sons, and all his children, one by one, and he even prophesied through his blessing
The biographies of Joseph and Jacob are blended together in Genesis because they are actually the biography of one person, not of two
Pharaoh saw that the Spirit of God was in him and that he was discreet and wise, so Pharaoh set him over all the land of Egypt
If we add all the experiences of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob together, we see a clear picture of the complete experience of a called one
From Abraham to Joseph, the Bible gives a full picture of a person chosen by God, from being called by God to maturing in life
In Abraham, we see God's calling, justification by faith, living by faith, and dwelling in fellowship with God
In chapter forty of Exodus, when Moses erected the tabernacle, not only did the glory of God come down upon it, but it also filled it
Pharaoh held the children of Israel in slavery and also sought to kill all the baby boys born to the Hebrew women
In the royal palace Moses was trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in his words and deeds
Now he supposed that his brothers would understand that God through his hand would give salvation to them; but they did not understand
Moses performed wonders and miracles in the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years to lead God's people out
In Moses we see a complete picture of God's redemption, including the Passover, the exodus from Egypt, and the crossing of the Red Sea
In order to deliver His people out of the land of Egypt, the land of bondage, God sent ten plagues through Moses to punish the Egyptians
God sent the last plague, the slaying of all the firstborn, to demonstrate His power and to accomplish His way of salvation
On the fourteenth day of the first month at midnight Jehovah smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast
The Passover portrayed in Exodus 12 is a clear, adequate, and even all-inclusive type of the redemption of Christ
The children of Israel were commanded to take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for a house
The lamb had to be without blemish, a male of the first year, taken either out from the sheep or from the goats
The blood put on the lintel and the doorposts was a sign for redemption, so that God could pass over when He saw this blood
The children of Israel ate the flesh of the lamb, which was roasted with fire , in the house that had been sprinkled with the blood
And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the Lord did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies'
Because the blood of the lamb had been applied to the doorpost of their houses, God in His righteous judgment could pass over them
Although the Passover was adequate to save them from Gods judgment it was not effective to rescue them from the usurpation of the Egyptians
In order to be saved from the Egyptian tyranny, the children of Israel needed the exodus and the crossing of the Red Sea
If the children of Israel had only the exodus but not the crossing of the Red Sea, their salvation would not have been secure
In Egypt the children of Israel were involved with the evil, corrupt, and condemned world and were under God's judgment
The blood of the Passover lamb saved them from God's judgment, and the water saved them from the tyranny of the Egyptians
Through water the children of Israel were saved from Egypt and its slavery , that is, from the world and its usurpation
Although they had been brought out of Egypt into the wilderness of separation, they were still constituted with the element of Egypt
His desire was to fill them, to satisfy them, to satiate them with food from heaven, and thereby to make them a heavenly people
God commanded Moses, saying, 'Thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink'
John 73739 say Now on the last day the great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried out saying If anyone thirst let him come to Me and drink
The significance of the smiting of the rock by the rod of Moses and the flowing out of the living water is that Christ is our rock
Having been smitten by the power of God's righteous law, He was cleft, and living water came forth for us to drink
In bringing the people to Mount Sinai, the mountain of God, it was not God's intention to give them commandments to keep
Because the people knew neither God nor themselves, God changed His attitude toward them and also caused a change in the atmosphere
The law came in as an extra thing ; it was added because of transgressions , and was not in the origination of God's economy
Concerning the matter of law, there is an important principle: the kind of law a person makes expresses the kind of person that one is
According to Exodus 31:18, the two tablets of stones upon which the Ten Commandments were written were called the 'two tables of testimony'
The law is the testimony, the ark is the ark of the testimony, and the tabernacle is the tabernacle of testimony
Exodus 401734 says And it came to pass in the first month in the second year on the first day of the month that the tabernacle was reared up
That day when the glory of God filled the tabernacle, it was indeed a great matter because God had gained a habitation on the earth
Although they had the tabernacle, they still did not have the solid building typified by the temple in the land of Canaan
If the children of Israel intended to reach the ultimate goal of God's calling, they needed to press on to enter into the good land
God's chosen people had to press on from Sinai until they entered into the land of Canaan, the land flowing with milk and honey
They were a peculiar people, because their food was different from the food of all the other people on the earth
The Passover solved the problem of the sins of the children of Israel, and the crossing of the Red Sea solved the problem of the world
While Moses stayed on Mount Sinai for forty days, Aaron made a golden calf for the people and thus brought a great sin upon them
On the eighth day they began to offer the sacrifices , thus ministering in their priestly office before God and maintaining God's testimony
He is One who is able to sympathize with our weaknesses, for He has been tried in all respects like us, yet without sin
He offered Himself without blemish and spot to God to do God's will and became a sweet savor to satisfy God's desire
The meal offering signifies that Christ's human living was so proper, even, tender, fine, balanced, pure, and sinless
The peace offering signifies that Christ became the peace and the fellowship between God and us by shedding His blood and dying for us
The sin offering signifies that Christ was made sin for us that through His death on the cross sin might be condemned
The shoulder is the strength for movement; hence, the heave offering signifies the powerful Christ in ascension
These enemies typify the rulers and the authorities in the air , who try to frustrate us from the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ
After they entered into the good land, they were not fighting with the Egyptians but with the many nations of the land
In type, these nations refer to the evil forces of darkness, the evil authorities, the rulers, and the authorities of the air
These usurping forces in the heavenlies always try to prevent us from enjoying the riches of the all-inclusive Christ
When the children of Israel entered into the good land under Joshua's leadership, they defeated the enemy and settled down to live
Consequently they gradually forsook God followed the customs of the nations had mixed marriages with the nations and worshipped other gods
Thirteen judges are mentioned in the book of Judges Othniel Ehud Shamgar Deborah Barak Gideon Tola Jair Jephthah Ibzan Elon Abdon and Samson
Besides these, in the book of Judges there were other judges whose names are not mentioned, such as Eli , Samuel , Joel and Abiah
God delivered them into the hands of spoilers, and He sold them into the hands of their enemies so that they could no longer stand
They corrupted themselves more than their fathers and did not cease from their own doings nor from their stubborn way
The unbelief of the children of Israel caused them to wander for forty years so that even their carcasses fell in the wilderness
Because Jehovahs Spirit had come upon them they could prevail against their strong enemies and could be deliverers to the children of Israel
Because they abhorred the offerings of the Lord, their sin was very great before Him , to such an extent that He would slay them
Eli allowed his two sons to make themselves fat with the best of all the offerings of God's people, for he honored his sons more than God
God swore to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house would never be cleansed with sacrifice or offerings
When the children of Israel went out to fight against the Philistines, God allowed His ark to be taken, and the two sons of Eli were slain
When Eli heard that the ark of the Lord was taken, he fell from the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke and he died
Besides His ordination of the house of Aaron as priests, He had made a supplement in the sixth chapter of Numbers
It is not by being appointed, ordained, or even chosen by the Lord, but by voluntarily consecrating yourself to Him
At the time of Eli, the Lord was really poor as far as the priesthood was concerned; so Hannah lent Samuel to the Lord
He became a priest according to the supplement provided in Numbers 6, not according to an appointment or ordination
Samuel 3:19-21 says, 'And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground
God sent Samuel to tell Saul that He had found another to replace him, for He had found Himself a man after His own heart
Apart from the sin he committed because of the wife of Uriah, David did what was right in the eyes of the Lord
After they crossed the river Jordan, beginning from Jericho, they captured the land of Canaan battle by battle and city by city
God exercised His divine power to preserve the ark and caused the Philistines to return it to the people of God
Later, David brought God's ark to the city of David, that is, Mount Zion, a high hill within the city of Jerusalem
Although he prepared a tabernacle for the ark according to his own desire, he realized that this was only a temporary arrangement
Throughout his lifetime, David endeavored, under difficult circumstances, to prepare materials for the house of Jehovah
The first thing Solomon did after he ascended to the throne of David was to worship God and sacrifice to God at the tabernacle in Gibeon
When Solomon awoke, he left Gibeon and returned to Jerusalem at once to stand before God's ark to offer burnt offerings and peace offerings
He also understood that while the tabernacle without the ark was but an empty shell, the ark without the tabernacle was also abnormal
At this juncture, not only did God secure a kingdom to demonstrate His authority, but He also gained a temple to manifest His glory
As David prepared building materials in hardship, Christ also redeemed us through suffering and in death to prepare us as building materials
After the Israelites entered into the good land, they did in fact destroy the high places and the names of idols
Jeroboam was indifferent to God's unique chosen place and established another worship center because of his ambition
It came to pass when he reigned that he smote all the house of Jeroboam he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed until he had destroyed him
Athaliah is omitted because when she usurped the throne Joash continued the lineage of the house of David to be king in the house of Jehovah
He did very abominably in following idols according to all things as did the Amorites whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel
All the seventy sons of Ahab in Samaria and all who remained of his house were also slain, fulfilling the words of the prophet Elijah
The judgment Israel received from God and their captivity should have been a strong warning to the kingdom of Judah
