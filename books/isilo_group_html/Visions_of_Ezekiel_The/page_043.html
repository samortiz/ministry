Edom was the son of Esau, the brother of Jacob. Thus, according to blood, Edom and the sons of Israel were cousins. What is the meaning of Edom? Edom signifies the old man. Edom signifies us. Our unregenerated old man is Edom and our regenerated new man is Israel. According to the record of Ezekiel, Edom was full of hatred toward Israel, continually seeking revenge and vengeance. We are the same. Our old man hates the church. You may say, "I love the church." I believe that you do love the church, but sometimes you also hate the church. Have you not discovered that you are two men? On the one hand you are a real Israelite loving the church, and on the other hand you are a real Edomite hating the church. Sometimes you love the church and you love all the leading ones. At other times you hate the church and you hate all the elders. You do have the nature of Edom within you.</P><P>Along with Edom is Philistia. In order to know the Philistines, we must study Judges and 1 Samuel. The Philistines were even closer to Israel than the Edomites. They lived very close to the good land and even mingled with the Israelites. Many times the Philistines came to the people of Israel and intervened in their worship to God.</P><P>Once the ark was captured by the Philistines. The Philistines typify you and me as the natural man. We have the old man, and we also have the natural man. The natural man is more difficult to recognize than the old man. Let me illustrate the difference between the natural man and the old man. Suppose that there are three elders in a local church. They all love the Lord, but when one of them becomes the leading one, the other two brothers react. Their reaction is an expression of the old man.</P><P>What about the natural man? The natural man may be illustrated in this way. Once a brother becomes the leading elder, he would endeavor to do many things for the church. He would exercise his wisdom, his human power, and his capabilities. He would play politics, maneuver situations and exercise control to work things out. This is the natural man. The elders' meetings become simply a meeting of the old man with the natural man. This damages the church life. Some of the churches can hardly go on because they are frustrated by the old man and the natural man of the leadership. We are not afraid of the Ammonites. We are a little afraid of the Moabites. But our real concern today is the Edomites and Philistines. The Edomites and the Philistines do the most damage to the church life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Tyrus and Zidon</H2><P>Tyrus typifies people who are seeking worldly wealth. They are seeking to be rich and to make money. They will sacrifice everything related to the Lord for the sake of their business. They do not care for the Lord's interests; they only care for their wealth, their riches, and their business. People of Tyrus may be found among unbelievers and also among believers. Some of your relatives, your cousins, your in-laws, your classmates, and your friends are people of Tyrus. If you talk to them concerning the church, the Lord's testimony, or Christ, they cannot understand what you are talking about. They only want to know if this will help them make a better living and help them become richer or get a higher degree or a higher position. Many of the Jewish people today are endeavoring for these two things: position and wealth. One Jewish person told me it is better to have both a degree and wealth. These are the people of Tyrus. Some real Christians are also people of Tyrus. When you speak to them concerning the Lord's recovery, they think you are foolish. They think you spend too much time going to the meetings, too much time fellowshipping, and too much time reading the Bible. They think you do not care enough for your degree, for your business, and for your money. This means they also are people of Tyrus.</P><P>Tyrus said Jerusalem was going to fall. They were happy that Jerusalem was going to fall (26:2). All the people who are seeking the world's wealth would be happy to see the church terminated. They would be happy if the meeting hall doors were permanently closed. They would tell you that you are wasting your time going to the meetings. Perhaps even among the local churches today, there are some with this attitude who attend the meetings. They feel they need to study and get a higher degree and that they need to make more money. They do not care for the church or the Lord's interest. They only care for riches, for wealth, for a position, and for their business. When they hear of some who backslide, they are happy.</P><P>Along with Tyrus is Zidon. Ezekiel says that Zidon was a pricking brier and a grieving thorn to the house of Israel (28:24). After Tyrus comes Zidon, the brier that pricks and grieves. In Matthew 13:22 Jesus said that the deceitfulness of riches and the cares of this world are like thorns which choke the growth of life. If Tyrus is present, Zidon is close by. If many among the saints are of Tyrus, many of Zidon will also come out. This means if the saints are loving the world and riches, they will become briers. Many Christians today have simply become briers and thorns which prick and grieve and damage the church life.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Visions of Ezekiel &nbsp; pg 43</div><br></body></html>
