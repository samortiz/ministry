   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then Jehovah said to me, Go again, love a woman who is loved by her companion yet who is an adulteress, even as Jehovah has loved the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes v. 1 .

   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God told Hosea to love Gomer again as a symbol of His intention to love Israel again.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today Israel is a Gomer, but the day is coming when God will restore her to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This restoration will be the result of the manifestation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once again I would emphasize the fact that in the prophetic books four things are covered repeatedly: God s chastisement on the Jews, God s punishment upon the nations, the manifestation of Christ, and the restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God s chastisement and punishment will issue in the manifestation of Christ, and the manifestation of Christ will bring in the age of restoration, the millennial kingdom, which ushers the old and ruined universe into the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we see these four things, we will see what a hope we have in Christ.</S>
