THE PROPHETS DURING THE RETURN</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Kingship Not Being Recovered</h2><p>The kingship which God established among the people of Israel due to the deterioration of the priesthood was completely destroyed at the time of their captivity. After their return from the land of captivity to their homeland through God&rsquo;s visitation, the kingship was still not recovered, for they remained under the rule of the Gentiles.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Zerubbabel the Governor<br />and<br />Joshua the High Priest</h2><p>The people of Israel who returned after the proclamation was made in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia were led by Zerubbabel, Joshua, and others (Ezra 1:1-5; 2:1-2). Their number was forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty. Besides these, there were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven servants and maids, and two hundred singing men and women (Ezra 2:64-65). Zerubbabel, a descendent of the royal house of David and the son of Salathiel (Matt. 1:12), ruled over the people of Israel as the governor of Judah appointed by the Gentile nation of Persia. Joshua (that is, Jeshua), the son of Josedech, served as the high priest taking care of the matters pertaining to the worship of God (Hag. 1:1). Both of their ministries were for the rebuilding of the holy temple.</p><p>In the seventh month of the same year the children of Israel returned to the land of Judah and gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem. They built and set the altar of God upon its original foundation, they offered sacrifices to God, and they kept the feast of tabernacles (Ezra 3:1-4). In the second month of the following year, they set forward the work of building the house of God (Ezra 3:8). When the builders laid the foundation of the temple, the priests stood in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise Jehovah according to the ordinance of David. All the people shouted with a great shout when they praised God. However, many of the priests and Levites and heads of the fathers&rsquo; houses, the old men who had seen the first house, wept with a loud voice when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, while many shouted aloud for joy (Ezra 3:10-13).</p><p>At that time the enemies of Judah and Benjamin asked that they be allowed to participate in the building work, but they were refused by Zerubbabel and Joshua with stern words. Thus, moved to anger in their shame, they did their best to carry out the damaging work, and they also wrote to the king accusing the returned Israelites of rebellion. Hence, King Artaxerxes (Smerdis) commanded that the building of the temple be stopped. So the work ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius, king of Persia (Ezra 4). The prophets Haggai and Zechariah prophesied in the name of God and spoke words of encouragement to the people in Judah and Jerusalem. Then Zerubbabel and Joshua rose up and began to build the house of God (Ezra 5:1-2). When the house was finished on the third day of the month Adar (the twelfth month), which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king, they kept the dedication of the house of God with joy and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month (Ezra 6:14-21).</p><h2 class="head2">C. Haggai</h2><p>During the years when the rebuilding of the holy temple was interrupted, the children of Israel began to build beautiful houses for themselves and gradually forgot the building of the holy temple. Furthermore, the enemy&rsquo;s opposition and hindrance steadily increased, and desolation and drought continued to plague the land. Therefore, the people of Israel concluded that the time to build the house of Jehovah had not yet come (Hag. 1:2, 4, 6, 10). It was under such a circumstance that the prophets Haggai and Zechariah rose up to deliver the word of God and encourage the returned Israelites to finish the rebuilding work of God&rsquo;s holy temple.</p><p>The word of God came to Haggai the prophet, saying, &ldquo;Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled houses, and this house lie waste?...Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages, earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes. Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Consider your ways. Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the Lord&rdquo; (Hag. 1:4, 6-8). God reprimanded the people through Haggai, telling them to consider their ways because of the disasters and miseries that had come upon them, and to not let the house lie waste, but to go up to the mountain, bring wood, and build God&rsquo;s house. So, Zerubbabel the son of Salathiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of Jehovah their God (Hag. 1:12).</p><p>Then God spoke through Haggai the prophet to encourage the people to be strong and work for the completion of the rebuilding of God&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the Lord; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the Lord, and work: for I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts&rdquo; (Hag. 2:4).</p><h2 class="head2">D. Zechariah</h2><h2 class="head3">1. His Status and Time</h2><p>Zechariah the prophet was the son of Berechiah and the grandson of Iddo (Zech. 1:1). Born in the land of captivity, he came back with Zerubbabel to the homeland. As Iddo was one among the first group of priests who returned to Israel (Neh. 12:1, 4, 16), Zechariah was both a prophet and a priest. A contemporary of Haggai, Zechariah began to prophesy approximately two months later than Haggai (compare Zech. 1:1 with Hag. 1:1), and his writings are much longer and their contents more mysterious than Haggai&rsquo;s.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Strengthening the Rebuilding Work<br />of the Holy Temple by Foretelling Its Success</h2><p>In order that Zechariah might strengthen the rebuilding work of the holy temple by foretelling its success, God gave him a series of eight visions in the beginning of the prophecies in his book.</p><p>The first vision was of a man riding upon a red horse and standing among the myrtle trees (the people of Israel) that were in the bottom (the land of captivity) (1:7-17). The one riding on a red horse denotes the angel of Jehovah, that is, Christ. The angel stood in the bottom, where God&rsquo;s people were kept in captivity, staying with them and interceding for their return. God answered that He was jealous for Jerusalem with a great jealousy, and He was very displeased with the nations which helped forward the affliction; He would grant mercies that His house might be rebuilt and a line stretched upon Jerusalem.</p><p>The second vision was of the four horns and four carpenters (1:18-21). The four horns denote the enemies who oppressed and scattered Israel, and the four carpenters signify the tools used by God to smite the enemies of Israel.</p><p>Zechariah&rsquo;s third vision was of a man with a measuring line in his hand to measure Jerusalem (2:1-13). After dealing with the enemies of Israel, God again visited the holy land. A measuring line is for measuring the land, signifying that God would measure and choose Jerusalem and dwell in its midst. Jehovah who visited Israel is Christ. Christ is the One sent by Jehovah, and He is also Jehovah who sent Him. He is both the sent One and the Sender.</p><p>Fourth, Zechariah saw a vision of Joshua being stripped of his filthy garments and clothed with festival-robes (3:1-10). Joshua the high priest typifies the people of Israel as a kingdom of priests. In order to make the people of Israel a kingdom of priests unto Him, God first had to remove their filthiness. Therefore, God raised up Christ as the Sprout of life and the stone with God&rsquo;s seven Spirits (seven eyes&mdash;4:10; Rev. 5:6), and judged (engraved on) Him on the cross that He might remove the iniquity of Israel. The Sprout of life, Christ, who is filled with God&rsquo;s Spirit, also became the festival-robes to clothe them as their righteousness that they might live in God&rsquo;s presence.</p><p>Fifth, Zechariah saw a golden lampstand and the two olive trees (4:1-14). The golden lampstand signifies the purged Israel as a shining vessel among the nations. The shining oil in the vessel is the Spirit of Jehovah. The two olive trees, on the one hand, signify Joshua and Zerubbabel building the holy temple and recovering God&rsquo;s testimony by the Spirit of Jehovah; on the other hand, they denote the two witnesses in Revelation 11 preaching the word by being filled with the Spirit. For the building of God&rsquo;s holy temple, there is the need of a topstone. In the previous vision Christ was the stone for removing the iniquity of God&rsquo;s people; in this vision Christ is the stone for the building of God&rsquo;s holy temple.</p><p>Zechariah&rsquo;s sixth vision was of the flying roll (5:1-4). This denotes God&rsquo;s law and righteousness. Zechariah 5:3 says, &ldquo;Every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it.&rdquo; Stealing and perjury are two representative sins. The former is an offense against man; the latter, against God. This indicates that God wants to cleanse His people.</p><p>The seventh vision was of the ephah (5:5-11), An ephah is a commercial instrument, indicating that there were still Babylonian things among the returned people. When the people of Israel returned from Babylon, they also brought Babylonian things back with them. All these things must be sent back to Babylon (the land of Shinar is Babylon).</p><p>The eighth vision was of the four chariots (6:1-15). These four chariots that came out from between the mountains of brass refer to the four winds of heaven, which are also the four winds in Revelation 7:1-3. They are specifically for the judgment (signified by the mountains of brass) of the evils of the nations. This judgment will cause the nations to come and build God&rsquo;s temple (v. 15). Christ as the Sprout was raised up also for the building of God&rsquo;s temple (vv. 12-13).</p><p>All eight visions are prophecies concerning the children of Israel as God&rsquo;s people. The initial fulfillment of these prophecies took place during the time of Zechariah, but their complete fulfillment is yet to come. The visions as a whole speak of the importance of Christ in the recovery of God&rsquo;s building.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Prophesying of the Various Aspects<br />of the Two Comings of Christ</h2><p>Besides telling of the importance of Christ in relation to God&rsquo;s rebuilding work in the preceding eight visions, Zechariah also prophesied of the various aspects of the two comings of Christ in chapters nine through fourteen of his book. In His first coming, Christ would come as the King of Israel, meek and mounted on a colt, the foal of a donkey (9:9; Matt. 21:1-10); eventually He would be betrayed by one of His disciples for thirty pieces of silver (11:12-13; Matt 26:14-16; 27:3-10). He also would be smitten as the shepherd, and His disciples would be scattered as sheep (13:7; Matt. 26:31). His two hands would be wounded on the cross in the house of Israel (the house of the friends who loved Him) (13:6; John 19:18a), and His side would be pierced (12:10; John 19:34a), opening a fountain for the children of Israel for sin and for uncleanness (13:1; John 19:34b; Matt. 26:28). Furthermore, He will come a second time, accompanied by His saints (14:5; 1 Thes. 4:16a, 14b), and His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives which is outside of Jerusalem (14:4; Acts 1:9-12). He will fight for the children of Israel, His chosen people, against the nations that besieged them and will save them from destruction (14:2-3, 12-15; 12:1-9). At that time, the whole house of Israel will look upon Him whom they have pierced, and they will mourn for Him; thus, all Israel will be saved (12:10-14; Rom. 11:26). Afterwards, He will be the King to reign and rule over the nations; all the people will go up to Jerusalem from year to year to worship Him, and all will be sanctified unto Him (9:10; 14:16-21).</p><h2 class="head2">E. Nehemiah the Governor and Ezra the Priest</h2><p>There were three returnings of the children of Israel from the land of captivity. The first return was led by Zerubbabel (Ezra 2:2), the second return by Ezra (Ezra 7:1, 6-7), and the third return by Nehemiah (Neh. 2:5-6).</p><p>Nehemiah was the king&rsquo;s cupbearer. When he heard that those who had returned from the captivity were in great affliction and reproach, and that the wall of Jerusalem also was broken down and its gates were burned with fire, he wept, fasting and praying before God. In the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes I (not the same King Artaxerxes who stopped the people of Israel from rebuilding the holy temple), Nehemiah was granted permission by the king to return to Jerusalem for the rebuilding of its walls (Neh. 2:1-6, 17). He was appointed to be the governor in the land of Judah (Neh. 5:14). Ezra was a lineal descendant of Aaron the high priest; hence, he was a priest. He was also a ready scribe in the law of Moses which God had given. In the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes I, Ezra obtained permission from the king to lead the people of Israel up to Jerusalem. He had set his heart to study the law of God, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances (Ezra 7:1-10).</p><p>Nehemiah, ordered by the king of Persia, went back to Jerusalem to govern the people of Israel, and he encouraged the returned ones to continue and to complete the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem, that they may no longer be a reproach. So they strengthened their hands for this good work (Neh. 2:17-18). They were each assigned to rebuild a section of the wall. The enemies, led by Sanballat and Tobiah, were at first very angry, and they mocked the people of God. Then they caused a disturbance among them and sought to harm and bring false accusation against Nehemiah. However, the people, under Nehemiah&rsquo;s leadership, rebuilt the walls with one hand doing the work and the other hand holding a weapon. They were also encouraged by him not to fear their enemies (Neh. 4:14-20). Because the nobles and the rulers of Israel exacted usury from the people, the people were poverty-stricken and there was a great cry among them. So Nehemiah rebuked the nobles and the rulers, urging them to redeem their brothers and stop the usury (Neh. 5:1-11). Moreover, although he was the governor, Nehemiah had not eaten the bread of the governor that he might not increase the burden of the people. Rather, one hundred fifty people ate at his table daily (Neh. 5:14-17). The rebuilding of the wall from the start to the completion took fifty-two days (Neh. 6:15).</p><p>At that time, Ezra joined in to recover the things pertaining to the worship of God contained in the book of the law. All the people gathered themselves together as one man into the broad place that was before the water gate, and they asked Ezra to bring the book of the law of Moses which God had commanded to Israel. Then Ezra brought the law and read it before the congregation, those who could hear with understanding (Neh. 8:1-3). Furthermore, in accordance with God&rsquo;s commandment, the people dwelt in booths in the feast of the seventh month (Neh. 8:13-17). They also recovered the Sabbath (Neh. 13:15-22). Both Nehemiah and Ezra strictly forbade the people to marry foreign wives, and they also repented and confessed to God for such practices of the people (Neh. 13:23-31; Ezra 9&mdash;10).</p><h2 class="head2">F. Malachi</h2><h2 class="head3">1. His Status and Time</h2><p>Malachi was the most hidden among the prophets, because aside from his name, there is no record of his status or genealogy. The books of Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, and Zechariah do not once mention his name. According to his own writing, Malachi might be a prophet at the time of Nehemiah. During that time, first, the holy temple had been rebuilt and the offering of sacrifices had been restored (Mal. 1:6-10); second, the zeal of the priests had gradually grown cold in the service of God (compare Mal. 1:6 with Neh. 13:4); third, the people had neglected to bring their tithes to the storehouse (compare Mal. 3:8 with Neh. 13:10-12); fourth, the people had married heathen wives (compare Mal. 2:11 with Neh. 13:23-25); and fifth, the initial fulfillment of the prophecy in Malachi 3:1-5 probably refers to Malachi and Nehemiah initially. Verses 1 and 2 say, &ldquo;Behold, I will send Malachi [meaning &ldquo;my messenger&rdquo; and typifying John the Baptist and Elijah], and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple...But who may abide the day of his coming?&rdquo; Malachi spoke for God during Nehemiah&rsquo;s absence from Jerusalem, thus paving the way for the work of rearrangement to be carried out upon his return. When Nehemiah came back, he unexpectedly cast all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber of God&rsquo;s house and thus cleansed the temple. His action fulfilled the word quoted above. Malachi might also be the last prophet during the rebuilding of the holy temple and the holy city.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Rebuking and Admonishing<br />the People of Israel for Their Evils<br />after the Rebuilding<br />of the Holy Temple and the Holy City</h2><p>Malachi rebuked and admonished the people of Israel for their evils after the rebuilding of the holy temple and the holy city. He rebuked the priests for despising the name of God and for offering polluted bread upon the altar (Mal. 1:6-14), thus departing out of the way (2:1-9). He also rebuked the people for dealing treacherously against their brothers (2:10); for marrying heathen wives, even dealing treacherously against the wives of their youth (2:11-17); for robbing God in tithes and offerings (3:7-11); and for speaking against God (3:13-15).</p><h2 class="head3">3. Foretelling the Coming of<br />Elijah the Prophet and John the Baptist</h2><p>Malachi 4:5-6 contains the prophecy concerning the coming of Elijah the prophet: &ldquo;Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.&rdquo; This refers to one of the two witnesses in Revelation 11:3-12 who, before the restoration of Israel, that is, three and a half years before the Lord&rsquo;s coming back to the earth, will prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, testifying for God (Matt. 17:11). This prophecy also refers to the coming of John the Baptist at the beginning of the New Testament to prepare the hearts of the people for the Lord Jesus (Luke 1:16-17; Matt. 17:12-13).</p><h2 class="head3">4. Foretelling the Second Coming of Christ</h2><p>Malachi 4:2 is a prophecy concerning the second coming of Christ: &ldquo;But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings.&rdquo; In His second coming the Lord will no longer come in a lowly manner as He did in His first coming. Rather, He will be as the rising sun, and the world will behold His glory; moreover, He will heal the remnant of the people of Israel.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>After the people of Israel returned to the holy land from the land of captivity, they did not have kings but had only the governor of Judah who was appointed by the king of Persia to rule over them. First there was Zerubbabel, a descendent of the royal house of David, assisted by Joshua as the high priest, for the rebuilding of God&rsquo;s temple; later there was Nehemiah, joined by Ezra the scribe as the priest, for the restoration of the holy city Jerusalem. During the time of Zerubbabel and Joshua, there were the prophets Haggai and Zechariah who fulfilled the prophetic duties by speaking for God and encouraging the people to finish the rebuilding of God&rsquo;s temple. During the time of Nehemiah and Ezra the scribe, there was Malachi the prophet speaking for God and instructing the people. Zechariah, in his speaking for God, spoke concerning the importance of Christ in relation to the recovery of God&rsquo;s building, and he also prophesied concerning the two comings of Christ. Malachi, in his speaking for God, prophesied concerning the coming of John the Baptist and Elijah, and he also spoke of the second coming of Christ in glory.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>According to the biblical record, how many returns were there of the people of Israel from the land of captivity?

THE FUNCTION OF THE PROPHETS</h2><p>Prophets are God&rsquo;s spokesmen. They speak for God and speak forth God; sometimes they also predict. According to the Bible, the main function of a prophet is not to predict the things to come but to speak for God. For example, in Exodus 3 and 4 when Moses was called by God, he told God that he was slow of speech and of a slow tongue (4:10). So God gave Aaron to Moses to be his prophet (4:14-16; 7:1). Aaron did not predict for Moses; rather, he spoke for him. In the whole Bible, to prophesy is mainly to speak for God and to speak forth God; sometimes it is also to predict. To predict, however, is secondary. This is the proper meaning of prophesying in the Bible.</p><p>A prophet is also called a seer. First Samuel 9:9 says, &ldquo;Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE PROPHETS<br />BEFORE THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS</h2><p>The prophets before the age of the prophets were Abraham, Moses, Samuel, David, and the Gentile prophet Balaam.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Abraham</h2><p>Abraham was a prophet of God. According to the record in Genesis 20, when Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah, God intervened and said to him, &ldquo;Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine&rdquo; (v. 7). And Abimelech restored Sarah to Abraham. So Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maidservants, so that they bore children (vv. 14, 17). Here God used Abraham as His spokesman.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Moses</h2><p>Moses was also a prophet of God. Deuteronomy 18:15 says, &ldquo;The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken.&rdquo; As a prophet, Moses typified Christ (Acts 3:22-23). He was used by God to lead the children of Israel out of Pharaoh&rsquo;s usurpation and Egypt&rsquo;s tyranny; he further led them to Mount Sinai to serve and to offer sacrifices to God, to build the tabernacle, and to go through the trials in the wilderness. During those forty years, Moses served as God&rsquo;s spokesman, speaking for God, speaking forth God, and predicting. He predicted that the children of Israel would forsake God and be cast by God into all the nations, but that when they would repent and turn to God, He would gather them from the nations (Deut. 29:25-28; 30:1, 3). He also typified Christ as the Apostle sent by God for His people (Heb. 3:1-2).</p><h2 class="head2">C. Samuel</h2><p>Samuel was also a prophet of God. First Samuel 3:19-21 says, &ldquo;And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord. And the Lord appeared again in Shiloh: for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord.&rdquo; God established Samuel as a prophet to speak for Him. God prophesied through him that the house of Eli would deteriorate (1 Sam. 3:12-14) and that a man after God&rsquo;s heart would succeed Saul to the throne (1 Sam. 13:13-14).</p><p>Formerly, the priests occupied an important position, because the people needed to go through the priests when they served and drew near to God. But from the time that God established Samuel as the prophet, and after the death of the priest Eli, the priests no longer occupied the position of importance. At that time, when the people or the kings wanted to know God&rsquo;s desire, they had to go through the prophets.</p><h2 class="head2">D. David</h2><p>David was a king and a prophet as well (Acts 2:29-30). The Spirit of Jehovah spoke by him, and His word was in his tongue (2 Sam. 23:2). In his psalms he prophesied that from the beginning Christ was God (Psa. 110:1; Matt. 22:43-44) who became a man (Psa. 8:4-5; Heb. 2:6-9). He came into the world that He might do the will of God (referring especially to the replacement of all the sacrifices) (Psa. 40:6-8; Heb. 10:5-9). He trusted in God (Psa. 18:2; Heb. 2:13). He loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore, God anointed Him with the oil of exultant joy above His partners (Psa. 45:7; Heb. 1:9). He was hurt by one of His disciples (Psa. 41:9; John 13:18). On the cross He was rejected by God for our sins, His hands and feet were pierced, and He suffered the pain of death (Psa. 22:1, 14-17; Matt. 27:46); yet not one of His bones was broken (Psa. 34:20; John 19:36). The soldiers divided His garments among themselves, and for His clothing they cast lots (Psa. 22:18; John 19:23-24). While He was dying on the cross He thirsted (Psa. 69:21; John 19:28). God would not leave His soul in Hades, nor would He permit His flesh to see corruption; rather, God raised Him up, made Him ascend before God, and seated Him at God&rsquo;s right hand (Psa. 16:8-11; 110:1; Acts 2:25-35). In resurrection He (with His human nature) was born of God (to become God&rsquo;s Firstborn) (Psa. 2:7; Acts 13:32-35). After resurrection, He declares the Father&rsquo;s name to His brothers (disciples); in the midst of the church He sings praise to the Father (Psa. 22:22; Heb. 2:12). Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men (Psa. 68:18; Eph. 4:8). In ascension He was made a Priest forever according to the order of Melchisedec (Psa. 110:4; Heb. 5:5-6, 10). Now He is sitting in the heavens, waiting for God to make His enemies His footstool (Psa. 110:1; Heb. 10:12-13; 1 Cor. 15:25). At His coming back, all the angels of God shall worship Him (Psa. 97:7; Heb. 1:6). His throne is forever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of His kingdom (Psa. 45:6; Heb. 1:8). In the beginning He was the Lord who created the heavens and the earth; the heavens and the earth shall perish and be changed, but He shall remain forever and not be changed, and His years shall not fail (Psa. 102:25-27; Heb. 1:10-12).</p><h2 class="head2">E. The Gentile Prophet Balaam</h2><p>Balaam was a prophet from Pethor, which was by the river, who was hired by Balak, the king of the Moabites, to curse the children of Israel (Num. 22:4-6). Inspired by the Spirit of God, however, he blessed Israel instead, saying, &ldquo;He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel&rdquo; (Num. 23:18-21). Again, he said, &ldquo;How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!&rdquo; (Num. 24:2-7). He also predicted that Christ would come as a Star out of Jacob and as a Scepter rising out of Israel, and that He would have dominion (Num. 24:17, 19; Matt. 2:2). Because he loved the wages of unrighteousness, he forsook the straight way and fell into error (2 Pet. 2:15; Jude 11).</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE PROPHETS<br />DURING THE AGE OF THE PROPHETS</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Raising Up of the Prophethood</h2><p>In the Old Testament there was first the priesthood. After the desolation and failure of the priesthood, God raised up the kingship, and after the failure of the kingship, God raised up the prophethood. The prophets were a support to the kings. God&rsquo;s original intention was to make the whole nation of Israel a kingdom of priests (Exo. 19:6). Because of the failure of the children of Israel in that they worshipped the golden calf at the foot of Mount Sinai (Exo. 32:1-24), God chose the tribe of Levi to replace the children of Israel as His priests (Exo. 32:25-26; Deut. 33:8-10). However, it was not the whole tribe of Levi but only the house of Aaron that was chosen to be the priests. When the tabernacle was set up at Mount Sinai, Aaron and his two sons were anointed and consecrated for the priestly service (Lev. 8). However, at the time of the two sons of Eli, the ordained priesthood of Aaron&rsquo;s house became completely degraded (1 Sam. 2:12-17). God therefore raised up the prophet Samuel to anoint Saul and David (1 Sam. 10:1; 16:13), thus bringing in the kingship.</p><p>When the kingship failed, there was the need of the prophethood for correction, adjustment, and restoration. When David killed Uriah, took his wife, and thus sinned against God, God sent the prophet Nathan to rebuke him for his evil deed (2 Sam. 12:1-25). During the degradation of the people of Israel, there was no proper king or priest. Therefore, God called Elijah and Elisha to function as prophets. When the priests failed and the kings were ruined, the prophets were then raised up as a support to the priests and kings.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Prophets Who Did Not Leave<br />Any Prophetic Writings</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Gad</h2><p>When David was fleeing and wandering, the prophet Gad advised him not to abide in the stronghold but to go into the land of Judah (1 Sam. 22:5). When David sinned against God by numbering the people, the word of God came to Gad who then told David that God offered him three calamities, and that he must choose one that God might do it to him. After the three days&rsquo; pestilence had passed, Gad came to see David and told him to go up and build an altar unto Jehovah in the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. And David built there an altar unto God and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings; thus the plague was stayed from Israel (2 Sam. 24).</p><h2 class="head3">2. Nathan</h2><p>The word of God came to Nathan the prophet when David the king set his heart to build a house for God. Nathan told King David that God would make a house for him and would set up his seed after him; his seed would build a house for God&rsquo;s name, and God would establish the throne of his kingdom forever (2 Sam. 7:1-17). This prophecy was first fulfilled for a time in Solomon and then completely fulfilled in Christ (Luke 1:32-33). When David sinned, God sent Nathan to rebuke him of his sin, telling him that God would raise up evil against him out of his own house and that the sword would never depart from his house (2 Sam. 12:1-15). When David begot Solomon through Bathsheba, God sent word through Nathan and named Solomon &ldquo;Jedidiah&rdquo; (meaning &ldquo;beloved of Jehovah&rdquo;), because God loved him (2 Sam. 12:24-25). When David was old and stricken in years, Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself and plotted to usurp the throne. Nathan and Bathsheba devised a plan which caused David to swear that Solomon would be the king and thus foiled the scheme of Adonijah (1 Kings 1).</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Old Prophet</h2><p>First Kings 13 records the story of an old prophet. The agedness of the old prophet does not mean that he was spiritually experienced, but that he was already old, aged, and useless in the hands of God. When God wanted to speak to Jeroboam, He could only use the man of God, not the old prophet.</p><p>Furthermore, the old prophet also used his title to deceive people. He had already lost fellowship with God, yet he made false claims saying that an angel had spoken to him by the word of Jehovah. It was when they were sitting at the table that the word of Jehovah came to the old prophet. This does not mean that the old prophet had become spiritual, but rather that God was going to deal with the man of God who had disobeyed His commandment. God had put no demand upon the old prophet and had put him aside. The old prophet was just waiting to die (1 Kings 13:31).</p><h2 class="head3">4. Ahijah</h2><p>Solomon followed his foreign wives to worship idols and did evil in the eyes of God. Hence, God was angry with Solomon and decided to rend the kingdom from him and give it to his servant Jeroboam. One day when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way. Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him and rent it in twelve pieces, and he told Jeroboam to take ten pieces because God would rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and would give ten tribes to him. Thus, God predicted through Ahijah that the kingdom would become divided (1 Kings 11:29-39).</p><p>When Jeroboam became king, because of his ambition, he built the high places and set up another center of worship, thus creating division and provoking God to anger. God prophesied again through Ahijah, saying, &ldquo;I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every man-child, him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweepeth away dung, till it be all gone&rdquo; (1 Kings 14:1-18, ASV).</p><h2 class="head3">5. Elijah</h2><p>Elijah means &ldquo;my God Jehovah.&rdquo; During the time when King Ahab and the people were worshipping Baal, Elijah was a strong witness of God and a man of prayer as well (James 5:17). He prayed for heaven not to send the rain, for the widow&rsquo;s son to be made alive, for fire to fall from heaven to consume the burnt offering, for heaven to send the rain (1 Kings 17&mdash;18), and for fire to come down from heaven to consume the captains with their soldiers sent by King Ahaziah (2 Kings 1). All these prayers were answered by God.</p><p>Nevertheless, Elijah also had his failure. On Mount Carmel, he proved that Jehovah was God and Baal was a false god; he also destroyed the prophets of Baal. Yet, because of Jezebel&rsquo;s threatening words, he fled to the land of Judah and sat down under a juniper tree, requesting for himself that he might die. God was going to use him greatly, yet he went into hiding because he feared for his life. In Romans 11:2-4 Paul says that Elijah pleaded with God against Israel, saying, &ldquo;Lord, they have killed Your prophets, they have torn down Your altars, and I am left alone, and they seek my life.&rdquo; But God answered, &ldquo;I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.&rdquo; Thus, Elijah&rsquo;s weakness also manifested the grace of God&rsquo;s selection. He was still an overcoming prophet who was eventually taken up by God (2 Kings 2:11).</p><h2 class="head3">6. Elisha</h2><p>Elisha means &ldquo;Jehovah is the Savior.&rdquo; Elisha was the continuation of Elijah to be a prophet in the kingdom of Israel. In Luke 4:27 the Lord Jesus testified that Elisha healed a Gentile with his gift of healing. He even healed the bad water and made it living water (2 Kings 2:19-22).</p><h2 class="head3">7. Micaiah</h2><p>Jehoshaphat the king of Judah and Ahab the king of Israel were planning to battle with the king of Syria, that they might take Ramoth-gilead out of his hand (1 Kings 22:1-4). When they inquired of God about this matter, all the prophets spoke lies with one mouth. The prophet Micaiah alone prophesied for God and was thus put into the prison. King Ahab, however, died in the battle as prophesied by Micaiah (1 Kings 22:19-22, 29-35).</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Prophets Who Wrote the Books<br />of the Major Prophets</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Isaiah</h2><p>Isaiah means &ldquo;Jehovah saves.&rdquo; Isaiah the son of Amoz (Isa. 1:1) was a contemporary of Amos and Hosea, the prophets in the kingdom of Israel, and of Micah, the prophet in the kingdom of Judah. His prophetic ministry lasted the longest; he prophesied under the reigns of four kings: Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah (1:1). His wife was a prophetess (8:3), and he had at least two sons: Shear-jashub (meaning, &ldquo;a remnant shall return&rdquo;) and Maher-shalal-hash-baz (meaning &ldquo;quickly the spoil, hasting the prey&rdquo;) (7:3; 8:3). He was a historian (2 Chron. 26:22; 32:32). According to a credible tradition among the Jews and some rabbinic writings of the second century, he suffered martyrdom during the reign of Manasseh (2 Kings 21:16; 24:4; cf. Acts 7:52) by being sawn asunder. Hebrews 2:13b shows that he (Isaiah) and the children whom God gave to him (Isa. 8:18) typify Christ and the believers whom God gave to Him.</p><p>The book of Isaiah speaks concerning salvation in such great detail that some have even called it the Gospel of Isaiah. In it are found prophecies concerning Christ: (a) His birth&mdash; God becoming a man (7:14; 9:6); (b) His genealogy&mdash;a descendant of Jesse (11:1); (c) His name&mdash;Emmanuel, Wonderful, Counselor, (a child being called) the mighty God, (a son being called) the everlasting Father, the Prince of peace, Jehovah&rsquo;s Servant (7:14; 9:6; 42:19); (d) His living&mdash;as a root out of a dry ground, having no form nor comeliness, His image being marred more than any man, and His form more than the sons of men, being despised and rejected of men, being a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief (52:14; 53:2-3); (e) His being anointed&mdash;being filled with the Spirit of God (61:1; 11:2); (f) His work&mdash;preaching good tidings and proclaiming God&rsquo;s jubilee (61:1-3); (g) His dealings with man&mdash;not crying nor lifting up His voice, not breaking a bruised reed, and not quenching the smoking flax (42:1-4); (h) His death&mdash;having borne our griefs and carried our sorrows, being wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities (53:4a-10); (i) His burial&mdash;making His grave with the rich (53:9a); (j) His resurrection&mdash;swallowing up death, prolonging His days, justifying many (25:8a; 53:10b-11); (k) His coming back&mdash;rending the heavens and coming down, judging the people (64:1; 63:1-6); (l) His reign&mdash;in the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6) reigning in righteousness, all peoples enjoying peace, and all creation living in harmony (9:7; 11:3-16; 32:1; 33:17-24); (m) His kingdom&mdash;being exalted above all the nations and all peoples flowing to it (2:2-4; 35:1-10; Micah 4:1-3), bringing in the new heaven and new earth (65:17; 66:22). Isaiah also prophesied that Christ, who became a man, was a sure foundation stone and a precious cornerstone laid by God for His building and trusted in by His believers (28:16), and that He would &ldquo;be as a hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land&rdquo; (32:2).</p><h2 class="head3">2. Jeremiah</h2><p>Jeremiah means &ldquo;Jehovah exalts&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah throws down.&rdquo; Jeremiah&rsquo;s whole life was a testimony of the meaning implied in his name. People despised and rejected Jeremiah, regarding him not as a priest, much less a prophet; they treated him like a criminal and like a traitor. God, however, lifted him up (Jer. 1:5, 10). On the other hand, the kings and people of Israel committed sins and wickednesses, worshipped idols and rejected God&rsquo;s word, and were extremely unrestrained. So God threw them down. Jeremiah prophesied that Christ was a righteous sprout which God would raise up for David, and that (at His coming again) He would reign and would execute judgment and justice in the earth, that the whole race of Israel would be saved, and that His name would be called Jehovah our righteousness (Jer. 23:5-7; 33:15-16). He also prophesied that God would make a new covenant with His people, according to which He would put His law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts; He would be their God, and they would be His people. They would know Him, from the least to the greatest of them. He would forgive their iniquities and would remember their sins no more (Jer. 31:31-34; Heb. 8:8-12). For the rest concerning Jeremiah and his prophecies, see Lesson Twelve in volume one.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Ezekiel</h2><p>Ezekiel, the son of Buzi, was a priest (Ezek. 1:3). His name means &ldquo;God strengthens&rdquo; or &ldquo;God is the strength.&rdquo; He sternly rebuked the leaders and people of Israel for turning away from God, worshipping idols, committing fornications, and doing all kinds of evil. He transmitted the word of God to the children of Israel who were in captivity (Ezek. 3:10-11); he continued and confirmed that which was spoken by Jeremiah (Jer. 29:1-14), earnestly telling them that before they could return to Jerusalem they needed to turn back to Jehovah their God. Although it was very difficult in the beginning and although he encountered great opposition (Ezek. 3:7-9), the people in captivity eventually detested the idols, turned their hearts to God, and were returned to their homeland after seventy years. This was mostly the result of the work of the prophet Ezekiel. For the rest concerning Ezekiel and his prophecies, see Lesson Twelve in volume one.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Daniel</h2><p>Daniel was of the children of Judah (Dan. 1:6). His name means &ldquo;God is the Judge&rdquo; or &ldquo;my God is the Judge.&rdquo; The testimony of the prophet Daniel is that his God is the Judge. The reason the kingdom of Judah fell and Daniel was taken captive to Babylon is that God is the Judge. He exercised self-control to keep himself undefiled and was not willing to go with the tide; he stood for God, even not caring for his own life, because God is the Judge. The dream and the writing which he interpreted before the king and the prophecies in his book also testify that God is the supreme Judge. He predicted that Christ would be cut off four hundred eighty-three years (that is, sixty-nine weeks) after the issuing of the decree to rebuild Jerusalem (Dan. 9:25-26); that He would receive the kingdom and come back (7:13-14); and that at His coming back He would be as a stone cut out without hands, which would become a great mountain (the kingdom) and would fill the whole earth (2:34-35). He also prophesied that in the future resurrection, some will receive eternal life and others will receive eternal punishment (Dan. 12:2; John 5:28-29); they who are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars forever and ever (Dan. 12:2-3; Matt. 13:43). For the rest concerning Daniel, see Lesson Twelve in volume one.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Prophets Who Wrote the Books<br />of the Minor Prophets</h2><p>The books of the so-called Minor Prophets are not called such to infer that the prophets were of a lower rank, or that the contents were of lesser importance, but because they were shorter books.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Hosea</h2><p>Hosea was the son of Beeri (Hosea 1:1). His name means &ldquo;salvation&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah is salvation.&rdquo; The prophecies in the book of Hosea were filled with salvation, especially Jehovah&rsquo;s salvation for the backsliding Israel. Hosea spoke for God as a prophet in the years of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the years of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. His contemporaries included the prophets Isaiah, Micah, and Amos. He predicted the escape of Christ to Egypt after His birth (Hosea 11:1; Matt. 2:15).</p><h2 class="head3">2. Joel</h2><p>Joel was the son of Pethuel (Joel 1:1). His name means &ldquo;Jehovah is God.&rdquo; Based upon the contents of the book of Joel, we can conclude that among the prophets who wrote books, Joel was one of the earliest. His ministry preceded that of Amos. He prophesied that the Holy Spirit would be poured out at Pentecost and that those who would call upon the Lord&rsquo;s name would be saved (2:28-32; Acts 2:16-21). He also prophesied that when Christ comes again, He will judge all the nations living on the earth (3:1-2; Matt. 25:31-46; Acts 17:31; 10:42).</p><h2 class="head3">3. Amos</h2><p>The prophet Amos was a native of Tekoa in the kingdom of Judah (Amos 1:1). Nevertheless, the place and main object of his ministry was the northern kingdom of Israel. He was a herdsman and a gatherer of sycamore fruit (7:14), lowly in the eyes of men. But God has chosen the weak of the world that He might shame the strong (1 Cor. 1:27). He chose a herdsman to be His prophet to warn Jeroboam, the son of Joash and the king of Israel, in the days of his great prosperity. Amos prophesied that when Christ comes again, the kingdom of Israel will be restored (Amos 9:11; Acts 15:16; 1:6).</p><h2 class="head3">4. Obadiah</h2><p>Obadiah means &ldquo;the servant of Jehovah.&rdquo; The book of Obadiah is the shortest book of the Old Testament, yet its content is very important. It pronounces the future and end of Edom, Israel&rsquo;s enemy for generations. In name the Edomites were Israel&rsquo;s brothers, but in reality they were Israel&rsquo;s archenemies, who were constantly trying to destroy God&rsquo;s chosen people. According to verses 11, 16, and 17-20, Obadiah ministered in Judah and addressed his prophecies to Judah.</p><h2 class="head3">5. Jonah</h2><p>The prophet Jonah, the son of Amittai, was of Gath-hepher (Jonah 1:1; 2 Kings 14:25). Jonah means &ldquo;a dove,&rdquo; signifying that God&rsquo;s commission to Jonah was to fly out like a dove to preach the gospel of peace.</p><p>Jonah typifies Christ in two aspects:</p><p>First, the death of Christ, as seen in Matthew 12:40: &ldquo;For as Jonah was in the belly of the sea monster three days and three nights, so shall the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.&rdquo;</p><p>Second, the ministry of Christ, as shown in Matthew 12:41: &ldquo;Behold, a greater than Jonah is here.&rdquo; Jonah was sent to Nineveh to preach the word of God; Christ was sent to the world as the Word of God (John 1:1). The Ninevites repented because they heard the preaching of the word of God; yet those during the time of the Lord Jesus would not repent, even though they had the very Word of God among them. Hence, the Ninevites will stand up in the judgment with that generation and will condemn it (Matt. 12:41).</p><h2 class="head3">6. Micah</h2><p>Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah (Micah 1:1). He was a contemporary of Isaiah, Hosea (Isa. 1:1; Hosea 1:1), and possibly Amos. His name means &ldquo;Who is like Jehovah?&rdquo; In his book he pointed out repeatedly the transcendence and incomparableness of God&rsquo;s holiness, righteousness, love, and mercy. At the end of his book, he said, &ldquo;Who is a God like unto thee...?&rdquo; (Micah 7:18). He prophesied concerning the birthplace of Christ when He became a man in time and the goings forth of His Godhead being from eternity (5:2), that He as the victorious Ruler would be the deliverance and peace of God&rsquo;s people (5:2-9), that His kingdom would be above all nations, and that the people would flow unto it (4:1-5), as also prophesied by Isaiah (Isa. 2:2-4).</p><h2 class="head3">7. Nahum</h2><p>Nahum was an Elkoshite (Nahum 1:1). God gave him the vision specifically concerning the Assyrian Empire and the destruction of its capital Nineveh. Although he was an Israelite, he prophesied in the kingdom of Judah. His name means &ldquo;consolation&rdquo; or &ldquo;revenge.&rdquo; His prophetic speakings were full of both consolation and revenge. Toward the oppressed people, God comforted them through the prophets; toward the cruel and violent Assyria, God made revenge.</p><p>Nahum prophesied in the reign of Hezekiah king of Judah. At that time Assyria was the strongest nation and the most cruel aggressor, and all the Near Eastern nations were afraid of her. Judah was especially afraid of her, and having seen the fall of the kingdom of Israel into the hands of Assyria (720 B.C.) and Egypt&rsquo;s defeat by Assyria (714 B.C., see Isa. 20), was constantly wary of this terrible enemy. Under this circumstance, Nahum rose up as a prophet to comfort God&rsquo;s people, telling them not to fear and predicting the soon coming of God&rsquo;s judgment upon Assyria.</p><h2 class="head3">8. Habakkuk</h2><p>Habakkuk means &ldquo;embraced&rdquo; or &ldquo;attached.&rdquo; When he had problems or when he sought for the interest of his fellow people, he embraced God and attached himself to God, asking questions repeatedly and not relaxing at all. The book of Habakkuk is very similar to the book of Nahum, both being concerned with God&rsquo;s judgment upon the enemies of God&rsquo;s people. The latter prophesied the end of Assyria, while the former predicted the end of Chaldea. Habakkuk also prophesied that the just shall live by his faith (Hab. 2:4; Rom. 1:17).</p><h2 class="head3">9. Zephaniah</h2><p>Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah (Zeph. 1:1), was a prince in the royal house of Judah. His name means &ldquo;Jehovah hides.&rdquo; A contemporary of Habakkuk and Jeremiah, Zephaniah prophesied in the days of Josiah, king of Judah. During his reign Josiah began to remove the idols but did not do it thoroughly; thus, some idols still remained. Therefore, Zephaniah spoke the word of God, saying, &ldquo;I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarim with the priests; and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops&rdquo; (1:4-5). He was in the imperial court assisting and guiding the young king Josiah to seek God. He prophesied that God would punish the nations, cause the people to call upon Him and serve Him, and bring restoration to the nation of Israel (3:8-20).</p><h2 class="head3">10. Haggai</h2><p>Haggai, who lived at the same time as Zechariah (Ezra 5:1), spoke for God in the second year of Darius the king. His name means &ldquo;my feasts&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah&rsquo;s feasts.&rdquo; This shows how much he longed for an early return to his homeland to restore God&rsquo;s feasts. For the rest concerning Haggai, see Lesson Thirteen in this volume.</p><h2 class="head3">11. Zechariah</h2><p>Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo (Zech. 1:1), was born in the land of captivity; he returned to the homeland with Zerubbabel. Iddo was one among the first group of priests to return (Neh. 12:4, 16); hence, Zechariah was both a prophet and a priest (Zech. 7:3-4), like Jeremiah and Ezekiel.</p><p>Iddo means &ldquo;an appointed time&rdquo;; Berechiah means &ldquo;blessed of Jehovah&rdquo;; Zechariah means &ldquo;remembered of Jehovah.&rdquo; These three names taken together mean &ldquo;at the appointed time Jehovah blesses and remembers.&rdquo; Surely, at an appointed day, God will bless and remember His people. For the rest concerning Zechariah, see Lesson Thirteen in this volume.</p><h2 class="head3">12. Malachi</h2><p>Malachi, whose name means &ldquo;my messenger,&rdquo; was the last of the prophets. His message terminated the age of law of the Old Testament and introduced the greatest messenger, the messenger of the covenant (Mal. 3:1), the Lord Jesus who gives grace. However, he could only introduce the Lord Jesus and could not bring Him in. Therefore, his concluding word was still on the curse (4:6), which was the terrible result of the age of law. For the rest concerning Malachi, see Lesson Thirteen in this volume.</p><p>Between the book of Malachi and the Gospel of Matthew there was a space and silence of about four centuries. Bible readers can see, however, that a wonderful connection and correspondence definitely exist between the two books. The things that were mentioned at the end of Malachi are also at the beginning of Matthew&mdash;the Messenger of the covenant and His forerunner (3:1; 4:2, 5; Matt. 1&mdash;3).</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>The function of the prophets is to speak for God. God&rsquo;s original intention was to have the whole house of Israel be a kingdom of priests, to have every one of them serving God as a priest. But because of the failure of Israel, God chose out of the tribe of Levi the house of Aaron to be His priests. Thus the priesthood commenced. When the priestly office of the house of Aaron deteriorated, God raised up the kingship, and thus the age of the kings began. When the kingship also deteriorated, God raised up the prophets to assist the kings and the priests. Thus the age of the prophets also started. The prophets supported the kings and priests, rebuked and guided the people of Israel, and spoke concerning the Gentile nations who ruled over the nation of Israel. In addition, in their speaking for God, they prophesied extensively concerning the coming Christ. The themes of their prophecies include His being the eternal God, His being both the Son and the Father, His being both the Angel of Jehovah and Jehovah who sent the Angel, and His being the Lord who created the heaven and the earth. Furthermore, they include: His becoming a man; His human living on earth; His being anointed by God; His being filled with the Spirit; His preaching the good news; His proclaiming the jubilee; and eventually His being betrayed; His being wounded on the cross; His bearing man&rsquo;s sin; His being buried with the rich; His resurrection to be the foundation stone and cornerstone set up by God that His disciples might become His brothers to be His church, in whose midst He sings praise to God; His being ascended to the height; His sitting at the right hand of God; His being designated by God as High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec; and His waiting for God to make His enemies His footstool. Finally, they include His receiving the kingdom and His coming back with His saints, His defeating the nations, His saving the whole house of Israel, the setting up of His kingdom which will fill the earth, His reigning as King over the nations, and His bringing about the restoration and harmony of all things, thus ushering in the new heaven and new earth.</p><h2 class="head1">NOTICE</h2><p>The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;All the things must be fulfilled which have been written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me&rdquo; (Luke 24:44; cf.

ANTIOCHUS EPIPHANES KING OF SYRIA</h2><p>The Israelites in captivity can be divided into two main groups. The majority were scattered among the nations from the times of the kingdoms of Babylon, Persia, Media, Greece, and the Roman Empire until the present day. They dwelt first in the neighboring nations and gradually moved to other parts of the world. They established themselves in their respective countries of residence, followed the local customs, and over time actually became native inhabitants of those lands. There was also the minority, the remnant, who after being taken captive remembered their old country. They were reluctant to give up their ancestry and way of life; even the more, they were unwilling to forsake the God whom they served and worshipped. Seventy years after the captivity, in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, the Israelites obtained permission to return to their homeland to rebuild the temple and to reinstate the offering of sacrifices. These events are recorded in the books of Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.</p><p>After they returned to their own country, they were under the rule of the Persian Empire for another two centuries. For the most part, the various kings of Persia adopted a lenient policy concerning the people of Israel, granting them broad rights and allowing them to worship and serve God.</p><p>Judea was situated between the two strong nations of that day, Persia and Egypt, and whenever war would erupt between those two countries, it inevitably became the battle ground. For example, during the years of Artaxerxes II (404-358 B.C.), Evagoras, king of Salamis, in Cyprus, aided by Athens and Egypt, broke his relationship with Persia. Soon after that, he besieged Tyre in order to war against Persia. To support him, Egypt sent its armies northward through Judea, imposing taxation and military draft upon the remnant along the way and inflicting a loss of life and property beyond measure.</p><p>After Persia, the Grecian Empire established by Alexander the Great of Macedonia prevailed. Following his conquest of Tyre and Gaza the young Alexander stormed toward Judea with rage because the Israelites had failed to furnish him with military supplies and conciliatory tributes. When he drew near to the holy city, the high priest Jaddua led a company of priests and Levites to welcome him. He entered the city happily and even read the book of Daniel in the temple, only to discover that two hundred years earlier the prophets had already prophesied concerning him (Dan. 8:5-8). The young emperor was both astonished and moved and immediately ordered the retreat of his troops. After that, he dealt favorably with the holy people, granting them protection in the great Grecian Empire, waiving a portion of their taxes, and allowing them freedom of worship.</p><p>After the death of Alexander there were several years of civil war, after which his empire was subdivided into four parts: the kingdoms of Ptolemy (Egypt), of Cassander (Macedonia), of Lysimachus (Asia Minor), and of Seleucus (Syria). Located between Syria and Egypt, the land of Judea once again became a point of contention between the two powers. Although Judea had belonged to Syria, Ptolemy I seized it when he defeated Syria (320 B.C.). Under the rule of Ptolemy and his successors, the Jews in both Egypt and Judea gained considerable religious freedom and protection. The high priest in Jerusalem was not only the religious leader but also the political leader, and the priests and Levites were exempt from property taxes.</p><p>In 198 B.C., Antiochus the Great, king of Syria, defeated Egypt and recaptured Judea as his own domain. He then negotiated with Egypt under the terms that Ptolemy V, king of Egypt, would marry his daughter Cleopatra and the son she was to bear would become the heir to the throne of Egypt. He further pledged the land of Palestine as a dowry, promising an equal share in the tax revenues from the land for the two countries. Antiochus the Great, however, was not wholly faithful to his word. Instead of leaving Judea, the Syrian troops stayed there with the Egyptian troops. The Jews, who had managed to survive under foreign domination, now had a much more difficult time under the two co-rulers. There were factions and striving, with some suggesting closer ties with Egypt, and others, with Syria. During the winter between 190 B.C. and 189 B.C., the decisive encounter known as the Battle of Magnesia took place between Antiochus the Great and the Roman army. Magnesia was situated on the southern bank of the river Hermus, north of Ephesus and west of Sardis. Antiochus the Great, with 70,000 troops under him, was defeated by his opponent who had only 30,000. He was forced to concede territory as payment to Rome, and his son Antiochus (Epiphanes) was given as a hostage to the Romans. In paying the war indemnity, he drained the nation&rsquo;s treasury and brought about the decline of his country. Eventually he was killed in a revolt in 187 B.C. This fulfilled the word in Daniel 11:15-19. Antiochus&rsquo; son Seleucus Philopator succeeded him for twelve years and was murdered by his own subordinate.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Little Horn in Daniel 8</h2><p>In Lesson Twelve, volume one, which covered the captivity and the prophets in captivity, the great image in Daniel 2 and the visions in chapters seven through twelve were mentioned. Daniel 2 describes the great image in King Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream; chapter seven covers the vision of the four beasts emerging from the sea; chapter eight speaks of the clash between the ram and the he-goat; chapter eleven cites the things related to the southern and northern kings. What the little horn did in Daniel 8:9-14 and what the king from the north performed in 11:21-32a both refer to the same thing.</p><p>The great image in chapter two is of four parts: the head, the breast and the arms, the belly and the thighs, and the legs (including the ten toes). The fourth part is first divided into two legs and then into ten toes. The following are the ages signified by the first three parts as well as the two legs: the head refers to the Babylonian Empire (605-539 B.C.); the breast and the arms represent the Median and Persian Empire (549-330 B.C.), which, although Media and Persia are likened to the two arms, was one kingdom; the belly and the thighs symbolize the Greek Empire established by the Macedonians (336-323 B.C.); the two legs of the great image allude to the eastern and western Roman Empires (30 B.C.-474 A.D.). All of these, except that which is typified by the ten toes, have been fulfilled in history.</p><p>The four beasts in chapter seven are equivalent to the four sections of the great image in chapter two. The first beast corresponds to the head of the image; the second, to its breast and arms; the third, to its belly and thighs; and the fourth, to its legs and ten toes. The ram and the he-goat in chapter eight parallel the second and third beasts in chapter seven. Thus, the he-goat equals the third beast as well as the third part of the great image. This he-goat has four horns, and out of one of them comes forth a little horn. According to history, the ram signifies Persia and the he-goat symbolizes Greece. G. H. Pember, in his writings on the prophecies, says that signs of a ram could be found everywhere in Persia, especially in its capital. Ancient Greece also abounded with signs of a goat. The Bible symbolizes Persia by a ram and Greece by a he-goat. In this chapter, the he-goat refers to Alexander the Great. It is recorded in history that when he marched into Macedonia, he wore a crown with a he-goat&rsquo;s horn. After a twelve year reign, he died suddenly before the age of thirty-three.</p><p>Daniel 8:8 says that &ldquo;the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones towards the four winds of heaven.&rdquo; The four generals under Alexander the Great carved up the empire, and each established his own kingdom. The Grecian Empire of Macedonia thus became four nations at the death of Alexander. Since these prophecies were written long before Alexander&rsquo;s time, in reading them one cannot but believe in the divine inspiration of the holy Scriptures.</p><p>Daniel 8:9 continues, &ldquo;And out of one of them came forth a little horn.&rdquo; This little horn refers to Antiochus Epiphanes, king of Syria, that is, the king of the north mentioned in Daniel 11:21-35.</p><p>Antiochus Epiphanes was the son of Antiochus the Great, king of Syria, and the younger brother of Seleucus Philopator. He was sent to Rome as a hostage when his father was defeated in the Battle of Magnesia. His older brother, unwilling to see his continuous detainment, exchanged him for his own son Demetrius. Upon his release, Epiphanes went on to Athens. When his brother was murdered by Heliodorus, Epiphanes, with the help of the king of Pergamum, killed Heliodorus and regained power. Since Epiphanes fought on his nephew&rsquo;s behalf, the throne should have been inherited by Demetrius. Yet instead of returning to Rome as a hostage and thereby relieving Demetrius to become king, he claimed the throne for himself. Hence, Daniel 11:21 says that he was a vile person, obtaining the kingdom by flatteries.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Occupying the Holy Land,<br />Massacring the Israelites,<br />and Defiling the Temple</h2><p>After Antiochus Epiphanes obtained the kingdom, he entered into war with the Egyptians, regained Judea, and mistreated the Jews severely. In 170 B.C., returning from his expedition to Egypt, he entered Jerusalem and allowed his soldiers to carry on a three day massacre. Approximately one hundred thousand Jews, including men and women, old and young, were slaughtered, and some tens of thousands were captured and sold into slavery. Moreover, he robbed the temple of its precious vessels.</p><p>In 168 B.C., he again led his army to invade Egypt and met with apparent success. The surprise intervention of Rome forced him to evacuate, as depicted in Daniel 11:30, where it says, &ldquo;He shall be grieved, and return.&rdquo; Disappointed, he turned his indignation toward the holy people, who were to experience a much greater persecution than before. Countless were seized and slaughtered. Sacrifices, circumcision, and keeping of the Sabbath were absolutely forbidden, and violators received capital punishment. The books of the law were burned and their preaching prohibited. On December 25 of the same year he erected another altar to Zeus on the altar of burnt offering in the temple, the very abomination mentioned by Daniel. He set up his own image in the temple, sacrificed a sow on that altar, and sprinkled its blood in the temple. He forced the holy people to worship the idol and to eat pork, and he seduced young men to commit fornication in the temple and to sell their priesthood. This Antiochus Epiphanes is the &ldquo;little horn&rdquo; in Daniel 8:9-12. It was he who took away the daily sacrifice, cast down the sanctuary, trod on the holy people, and attacked the true God. He is a type of Antichrist who is &ldquo;the abomination of desolation&rdquo; as prophesied by the Lord Himself (Matt. 24:15). At that time, confronted with such unprecedented calamity, God&rsquo;s people called upon Him night and day for deliverance.</p><h2 class="head1">II. MACCABAEUS THE JEWISH PRIEST</h2><p>As in the age of the judges, God again heard the cry of His people, raising up for them an old priest named Mattathias to resist Syria&rsquo;s persecution. His age preventing him from serving in the temple, Mattathias had long moved back to his hometown Modin northwest of Jerusalem with his five sons&mdash;John, Simon, Judas (Maccabaeus), Eleazar, and Jonathan. Witnessing the desecration of Jerusalem and Judea, he sighed, &ldquo;Alas! Why was I born to see this, the ruin of my people, the ruin of the holy city, and to dwell there when it was given over to the enemy, the sanctuary given over to aliens?&rdquo; Mattathias and his sons rent their garments, put on sack cloth, and wept bitterly. When King Antiochus&rsquo; commissioner came to Modin to force all the Jews to worship idols, Mattathias steadfastly refused, declaring, &ldquo;Even if all nations that live under rule of the king obey him...I and my sons will live by the covenant of our fathers.&rdquo; As he finished speaking, a Jew was about to make an offering at the altar according to the king&rsquo;s decree before the rest of the people. When he saw this, his heart now burning in him with indignation, Mattathias rushed forward and slew the man. Following this, the old man and his sons dashed recklessly toward the commissioner and his aids, killing all of them. While destroying the heathen altar he cried, &ldquo;Let everyone who is zealous for the law and supports the covenant come out with me!&rdquo; He then organized a kind of guerrilla force to attack the Syrian troops everywhere, burning the idols and doing away with traitors. Patriotic Jews in all the places soon rose up in bands to respond to the cause.</p><p>Mattathias died of old age in 167 B.C. Before his death, he repeatedly charged his sons to continue his resolve to be zealous for God&rsquo;s law and to die for their ancestors&rsquo; covenant. His son Judas, also named Maccabaeus, later rose up to take his place.</p><p>Judas Maccabaeus was of huge stature and possessed both wisdom and courage. He loved God and his own country, leading a company of people and fighters who were faithful to God&rsquo;s law to resist foreign invasion. He engaged the Syrian armies in several dozen battles and managed to win almost every time. Renowned Syrian generals such as Apollonius, Lysias, Gorgias, and Nicanor, with troops many times more than the Jews, were defeated by him. His famous proverb was, &ldquo;It is not on the size of the army that victory in battle depends, but strength comes from heaven.&rdquo; Between 166 B.C. and 165 B.C., he won three major battles known in history as the Battle of Beth-Horon, the Battle of Emmaus, and the Battle of Beth-Zur.</p><p>After the victory at Beth-Zur, Judas Maccabaeus told his brothers, &ldquo;Behold, our enemies are crushed; let us go up to cleanse the sanctuary and dedicate it.&rdquo; He then prepared his entire army and went up to Mount Zion to cleanse the temple, hew down the idols, rebuild the altar, and drive out the priests who had purchased their offices. On December 25, 165 B.C., the people rose up early to offer sacrifices to God on the rebuilt altar according to the ancient ordinances. That particular day was selected to sanctify the altar because it was on the very same day and month when the Gentiles first defiled it. They rejoiced for eight straight days, and that period became the origin of &ldquo;the feast of Dedication&rdquo; (John 10:22) of the Jews.</p><p>Antiochus Epiphanes began to persecute the holy people and defiled the temple in 170 B.C., and Judas Maccabaeus purified the temple in 165 B.C. The entire period was about six years and four months, thereby fulfilling the prophecy in Daniel 8:13-14: &ldquo;How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.&rdquo;</p><p>The money in his treasury being lacking, Antiochus Epiphanes set off to Persia to collect tribute. While he was staying in Babylon, a report came to him that the armies sent to conquer Judah had been defeated, and Lysias&rsquo; bravest had suffered tremendous setback and shame. Moreover, the Jews had destroyed Zeus&rsquo; altar on the altar in Jerusalem, and they had built high walls around the sanctuary and restored it to its former state. When he heard this, he was astounded and badly shaken, and he took to his bed and became sick from grief. He stayed there for many days and soon realized that his end was near. Before he died, he was regretful of the evil doings in Jerusalem which resulted in his final distress. In 164 B.C., two years after the cleansing of the temple, Antiochus finally succumbed in a foreign land, thus concluding a sinful life.</p><p>Besides defeating Syria, Judas Maccabaeus also conquered the Edomites, the Philistines, and the Amorites, and recovered many lost territories. Unfortunately, in order to consolidate his victories, he sought man&rsquo;s assistance to subdue his enemies. He sent emissaries to Rome in 161 B.C. to seek a war alliance with the Romans. The Romans consented, yet even before the signed treaty was announced, this folk hero was slain in battle.</p><p>After Judas Maccabaeus died, his brothers Jonathan (161-143 B.C.) and Simon (142-135 B.C.) continued successively to fight for the Israelites. When the four brothers of Judas Maccabaeus had all passed away one after another, John Hyrcanus, the son of Simon, became the high priest and leader. Following that, there were no more glorious events of history or courageous acts worthy of record, but only internal power struggles, in-fighting, and civil war. The Roman general Pompey captured Jerusalem in 63 B.C. and finally ended the Maccabees&rsquo; war for independence.</p><h2 class="head1">III. POMPEY THE ROMAN GENERAL<br />AND HEROD KING OF JUDEA</h2><p>The father of Antipater the Idumaean and governor of Idumaea (a Jewish territory) had long been absolutely loyal to Judea. Antipater assumed his father&rsquo;s office upon his death. In 63 B.C., when the great Roman general Pompey overran Jerusalem, Antipater immediately changed with the wind and subjected himself to Rome. Because he served the Romans unequivocally under all circumstances, he was highly regarded by the Roman government. When Pompey and Julius Caesar were engaged in a civil war in 48 B.C., Antipater, realizing the certain victory of Caesar, fought for him in Egypt. At the end of the war, Caesar, having obtained power, first made him governor of the provinces of Judea, Samaria, and Galilee, and later appointed his son Herod as the tetrarch of Galilee.</p><p>Antipater died in 43 B.C., and his territories were partitioned by his first and second sons, Phasael and Herod. The time coincided with the establishment of the Second Triumvirate, according to which the eastern countries were under the domination of Antony. When Antony came to Antioch of Syria in 41 B.C., he appointed the two brothers governors, Phasael and Herod ruling the south and the north, respectively. In 40 B.C., when the Parthians invaded, Herod escaped to Rome and was welcomed by Octavius Caesar and Antony. With the Senate&rsquo;s approval, Caesar promoted him to be king of Judea. He officially ascended to the throne in 37 B.C., and died in 4 A.D. This was the same Herod who wanted to kill the baby Jesus (Matt. 2:16).</p><h2 class="head1">IV. AUGUSTUS THE ROMAN EMPEROR</h2><p>When Julius Caesar was murdered in 44 B.C., Octavius Caesar, who was first his grand nephew and then his adopted son, succeeded him. This Octavius Caesar was later called Augustus (Luke 2:1). At the age of eighteen, when he was studying in Greece, Octavian was advised by friends and relatives to flee eastward for his life. Instead, he hurried back to Rome to work with Antony and Lepidus, Caesar&rsquo;s generals, who wielded the real power. In the next year (43 B.C.), at nineteen, he was chosen as one of two chief rulers, whereupon he gave immediate orders to exile the assassins of his adoptive father. Simultaneously the Second Triumvirate was formed between him and Antony and Lepidus.</p><p>In the winter of 34 B.C., Antony married Cleopatra, the queen of Egypt, in Antioch of Syria. He further distributed the eastern provinces to her sons as rulers. When the Triumvirate ended in 32 B.C., Octavian declared war against Antony in the name of quelling rebellion and prevailed. He returned to Rome in 29 B.C. for a triumphal procession. Octavian thus became the owner of the Roman Empire. The Senate designated him the imperator (or the supreme commander) and conferred upon him the title of &ldquo;princeps&rdquo; (or &ldquo;first citizen&rdquo;). In January of 27 B.C. he was named &ldquo;Augustus,&rdquo; which means supreme and divine. Later he was named &ldquo;Caesar&rdquo; and officially became Caesar Augustus. It was during his reign that the Lord Jesus was born (Luke 2:1-7).</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>When the Israelites returned to their own country to rebuild the temple and the holy city, they were still under the rule of the Persian Empire for another two centuries. They were occupied by the Grecian Empire after Alexander the Great overthrew Persia. After Alexander died, they fell under the rule of the kingdom (including Syria) established by one of his generals, Seleucus. Judea, being situated between Syria to the north and Egypt to the south, was often caught in the wars between the two powers. When Antiochus Epiphanes became king of Syria, he occupied the holy land, slaughtered the Israelites, and defiled the temple. The Maccabees, led by Judas Maccabaeus, later rose up to defeat and expel the Syrians, and the temple was cleansed as a result. Following the Roman conquest of Syria and Egypt, the Israelites came under the rule of the Roman Empire. It was in the reign of the Roman emperor Caesar Augustus that John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus were born, thus concluding the Old Testament era and bringing in the New Testament age.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>How many parts does the great image in Daniel 2 have?

A promise is an ordinary word spoken by God, promising you that He will do something for you. An oath is a confirmation of God&rsquo;s word of promise. God confirmed His word of promise by means of His oath (Heb. 6:13, 17). When a promise is confirmed by an oath, it immediately becomes a covenant. What we have received from God is not merely an ordinary word of promise but a covenant confirmed by God&rsquo;s oath and sealed with His faithfulness. When the One who made the covenant died, the covenant became a bequeathed will, that is, a testament. Today the covenant is no longer merely a covenant but a testament bequeathed by the One who enacted the covenant.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE NEW TESTAMENT AND THE OLD TESTAMENT&mdash;<br />THE TWO COVENANTS GOD MADE WITH MAN</h2><p>The new testament and the old testament are the two covenants which God made with man as the two conditions upon which man may have a relationship with Him. The new testament is a continuation of the covenant God made with Abraham. In Genesis chapter twelve, God gave a promise to Abraham and later also swore to him (Gen. 22:16). Hence, the promise became a covenant made by God with Abraham (Gal. 3:15-17). Two thousand years later, God sent His Son Jesus Christ to the world, who shed His blood on the cross and enacted the new covenant (Luke 22:20). At that point the new covenant was accomplished; moreover, it became a testament because of the Lord&rsquo;s death.</p><p>The old covenant, which came four hundred and thirty years after God made the covenant with Abraham, was enacted at Mount Sinai, where God gave the law to the children of Israel. Strictly speaking, the old covenant does not cover the entire period of the Old Testament, from Genesis to Malachi. It actually began from Exodus 19 and continued until the time of John the Baptist (Matt. 11:12-13). The time of John the Baptist to the time before the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus is a transitional period between the Old and the New Testament times. Whereas God dealt with man in the Old Testament according to the old covenant&mdash;the law, He deals with man in the New Testament according to the new covenant&mdash; grace.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Old Testament&mdash;<br />a Covenant Which Was Added and Abolished</h2><p>Romans 5:20 says that &ldquo;the law entered.&rdquo; This word means that the law was not in God&rsquo;s original intention, nor was it God&rsquo;s original ordination for man. Rather, it entered later; it was added along the way. In the beginning God did not have any intention to deal with man according to the law; rather, the law was added later because of man&rsquo;s fall and corruption.</p><p>After rescuing the children of Israel from Egypt and bringing them to the foot of Mount Sinai, God told them that He had borne them on eagles&rsquo; wings when He brought them out of Egypt (Exo. 19:4). God was speaking words of grace to the children of Israel, telling them that what He had done to them was a matter of grace. If they had known themselves, they would have trusted in Him and would have asked Him to continue to deal with them according to grace and to take care of them in everything. But, since at that time they did not know themselves, they neither respected nor trusted in His grace. On the contrary, they trusted in themselves and told God that all He had commanded they would do (Exo. 19:7-8). Because they were so ignorant concerning themselves, thinking they could do what God had commanded, God changed His attitude toward them and gave them the law.</p><p>In the beginning God dealt with them according to grace; like an eagle with her young, He was very pleasant and approachable. But when He changed His attitude and began to deal with them according to the law, He came to them in a flame of fire and became dreadful and terrifying. God changed His attitude toward them and dealt with them according to the law so that He might make manifest their transgressions and expose their real condition through the law, that they might know their inability to keep God&rsquo;s commands, and that they might realize their wickedness and impotence (Rom. 3:20).</p><p>Since the old covenant was something added and was not God&rsquo;s original intention for man, it could not remain permanently. Rather, it became old, grew decrepit, and disappeared (Heb. 8:13). Moreover, the glory of the ministry of the old covenant was also done away (2 Cor. 3:7).</p><h2 class="head3">1. Ordained in the Hand of Moses</h2><p>Galatians 3:19 says that the law was &ldquo;ordained through angels in the hand of a mediator.&rdquo; The mediator here refers to Moses (John 1:17; Exo. 24:3). Hence, the law was ordained in the hand of Moses. This indicates that it was not a pleasant and sweet matter for God to give the law to man; otherwise, He would have done it Himself.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Dedicated with the Blood of Bulls and Goats</h2><p>Hebrews 9:18-20 says, &ldquo;Wherefore neither was the first covenant [the old covenant] dedicated without blood. For when every commandment according to the law had been spoken by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded to you.&rdquo; (Compare Exo. 24:6-8.) Man is sinful, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness (Heb. 9:22). Without forgiveness of sin there is no way to fulfill the requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness that by it the covenant may be enacted. Therefore, the old covenant was dedicated with the blood of bulls and goats.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Based upon the Law,<br />Which Cannot Give Life, as Its Condition</h2><p>In the Old Testament God dealt with man according to the law. Everyone who kept the law would be blessed (Deut. 6:1-3), and everyone who did not abide by all the things written in the book of the law to do them would be cursed (Gal. 3:10). The law was able only to demand and condemn; it could not give life. Galatians 3:21 says, &ldquo;If a law was given which was able to give life, righteousness would have indeed been of the law.&rdquo; But actually man cannot be justified by law, for the law only demands and condemns; it cannot give life, nor can it give man the power to be justified by God.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Requiring Man Only to Work, Not to Believe</h2><p>Galatians 3:12 says, &ldquo;And the law is not of faith, but he who does them shall live by them.&rdquo; The law is not of faith; it is of works. The law is not based on the principle of faith; it is based on the principle of works. Man must do the law in order to live. Therefore, Moses spoke many times to all Israel in this way: &ldquo;Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live&rdquo; (Deut. 4:1; 5:1; 6:1, 25).</p><h2 class="head3">5. Applying Only to the Old Testament Age</h2><p>Referring to the old covenant, Hebrews 8:13 says, &ldquo;In saying new, He has made the first old. Now that which is becoming old and growing decrepit is near to disappearing.&rdquo; The prophecy in Jeremiah 31:31-34 concerning the coming new covenant indicated that the first covenant had become old and decrepit. It might have been that Jeremiah realized the weakness and unprofitableness of the old covenant and was deeply burdened about this matter. Therefore, God had an opportunity to come in to say through him, &ldquo;Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah&rdquo; (Heb. 8:8). Not only was the old covenant decrepit, but it was also near to disappearing. Therefore, it could only be applied to the Old Testament age.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The New Testament&mdash;<br />a Covenant Which Is Better and Eternal</h2><p>The new testament, or the new covenant, is a better covenant (Heb. 8:6). The new covenant is better than the old one, just as the reality of a person is better than his photograph. The old covenant, like a photograph, had only the outward form, but the new covenant, like the real person, has the inward life with all its reality. The old covenant was lifeless; the new covenant is constituted with the indestructible life (Heb. 7:16). Everything in the new covenant is much better than the things in the old covenant because everything in the new covenant is the reality constituted with life. Therefore, it is a better covenant.</p><p>Furthermore, the new covenant is an eternal covenant (Heb. 13:20). Unlike the old covenant, which became old and decrepit and was abolished (Heb. 8:13), the new covenant is eternally effective.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Accomplished by Jesus Christ</h2><p>The new covenant was accomplished by Jesus Christ Himself. When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross and shed the precious blood, He made the way for God to enact a new covenant with us (Matt. 26:28). Unlike the old covenant which was ordained in the hand of Moses, the new covenant was accomplished by the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, God&rsquo;s beloved Son.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Established with the Blood of Jesus,<br />the Son of God</h2><p>After eating the Passover with the disciples, the Lord established His table with the bread and the cup. He took the cup, saying, &ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in My blood&rdquo; (Luke 22:20). The new covenant was established with the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. First John 1:7 also says that the blood of Jesus, the Son of God, cleanses us from all sin. Because His blood satisfied the requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness, it opened the way for God to enact a new covenant with us. Therefore, the new covenant was enacted through the blood of Jesus, the Son of God; it is not like the old covenant which was enacted with the blood of bulls and goats.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Based upon Grace,<br />Which Gives Life, as Its Condition</h2><p>Now that we are in the new covenant, we are not under the law but under grace (Rom. 6:14). Grace is the Triune God processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to become everything to us. He is our redemption, salvation, life, and sanctification.</p><p>The new covenant is based upon grace, which gives life, as its condition. This means that in the new covenant the processed Triune God intends to be our all. Hence, the new covenant does not require man to keep the law; rather, it deals with man according to grace, which is God as everything to man.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Requiring Man Only to Believe, Not to Work</h2><p>Romans 11:6 says, &ldquo;But if by grace, it is no longer out of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace.&rdquo; Whereas the law is altogether out of works, grace is absolutely not of works. Anything that is out of works is not grace but law. John 3:15 says, &ldquo;That everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life.&rdquo; Thus, the New Testament shows us very clearly that God does not require man to work; God requires man only to believe. In the New Testament age, the unique cause of God&rsquo;s judgment on man is man&rsquo;s unbelief, his not believing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God (John 3:18).</p><p>In the New Testament, the meaning of the word faith has two aspects. Objectively, faith is what we believe. Subjectively, faith is our believing. Therefore, faith denotes both the act of believing and that in which we believe. The things in which we believe include God&rsquo;s sending His Son into the world, the Son&rsquo;s human living, His death on the cross to accomplish redemption, His burial, His resurrection, His becoming the life-giving Spirit, His ascension, and His pouring out of the Holy Spirit. When we hear of all these divine matters, we will be stirred up and filled with appreciation. This is our faith and this is our believing act. In the new covenant man only needs to have such a faith; man does not need to strive to keep the law.</p><h2 class="head3">5. Applying to the New Testament Age and Eternity</h2><p>The new covenant was established when the Lord Jesus died on the cross and shed His blood. Hence, to those who believe in Him, that was the beginning of the new covenant. But as far as the Israelites are concerned, the prophecy in Jeremiah 31 will not be fulfilled until Christ&rsquo;s second coming. The new covenant will be applied unto eternity, because it is an eternal covenant (Heb. 13:20).</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE NEW TESTAMENT AND THE OLD TESTAMENT&mdash;<br />THE TWO SECTIONS OF THE BIBLE</h2><p>The New and Old Testaments also refer to the two sections of the entire Bible (see Lesson One, volume one).</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Old Testament</h2><p>The Old Testament refers to the first section of the Bible; it contains thirty-nine books which can be divided into:</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Law</h2><p>The Law includes the five books from Genesis to Deuteronomy, which were written by Moses; hence they are called the Five Books of Moses, or the Pentateuch. Because all the commandments, statutes, and ordinances of the Old Testament are recorded in these five books, they are called the Law.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Historical Books</h2><p>The historical books include twelve books, from Joshua to Esther. They contain the history of the children of Israel, from their journey through the wilderness into Canaan, passing through the period of the judges, the establishment of the kingdom, and the division of the kingdom, which led to their captivity, and ending in their return from the captivity. Therefore, they are called the historical books.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Books of Poetry</h2><p>The books of poetry include five books, from Job to the Song of Songs. They are the writings of God&rsquo;s people under the inspiration of the Spirit in which they expressed through poetry their spiritual experiences in their daily life.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Prophets</h2><p>The Prophets, consisting of seventeen books, from Isaiah to Malachi, were written by the prophets. They contain the prophecies concerning the children of Israel, the Gentiles, and Christ; they also include much history as well as exhortation, warning, and encouragement to the children of Israel.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The New Testament</h2><p>The New Testament refers to the second section of the Bible; it contains twenty-seven books, which can be divided into:</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Historical Books</h2><p>The historical books include the five books from Matthew to Acts. The first four are the Gospels, which are a record of the life of the Lord Jesus. The fifth is the book of Acts, which is a record of the movement of the apostles on the earth after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection and ascension.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Epistles</h2><p>The Epistles include the twenty-one books from Romans to Jude, which are letters written by the apostles either to the churches or to individuals. They tell us in particular concerning the church in God&rsquo;s eternal plan as well as the different aspects of the church. They also tell us concerning the saints&rsquo; proper spiritual life and living.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Book of Prophecy</h2><p>There is only one book of prophecy, the book of Revelation, the last book of the New Testament as well as the last book of the Bible. It contains prophecies concerning the condition of the church, the future of the people of Israel, God&rsquo;s judgment of the world, the second coming of Christ, the end of Satan, the ultimate judgment, the millennium, and the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>The new and the old testaments first refer to the two covenants which God made with man as the two conditions for man to have a relationship with Him. The old covenant was ordained in the hand of Moses, dedicated with the blood of bulls and goats, and based upon the law, which could not give life, as its condition, requiring man only to work, not to believe. It was not God&rsquo;s original intention but was added later and eventually was done away. Thus, it was applied only to the Old Testament age. The new covenant, the better and eternal covenant, was accomplished by Jesus Christ, was established with the blood of Jesus, the Son of God, and is based upon grace, which gives life, as its condition, requiring man only to believe, not to work. It is of God&rsquo;s original intention and is applied to the New Testament age and eternity.</p><p>The New and the Old Testaments also refer to the two sections of the entire Bible. The Old Testament refers to the first section, and it contains thirty-nine books which can be divided into four categories. First, the Law, consisting of five books, from Genesis to Deuteronomy, contains mainly the record of the commandments, statutes, and ordinances given by God. Second, the historical books, consisting of twelve books, from Joshua to Esther, are the record of the history of the children of Israel, from their entering into Canaan to their return from captivity. Third, the books of poetry, consisting of five books, from Job to the Song of Songs, are the poetic expressions of the various spiritual experiences of God&rsquo;s people. Fourth, the prophetic books, consisting of seventeen books, from Isaiah to Malachi, are the record of the prophets&rsquo; reproach, exhortation, warning, and encouragement to the children of Israel, and the prophecies concerning the children of Israel, the Gentiles, the various aspects of Christ, the future millennium, and the new heaven and new earth. The New Testament refers to the second section of the Bible, and it contains twenty-seven books which can be divided into three categories: First, the historical books consist of five books, from Matthew to Acts. The first four, the Gospels, are the record of the life of the Lord Jesus, and the fifth, Acts, is a record of the movement of the apostles on the earth after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection and ascension. Second, the Epistles, consisting of twenty-one books from Romans to Jude, are the apostles&rsquo; letters to the churches and to individual saints, revealing the divine revelation concerning the church and the proper condition of the believers&rsquo; spiritual life and living. Third, the one book of prophecy, the book of Revelation, is not only the conclusion of the New Testament, but also the consummation of the entire Bible, containing prophecies on the church, the children of Israel, the end of the world and Satan, the second coming of Christ, the millennium, and the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>How was the old covenant enacted?</li><li>Why was the old covenant added?</li><li>How was the new covenant enacted?</li><li>What condition was the old covenant based upon?

In this lesson we will begin with John the Baptist, since he was the inaugurator who brought in the New Testament age.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE BACKGROUND</h2><p>Before John the Baptist came out, Judaism had become a dead religion. The Jews took God&rsquo;s law and the service of the tabernacle instituted by God and made them into dead ordinances. Not only were there many ordinances for their living, but there were also many religious regulations related to their service to God, including their priestly service and its system. All these became ordinances in letters which could not give men freedom in the spirit. John the Baptist was born under such a background.</p><h2 class="head1">II. HIS STATUS</h2><p>John the Baptist was born in a priestly family. He was an Israelite born into a tribe of serving priests, which was the tribe of Levi; hence, he was born a priest. His father Zachariah was an orthodox priest (Luke 1:8).</p><h2 class="head1">III. HIS BIRTH</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Conceived</h2><p>John the Baptist was not conceived by his parents&rsquo; natural strength. Because his mother was barren and both parents were advanced in age, humanly speaking, it was impossible for his conception to take place. But while his father was serving in the temple, an angel of the Lord appeared to him and said to him, &ldquo;Do not fear, Zachariah, because your petition was heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John&rdquo; (Luke 1:11, 13). At the time when there was no hope and when man&rsquo;s natural strength had come to an end, because of Zachariah&rsquo;s prayer, God&rsquo;s operation was able to have a new beginning by His divine act. This was revealed in the case of Abraham and Sarah (Gen. 17:15-19) and in the case of Hannah (1 Sam. 1:5-20).</p><p>The conception of John the Baptist was a miracle accomplished by the divine power in the divine way (Luke 1:19-20). It was God who came in to enable his parents to have a son by His power. But the conception of John the Baptist was accomplished merely in a human mother of a human father, without the divine essence being involved, thus bringing forth a mere man who was only filled with the Spirit of God (Luke 1:15) but lacked the nature of God.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Born</h2><p>Luke 1:57-58 says, &ldquo;Now the time was fulfilled for Elizabeth to give birth, and she brought forth a son. And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had magnified His mercy with her, and they rejoiced with her.&rdquo; The birth of John was miraculous and astounding, causing the neighbors and relatives to rejoice with astonishment.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Circumcised and Named</h2><p>On the eighth day, John the Baptist was circumcised. This was according to the requirement in Leviticus 12:3. When some were about to call him by the name of his father, Zachariah, his mother answered and said, &ldquo;No, but he shall be called John.&rdquo; Then they said to her, &ldquo;There is no one of your relatives who is called by this name.&rdquo; When they gestured to Zachariah as to what his child should be called, he miraculously wrote on the tablet, &ldquo;John is his name&rdquo; (Luke 1:59-63). The Lord&rsquo;s forerunner was given this name because God wanted him to be one who would not keep the traditions. For this reason, he was not given a traditional name, but he was given a new name.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. HIS LIFE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Living in the Wilderness</h2><p>&ldquo;And the young child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his presentation to Israel&rdquo; (Luke 1:80). For John to grow and become strong in spirit means that he was with God and for God, and to live in the wilderness was to be away from the traditions of human culture and religion that God might have a free and clear way to use him as the forerunner of the Savior.</p><p>As one who was born a priest, and according to the regulations of the Old Testament, John should have spent much time in the temple. However, he did not stay in the temple; he lived in the wilderness. The wilderness is a place without culture, tradition, or religion. By living in the wilderness John cut himself off from the crowd, from religion and culture, and from the temple of Judaism with all the systems and traditions of its service to God. He was a Jew, but he did not live as a Jew. He was a priest, but he did not live as a priest. On the contrary, he lived as an uncultured person. He put aside human religion, human culture, human practice, human system, all of man&rsquo;s traditions, the tradition of the priests, and the tradition of serving God; he abandoned them all. This strongly indicates that God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is contrary to religion and culture. It also indicates that the old way of the worship of God according to the Old Testament was repudiated, and a new way was about to be brought in.</p><h2 class="head2">B. His Way of Life</h2><p>John lived in a way that was absolutely contrary to religion, culture, and tradition and outside of religion, culture, and tradition. He wore a garment of camel&rsquo;s hair and a leather girdle about his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey (Matt. 3:4). According to the regulations of the law, John, who was born a priest, should have worn the priestly garment, which was made mainly of fine linen (Exo. 28:4, 40-41; Lev. 6:10; Ezek. 44:17-18); and he should have eaten the priestly food, which was composed mainly of fine flour and the meat of the sacrifices offered to God by His people (Lev. 2:1-3; 6:6-18, 25-26; 7:31-34). However, John acted altogether contrary to traditional teachings. He wore a garment of camel&rsquo;s hair (the camel was considered an unclean animal&mdash;Lev. 11:4) and a leather girdle about his loins, he ate locusts and wild honey, and he lived in the wilderness. All these things were uncivilized, uncultured, and completely contrary to the religious regulations and the Judaic traditions. All this indicates that he had altogether abandoned all the Old Testament traditions, which had fallen into a kind of religion mixed with human culture.</p><h2 class="head1">V. HIS TEACHING</h2><p>Luke 3:7-14 is a record of the teachings of John the Baptist.</p><h2 class="head2">A. To Repent and Produce Fruits</h2><p>John said to the crowds going out to be baptized by him, &ldquo;Brood of vipers! Who prompted you to flee from the coming wrath? Produce then fruits worthy of your repentance, and do not begin to say among yourselves, We have Abraham for our father, for I tell you that God is able out of these stones to raise up children to Abraham&rdquo; (Luke 3:7-8). He strongly pointed out that although the people of Israel were the descendants of Abraham, they had become the brood of vipers, the children of the Devil, having the poisonous nature of the Devil. They needed a change in life and nature to make them children of God to produce good fruit (Luke 3:9).</p><h2 class="head2">B. To Live a Superior Life</h2><p>John taught the people that he who has two tunics should share with the one who has none. He taught the tax collectors to exact no more than what they had been instructed, and he taught those serving in the military to extort nothing from anyone by force, nor to take anything from anyone by false accusation, and to be satisfied with their wages (Luke 3:11-14). Although John lived in a way that was contrary to religion, culture, and tradition, he taught people to live a superior life.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. HIS MINISTRY</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Preaching the Baptism of Repentance</h2><p>&ldquo;The word of God came to John, the son of Zachariah, in the wilderness. And he came into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins&rdquo; (Luke 3:2-3). Repentance is a matter of changing the mind, of turning the mind to God. Baptism is a matter of burying the repenting people, terminating them and their way of living so that God may regenerate them and make them a new creation (John 3:3, 5-6; 2 Cor. 5:17). Repentance with baptism is for forgiveness of sins, so that the obstacle of man&rsquo;s fall may be removed and man may be reconciled to God.</p><p>To baptize people is to immerse them, to bury them, in water, signifying death. This indicates that he who repents is good for nothing but burial. This also signifies the termination of the old person, that a new beginning may be realized in resurrection, to be brought in by Christ as the Life-giver. Hence, John&rsquo;s baptism not only terminated those who repented, but also ushered them to Christ for life. Baptism in the Bible implies death and resurrection. To be baptized into the water is to be put into death and buried. To be raised up from the water means to be resurrected from death.</p><p>In the Old Testament while the children of Israel were entering into Canaan, they had to cross the Jordan River, in which twelve stones representing the twelve tribes of Israel were buried, and from which another twelve stones representing the twelve tribes of Israel were resurrected and brought up (Josh. 4:1-18). Hence, to baptize people in the Jordan River implied the burial of their old being and the resurrection of the new. Just as the children of Israel&rsquo;s crossing the Jordan River ushered them into the good land, so to be baptized brings people into Christ, the real good land.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Bringing Men to Receive Christ</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Preparing Men&rsquo;s Hearts to Receive Christ</h2><p>&ldquo;As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord; make His paths straight. Every ravine shall be filled up, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked places shall become straight, and the rough places smooth roads; and all flesh shall see the salvation of God&rdquo; (Luke 3:4-6). To prepare the way of the Lord and to make His paths straight is to change people&rsquo;s minds, to turn their minds toward Christ and make their hearts right, to cause every part and avenue of their hearts to be straightened through repentance, thus preparing their hearts to receive Christ that Christ may enter into them to be their life and take possession of them.</p><p>Ravine, mountain, crooked places, and rough places are figures of speech describing the condition of men&rsquo;s hearts toward God and toward each other and the relationships among men, all of which needed to be dealt with for the way to be prepared for the Savior&rsquo;s coming.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Ushering Men to Christ</h2><p>&ldquo;Now while the people were in expectation and all were reasoning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Christ [that is, the Messiah], John answered and said to all, I indeed baptize you with water, but He who is stronger than I is coming, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie; He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire; whose winnowing shovel is in His hand to thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor, and to gather the wheat into His barn, but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire&rdquo; (Luke 3:15-17). Here we see that although John preached a baptism of repentance, the goal of his ministry was a wonderful Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God. He realized that he was only a messenger sent by Jehovah of hosts (Mal. 3:1) to bring people to Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and exalt Him as the goal of his ministry.</p><p>John testified that he baptized with water, but the One coming, Christ, will baptize people in the Holy Spirit and fire. The Holy Spirit, into whom Christ baptizes the regenerated believers, is the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:9). Hence, to be baptized in the Holy Spirit is to be baptized into Christ (Gal. 3:27; Rom. 6:3), into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19), and even into the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13). It is through baptism in such a water and in such a Spirit that the believers in Christ are regenerated into the kingdom of God, into the realm of the divine life and the divine rule (John 3:3, 5), that they may live by the eternal life of God in His eternal kingdom. Furthermore, Christ will baptize the unrepenting ones in fire. According to the context, the fire here is not the fire in Acts 2:3, which is related to the Holy Spirit; it is the fire of the lake of fire (Rev. 20:15). What John meant was that if people would truly repent and believe in the Lord Jesus, the Lord would baptize them in the Holy Spirit so that they might have eternal life. If they, like the Pharisees and Sadducees, would not repent, the Lord would baptize them in fire, putting them into the lake of fire for eternal punishment. John&rsquo;s baptism was only for repentance, to usher people to faith in Christ. The Lord&rsquo;s baptism either causes the believers to have life in the Holy Spirit, or causes the unbelievers to perish for eternity in the fire.</p><h2 class="head1">VII. HIS TYPE</h2><p>John the Baptist had the spirit and power of Elijah, and he did the work of Elijah in turning many Israelites to the Lord their God (Luke 1:16-17). Furthermore, he was the first one in the New Testament who was filled with the Holy Spirit; hence, in typology he was the Elijah who was about to come. Concerning John, the Lord said, &ldquo;And if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah, who is about to come&rdquo; (Matt. 11:14). This word means that if the Jews at that time would receive John&rsquo;s testimony and teaching, John would be their Elijah. However, the prophecy concerning the coming of Elijah in Malachi 4:5 will actually be fulfilled in the great tribulation, when Elijah, one of the two witnesses, will come to strengthen God&rsquo;s people (Rev. 11:3-12).</p><h2 class="head1">VIII. HIS DISCIPLES</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Making His Teaching into a Religion</h2><p>Toward the end of the Old Testament age, there were two major sects among the Jews: the Pharisees and Sadducees, who were frequently mentioned in the New Testament. After John the Baptist began his ministry, his disciples produced a new sect, a new religion, called the disciples of John (Matt. 9:14; John 3:25), in addition to the Pharisees and Sadducees.</p><p>John the Baptist dropped the old religion and began his ministry in the wilderness outside of religion (Matt. 3:1). However, his disciples made his teachings into a new religion to frustrate men from receiving Christ, just as the Pharisees of the old religion did. The ministry of John the Baptist was to introduce men to Christ that Christ might become their Redeemer, their life, and their all. However, some of his disciples drifted away from his goal, Christ, to some of his practices, making them a religion. To be religious means to do things for God without Christ. Even to do anything scriptural and fundamental, yet lacking the presence of Christ, is religious.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Causing His Work to Be in Rivalry with Christ</h2><p>John the Baptist was the forerunner of the Lord Jesus, the voice of one crying in the wilderness (John 1:23). After Christ came out to minister, John should have stopped his work and withdrawn himself from the scene so that Christ might be the only One on the scene, and all those who followed him should have gone to Christ. But because John did not withdraw right away, when his disciples saw that all the people were going to the Lord Jesus to be baptized (John 3:26), they wanted to do justice for their teacher, thus causing John&rsquo;s work to compete with Christ. If John would no longer have baptized people and would have told all his disciples that they should follow Jesus, not allowing people to follow him, there would have been no difficulty.</p><h2 class="head1">IX. HIS ENDING</h2><p>At the end John the Baptist was put into prison by Herod the tetrarch and was beheaded. This ending speaks forth, on the one hand, the evil, the corruption, and the darkness of Roman politics; on the other hand, it also shows the result of John the Baptist&rsquo;s not stopping his work. He once testified strongly saying that He was not the Christ but a messenger sent before Christ. He also aggressively announced that Christ was the Bridegroom coming to marry the bride (the church composed of all the believers in Christ), that he was only a friend of the Bridegroom, and that Christ must increase and he must decrease (John 3:28-30). Since this was the case, he should have withdrawn and no longer baptized people, because the One of whom he testified was already baptizing people. But he was still there baptizing people, causing his disciples to be in rivalry with Christ. Therefore, God had to raise up the environment to remove him and terminate his ministry. Yet the baptism of repentance left by him was still being received by people, though it had become the out-of-date truth, thus becoming a hindrance to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy (Acts 18:25; 19:1-5).</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>The Israelites took all that God gave to their forefathers in the Old Testament and made it into dead religious regulations and rituals. Under such a background John the Baptist, through God&rsquo;s miraculous empowering, was born of his old and barren parents into a priestly family of the Jewish religion of that time. From his mother&rsquo;s womb he was filled with the Holy Spirit. Though born a priest, he cut himself off from the holy temple and from the traditional religion and culture to live in the wilderness. There he lived in a &ldquo;wild&rdquo; way contrary to all traditions of the forefathers. In the wilderness, away from the atmosphere of religion and culture, he was the forerunner of Christ, a voice crying out to pave the way for Christ and introduce Christ. He preached the baptism of repentance and prepared the people&rsquo;s hearts to receive Christ. He had the spirit and power of Elijah to change the people&rsquo;s minds, turning them to Christ. He testified for Christ and aggressively declared to his disciples that Christ was the Bridegroom coming to marry the church, that he was only a messenger as the Bridegroom&rsquo;s friend, and that this Christ must increase and he must decrease. Yet his disciples made his teachings into another religion, causing his work to be in rivalry with Christ. Therefore, God allowed him to be imprisoned, even beheaded, thus removing him and terminating his work which, although unintentionally, was in real rivalry with Christ. The baptism of repentance left by him was still accepted by people and became a hindrance to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>Under what background was John the Baptist born?</li><li>What was the status of John the Baptist?</li><li>John the Baptist did not live in the temple; rather, he lived in the wilderness.

In the foregoing lesson we saw that he was the inaugurator of the New Testament age, who brought in the central figure of the New Testament&mdash;Jesus Christ. In this lesson we will see the Lord Jesus, who is the central figure of the New Testament and even of the whole Bible, from His eternity past to His death and burial. In the next lesson we will see the remaining points concerning Him.</p><h2 class="head1">I. HIS ETERNITY PAST</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Word That Was in the Beginning with God</h2><p>John 1:1-2 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God.&rdquo; The Word is Christ (John 1:14). From the beginning Christ was the Word that was with God. He is without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life (Heb. 7:3). His deity is eternal. He was with God from the beginning. He is the Word that was in the beginning with God.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Complete God</h2><p>Romans 9:5 says, &ldquo;Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever.&rdquo; This proves that Christ is the complete God. In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily (Col. 2:9); He is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the express image of God&rsquo;s substance (Heb. 1:3). He subsists in the form of God and is equal with God (Phil. 2:6), and He is the mystery of God (Col. 2:2b).</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Only Begotten Son of God</h2><p>From eternity past Christ was the only begotten Son of God. He was in the bosom of the Father from eternity past; after incarnation He is still in the bosom of the Father. John 1:18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is&rdquo; in the original text is in the present tense, proving that while He was speaking this word on the earth, He was still in the bosom of the Father. He as the only begotten Son was with the Father, and He was, is, and always will be in the bosom of the Father.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Expression of the Father</h2><p>Christ, the only begotten Son of God, expressed God by the Word, life, light, grace, and reality, as revealed in John 1:1, 4, 5, and 14. The Word is God revealed, life is God imparted, light is God shining, grace is God enjoyed, and reality is God realized, apprehended. The essence of them all is God Himself. It is by these things that God is fully declared in the Son. Although no one has ever seen God, the Son of God has declared, expressed, Him in the way of being the Word, life, light, grace, and reality.</p><h2 class="head2">E. The Author of Life</h2><p>The eternal Christ is the origin and originator of life; hence, He is the Author of life (Acts 3:15). In Him is the eternal life, the life of God (John 1:4).</p><h2 class="head1">II. HIS STATUS</h2><p>This Christ, who was the complete God, the eternal Word who was with God, the only begotten Son who expressed God, and the Author of life, came into man through incarnation and was born as a perfect man in time, about four thousand years after the creation of man. Among the four Gospels in the beginning of the New Testament, Matthew and Luke have a record of His genealogy that explains His status. Matthew testifies that He is the King, the Christ prophesied in the Old Testament. The genealogy given in Matthew shows us the antecedents and the royal status of this King, proving that He is the proper successor to the throne of David. Luke testifies that He is a proper and normal man. The genealogy recorded in Luke traces back to Adam, the first ancestor of mankind, proving that He is a genuine man who is qualified to be the Savior of mankind.</p><h2 class="head1">III. HIS CONCEPTION</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Conceived of the Holy Spirit<br />and Born of a Virgin</h2><p>This wonderful person, Jesus Christ, was conceived of the Holy Spirit of God in the womb of a chaste virgin. His source was on the one hand God and on the other hand man. According to the biblical sense, the Holy Spirit of God is simply God Himself. Therefore, His being conceived of the Holy Spirit in the womb of a chaste virgin was the coming of God Himself into this chaste virgin to be conceived. Surely this conception had the two elements of God and man; with the Holy Spirit there was the element of God, and with the virgin there was the element of man. Hence, the result of this conception was that a God-man was produced.</p><h2 class="head2">B. With God and Man as His Essences</h2><p>The Lord Jesus Christ was born with two natures, the divine nature and the human nature. He has not only the divine nature but also the human nature; He has both natures, divinity and humanity, at the same time. This word &ldquo;nature&rdquo; not only indicates His nature, but even more it denotes His essence. The essences of Jesus Christ are His two natures: the divine and the human. He is a God-man, One who is constituted with the divine nature and the human nature, that is, the divine essence plus the human essence. Therefore, He is both the complete God and the perfect Man. As God, He is completely God; as man, He is really a man. He is a God-man, a mingling of God and man. Any conception is a mingling. In the conception of Jesus Christ there were two essences, the divine essence and the human essence. The two essences were not only added together; they were mingled together. Therefore, what was produced was a God-man.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. HIS BIRTH</h2><h2 class="head2">A. In the Reign of Caesar Augustus</h2><p>Luke 2:1-3 says, &ldquo;Now it came about in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus for all the inhabited earth to be enrolled. This first enrollment took place when Quirinius governed Syria. And all went to be enrolled, each to his own city.&rdquo; It was sovereign of God that such a decree was issued during the reign of Caesar Augustus. By this enrollment Mary and Joseph were brought from Nazareth to Bethlehem so that Christ might be born there for the fulfillment of the prophecy in the Old Testament (Micah 5:2). Luke 2:4-5 says, &ldquo;And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to David&rsquo;s city, which is called Bethlehem, because he was out of the house and family of David, to be enrolled with Mary, who was espoused to him and was pregnant.&rdquo; Apart from the decree of Caesar Augustus, it might not have been possible for Mary and Joseph to go from Nazareth to Bethlehem. Such a move was necessary for the fulfillment of the prophecy that Christ was to be born in Bethlehem.</p><h2 class="head2">B. At Bethlehem</h2><p>Micah 5:2 prophesied clearly that Christ was to be born in Bethlehem of Judea; then, in due time, under God&rsquo;s sovereign arrangement and leading, Christ was born there. Matthew recorded this particular prophecy (which was omitted in the other three Gospels), especially to prove that the child Jesus was born a descendant of David to be the legal heir to his throne.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Laid in a Manger</h2><p>Luke 2:7 says, &ldquo;And she gave birth to her son, the firstborn; and she wrapped Him in cloths and laid Him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.&rdquo; The life of the Lord Jesus began with a manger, in the lowliest estate. Due to the occupancy of the busy activities of fallen mankind, there was no room for Him in the inn, so that He had to be laid in a manger. We may say that the manger is a symbol of His human living.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Announced to the Shepherds by an Angel</h2><p>There were shepherds in Bethlehem, living in the fields and keeping the nightwatches over their flock. And an angel of the Lord stood by them and said to them, &ldquo;I bring you good news of great joy, which will be to all the people, because a Savior was born to you today in David&rsquo;s city, who is Christ the Lord&rdquo; (Luke 2:8-11). This good news of great joy was announced to all people, not only to the Jewish people but to all of mankind.</p><p>The angel went on to say, &ldquo;And this is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger&rdquo; (Luke 2:12). A baby in a manger, signifying smallness in lowliness, was a sign of the Lord&rsquo;s life. Nevertheless, this little baby was the mighty God (Isa. 9:6).</p><h2 class="head2">E. A Multitude of the Heavenly Army<br />Joining the Angel and Praising God</h2><p>Luke 2:13-14 says, &ldquo;And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God and saying, Glory in the highest places to God, and on earth peace among men of His good pleasure.&rdquo; The praise of the heavenly army has two aspects: glory in the highest places to God and peace on earth among men of His good pleasure. The Lord&rsquo;s salvation has accomplished these two aspects: bringing glory to God in heaven and peace to men on earth. Christ is for God&rsquo;s glory and man&rsquo;s peace.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Witnessed by the Shepherds<br />and Spoken of to Others by Them</h2><p>In Luke 2:15-20 we are told that the shepherds went to Bethlehem and &ldquo;found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in the manger. And when they saw this, they made known concerning the word which was spoken to them about this little child.&rdquo; The good news concerning the Lord&rsquo;s birth was first announced by an angel to the shepherds. Then the shepherds, after hearing the announcement of the angel and after coming to see the little child, began to speak to others. All those who heard marveled concerning the things spoken to them by the shepherds.</p><h2 class="head2">G. Circumcised, Named, and Presented to God</h2><p>On the eighth day after His birth, the Lord Jesus was circumcised and named; and after another twenty-five days, as it was written in the law, He was presented to God as the male who opened the womb (Luke 2:21-24).</p><h2 class="head1">V. HIS FLIGHT AND GROWTH</h2><p>Shortly after He was born, the Lord Jesus fled to Egypt because of the persecution of King Herod. This was a fulfillment of the prophecy concerning Him in Hosea 11:1, which says that He must be called out of Egypt (Matt. 2:13-15). The prophecy of Hosea joins Him to Israel, making them one. After Herod died, He returned to the land of Israel. Because of the fear that the son of King Herod might continue the persecution, He went to live in Nazareth, a small city in the despised region of Galilee (John 7:52), and grew up to be a despised Nazarene (Matt. 2:19-23; John 1:45-46). In Nazareth, He was apparently the son of the carpenter Joseph and grew up in that carpenter&rsquo;s home (Matt. 13:55), and even became a carpenter despised by men (Mark 6:3). However, He was filled with wisdom from His youth, and the grace of God was upon Him. When He was twelve years old, He went up with His parents to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover, and He manifested His wisdom in the temple and His concern for the things of God. And He kept advancing in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and men (Luke 2:40-52). When He was thirty years of age, He came out to fulfill His ministry, preaching and working for God (Luke 3:23).</p><h2 class="head1">VI. HIS HUMAN LIVING</h2><p>The human living of the Lord Jesus Christ was a living of God mingled with man. While He was living on the earth, the complete Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash; was in Him, living a mingled life with Him as a perfect man. This kind of living, which was lived out through the mingling of God and man, was the transcendent living of the God-man. It was a man who lived, yet He lived out God; it was the Triune God with all His virtues lived out from humanity and manifested in human form.</p><p>The earthly living of this God-man as recorded in the four Gospels may be summarized in the following thirteen items:</p><ol class="none"><li>(1) Being the embodiment of the Triune God, having all that God the Father has (Col. 2:9; John 16:15a).</li><li>(2) Being the tabernacle of God and the temple of God (John 1:14a; 2:21).</li><li>(3) Coinherent with the Father (John 14:10a, 11a; 17:21).</li><li>(4) One with the Father (John 10:30; 17:22).</li><li>(5) Having the Father with Him (John 8:29; 16:32).</li><li>(6) Living because of the Father (John 6:57a).</li><li>(7) Anointed with the Spirit by the Father (Matt. 3:16-17; Luke 4:18a).</li><li>(8) Working with the Father (John 14:10b; 5:17, 19).</li><li>(9) Doing things in the name of the Father (John 10:25).</li><li>(10) Doing the Father&rsquo;s will (John 5:30; 6:38).</li><li>(11) Speaking the Father&rsquo;s word (John 14:24; 7:16-17; 12:49-50).</li><li>(12) Seeking the Father&rsquo;s glory (John 7:18).</li><li>(13) Expressing the Father (John 14:7-9).</li></ol><h2 class="head1">VII. HIS FOUR ASPECTS</h2><p>Christ as the center of the entire Bible is all-inclusive, having many aspects. The New Testament at its beginning presents four biographies to portray the four main aspects of this all-inclusive Christ. Matthew testifies that He is the King, the Christ of God according to the prophecies of the Old Testament, who brings the kingdom of the heavens to the earth. Mark tells us that He is the Servant of God, laboring for God faithfully. His account is most simple, for a servant does not need any detailed record. Luke portrays Him as the only proper and normal man, qualified to be the Savior of mankind. John unveils Him as the Son of God, the very God Himself, to be life to God&rsquo;s people.</p><h2 class="head1">VIII. HIS BAPTISM AND TEST</h2><p>When the Lord Jesus was about thirty years old (Luke 3:23), the legal age to be a priest (Num. 4:3), He came out to minister and work for God. Before He began His ministry, He was baptized by John and anointed by God with the Holy Spirit (Matt. 3:13-17; Luke 4:18). Then He was tempted by the Devil, and He overcame (Luke 4:1-13). Therefore, He was filled with the power of the Holy Spirit to come out to minister and work (Luke 4:14).</p><h2 class="head1">IX. HIS MINISTRY</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Preaching the Gospel</h2><p>The first thing the Lord Jesus did in His ministry was to preach the gospel, to announce God&rsquo;s glad tidings to the miserable people in bondage (Luke 4:18-19), that they may repent, believe in the gospel, have their sins forgiven, and be regenerated by God to have the divine life and enter into God&rsquo;s kingdom (Mark 1:14-15; John 3:3-7).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Teaching People</h2><p>The second thing the Lord Jesus did in His ministry was to teach people (Mark 1:21-22; 2:13), releasing words full of light to enlighten those sitting in the shadow of death (Matt. 4:12-16), that they might receive the light of life and thus be brought out of the satanic darkness into the divine light (Acts 26:18).</p><h2 class="head2">C. Performing Miracles and Wonders</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Calling Things Not Being as Being<br />and Ruling the Universe</h2><p>The first miracle that the Lord did in His ministry was to change water into wine, manifesting His divine glory (John 2:1-11). He also used a small portion of food to feed five thousand people at one time and four thousand people at another time. In both cases there were broken pieces left (Matt. 14:15-21; 15:32-38). These cases prove that He is the Creator who calls things not being as being. Furthermore, He also walked steadily on the waves (Matt. 14:24-27) and calmed the winds and the sea (Matt. 8:23-27). These cases indicate that He is the sovereign One who rules the universe.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Casting Out Demons</h2><p>The Lord Jesus came that He might destroy the works of Satan (1 John 3:8). Therefore in His ministry, as a part of the miracles and wonders, He also cast out demons, who were under the hand of Satan, from the possessed people (Mark 1:34, 39; 3:15; 6:7, 13; 16:17) that they might be delivered from Satan&rsquo;s bondage (Luke 13:16) and transferred out of Satan&rsquo;s authority of darkness (Acts 26:18; Col. 1:13) into God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Healing the Sick</h2><p>Sickness is an issue of sin, and it is also a sign of man&rsquo;s abnormal condition before God because of sin. The Lord Jesus healed the sinners&rsquo; sick condition both physically and spiritually and restored them to a normal condition that they might serve Him (Mark 1:34; 3:10; 6:5, 13, 56). This is another part of His ministry in doing miracles.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Cleansing the Leper</h2><p>Leprosy is the most contaminating and damaging disease, much more serious than fever (Mark 1:30, 40) and isolating its victim both from God and from men (see notes 2<sup>1</sup> and 3<sup>1</sup> in Matt. 8). A leper portrays a typical sinner. The Lord Jesus&rsquo; cleansing of a leper signifies His recovering of the sinner to the fellowship with God and with men.</p><h2 class="head3">5. Raising the Dead</h2><p>Death is the fruit of sin (James 1:15; Rom. 6:23). The Lord Jesus came to be the Savior of mankind not only to save people from sins (Matt. 1:21) but also to save them from death (John 6:50). While He was ministering on the earth, the highest of His miracles was His raising the dead (Matt. 11:5; Luke 7:12-15; John 11:39-44), proving that He is the Lord of life who is able to bring those who believe in Him out of death into life (John 5:24).</p><h2 class="head2">D. Expressing God</h2><p>While the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He lived because of the Father, He worked with the Father, He did things in the Father&rsquo;s name according to the Father&rsquo;s will, He spoke the Father&rsquo;s words, and He sought the Father&rsquo;s glory, not His own glory. Therefore, He could testify that &ldquo;He who has seen Me has seen the Father&rdquo; (John 14:9). He did not seek His own will, nor did He express Himself, but He expressed God. In His transfiguration on the mountain, He manifested the glory of His divinity, thus enabling God to be fully expressed before His three disciples (Matt. 17:1-2). At the end of His ministry and work for God, God declared from heaven that He had already glorified His name in Him, that is, that God Himself had already been expressed (John 12:28).</p><h2 class="head1">X. HIS DEATH</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Date and Place of His Death</h2><p>From the Lord Jesus&rsquo; baptism and the beginning of His ministry to the Passover recorded in John 2:13 was about half a year. From that Passover to the feast of the Jews recorded in John 5:1 was one year. From that feast to the Passover recorded in John 6:4 was another year. From this Passover to the Passover mentioned in John 12:1 and 19:14 was again another year, which was the year of His death. Hence, the Lord Jesus ministered and worked for about three and a half years. From this last Passover, counting back to the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes when the decree went out for the rebuilding of Jerusalem (Neh. 2:1-8), there are 483 years. Thus, this was the year of the completion of the sixty-ninth week mentioned in Daniel 9:24-26. It was on the day of the Passover in this year (Matt. 26:2) that the anointed One, Christ, was cut off, that is, nailed on the cross, and died at Golgotha (meaning the Place of a Skull&mdash;John 19:17-18) outside Jerusalem, as our Passover Lamb (1 Cor. 5:7).</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Way of His Death</h2><p>After the Lord Jesus ate His last Passover and instituted His supper (Matt. 26:20-30) on the night of His crucifixion, He was betrayed by Judas Iscariot, one of His twelve disciples, and was arrested by the Roman soldiers and Jewish deputies outside Jerusalem in the Garden of Gethsemane at the foot of the Mount of Olives (Matt. 26:36; John 18:1-2). Then He was judged on three occasions by the high priest of the Jews and their Sanhedrin (John 18:13-14, 19-24; Matt. 26:57-66; 27:1; Luke 22:66-71), and then judged on another three occasions, twice by Pilate, who was the Roman governor, and by Herod, according to the Roman law (Matt. 27:2, 11-14; Luke 23:1-5; John 18:28-38; Luke 23:6-11, 13-25). Although they could not find any fault in Him, in order to satisfy the crying and the demand of the Jews, they sentenced Him to the death of the cross and crucified Him with two robbers (Matt. 27:38). The Lord Jesus was on the cross from nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning (Mark 15:25) to three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon (Matt. 27:46) for a total of six hours. During the first three hours, from nine o&rsquo;clock until noon, men did the killing work on Him, making Him a martyr; during the last three hours, from noon until three o&rsquo;clock, God, counting Him as the Substitute for sinners, smote Him and bruised Him, judging the sinners and their sins in Him (Isa. 53:5-6, 10a; 2 Cor. 5:21).</p><h2 class="head2">C. Accomplishing an All-inclusive Death<br />with a Sevenfold Status</h2><p>The death of the Lord Jesus was not the death of an ordinary man. He died on the cross with a sevenfold status to accomplish an all-inclusive death for us and for everything that He redeemed.</p><p>First, He died as the Lamb of God to deal with the totality of sin, including our sinful nature and sinful deeds (John 1:29; 1 Pet. 2:24; Heb. 9:26, 28; 1 Cor. 15:3).</p><p>Second, He died as a man in the flesh (John 1:14), in the likeness of the flesh of sin, in the form of fallen man, to condemn sin and to deal with the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3).</p><p>Third, He died as the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:45b), as a man in the old creation, for us who are in the old creation, crucifying our old man on the cross (Rom. 6:6).</p><p>Fourth, He died as the brass serpent, having the serpent&rsquo;s form but not the serpent&rsquo;s poison. He was lifted up on the cross, and through His death He bruised the head of the ancient serpent (Gen. 3:15; Rev. 12:9), destroying Satan (Heb. 2:14) and his world (John 12:31), thus causing all those who believe in Him to have eternal life (John 3:15-16).</p><p>Fifth, He died as the Firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15), as the first item of the old creation, to terminate the entire old creation, thus reconciling all created things to God (Col. 1:20).</p><p>Sixth, He also died as the Peacemaker, as the One who makes peace. Through the cross He abolished all the regulating and separating ordinances of the law&mdash;such as those concerning circumcision, keeping the Sabbath, and eating certain foods, and including the different ways of living, the different customs and habits that cause separations in human society. Thus He created all His believers, both Jews and Gentiles, in Himself into one new man (Eph. 2:14-16).</p><p>The six items above are on the negative side, solving all problems for us, the sinners.</p><p>Seventh, on the positive side, He died as a grain of wheat, falling into the ground to release the divine life (John 12:24) to us that, like Him, we may become many grains of wheat to be formed into one loaf as His Body (1 Cor. 10:17a).</p><p>Thus He accomplished an all-inclusive death with a sevenfold status.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Accomplishing an Eternal Redemption</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The Triune God Dying for Sinners<br />in the Human Flesh of Jesus</h2><p>In the death of the Lord Jesus, the Triune God&mdash;the Son with the Father through the Spirit&mdash;died and shed His blood for sinners in the human flesh of Jesus, accomplishing an eternal redemption. This is not only the Lord Jesus dying for us; it is the entire Triune God in the flesh of Jesus dying for us. (See chapter one of <em>Christ as Revealed in the New Testament,</em> published by Taiwan Gospel Book Room, 1984.)</p><h2 class="head3">2. Offering Himself to God<br />through the Eternal Spirit</h2><p>Hebrews 9:14 says, &ldquo;Christ...through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God.&rdquo; On the cross, Christ offered Himself in the body to God (Heb. 10:5, 10), yet He did it through the eternal Spirit. Hence His offering is eternal, without any limit of time. Therefore, in the eyes of God, Christ, the Lamb of God, was slain from the foundation of the world (Rev. 13:8). His offering of Himself was once for all (Heb. 7:27), and the redemption accomplished through His death is eternal (Heb. 9:12), having an eternal efficacy.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Blood of Jesus the Son of God<br />Having an Eternal Efficacy</h2><p>The blood shed on the cross by the Lord Jesus Christ, the God-man, is the blood of Jesus the Son of God. First John 1:7 says that &ldquo;the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.&rdquo; When man sins, only human blood can wash away the human sin. Jesus is a man, and the blood He shed is the genuine human blood, qualified to redeem man. Furthermore, John did not say &ldquo;the blood of Jesus the Son of Man,&rdquo; but &ldquo;the blood of Jesus His [God&rsquo;s] Son.&rdquo; This indicates that the blood shed by Jesus on the cross is not only the human blood, but also God&rsquo;s blood (as mentioned in Acts 20:28), which has the surety of the unlimited power of God&rsquo;s divinity. His unlimited divinity makes the redeeming efficacy of His blood eternal and unlimited. Therefore, the redemption accomplished by Christ is an eternal redemption. By shedding His blood and dying once, He is able to redeem all those who believe in Him, in all times and in all places. The efficacy of the blood of Jesus the Son of God is universal and eternal, not bound by time and space. Therefore, by the blood of Jesus the Son of God and through the eternal Spirit of God, Christ accomplished an eternal, unlimited redemption.</p><h2 class="head1">XI. HIS BURIAL</h2><p>The Lord Jesus died, and in the evening of that day He was buried by two of His disciples, Joseph of Arimathea, a rich man, and Nicodemus. He was laid in the new tomb which Joseph had hewed in the rock for himself (Matt. 27:57-60; John 19:38-42), thus fulfilling the prophecy in Isaiah 53:9 concerning His being buried with the rich. Therefore He rested in the new tomb. On the next day, fearing that the Lord&rsquo;s disciples might come and steal Him away and say to people that He had risen from the dead, the Jewish chief priests and the Pharisees obtained permission from the Roman governor Pilate to seal the stone that blocked the grave and secured the grave with the guard (Matt. 27:62-66).</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>From eternity Jesus Christ was the complete God. He was the Word that was with God as God&rsquo;s explanation; He was also the only begotten Son as God&rsquo;s expression. Moreover, He was the Author of life, and in Him was the eternal life of God. In time, about four thousand years after the creation of man, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit of God with the divine element (essence) in the womb of a chaste virgin with the human element (essence), and born as a God-man of two natures, the divine nature and the human nature. He is the genuine God and a real man; He is a God-man. He was born in the reign of the Roman emperor Caesar Augustus in the city of Bethlehem in Judea, and was laid in a manger. On the eighth day He was circumcised and named, and after twenty-five days He was presented to God. Shortly afterwards He fled to Egypt and again returned to the land of Israel. He then lived in the small city of Nazareth in the despised province of Galilee and grew up to be a despised Nazarene. When He was baptized at about thirty years of age, He was anointed with the Holy Spirit by God. Following this, He was tempted by the Devil and He overcame. His human living was the living of the mingling of God and man, a living in which the Triune God with all His virtues was lived out from within humanity and was manifested in human form. He was the all-inclusive One with four aspects: God, Man, King, and Servant. His ministry comprised: (1) preaching the gospel to save sinners; (2) teaching people, enlightening those who are in darkness that they may have the light of life; (3) performing miracles and wonders by calling things not being as being, ruling over the winds and the sea, casting out demons, healing the sick, cleansing the leper, and raising the dead, proving that He is the Lord of life who is able to bring people out of death into life; and (4) expressing God that God may be expressed in Him among men. After He ministered and worked for three and a half years, He was crucified according to the year and date prophesied in the Scriptures, accomplishing an all-inclusive death with a sevenfold status: (1) as the Lamb of God, taking away the sin of men; (2) as a man in the flesh, condemning sin and dealing with the flesh of sin; (3) as the last Adam, a man in the old creation, crucifying our old man on the cross; (4) as a brass serpent, destroying the ancient serpent, Satan, with his world; (5) as the Firstborn of all creation, terminating the entire old creation and reconciling all things to God; (6) as the Peacemaker, abolishing all the separating ordinances of the law; and (7) as a grain of wheat, falling into the ground and dying, thus releasing the divine life that those who believe in Him may become the many grains for the constitution of His Body. Thus He accomplished an eternal redemption. After His death, He was buried by a disciple, a rich man, in his new tomb, and thus He rested.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>What was the person of Jesus Christ in eternity past?</li><li>Explain the status of Jesus Christ.</li><li>Explain the conception of Jesus Christ.</li><li>Explain the human living of Jesus Christ.</li><li>What are the four aspects of Jesus Christ portrayed in the four Gospels?</li><li>State briefly the ministry of Jesus Christ.</li><li>State briefly the all-inclusive death of Jesus Christ on the cross.</li><li>How did the Lord Jesus accomplish an eternal redemption?</li></ol><p>(This lesson is relatively long and may be divided into two sections and taught in two sessions on the same day.)</p><h1 class="series">TRUTH LESSONS&mdash;LEVEL ONE</h1><h1 class="msg">LESSON NINETEEN</h1><h1 class="title">A KEY VIEW OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(3)</h1><h1 class="subtitle">JESUS CHRIST</h1><h1 class="subtitle">(2)</h1><h1 class="subtitle">FROM HIS RESURRECTION<br />TO HIS ETERNITY FUTURE</h1><h1 class="title">OUTLINE</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>His resurrection:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>The process of His resurrection.</li><li>The achievements of His resurrection.</li><li>His breathing into the disciples in resurrection.</li><li>His presence with the disciples in resurrection.</li></ol></li><li>His ascension:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Ascending above all the heavens.</li><li>To fill all things.</li><li>Sitting down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.</li><li>Enthroned and crowned.</li><li>His offices and ministry in heaven:<ol class="decimal"><li>As Lord and Christ.</li><li>As Head over all things.</li><li>As the Baptizer in the Holy Spirit.</li><li>As the Giver of spiritual gifts.</li><li>As a Leader and Savior.</li><li>As the Mediator and Surety of the better covenant.</li><li>As a Minister of the true tabernacle in the heavens.</li><li>As the High Priest.</li><li>As an Advocate.</li><li>As the Ruler of the kings of the earth.</li><li>As the Opener of the mystery of the new covenant.</li></ol></li><li>The length of His stay in heaven.</li></ol></li><li>His second coming:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>First coming secretly from heaven to the air.</li><li>Then coming openly from the air to the earth.</li><li>Dealing with the four groups of people on the earth today.</li><li>Binding and imprisoning Satan.</li><li>Setting up the millennial kingdom on the earth.</li><li>Purging the last rebellion of mankind.</li><li>Judging all the dead in the universe.</li></ol></li><li>His eternity future:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Being the entrance into the New Jerusalem.</li><li>Being the Husband of the New Jerusalem.</li><li>Being the temple of the holy city.</li><li>Being the lamp of the holy city.</li><li>Being the center of the holy city.</li><li>Being the supply of the holy city.</li></ol></li><li>Conclusion.</li></ol><h1 class="title">TEXT</h1><p>In this lesson we will continue to see Jesus Christ as the center of the New Testament, from His resurrection to His eternity future.</p><h2 class="head1">I. HIS RESURRECTION</h2><p>The Lord Jesus died and was buried for three days. Then very early on the first day of the week, the day after the Sabbath, He resurrected. At that time there was a great earthquake, and an angel of the Lord descended out of heaven and came and rolled away the stone which was against the entrance to the tomb (Matt. 28:1-2). Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is crucial to the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s divine economy. Its significance is profound and its contents extensive. In this lesson we can give only a brief account as follows:</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Process of His Resurrection</h2><p>First Peter 3:18 unveils what happened when the Lord Jesus died on the cross. The second half of the verse says that He was &ldquo;put to death in flesh, but made alive in spirit.&rdquo; The crucifixion put Christ to death only in His flesh, not in His spirit. His spirit did not die at the cross when His flesh did; His spirit rather became more active with the power of God&rsquo;s life, so that in this empowered spirit He went to Tartarus, the deep pit, to the fallen and imprisoned angels to proclaim God&rsquo;s victory through His incarnation in Christ and Christ&rsquo;s death in the flesh over Satan&rsquo;s scheme to derange the divine plan (1 Pet. 3:19 and notes). While the Lord Jesus was being put to death in the flesh, because His spirit became active by the empowering of God&rsquo;s life, He was resurrecting at the same time. When the Roman soldiers outwardly were executing the death penalty on Jesus, the Triune God&mdash;the Father, Son, and Spirit&mdash;was also doing the work of resurrection in Him. This is the beginning of the resurrection of Christ. Then, His divine power of resurrection set His soul free from Hades and enabled His body to leave the tomb; hence, His whole being&mdash; spirit, soul, and body&mdash;was resurrected (Acts 2:31-32). His resurrection began with His spirit, passed through His soul, and consummated in His body.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Achievements of His Resurrection</h2><p>The resurrection of the Lord Jesus was an exceedingly great accomplishment of His eternal redemption. The main achievements may be divided into seven items:</p><p>First, Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was God&rsquo;s vindication and approval of Him and His work. The Jews who persecuted Him said that the words He spoke and the things He did were a blasphemy to God and that He was liable to death (John 5:16-18; Matt. 26:64-66). They therefore killed Him on the cross. God, however, raised Him from the dead (Acts 3:15). This was God&rsquo;s vindication and approval, not only before the Jews but also before the whole universe, of Him and His work. Hence, He was also &ldquo;raised because of our justification&rdquo; (Rom. 4:25). This was a great accomplishment of His resurrection.</p><p>Second, Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was a sign of His universal success. Without resurrection, all that He had achieved before His resurrection would be nullified with His death. However, He had authority to lay down His life, and He had authority to take it again (John 10:18). Thus, His rising up from among the dead is a sign indicating that what He had done prior to His death was successful and that it has an eternal efficacy in His resurrection.</p><p>Third, Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was also His victory over death, including Satan, Hades, and the grave (Acts 2:24, 31; Heb. 2:14; Rev. 1:18). On the cross He tasted death on behalf of everything (Heb. 2:9), nullified death (2 Tim. 1:10), and destroyed and cast out Satan (John 12:31). Without resurrection, however, He could not show His victory over death (including Hades and the grave) and Satan.</p><p>Fourth, Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was His glorification. Through His resurrection, His divinity was released from the shell of His humanity which concealed His glory, enabling Him with His humanity to enter into the divine glory (Luke 24:26; 1 Cor. 15:43); hence, God glorified Him in resurrection (Acts 3:13, 15a).</p><p>Fifth, in His resurrection Christ was made the life-giving Spirit. He was God who is the Spirit (John 1:1; 4:24), incarnated (John 1:14), taking the form of human flesh (Phil. 2:6-7; Rom. 8:3). Through His death and resurrection He was transfigured to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), that He might impart God&rsquo;s life to His believers (John 3:15).</p><p>Sixth, in His resurrection Christ was born as the firstborn Son of God. He was the only begotten Son of God from eternity (John 1:18); then He was incarnated and was born to be the Son of Man (John 1:14), bringing God into man that divinity might be mingled with humanity. In resurrection He was begotten in His humanity to be the Son of God, that is, the firstborn Son of God (Acts 13:33; Rom. 8:29), bringing man into God that humanity might be mingled with divinity. In His flesh He was altogether a man; He was the Son of Man. His humanity needed to be begotten as the Son of God through death and resurrection that He might be the firstborn Son of God among many brothers. In His divinity He became flesh to be born as the Son of Man; in His humanity He entered into resurrection to be begotten as the firstborn Son of God. This is the twofold result of His two births in time.</p><p>Seventh, in His resurrection Christ caused His believers to be regenerated. Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was the germination of the new creation, and in this new creation God regenerated us (1 Pet. 1:3) that we might become the many sons of God (Heb. 2:10) to be God&rsquo;s new creation in resurrection, which is also the newborn child mentioned by the Lord in John 16:21. The many sons of God regenerated through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection are the many grains as His propagation, produced by Him as the grain of wheat that fell into the earth and died (John 12:24), and made into one bread to be His Body (1 Cor. 10:17), His church (Eph. 1:22-23). He, the Firstborn from among the dead and the Firstborn of God among many brothers, became in resurrection the Head of the Body, the church (Col. 1:18).</p><h2 class="head2">C. His Breathing into the Disciples<br />in Resurrection</h2><p>On the night of His resurrection the Lord Jesus came to the disciples and breathed Himself, the resurrected Christ, the pneumatic Christ, as breath into them (John 20:22). This breath was the holy breath, the Holy Spirit. He, as the Christ in resurrection, is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), so He could breathe Himself as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) into the disciples as their divine life and essence. Such a Christ who passed through death, entered into resurrection, and became the Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, breathed Himself into the disciples to be with them forever.</p><h2 class="head2">D. His Presence with the Disciples<br />in Resurrection</h2><p>After the Lord Jesus breathed Himself as the Spirit into the believers in resurrection, He was in them to be with them. This was His invisible presence with them, unlike His visible presence when He was in the flesh. After His resurrection, He appeared again and again to the disciples (Acts 1:3). His appearings and disappearings were to train them to know and experience His invisible presence. As the pneumatic Christ in them, His invisible presence was eternal (John 14:16).</p><h2 class="head1">II. HIS ASCENSION</h2><p>After His resurrection the Lord Jesus appeared to the disciples for forty days. Then, on Mount Olivet outside the city of Jerusalem, He was taken up in a cloud before the eyes of the disciples (Acts 1:9-11).</p><h2 class="head2">A. Ascending above All the Heavens</h2><p>In His ascension Christ ascended above all the heavens (Eph. 4:10) to the height of the universe (Eph. 4:8), far above all in the universe (Eph. 1:21) through the surpassingly great power of God (Eph. 1:19).</p><h2 class="head2">B. To Fill All Things</h2><p>Christ was God in heaven (John 3:13); then, He came to the earth as a God-man (1 Tim. 1:15; John 1:14), died in humanity with divinity, went down into Hades (Acts 2:31b), the depths of the earth (Eph. 4:9), was resurrected and came out of Hades with divinity and humanity, came back to the earth, and ascended above all the heavens that He might fill all things (Eph. 4:10) and be the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:23). This shows that His breadth and length and height and depth are immeasurable (Eph. 3:18).</p><h2 class="head2">C. Sitting Down on the Right Hand<br />of the Majesty on High</h2><p>After Christ ascended to the heavens, He was seated on the right hand of God, the Majesty on high (Psa. 110:1a; Heb. 1:3b). This indicates that He has finished His redemptive work on the earth and can thus sit down (Heb. 10:11-12), and also that He has overcome His enemies and is now sitting, waiting for God to make His enemies the footstool for His feet (Psa. 110:1b; Heb. 10:13; 1 Cor. 15:24-25).</p><h2 class="head2">D. Enthroned and Crowned</h2><p>When Christ ascended above all the heavens and sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high, He was given to sit on the throne of God&rsquo;s dominion (Rev. 3:21) to rule over and administrate the universe for God. Moreover, He was crowned with glory and honor (Heb. 2:9). Glory refers to the splendor related to Christ&rsquo;s person; honor refers to the preciousness of His worth and the dignity of His position.</p><h2 class="head2">E. His Offices and Ministry in Heaven</h2><p>When Christ ascended to heaven and sat on the throne of God, He was put into a number of important offices. Based upon these offices, He is carrying out His heavenly ministry unto eternity.</p><h2 class="head3">1. As Lord and Christ</h2><p>When Christ ascended, He was made both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:33-36). As God, the Lord was the Lord all the time (Luke 1:43; John 11:21; 20:28). But as man, He was made the Lord in His ascension after He brought His humanity into God in His resurrection. And as God&rsquo;s sent and anointed One, He was Christ since He was born (Luke 2:11; Matt. 1:16; John 1:41; Matt. 16:16). But as such a One, He was also officially made the very Christ of God in His ascension. He was made Lord, as the Lord of all, to possess all; He was also made Christ, as God&rsquo;s Anointed, to carry out God&rsquo;s commission and accomplish God&rsquo;s plan.</p><h2 class="head3">2. As Head over All Things</h2><p>It was in His humanity with His divinity that Christ was raised from the dead, was exalted to the heavenlies, was seated on the right hand of God, the Majesty, had all things subjected to Him, and was given to be Head over all things to the church (Eph. 1:20-22). It was through God&rsquo;s surpassingly great power that Christ received the headship in the whole universe. Thus, God has made Christ the Head over all things. Through all the dispensations of God in all the ages, all things will be headed up in Christ (Eph. 1:10) in the new heaven and new earth. This is God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</p><p>&ldquo;To the church&rdquo; implies a kind of transmission. Whatever Christ, the Head over all things and the Head of the church (Col. 1:18), has attained and obtained is transmitted to His Body, the church. In this transmission, the church shares with Christ all His attainments and obtainments. Only as the Head over all things can He transmit all that He has attained and obtained through His death, resurrection, and ascension, into us to be our portion for us to enjoy and experience. He exercises His authority and life as the Head to infuse all the riches of the Head into His believers, His members, that they may grow and function in the divine life and build up His Body (Eph. 4:13, 16).</p><h2 class="head3">3. As the Baptizer in the Holy Spirit</h2><p>Acts 2:33 says, &ldquo;Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He poured out this which you both see and hear.&rdquo; This tells how Christ became the Baptizer in the Holy Spirit. For this He was exalted by God and received the promise of the Holy Spirit. In His incarnation Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit, having the Holy Spirit as His essence inwardly; in His baptism Christ was anointed with the Spirit economically for His ministry on earth (Matt. 3:16; Luke 4:18). After His resurrection and ascension, He still needed to receive the Spirit economically again that He might be the Baptizer in the Holy Spirit (Matt. 3:11b) to pour Himself out upon all His believers, baptizing them into one Body (1 Cor. 12:13), to carry out His heavenly ministry on earth for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s economy. As the Baptizer in the Holy Spirit, He has also become the Giver of the Holy Spirit who gives, not by measure, the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, to those who believe in Him and are saved (John 3:34) to be their bountiful and immeasurable supply (Phil. 1:19).</p><h2 class="head3">4. As the Giver of Spiritual Gifts</h2><p>Through His death and resurrection, Christ rescued the captives out of Satan&rsquo;s captivity; then when Christ ascended to the height, He led them captive and presented them to God. In His ascension Christ received these saints, whom He had rescued through His death and resurrection, from God as gifts. Then He gave them as gifts&mdash;as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers&mdash;to the church for the perfecting of the saints unto the building up of His Body (Eph. 4:8-12). Thus, He becomes the Giver of spiritual gifts.</p><h2 class="head3">5. As a Leader and Savior</h2><p>In His ascension Christ was exalted by God to His right hand to be a Leader and Savior (Acts 5:31). Leader may also be rendered prince; in Greek it also means author (Acts 3:15; Heb. 12:2) or captain (Heb. 2:10). This indicates that Christ is the Author, the Captain, hence, the Leader, the Ruler. God exalted the Man Jesus, who was rejected and killed by the Jews, as the highest Leader and as the Ruler of the kings to rule over the world. At the same time, God also made Him the Savior. In His birth the angel announced Him as the Savior (Luke 2:11). In His ministry on earth He also took the status of the Savior (John 4:42). However, it was after His resurrection and in His ascension that God made Him officially the Savior, to save those who would repent and turn to God and who would believe in Him, according to the eternal redemption which He had accomplished. Leader is related to authority, and Savior, to salvation. As the Leader, Christ rules sovereignly over the earth with His authority that the environment might be fit for God&rsquo;s chosen people to receive Him as their Savior and enjoy His salvation.</p><h2 class="head3">6. As the Mediator and Surety<br />of the Better Covenant</h2><p>In His ascension Christ was made the Mediator and Surety of the new covenant. This better covenant, which is the new covenant Christ enacted for us (Matt. 26:28), was not only enacted upon better promises of a better law, the inner law of life (Heb. 8:6b, 10-12), but also consummated with Christ&rsquo;s better sacrifices (Heb. 9:23) and His better blood (Heb. 12:24). Thus, Christ became the Mediator and Surety of the better covenant between God and man, not only guaranteeing the eternal efficacy of this covenant but also executing all the rich bequests of this covenant into His believers.</p><h2 class="head3">7. As a Minister of the True Tabernacle<br />in the Heavens</h2><p>Hebrews 8:2 reveals that the ascended Christ is also a Minister of the holy places, even of the true tabernacle, in the heavens. Christ, as a Minister in the heavens, ministers heaven (which is not only a place, but also a condition of life) into us, that we may have the heavenly life and power to live a heavenly life on earth as He did while He was here.</p><h2 class="head3">8. As the High Priest</h2><p>When Christ ascended above all the heavens, He was also made the High Priest of the new covenant according to the order of Melchisedec (Heb. 5:9-10; 4:14; 7:28). Christ, as the High Priest, appears before God on our behalf, interceding for the believers and supplying them with the heavenly life, that they may enjoy His daily salvation to the uttermost (Heb. 7:25) and enter fully into God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p><h2 class="head3">9. As an Advocate</h2><p>First John 2:1 tells us that the heavenly Christ is also our Advocate before God; He is the righteous One, the only righteous Man among all men. His righteous act (Rom. 5:18) on the cross, that is, the act of dying to accomplish redemption according to the will of God, fulfilled the righteous requirement of the righteous God for us and all sinners. Only He is qualified to be our Advocate in heaven before God to care for us in our sinning condition and restore us to a righteous condition that our Father who is righteous might be appeased and that we may continue to live in the fellowship of God.</p><h2 class="head3">10. As the Ruler of the Kings of the Earth</h2><p>Revelation 1:5 refers to the Christ who has ascended above the heavens as the Ruler of the kings of the earth. This title indicates that He is far above all rule and authority of the earth. Hence, He is called King of kings and Lord of lords (Rev. 19:16), and He rules and reigns over all mankind on the earth to execute God&rsquo;s eternal kingdom to them.</p><h2 class="head3">11. As the Opener of the Mystery<br />of the New Covenant</h2><p>Revelation 5:5 also reveals that the Christ who has ascended to the heavenlies is the Opener of the mystery of the new covenant, the One who opens the seven seals prophesied in Revelation (Rev. 6:1; 8:1). He is the Lamb who has accomplished redemption for us and the Lion of Judah who has defeated God&rsquo;s enemy. Such a One alone is worthy to open the new covenant enacted by His blood (Rev. 5:5-6) to show us that the church redeemed by His shed blood will become His bride, His counterpart, to enjoy the marriage feast with Him (Rev. 19:7-9), and will become His holy army to fight Antichrist and his armies (Rev. 19:11-21) and then reign with Him in the millennial kingdom (Rev. 20:4-6), thus ushering in the new heaven and new earth and participating in the New Jerusalem as the ultimate expression of God (Rev. 21:1-3, 9-26; 22:1-5).</p><p>The above eleven items tell us of the different aspects of Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry according to the offices He received of God in His ascension.</p><h2 class="head2">F. The Length of His Stay in Heaven</h2><p>Acts 3:21 says, &ldquo;Whom heaven must indeed receive until the times of restoration of all things,&rdquo; that is, the coming age of the kingdom, the time of the millennial kingdom. This indicates that Christ will remain in the height of heaven to where He has ascended until the end of this age.</p><h2 class="head1">III. HIS SECOND COMING</h2><p>At the end of the church age, before the times of restoration of all things, Christ, who is carrying out His ministry according to His heavenly offices above all the heavens, will come back from heaven according to His promise (Matt. 24:33-44).</p><h2 class="head2">A. First Coming Secretly from Heaven to the Air</h2><p>At the end of the church age, before Christ will leave the height of heaven to where He has ascended, the overcoming saints will be raptured, before the great tribulation, to His throne in the heavens (Rev. 12:5-6; 14:1-4; Luke 21:36). Afterwards, Christ will descend from His heavenly throne to the air with the overcomers. This is the secret aspect of His <em>parousia</em> which will occur before the coming great tribulation. He will remain in the air for a period of time to accomplish three important things.</p><p>First, when Christ descends from heaven and remains in the air, He will receive up the majority of the believers who remain on earth during the great tribulation (1 Thes. 4:15-17).</p><p>Second, after He receives up the believers, Christ will judge all the believers in the air before His judgment seat to reward the faithful and overcoming ones and to punish the unfaithful and defeated ones (1 Cor. 4:5; 2 Cor. 5:10).</p><p>Third, He will marry the faithful and overcoming saints as His bride in the millennial kingdom to enjoy His marriage feast (Rev. 19:7-9).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Then Coming Openly<br />from the Air to the Earth</h2><p>After He accomplishes the above three things, Christ will descend from the air to the earth (Matt. 24:30) with the saints as His bride. This is the open aspect of His <em>parousia,</em> which will occur after the great tribulation.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Dealing with the Four Groups<br />of People on Earth Today</h2><p>First, Christ will receive up the believers. As those betrothed to Christ, the believers take Him as their Husband (2 Cor. 11:2). In His second coming, as mentioned earlier, Christ will receive them up to the air to judge them, rewarding the overcomers and punishing the defeated ones. He will marry the overcoming believers who match Him, that is, the overcoming church as His bride.</p><p>Second, He will destroy the religious system of Roman Catholicism and Christianity; He will also destroy the false believers. In His second coming, Christ will first use Antichrist, who will persecute religion, to burn and destroy (Rev. 17:16) the religious system of Roman Catholicism and Christianity, which is the system of Christendom and the mysterious, great religious Babylon mentioned in Revelation 17:5. Then He will send the angels to bind all the false believers, the tares spoken of in Matthew 13:25-26, into bundles and cast them into the furnace of the lake of fire (Matt. 13:30, 39-42). Thus He will become the Destroyer of the wicked and adulterous religion and of the false believers.</p><p>Third, Christ will save the people of Israel, the Jews. In Christ&rsquo;s second coming, Antichrist will lead the great armies of the nations to surround the people of Israel and Jerusalem to destroy them. At the very moment of peril, Christ will descend to defeat and slay Antichrist and his armies (Zech. 14:1-5, 12-14). Then the people of Israel will look to Him (Zech. 12:10), and He will be their Deliverer so that all Israel will be saved (Rom. 11:25-26).</p><p>Fourth, He will judge the Gentiles. In Christ&rsquo;s second coming, after He destroys Antichrist, who opposes God and persecutes God&rsquo;s people, and the armies of the nations who join him in doing evil, as mentioned in the preceding point, He will sit on His throne of glory to judge all the remaining Gentiles of the nations. Based upon their well-treatment or ill-treatment of God&rsquo;s people&mdash;the children of Israel and the believers who remain during the great tribulation&mdash;He will separate them into two groups, the &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; and the &ldquo;goats.&rdquo; The sheep will be justified and blessed and will enter into the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world, that is, the earthly part of the millennium, to be the people enjoying its blessings. The goats will be condemned and cursed and will go to the lake of fire to suffer eternal punishment (Matt. 25:31-46). Thus Christ will judge the inhabited earth in righteousness (Acts 17:31) before the millennial kingdom as the Judge of the living and the dead (Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1; 1 Pet. 4:5).</p><h2 class="head2">D. Binding and Imprisoning Satan</h2><p>After Christ in His second coming deals with the four groups of people on the earth, He will send an angel to bind Satan, cast him into the abyss, and shut him up for one thousand years (Rev. 20:1-3). Immediately after Satan&rsquo;s rebellion, God declared His judgment on him (Isa. 14:12-15). Since then God has been continuously executing His judgment (Luke 10:17-19; Heb. 2:14; Rev. 12:9, 12). Then in His second coming, Christ will further execute God&rsquo;s judgment pronounced on the rebellious Satan by binding and imprisoning him. After Christ removes God&rsquo;s rebel from the earth, He will clear up the rebellious earth that His kingdom, the kingdom of God, may come to the earth.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Setting up the Millennial Kingdom<br />on the Earth</h2><p>After Christ clears up the rebellious ones on the earth, He will set up the millennial kingdom, the kingdom of God and of Him, on the cleansed earth (Rev. 20:4-6; 11:15). The &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; who are justified and blessed will be the people in the earthly part of the millennium, that is, the kingdom of the Son of Man (Matt. 13:41). The saved Israelites will serve as priests in the earthly part to teach the people, &ldquo;the sheep,&rdquo; how to serve God (Zech. 8:20-23). The overcoming saints as Christ&rsquo;s bride will be in the heavenly part of the millennium, that is, the kingdom of the Father (Matt. 13:43), to reign with Christ and rule over the nations as the people for one thousand years (Rev. 2:26-27).</p><h2 class="head2">F. Purging the Last Rebellion of Mankind</h2><p>At the end of the millennium, Satan will be loosed out of his prison, the abyss. He will go out to deceive the nations, the people on the earth during the millennium, to follow him and to surround the camp pitched by the saints on earth and the city inhabited by the people of Israel, in his last struggle to rebel against God. Then fire will come down from heaven to devour them. The Devil who deceived the people will be cast into the lake of fire, where Antichrist and his false prophet also will be (Rev. 20:7-10). This is the last stage of Christ&rsquo;s execution of God&rsquo;s judgment on Satan; it is also the final clearing up of the rebellious poison which was injected into man by Satan. Thus, the purged nations may enter into the new heaven and new earth to be the blessed people of God forever.</p><h2 class="head2">G. Judging All the Dead in the Universe</h2><p>In Christ&rsquo;s second coming, the last thing He will do is to judge all the dead, including all the dead human beings imprisoned in Hades and all the dead demons confined in the sea (Rev. 20:11-15). Thus, Christ will sit on the great white throne to be the Judge of the dead human beings (Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1; 1 Pet. 4:5). At the same time, He will also judge the dead demons. After He has cast both the dead human beings and the dead demons into the lake of fire, the whole universe will be completely cleared up and the new heaven and new earth may be brought in.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. HIS ETERNITY FUTURE</h2><p>In His second coming Christ will use nearly one thousand years to thoroughly clean up the whole universe and put it in order. Then the new heaven and new earth will be brought in, and its center will be the New Jerusalem composed of all the people redeemed by God throughout all generations. Everything of Christ&rsquo;s eternal future is in the New Jerusalem.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Being the Entrance into the New Jerusalem</h2><p>The coming New Jerusalem is the ultimate crystallization of the mingling of the processed Triune God with men who have been redeemed and transformed by God with the divine elements of His divine Trinity in the different dispensations of the old creation, to be an organism to express Him in eternity future. The essence of the divine nature of God the Father, who is the origin and source of everything, like the precious and pure gold, is the very substance of the divine organism. The all-inclusive, glorious Christ as the embodiment of the divine Trinity, who has passed through an all-inclusive death and has entered into a resurrection which is rich in the divine life and the life-generating power to produce a result like pearls with glory and beauty, is the entrance into the divine organism. The saints, who are regenerated and transformed with all the divine elements by the Spirit, as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God, like the valuable and splendid precious stones, constitute the wall and the wall&rsquo;s foundation. Christ as the entrance into this divine organism is the key uniting factor of this divine organism. Christ as such an entrance will be completely and fully expressed in His eternity.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Being the Husband of the New Jerusalem</h2><p>Revelation 21:9 refers to the New Jerusalem as the wife of the Lamb, indicating that Christ is the Husband of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2). The New Jerusalem comes out of the Lamb, who has accomplished an eternal redemption, and returns to Him to be one with Him, as Eve came out of Adam and returned to Adam to be one with him.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Being the Temple of the Holy City</h2><p>Revelation 21:22 says, &ldquo;And I saw no temple in it, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.&rdquo; There is no temple in the New Jerusalem; the Lord God the Almighty and Christ the Lamb are its temple. This temple, according to the original text, does not refer to the entire temple including the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies; rather, it refers to the inner temple, the Holy of Holies. This inner temple is the almighty God and Christ as the Lamb, signifying that God and Christ Themselves will be the place in which we serve God in the new heaven and new earth. The holy city as the tabernacle of God (Rev. 21:3) is for God to dwell in, and God and the Lamb as the temple are for us to dwell in (cf. Psa. 27:4; 92:13). In the new heaven and new earth, the holy city New Jerusalem will be a mutual dwelling place for both God and man for eternity.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Being the Lamp of the Holy City</h2><p>Revelation 21:23 says, &ldquo;And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.&rdquo; The glory of God illuminating the city indicates that God is the light shining in the holy city. The Lamb as the lamp shines with God as the light to illumine the city with the glory of God, and through the city He shines over the nations around it (Rev. 21:24). In the millennium the light of the sun and the moon will be intensified (Isa. 30:26). The sun and the moon will be in the new heaven and new earth, but they will not be needed in the New Jerusalem, for God, the divine light, will shine much more brightly, far above the natural light of the sun and moon. In eternity future, God as the transcendent light will shine over the entire city through the Lamb-Christ, and He will also shine out of the holy city over the nations, the citizens on the new earth. Thus, the nations will walk in the shining of the holy city.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Being the Center of the Holy City</h2><p>Revelation 22:1 says, &ldquo;...a river of water of life...proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.&rdquo; God and the Lamb are one, because God is the light and the Lamb is the lamp; the light is in the lamp, and the two are one. God and the Lamb are just one&mdash;the redeeming God. The throne of God and the Lamb is the throne of the redeeming God, the throne of the Lamb-Christ. The river of water of life in the holy city flows as a spiral through the entire city. This indicates that the throne, out from which flows the river of water of life, is the center of the holy city; the redeeming God who sits on the throne is the Lamb-Christ, who of course will be the center of the holy city. The temple is for God&rsquo;s expression; the throne is for God&rsquo;s administration. God&rsquo;s throne of administration is in the temple of His expression. This indicates that in the coming eternity the Lamb-Christ will be God&rsquo;s Administrator in the center of the New Jerusalem, that God&rsquo;s expression may extend to the circumference of the holy city.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Being the Supply of the Holy City</h2><p>In the preceding text we have seen that there is a river of water of life flowing as a spiral through the entire city. On this side and on that side of the river is the tree of life, signifying Christ as life, producing twelve fruits for the supply and satisfaction of the entire city (Rev. 22:2)&mdash;all the redeemed ones throughout all generations. This portrays how the processed Triune God&mdash;God, the Lamb, and the Spirit, symbolized by the water of life&mdash;dispenses Himself as the immeasurable One, embodied in the all-inclusive Christ, to His redeemed under His headship to be their supply and satisfaction unto eternity. Furthermore, the leaves of the tree of life, which tree signifies Christ, will be for the healing of the restored nations, who will be God&rsquo;s people forever on the new earth (Rev. 22:2), to enable them to live forever.</p><p>The items discussed briefly above present a general sketch to show us that in eternity future the all-inclusive, glorious Christ as the embodiment of the divine Trinity is incomparably glorious and full of the abundant life to the uttermost in the various aspects of His manifestation as our eternal, immeasurable supply and enjoyment. He is worthy to receive our eternal appreciation and worship!</p><h2 class="head1">V. CONCLUSION</h2><p>Jesus Christ as revealed in the New Testament is the God-man, the union and mingling of the entire Triune God and the complete tripartite man, mysterious, wonderful, rich, bountiful, all-inclusive, and immeasurable. He is the center of the entire New Testament economy of God and the contents of the whole New Testament. We can never exhaust Him in words. He needs the church which is rich in His life to testify Him in this age, the kingdom which is full of His authority and power to exalt Him in the next age, and the New Jerusalem which will be overflowing with His fullness to express Him in eternity fully, completely, multifariously, and eternally! He is truly worthy to receive our worship, exaltation, praise, and love without limit and without end unto the age of the ages!</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>Christ&rsquo;s resurrection began with His spirit, passed through His soul, and consummated in His body. Its achievements consist of seven items: God&rsquo;s vindication and approval of Him and His work; the sign of His universal success; His victory over death, including Satan, Hades, and the grave; the release of the glory of His divinity, which was concealed in the shell of His human body, enabling Him to enter into the divine glory with humanity; His becoming the life-giving Spirit; His being born as God&rsquo;s Firstborn with humanity; and the regeneration of His believers that they may become God&rsquo;s many sons to be His Body, the church. On the night of resurrection after He came to the disciples and breathed Himself as breath into them to be their divine life and essence, He stayed with them for forty days, appearing and disappearing, to train them to experience His invisible presence. Afterwards, He ascended to the height of the heavens that He might fill all things, and was seated at the right hand of God, enthroned and crowned, and received many important offices. According to these offices He is carrying out His heavenly ministry as Lord and Christ, Head over all things, the Baptizer in the Holy Spirit, the Giver of spiritual gifts, a Leader and Savior, the Mediator and Surety of the new covenant, a Minister of the true tabernacle in the heavens, the High Priest, an Advocate, the Ruler of the kings of the earth, and the Opener of the mystery of the new covenant, until the time of the restoration of all things.</p><p>His second coming has two aspects: from the heavenly throne to the air secretly and from the air to the earth openly. Before the secret aspect begins, the overcoming and early-matured believers will be raptured to His throne in heaven. Then Christ will bring them with Him to descend secretly from heaven to the air, where they will stay for a period of time, and where also the majority of the saints will be raptured and judged. The overcoming believers will be married to Christ to be His bride in the millennium and to enjoy His marriage feast. Following the secret aspect, the open aspect of His second coming will begin. He will bring the overcoming believers from the air to the earth. First, He will smite Antichrist and his armies and then save the people of Israel, judge the Gentiles of the nations living on earth, bind and imprison Satan in the abyss for one thousand years, and establish the millennial kingdom. At the end of the millennium, He will destroy the group of people involved in mankind&rsquo;s last rebellion against God, and He will cast the Devil, who had been loosed from the abyss to deceive the people, into the lake of fire, thus completing God&rsquo;s declared judgment on Satan. Following this, Christ will sit on the great white throne to judge all the dead in the universe, including the dead human beings on earth and the dead demons in the sea, and will make the entire universe orderly and clean. Thus, the new heaven and new earth will be brought in and eternity future will also begin. Christ will be the Husband of the New Jerusalem, the composition and mingling of all those redeemed in the different dispensations of the old creation with the processed Triune God. Thus, Christ will be one with all the redeemed and will be the entrance for them to enter into the divine organism. He will also be the temple, the lamp, the center, and the supply for their enjoyment and experience eternally. This is Christ&rsquo;s eternity future, divine, glorious, transcendent, and boundless!</p><p>This Christ is the God-man, the mingling and union of the Triune God and the tripartite man. He is so rich, bountiful, and all-inclusive. He needs the church which is rich in His life to testify Him in this age, the kingdom that is full of His authority and power to exalt Him in the coming age, and the New Jerusalem which is filled with His glory to express Him completely and eternally in eternity! He is worthy of our worship, exaltation, praise, and love forever!</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>Explain the process of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection from its beginning to its completion.</li><li>Explain the two births of Christ in time.</li><li>Enumerate the seven items achieved through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</li><li>To where did Christ ascend?

HIS PERSON</h2><p>The person of the Lord Jesus is multifaceted and all-inclusive.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Creator</h2><p>The Lord Jesus is the Creator (Heb. 1:10). All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being (John 1:3). All things were created in Him, through Him, and unto Him (Col. 1:16), and He also upholds all things by the word of His power (Heb. 1:3).</p><h2 class="head2">B. God&mdash;the Son of God</h2><p>The Lord Jesus is God. Romans 9:5 says, &ldquo;Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever.&rdquo; John 1:1 and 14 also say, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God....And the Word became flesh.&rdquo; Therefore, the Lord Jesus is the complete God who became flesh. He is the Son of God (John 20:31; Rom. 1:4a); He is the embodiment of God, the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily (Col. 2:9); and He is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory, the express image of God&rsquo;s substance (Heb. 1:3).</p><p>When the Lord Jesus came to the earth, outwardly He appeared very lowly. Because He used the flesh as a veil to conceal God&rsquo;s glory, men could not see that He was God&rsquo;s glory. Yet He was the very embodiment of the most high God of glory.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Man&mdash;the Son of Man</h2><p>The Lord Jesus is a man (1 Tim. 2:5). He is the perfect man, the Son of Man who was born of the virgin Mary (Matt. 1:23; Luke 19:10), and who, becoming in the likeness of men (Phil. 2:7), lived as a man. Men saw Him as a carpenter (Mark 6:3). He hungered, thirsted, rejoiced, became angry, and also wept. He was loving, compassionate, sympathetic, condescending, patient, and forgiving toward people. He was without sin; even He knew no sin (2 Cor. 5:21). He was a genuine man. After His resurrection, He was still a man (Luke 24:39-43); in His ascension He is still a man (Acts 7:56); at His coming back He will still be a man (Matt. 26:64); and even in eternity He will still be a man (John 1:51).</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Redeemer</h2><p>The Lord Jesus is the Redeemer. Matthew 20:28 says, &ldquo;The Son of Man came...to give His life a ransom for many.&rdquo; All have sinned and come short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23) and are under God&rsquo;s condemnation. According to the requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness, without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins (Heb. 9:22). The Lord Jesus took on a body of blood and flesh, and He gave His life and shed His blood on the cross to be the ransom for many. Thus He satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirement and redeemed us from under the curse of the law (Gal. 3:13). With His precious blood He redeemed us (1 Pet. 1:18-19; Rev. 1:5). Therefore He is our Redeemer.</p><h2 class="head2">E. The Savior</h2><p>The Lord Jesus is not only the Redeemer but also the Savior (Luke 2:11). Man has a twofold problem: on the one hand, man has the problem of the charges of sin against him before God; on the other hand, he has the problem of the sinful nature. Therefore, man has this twofold need: first, concerning the problem of outward position, law, and the charges of sin, there is the need for the redemption of the blood of Christ; second, concerning the problem of the old life and sinful nature within man, there is the need for another life, a transcendent life, to enter into man to save him from his fallen life.</p><p>On the one hand, the Lord Jesus as the Redeemer accomplished redemption for us by His death; on the other hand, He rose from the dead to enter into us to be our Savior of life. Romans 5:10 tells us that while we were enemies of God, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, that is, through His redeeming death on the cross. This means that the charges of sin against us before God were removed, and we were redeemed. This is the redeeming aspect. Romans 5:10 also indicates that, since we were reconciled to God, we need to be saved much more in the life of the resurrected Christ. This is the saving aspect. To be redeemed is outward, objective, and once for all; to be saved is inward, subjective, and daily for our whole life long.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Jesus</h2><p>After the Lord Jesus was born, according to God&rsquo;s ordination He was named Jesus, which means &ldquo;Jehovah the Savior,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah the salvation.&rdquo; This indicates that He is Jehovah God in the Old Testament becoming man&rsquo;s Savior and man&rsquo;s salvation to save God&rsquo;s people from their sins (Matt. 1:21).</p><h2 class="head2">G. Christ</h2><p>The Lord Jesus is also Christ (Matt. 16:16; John 20:31), the Messiah anointed by God (the anointed One, John 1:41), the Christ appointed by God (Acts 2:36) and commissioned by God to accomplish God&rsquo;s plan (Eph. 3:11; 1:10).</p><h2 class="head2">H. The Lord</h2><p>The Lord Jesus is the Lord. While the Lord Jesus was on the earth, the Bible confirms that He was the Lord. When the Lord Jesus was born, the angel declared that &ldquo;a Savior was born to you today in David&rsquo;s city, who is Christ the Lord&rdquo; (Luke 2:11). Moreover, when John the Baptist came, he was to prepare the way of the Lord and make His paths straight (Matt. 3:3). The &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; in the New Testament equals Jehovah in the Old Testament (compare Matt. 4:7 and Deut. 6:16). Jehovah is the divine title of the Triune God (Exo. 3:15). Therefore, the fact that Christ is called Lord proves that He is the Triune God (John 20:28).</p><h2 class="head2">I. The Resurrected Lord</h2><p>After the Lord Jesus died and was resurrected (1 Cor. 15:3-4), the disciples saw Him and called Him Lord (John 20:18, 25, 28); at this time He was the resurrected Lord. Eventually, in His ascension, standing in the position of a man, He was made Lord by God (Acts 2:36); that is, God made Him the Lord of all things, to whom are all things, and the Lord of all men, unto whom are all men (Acts 10:36).</p><h2 class="head2">J. The Life-giving Spirit</h2><p>First Corinthians 15:45b says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus is this last Adam who became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection to enter into His disciples to be their life (1 John 5:12) and to be joined to them as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). Today He is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17) to dispense God&rsquo;s life to all who believe in Him.</p><h2 class="head2">K. The Life</h2><p>In John 11:25 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am...the life.&rdquo; This life is God&rsquo;s eternal life. The Lord Jesus came that man may have life, the eternal life of God, and may have it abundantly (John 10:10). When man receives Him, He enters into him to be his life (John 3:15).</p><h2 class="head2">L. The Resurrection</h2><p>In John 11:25 the Lord Jesus also said, &ldquo;I am the resurrection.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus is the resurrection. Resurrection is in contrast to death in particular; resurrection is that which passes through death and triumphs over death. The Lord Jesus passed through the death of the cross and entered into Hades, and then He came out of Hades and triumphed over the power of death (Acts 2:24). Therefore, He is the resurrection. Today the life within all the believers is the resurrection life which has the power of resurrection (Phil. 3:10).</p><h2 class="head1">II. HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Incarnation</h2><p>The first major step in the Lord Jesus&rsquo; accomplishments was incarnation (John 1:14; Heb. 2:14a). He was conceived of the Holy Spirit, who is God Himself reaching man, and who entered into the womb of the virgin Mary to be mingled with humanity (Matt. 1:18, 20). After remaining there for a period of nine months, He was born. At that time there was an extraordinary man, a God-man, on the earth. He was God yet also man; He was both God and man. In Him was not only humanity, but also divinity. Therefore, through His incarnation He brought God into man.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Human Experience</h2><p>The second major step in the Lord Jesus&rsquo; accomplishments was His experience of human life. As a man He lived in a lowly home (cf. Isa. 53:2) and lived among the human race for over thirty years. He came in contact with various kinds of people: the moral (John 3:1), the immoral (John 4:17-18), the dying (John 4:47), the sick and impotent (John 5:5), the hungry (John 6:26-27), the thirsty (John 7:37), those under the bondage of sin (John 8:3, 34), the blind (John 9:1), and even the dead (John 11:39). He also experienced human sufferings, sorrows, despisings, rejections (Isa. 53:3), trials, and temptations (Heb. 2:18; 4:15), and He even wept (John 11:35). He passed through all these tests. It is in His humanity with divinity that He passed through all the things of the human life.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Death</h2><p>The third major step in the Lord Jesus&rsquo; accomplishments was death (1 Cor. 15:3). His death was the death of a God-man, an all-inclusive death. He died as One with a sevenfold status: the Lamb of God (John 1:29), a man in the flesh (Rom. 8:3), the brass serpent (John 3:14), the old man in Adam (1 Cor. 15:45a), the Firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15), the Peacemaker (Eph. 2:14), and a grain of wheat (John 12:24). His death terminated all the negative things in the universe: sins, the flesh, the Devil&mdash;the old serpent&mdash;with the world belonging to him, the old man, the old creation, and all the separating ordinances and customs; His death also released His divine life to us. Thus He accomplished His eternal redemption (Heb. 9:12; 10:12).</p><h2 class="head2">D. Resurrection</h2><p>The fourth major step of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; accomplishments was that He rose from the dead (1 Cor. 15:4). His resurrection was God&rsquo;s vindication and approval of Him and His work to be a proof of our justification before God (Rom. 4:25); it was also a mark of His universal success. His resurrection demonstrated that He triumphed over Satan, death, Hades, and the grave (Heb. 2:14; Acts 2:31). Through His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) to impart God&rsquo;s life to us (John 3:15) and regenerate us (1 Pet. 1:3). Thus, having nullified death through His death, He brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel in His resurrection (2 Tim. 1:10).</p><h2 class="head2">E. Breathing the Spirit of Life into the Believers</h2><p>The fifth major step of Christ&rsquo;s accomplishments was that in resurrection He came back to the disciples and breathed into them that they might receive the Holy Spirit essentially (John 20:22), who is the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), the life-giving Spirit whom He has become in resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45b), to be their life and the essence of the new creation (1 John 5:12; 2 Cor. 5:17).</p><h2 class="head2">F. Ascension</h2><p>The sixth major step of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; accomplishments was that He ascended and sat at the right hand of God, far above all in the universe (Mark 16:19; Eph. 1:20-21), was made both Lord and Christ by God (Acts 2:36), and became the Head over all things and the Head of the church (Eph. 1:22; Col. 1:18).</p><h2 class="head2">G. Pouring Out the Spirit of Power<br />upon the Believers, Baptizing Them into His Body</h2><p>The seventh major step of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; accomplishments was that He poured out the Spirit of power economically after His ascension (Acts 2:33), first on the day of Pentecost, baptizing the Jewish believers into the Spirit (Acts 2:4), and later in the house of Cornelius, baptizing the Gentile believers into the Spirit (Acts 10:44-45). By these two steps He baptized all the believers once for all into the Spirit and into His one Body (1 Cor. 12:13).</p><p>All these seven items of His accomplishments were accomplished once for all and have become accomplished facts.</p><h2 class="head1">III. HIS ATTAINMENTS</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Height of the Universe</h2><p>God raised Christ to the highest position, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is coming (Eph. 1:21). Christ ascended to the height of the universe far above all things, transcending time and space.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Peak of the Divine Attributes<br />and Human Virtues</h2><p>Christ is the God-man, having both the divine nature and the human nature. In His divine nature are the divine attributes, and in His human nature are the God-created human virtues (Phil. 4:8). Human virtues are the image of the divine attributes (Gen. 1:26-27) to express what God is. Christ was God; therefore, He possessed the divine attributes. Then He became a man; hence, He also possessed the human virtues. While He was on the earth, He as the God-man lived out the divine attributes in His human virtues, thus expressing what God is in humanity (Heb. 1:3a). Then in His resurrection He uplifted the human virtues that the divine attributes might be expressed in an uplifted way in this resurrected Man (Rom. 1:4). Finally, when He, as the God-man in resurrection, was exalted by God to the height of the universe, far above all, He attained the peak where He expresses the divine attributes in His human virtues to the highest degree, expressing what God is in His humanity in the universe unto all the generations of the age of the ages.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. HIS OBTAINMENTS</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Throne</h2><p>In His ascension, the Lord Jesus was seated at the right hand of the throne of God (Heb. 12:2). His throne is forever and ever (Heb. 1:8). In eternity He will be sitting with God on this throne (Rev. 22:1) forever and ever. This throne is the throne of authority for God&rsquo;s administration and also the throne of grace (Heb. 4:16). Authority is for Him to rule over all things for the church, and grace is for Him to dispense Himself into us. When we pray, we come before Him at this throne to contact Him.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Glory</h2><p>The Lord Jesus was glorified in resurrection (Luke 24:26) and crowned with glory in ascension (Heb. 2:9). Before His death He prayed to the Father, saying, &ldquo;Glorify Your Son,&rdquo; and also, &ldquo;...that they [the disciples] may behold My glory which You have given Me&rdquo; (John 17:1, 24). This prayer was fulfilled in His resurrection and ascension. His glorification was the manifestation of the God of glory from within Him to become His glory, thus making His person full of splendor.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Honor</h2><p>The Lord Jesus in His ascension was also crowned with honor (Heb. 2:9). Glory refers to the splendor related to His person; honor refers to the preciousness related to His worth and the dignity related to His position. In His ascension He has obtained both.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Name Which Is above Every Name</h2><p>In the Lord Jesus&rsquo; ascension, God bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth, and every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father (Phil. 2:9-11). The Lord&rsquo;s person is glorious, His worth is precious, His position is dignified, and His name is the highest, that God may be glorified.</p><h2 class="head2">E. The Lordship</h2><p>Acts 2:36 and 10:36 tell us that after the Lord&rsquo;s ascension God made Him Lord and gave Him the lordship over all things that He may be the Lord of all things and all men. This is for the salvation of the believers, the building of the church, and the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal plan.</p><h2 class="head2">F. The Rulership</h2><p>Acts 5:31 says that God has exalted the Lord Jesus to His right hand as a Leader, a Prince. Revelation 1:5 also says that after His death and resurrection He became the Ruler of the kings of the earth. Revelation 19:16 further says that He is Lord of lords. In His ascension the Lord Jesus received the kingship from God to be the highest Leader in God&rsquo;s administration, ruling over all the kings. This is for the spread of His gospel that God&rsquo;s chosen ones may be saved and that the church may be built, in order to accomplish God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p><h2 class="head1">V. HIS WORK IN THE PRESENT AGE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Giving Repentance and Forgiveness of Sins<br />to Save Sinners</h2><p>The first thing Christ did after His ascension was to give repentance and forgiveness of sins to men (Acts 5:31) that they might believe and be saved (Acts 16:31).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Building the Church</h2><p>Christ saves sinners in this age to make them His members for the building of the church (Matt. 16:18), His Body (Eph. 1:22b-23), that God may be manifested in Him and through the church (1 Tim. 3:15-16).</p><h2 class="head2">C. Establishing God&rsquo;s Kingdom</h2><p>In building the church in this age Christ is establishing the kingdom of God in the church (Matt. 16:18-19). The church life is the kingdom life (Rom. 14:17). As the kingdom of God in this age, the church is the place in which God rules and carries out His will on the earth (Matt. 6:10).</p><h2 class="head2">D. Being the Mediator of the New Covenant</h2><p>After Christ established the new covenant on the earth through His death (Matt. 26:28), He ascended to the heavens to be the Mediator of the new covenant (Heb. 8:6). Today He is executing the bequests in this new covenant, such as the efficacy of His all-inclusive death, the power of His resurrection, and His divine life with the law of this life, causing them to be our supply and enjoyment.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Being the Minister of the True Tabernacle</h2><p>In the heavens today Christ is also the Minister of the true tabernacle, ministering to all the believers the heavenly life and the heavenly supply of the divine riches (Heb. 8:1-2).</p><h2 class="head2">F. Being the High Priest of the Believers</h2><p>In the heavens today Christ is also our High Priest (Heb. 4:14), interceding before God for us that we may be saved to the uttermost (Heb. 7:24-26). He is also like Melchisedec (Heb. 6:20), supplying the bread of life and the wine to us who are still on the earth living and fighting for Him (Gen. 14:18).</p><h2 class="head2">G. Being the Advocate of the Believers</h2><p>In the heavens today Christ is also our Advocate before the righteous God (1 John 2:1-2). He is our propitiation. If we sin, He pleads for us by this propitiation to restore our interrupted fellowship with God, that we may once again abide in the divine fellowship, enjoying God as light and love.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. HIS WORK AT HIS COMING BACK</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Redeeming the Believers&rsquo; Body</h2><p>When the Lord comes again, descending from the heavens, He will transfigure the body of our humiliation according to the operation of Him who is able even to subject all things to Himself (Phil. 3:20-21), so that our body may be redeemed and we may enjoy the full sonship (Rom. 8:23). Our spirit has been regenerated and our soul is being transformed; when the Lord comes again He will transfigure our vile and corrupted body, conforming it to the body of His glory, that we may enter into His glory to enjoy God&rsquo;s full salvation (Eph. 1:5).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Restoring All Things</h2><p>When the Lord comes again He will restore all things. Because of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall, God&rsquo;s entire creation has come under the slavery of corruption and is subjected to vanity, and it is eagerly expecting that it will be freed into the freedom of the glory of the children of God. Furthermore, we who have enjoyed the firstfruit of the Spirit also groan in ourselves, eagerly expecting sonship, the redemption of our body, that we may enter into His glory (Rom. 8:20-23). In His second coming the Lord Jesus will not only redeem our body that we may enter into God&rsquo;s glory, but will also free the creation from the slavery of corruption that it may enjoy the freedom of glory that we will enjoy. Although the creation cannot share in the glory that we will enjoy, it will enjoy the freedom brought to it by our enjoyment of the glory in the restoration to be brought in by the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Bringing in God&rsquo;s Kingdom</h2><p>The Lord was resurrected and ascended to the heavens to receive the kingdom (Luke 19:12). At the end of this age, the Lord will receive the kingdom from God (Dan. 7:13-14) and will come back to the earth with God&rsquo;s kingdom (Luke 19:15). At that time the kingdom of this world will become the kingdom of God and of Christ (Rev. 11:15; 12:10), which will be the millennial kingdom in the coming age, in which the overcoming saints will reign with Him for one thousand years (Rev. 20:4).</p><h2 class="head1">VII. HIS WORK IN ETERNITY</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Being the Lamb Who Is One with God</h2><p>In eternity at the center of the holy city, New Jerusalem, is the throne of God and of the Lamb (Rev. 22:1). God and the Lamb are sitting on one throne, showing that the Lamb and God are one. In eternity He will be the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, to His redeemed people.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Being the Husband of the Redeemed</h2><p>In eternity all the redeemed people will be the wife of the Lamb, and the Lamb will be their Husband (Rev. 21:9, 2). This indicates that all the redeemed ones throughout the ages came out of Him and return to Him to become His counterpart that He may gain His beloved, just as Eve came out of Adam and returned to Adam to be his counterpart (Gen. 2:21-24).</p><h2 class="head2">C. Being the Temple<br />in Which the Redeemed Serve God</h2><p>In the New Jerusalem God and the Lamb are the temple in the city (Rev. 21:22). In the Old Testament God&rsquo;s chosen people first served Him in the tabernacle, then in the temple. In eternity the New Jerusalem will be the tabernacle of God (Rev. 21:3) as God&rsquo;s dwelling place, and the temple therein, which is just God and the Lamb, will be the place where the redeemed serve Him.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Being the Lamp of the Holy City</h2><p>The holy city has no need of the sun nor of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb (Rev. 21:23). In the holy city the Lamb is the lamp and God is the light shining from within to manifest God&rsquo;s glory.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Being the Supply of the Holy City</h2><p>In the holy city a river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. And on this side and on that side of the river is the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, and yielding its fruit each month (Rev. 22:1-2). The river of water of life signifies the Spirit of Christ saturating the holy city, and the tree of life signifies Christ as the life and life supply to the entire city.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Being the Healing of the Nations<br />on the New Earth</h2><p>In eternity, the leaves of the tree of life, which signifies Christ, are for the healing of the nations around the holy city (Rev. 22:2), that their restored natural man may live forever. In the Bible leaves are a symbol of man&rsquo;s deeds (Gen. 3:7). The leaves of the tree of life symbolize the deeds of Christ. The nations on the new earth will take the deeds of Christ as their guide and regulation outwardly, that they may live the human life forever.</p><h2 class="head1">VIII. CONCLUSION</h2><p>The gospel revealed in the New Testament is not a kind of doctrine or ism, nor is it a theory or a philosophy; neither is it any kind of blessing or benefit. The gospel is concerning a living person, the God-man, concerning what He is and does, and all that He has attained and obtained. In the early days the apostles and believers preached this mysterious and wonderful One as the gospel (Acts 5:42; 8:5). Therefore this gospel is not only called the gospel of Jesus Christ (Mark 1:1) and the gospel of Christ (Rom. 15:19; 2 Cor. 10:14), but also the gospel of the glory of Christ (2 Cor. 4:4). This gospel of glory, which is Christ Himself, is also called the gospel of God (Rom. 1:1; 2 Cor. 11:7), because it is planned and accomplished by God; the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 4:23; 24:14), because it brings in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens; the gospel of grace (Acts 20:24), because it brings to us the grace of life of the Triune God; the gospel of peace (Eph. 2:17; 6:15), because it brings peace between us and God and between man and man; and the gospel of salvation (Eph. 1:13), because it brings us salvation that we may be saved. This gospel is also called the glad tidings (Rom. 10:15) and is worthwhile for us to preach at every time and in every place throughout our whole life.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>The gospel of Jesus Christ is simply Jesus Christ Himself, with His person, His accomplishments, His attainments, His obtainments, and His work in this age, in the coming age, and in eternity, as the content. His person is multifaceted. He is the Creator of all things. He is God who is over all and blessed forever, the complete God, the Son of God, the embodiment of God, the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory, and the express image of God&rsquo;s substance. He is a man, the Son of Man, who was born of a virgin, possessing the human nature, a human body, and the human form, and who lived a human life on earth; after His resurrection He is still a man, and in eternity He will still be a man. He is the Redeemer who died and shed His blood to redeem us outwardly, objectively, once for all by His precious blood. He is also the Savior who resurrected from the dead to save us inwardly, subjectively, day by day, by His divine life. He is Jesus, who is Jehovah God coming to be our Savior and our salvation. He is Christ, the Messiah who was anointed by God to accomplish God&rsquo;s plan. He is also the Lord, who is Jehovah in the Old Testament, the very Triune God. After He died and was resurrected, men called Him Lord; hence, He is the resurrected Lord. When He ascended to the height of the heavens, as a man He was made Lord by God, that is, the Lord of all things, to whom are all things, and the Lord of all men, unto whom are all men. He is the life-giving Spirit who enters into His disciples to be their life and to be joined to them as one spirit. He is the life, God&rsquo;s eternal life, entering into us to be our life. He is the resurrection and He has overcome death to be the resurrection life and the resurrection power within us. He was incarnated and born as a God-man; He passed through all the experiences of human life; He died to accomplish redemption; He resurrected to give life; He breathed the Spirit of life into the believers to be their life; He ascended to heaven, was made both Lord and Christ, and became the Head of all things and of the church; and He poured out the Spirit of power upon the believers, baptizing them into His one Body. In ascension He attained to the height of the universe, far above all; He also attained to the peak of the divine attributes with the human virtues, expressing what God is in His humanity in the universe through all eternity. Furthermore, in His ascension He has obtained the throne, glory, honor, the name which is above every name, the lordship, and the rulership. Today in the heavens He gives repentance and forgiveness of sins to save sinners for the building of the church and the establishment of God&rsquo;s kingdom. Moreover, in the heavens He is also the Mediator of the new covenant, executing the bequests of the new testament; the Minister of the true tabernacle, ministering the heavenly life and the heavenly supply to the believers; the High Priest of the believers, interceding for them that they may be saved to the uttermost; and the Advocate of the believers, pleading for them before God to restore their interrupted fellowship with God. At His coming back He will redeem the believers&rsquo; body, conforming it to the body of His glory, and He will also restore all things and bring in God&rsquo;s kingdom. In eternity He will be the Lamb who is one with God, the Husband of the redeemed, and the temple in which they serve God; He will also be the lamp shining in the holy city, the supply nourishing the holy city, and the healing of the nations on the new earth for eternity. The early apostles and believers preached such a Christ as the gospel. This gospel is not only called the gospel of Jesus Christ and the gospel of Christ, but also the gospel of the glory of Christ; moreover, it is called the gospel of God, the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens, the gospel of grace, the gospel of peace, and the gospel of salvation. Therefore, the gospel is called the glad tidings and is worthwhile for us to preach at every time and in every place throughout our whole life!</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>State the various aspects of the Lord&rsquo;s person.</li><li>Explain the difference between the Lord&rsquo;s being the Redeemer and His being the Savior.</li><li>State the seven items of the Lord&rsquo;s accomplishments.</li><li>State the six points of the Lord&rsquo;s obtainments in His ascension.</li><li>What is the Lord&rsquo;s work in this age?</li><li>What will be the Lord&rsquo;s work at His coming back?</li><li>What will be the Lord&rsquo;s work in eternity?</li></ol><p>(This lesson may be divided into two sections and taught in two sessions on the same day.)</p><h1 class="series">TRUTH LESSONS&mdash;LEVEL ONE</h1><h1 class="msg">LESSON TWENTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">A KEY VIEW OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(5)</h1><h1 class="subtitle">APOSTLES, PROPHETS, EVANGELISTS,<br />AND SHEPHERD-TEACHERS</h1><h1 class="head1">OUTLINE</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Apostles:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>The meaning of apostles.</li><li>The first twelve apostles.</li><li>Other apostles.</li><li>The work of the apostles:<ol class="decimal"><li>Going out to preach the word of God.</li><li>Establishing churches.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Prophets:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>The meaning of prophets.</li><li>The ministry of the prophets:<ol class="decimal"><li>Bringing in God&rsquo;s revelation.</li><li>Edifying the believers and building up the church.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Evangelists:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>The meaning of evangelists.</li><li>The work of the evangelists.</li></ol></li><li>Shepherd-teachers:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>The meaning of shepherd-teachers.</li><li>The work of the shepherd-teachers.</li></ol></li><li>Conclusion:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Perfecting the saints directly.</li><li>Building up the church indirectly.</li></ol></li></ol><h1 class="title">TEXT</h1><p>Concerning the work of the ministry, Ephesians 4:12-13 says that it is to minister Christ to men for the building up of the Body of Christ, the church, until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. This is God&rsquo;s work in His New Testament economy. This is the focus of God&rsquo;s work in the New Testament, which especially stresses the building up of the Body of Christ.</p><p>For such a building work of the Body of Christ, God has particularly separated a group of people and given them as gifts to the church. Ephesians 4:8 says, &ldquo;Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.&rdquo; &ldquo;Gifts&rdquo; here does not refer to the gifts given by the Holy Spirit to the individuals (Rom. 12:6-8; 1 Cor. 12:8-11); it refers to the gifted persons&mdash;apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers. After rescuing men from Satan and death through His death and resurrection, Christ in His ascension, with His resurrection life and through the Holy Spirit, gave spiritual abilities to His rescued ones that they might build up His Body; He also separated some from among them and gave them as gifts to the church to perfect the saints for the building up of His Body. Ephesians 4:11 tells us that the ascended Christ gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherd-teachers to the church.</p><h2 class="head1">I. APOSTLES</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Meaning of Apostles</h2><p>&ldquo;Apostle&rdquo; in Greek means the sent one. An apostle of the Lord is a believer who is called and sent out by God through the will of God (1 Cor. 1:1; Eph. 1:1) and according to the command of God and of Christ (1 Tim. 1:1), with the authority of God to preach the gospel of God, to teach the divine truths, and to establish churches. Apostles are the greatest gifts given by Christ to the church, and they are also placed by God in the highest office in the universal church (1 Cor. 12:28; Rom. 1:5). They are not ordained by man, but appointed by God Himself; not sent out by man, but sent out directly by God. God appoints the apostles in particular and sends them out to work for God in different places and establish churches (Acts 8:14, 25; 13:2; 14:21-23).</p><h2 class="head2">B. The First Twelve Apostles</h2><p>While the Lord Jesus worked on earth to fulfill His ministry, He chose twelve disciples to continue His work and called them apostles (Luke 6:13; Mark 3:13-14; 6:30). They occupied a special place in God&rsquo;s economy. The Bible refers to them not only as apostles, but also as the twelve apostles (Rev. 21:14). Concerning them, the Lord said, &ldquo;That you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom; and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel&rdquo; (Luke 22:30). Thus, they occupied a special place which is not shared by the other workers of God. Christ has a particular throne, and they also have their twelve thrones. Judas lost his apostleship due to his betrayal of the Lord; therefore, God chose Matthias to rank with the other eleven (Acts 1:25-26). In eternity the names of the twelve apostles will be written on the foundations of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:14), indicating that they will occupy a special place among the redeemed even unto eternity.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Other Apostles</h2><p>Many people think that only the Twelve were apostles. Actually, besides the Twelve there were many other apostles. Ephesians 4 tells us clearly that the Lord Jesus in His ascension gave some apostles as gifts to the church. These clearly were not the original Twelve, for they were appointed when the Lord Jesus was still on earth.</p><p>Immediately following the descending of the Spirit, the twelve apostles carried on the work from Acts chapter two to chapter twelve. Then in chapter thirteen we are told that there were in the church in Antioch prophets and teachers and as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, &ldquo;Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them&rdquo; (Acts 13:1-2). This was the Holy Spirit sending men out for the work; He sent Paul and Barnabas out from Antioch. Then in Acts 14:4, when they were in Iconium, they were referred to as apostles. This shows us that the workers sent out by the Holy Spirit were apostles. Although they were not among the Twelve, Paul and Barnabas were also apostles. Aside from the Twelve, the Holy Spirit is still sending out apostles for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p><p>In the New Testament, not only Barnabas and Paul were apostles, but many others also were raised up by the Holy Spirit to become such apostles. Silas and Timothy (1 Thes. 1:1; 2:6) were referred to as apostles; the two brothers sent by Paul to deliver the donations to the needy brothers in Judea were called apostles of churches (2 Cor. 8:23); Andronicus and Junia were notable among the apostles (Rom. 16:7); and James, the brother of the Lord, was also an apostle (Gal. 1:19). All these were apostles in addition to the Twelve. Because there were many other apostles besides the Twelve, it was possible for the false apostles to call themselves apostles (2 Cor. 11:13; Rev. 2:2).</p><p>Although apostleship is the highest office set up by God, the apostles are not a group of extraordinary people. They are simply a group of workers sent out by God to preach the gospel and establish the churches. Therefore, as long as one is sent out by God to preach the gospel so that men may be saved and may receive the Holy Spirit (2 Cor. 11:4-5), and to convey God&rsquo;s word to men (2 Pet. 3:2), whether in the past or at the present time, he is an apostle. The proof of one&rsquo;s apostleship is found in the fruitful result of his work (1 Cor. 9:1-2) and in his power, which includes life power in all endurance and miraculous power in doing signs and wonders (2 Cor. 12:11-12).</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Work of the Apostles</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Going Out to Preach the Word of God</h2><p>After they were sent, the apostles&rsquo; principal work was to go out to preach the word of God. This is clearly depicted in Acts 13:4-6: &ldquo;They therefore, having been sent out by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed away to Cyprus. And having come to Salamis, they announced the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews....And having passed through the whole island as far as Paphos,...&rdquo; The apostles were always on the move doing the work; they did not settle down to shepherd a church, but they were constantly traveling. The result of their preaching was that as many as were appointed to eternal life believed, and there were ones saved among both the Jews and the Gentiles (Acts 13:46-48).</p><h2 class="head3">2. Establishing Churches</h2><p>When the apostles were sent out to a place where there was no local church, they would preach the gospel and bring salvation to men who would then become the church in that locality. Then they would choose some from among the saved ones and appoint them to be the elders, and they would commit the church in that locality to the leadership of the elders. Beginning from Acts 13, apart from Antioch, almost all the churches were founded in this way (Acts 14:20-27). The goal of the apostles&rsquo; work in their going out was to establish churches. Their preaching of the gospel was the means for them to achieve this goal.</p><h2 class="head1">II. PROPHETS</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Meaning of Prophets</h2><p>Prophets (referring to persons) are gifts given by Christ to the church (Eph. 4:11); prophecy (referring to the ability to prophesy) is a gift given by Christ to individual believers (1 Cor. 12:10; 14:1). What Christ gives to the church are the prophets, the persons; what Christ gives to individual believers is the gift of prophecy, the ability to prophesy. Christ gives the gift of prophecy to individual believers that they may prophesy. Then He gives those who have the gift of prophecy and the ability to prophesy as gifts to the church that the church may be built up. Hence, regarding the persons, they are the gifts given by Christ to the church, and regarding the ability they have received, it is a gift given individually to them by Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Ministry of the Prophets</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Bringing In God&rsquo;s Revelation</h2><p>The ministry of the prophets brings in God&rsquo;s revelation. In the church they not only speak for God and speak forth God, but sometimes they also predict for God for the edification of the church. At times they speak for God and speak forth God in an ordinary way through the spiritual power of the Holy Spirit (Rom. 12:6); at other times they predict for God in an inspired way by the miraculous power of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:10). Both are the prophets&rsquo; speaking for God in the power of the Holy Spirit. Hence, both carry God&rsquo;s authority, and both can cause man to receive the revelation which is from God, and sometimes even cause unbelievers to be benefited (1 Cor. 14:24-25).</p><h2 class="head3">2. Edifying the Believers<br />and Building Up the Church</h2><p>As the greatest gift in the local church, prophets can cause a local church to be built up more than the other gifts (1 Cor. 14:4-5). In the meetings of the local church prophesying to speak for God can render the greatest spiritual supply to the church. Just as apostleship is the greatest office for the universal church, so prophesying is the greatest gift for the local church. Hence, the Bible says that the church is built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets (Eph. 2:20).</p><p>Although the prophets are for the local churches, yet because they have the gift of speaking for God, wherever they go they can prophesy to build up the believers and the church. Agabus, Silas, and Judas were prophets in the church in Jerusalem, but when they went to Antioch or Caesarea they were able to prophesy, to speak for God (Acts 11:27-28; 21:8-11; 15:22, 30, 32).</p><h2 class="head1">III. EVANGELISTS</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Meaning of Evangelists</h2><p>Evangelists are also Christ&rsquo;s gifts to the church (Eph. 4:11), but how they become such men is not told in the Bible. Prophets and teachers can be such men because they have received the gift of prophecy and the gift of teaching, respectively (1 Cor. 12:10; Rom. 12:6-7). But the Bible does not tell us how the evangelists become evangelists or on what basis they become evangelists. Perhaps because they have received the evangelistic gift, they are set up by God to be the evangelists with the evangelistic office.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Work of the Evangelists</h2><p>The work of the evangelists is to preach the gospel. Although God commands all believers to preach the gospel, the Bible shows us that God especially set some to be evangelists. They do not preach the gospel in an ordinary way; they are wholly devoted to the work of gospel preaching. Gospel preaching is their work. Philip was such a person (Acts 21:8). Whereas the work of the prophets and teachers is, in general, directed toward those who are within the church for their building up, the work of the evangelists is directed toward those who are outside the church to save them into the church. The evangelists travel from place to place to do the work of gospel preaching. For instance, Philip was in Jerusalem originally; then he went to Samaria and many other places to preach the gospel (Acts 8:5-12, 26-40; 21:8). Although the evangelists may preach the gospel to save sinners, it is the task of the apostles, not the evangelists, to establish churches officially in every place (Acts 8:5-12, 14-17). The evangelists can merely go out to different places to preach the gospel; those who can go out to preach the gospel and establish the churches are the apostles.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. SHEPHERD-TEACHERS</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Meaning of Shepherd-Teachers</h2><p>According to the grammatical construction of the original text of Ephesians 4:11, shepherds and teachers refer to one class of persons who have the gift of shepherding and teaching. They have received the grace of God and are burdened to take care of the believers, and they also know the Bible and understand the teachings of God&rsquo;s Word so that they can help the believers to know the truth. The shepherds&rsquo; shepherding and the teachers&rsquo; teaching are two-in-one and are inseparable. Those who shepherd must also teach, and those who teach must also shepherd. Hence, shepherding and teaching are one gift, and shepherds and teachers are the same class of persons. In the New Testament we find reference to an apostle (for example, Paul) and a prophet (for example, Agabus) and an evangelist (for example, Philip) and a teacher (for example, Manaen&mdash;Acts 13:1), but nowhere in God&rsquo;s Word do we find anyone referred to as a shepherd. This confirms the fact that shepherds and teachers are one class of persons.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Work of the Shepherd-Teachers</h2><p>The work of the shepherd-teachers is to shepherd and teach the church of God, that is, to feed, nurture, instruct, and lead people with the word of God. Prophets speak the word of God with revelation; teachers interpret the word of God in an ordinary way. What the prophets speak is mainly God&rsquo;s revelation; what the teachers teach is mainly the truths already revealed in the Word. Based on what God has revealed, the teachers interpret to others the truths that others may be enlightened and edified in the truth. They, like the prophets, function mainly in the local church (Acts 13:1), but wherever they go they can shepherd and teach the church of God. Apollos was such a person. Wherever he went, whether to Ephesus or to Corinth, he instructed others and watered them with the word of God (Acts 18:24-28; 19:1; 1 Cor. 3:6).</p><h2 class="head1">V. CONCLUSION</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Perfecting the Saints Directly</h2><p>Christ gave these gifted persons to the church for the perfecting of the saints that the saints may participate in the work of the ministry, that is, in the building up of the Body of Christ. The saints need to be perfected and equipped unto the work of the ministry (Eph. 4:12). &ldquo;Unto&rdquo; in the original language means resulting in. The perfecting of the saints by the gifted persons results in the work of the ministry. According to the grammatical construction, the work of the ministry is the building up of the Body of Christ. What the gifted persons do is to perfect the saints to do the same thing as they do, which is the work of the ministry, the building up of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Building Up the Church Indirectly</h2><p>The building up of the Body of Christ should not be carried out only by the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers; it should be done by all the members. Hence, the saints are the building members. Furthermore, the work of the ministry, as mentioned in Ephesians 4:12, does not refer merely to the work of the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers, but it even the more refers to the work of the saints. Hence, the building up of the Body of Christ is not carried out directly by the gifted persons in Ephesians 4:11; it is accomplished by the perfected saints. The gifted persons should learn how to perfect others, and after finishing the perfecting work, they should leave the building work to all the members of the Body and let all the members build up the Body of Christ directly.</p><p>Ephesians 4:16 says, &ldquo;Out from whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; This indicates that all the members, having been perfected by the apostles, prophets, and other gifted persons, operate according to each one&rsquo;s own measure, performing each one&rsquo;s own function, and thus build up the Body of Christ directly. The perfecting work done by the gifted persons does not build up the Body of Christ directly; their work builds up the Body indirectly.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>The center of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is the building up of the church, the Body of Christ. For this work, Christ separates a group of gifted persons out of His saved ones, and gives them as gifts to the church. He gives four classes of persons: apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers. Apostles are the greatest gifts given by Christ to the church, and their office is placed highest in the universal church. The work of the apostles is to preach the gospel, teach the truth, and establish the churches. Prophets are those who speak for God. They not only speak for God, but they also speak forth God, and sometimes they also predict for God. Their ministry brings in God&rsquo;s revelation. At times they speak for God and speak forth God in an ordinary way through the spiritual power of the Holy Spirit; at other times they predict for God in an inspired way by the miraculous power of the Holy Spirit. Both are for the edification of the believers and the building up of the church. Prophesying is the greatest gift in the local church, and it can build up the local church more than the other gifts. The evangelists are also gifts received by the church from Christ. Their work is to preach the gospel. They do not preach the gospel in an ordinary way; they are wholly devoted to the work of gospel preaching. Whereas the evangelists can merely go to different places to preach the gospel, the apostles can preach the gospel everywhere and also establish the churches. Shepherds and teachers are one class of persons who have the gift of shepherding and teaching. Their work is to shepherd and teach the church of God, to nourish, nurture, instruct, and lead the believers. The prophets speak God&rsquo;s word with revelation; the shepherd-teachers interpret God&rsquo;s word in an ordinary manner. The shepherd-teachers instruct others according to the revelation spoken by the prophets, and thus cause others to be edified in the light of the truth. Christ gives these four kinds of persons as gifts to the church for the perfecting of the saints, that the saints may participate in the work of the ministry, which is the building up of the Body of Christ. They do not build up the Body of Christ directly; they perfect the saints to build up the Body of Christ directly. Hence, their building of the Body of Christ is indirect.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>What do the gifts in Ephesians 4:8 and 11 refer to?</li><li>What is the meaning of apostles?

Some consider the chapel as the church; in their thinking, to go to the chapel is to go to the church. Actually, neither is the physical building the church, nor are the different associations and organizations in Christianity the churches. Today in a large city many denominations, missions, and evangelistic organizations can be seen. All these organizations and associations must not be considered churches. The church is a mysterious organism (Eph. 1:22-23). This organism, according to the pure word of the Bible, has the following eight aspects:</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE CHURCH BEING THE ASSEMBLY<br />OF GOD&rsquo;S CALLED ONES</h2><p>The church (Matt. 16:18; 18:17) in Greek is <em>ekklesia,</em> composed of two words: <em>ek,</em> out, and <em>kaleo-,</em> called; the two words put together mean the called out congregation, or the assembly of the called ones. Hence, according to the literal sense of the word, the church is the assembly of those called out of the world by God.</p><p>Although there is no plain mentioning of the church in the Old Testament, there is a picture concerning the church. When the children of Israel went out of Egypt, they came to the foot of Mount Sinai. There they were formed together into one coordinated entity to assemble before God with the tabernacle as the center and the twelve tribes as the circumference encamping around the tabernacle (Num. 2). Thus, they became one corporate body, the <em>ekklesia,</em> the assembly of God&rsquo;s called ones. Hence, the New Testament calls them the <em>ekklesia</em> (Acts 7:38, the word assembly is <em>ekklesia</em>). On the one hand, they were called out by God from Egypt (signifying the world); on the other hand, they were the congregation gathering before God. The children of Israel did not have the nature of the church; they were only a type, a picture, showing us that the church is the assembling together of those who are called out of the world by God through His redemption and His saving power.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE CHURCH BEING THE COMPOSITION<br />OF THE SAINTS</h2><p>First Corinthians 1:2 says, &ldquo;To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; This indicates that the church is a composition of the saints, and the saints are the constituents of the church. First Corinthians 14:33 calls the churches the churches of the saints. This indicates that the saints are the constituents of the church; the church is composed of the saints. Individually speaking, we are the saints; corporately speaking, we are the church.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE CHURCH BEING THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p>Ephesians 1:22-23 says, &ldquo;...the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; The church is the Body of Christ. The Body is not an organization but an organism. The church is an organic Body constituted of all the believers, who have been regenerated and have God&rsquo;s life, for the expression of the Head. The Body is the fullness of the Head, and the fullness is the expression of the Head. If a person only has a head but does not have a body, he has no fullness and he cannot be expressed. If he has a body, but the body is small and skinny, that is not full enough, and such a body can hardly express him. Christ, as the One who fills all in all, needs a great Body to be His fullness. This Body is His church to be His expression.</p><p>The church is the Body of Christ, and Christ is the Head of the church (Col. 1:18). Hence, the church and Christ are one Body, the mysterious, universal great man, having the same life and nature and sharing the same position and authority. Just as Christ is far above all and sits in the heavenlies (Eph. 1:20-21), so also the church sits together with Him in the heavenlies (Eph. 2:6). Just as Christ has received all authority in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18), so also the church participates in His authority (Luke 10:19). Today the life of the church is hidden with Christ in God, and in the future the church will be manifested with Christ together in glory (Col. 3:3-4). What Christ is, what Christ has, where Christ is, and what Christ does are what the church is, what the church has, where the church is, and what the church does. Christ is the life and content of the church; the church is the organism and expression of Christ. The church receives everything from Christ; everything of Christ is expressed through the church. The two are mingled and joined as one, with Christ being the inward content and the church, the outward expression. Just as the body does everything, accomplishes everything, and is expressed in everything through the head, so the church does everything, accomplishes everything, and is expressed in everything through Christ. Hence, the church as the Body of Christ is also Christ (1 Cor. 12:12).</p><p>In the Bible, Christ sometimes refers to the personal Christ and sometimes to Christ and the church. The Bible considers Christ and the church as the one mysterious Christ. Christ is the Head of this mysterious Christ, and the church is the Body of this mysterious Christ. The two joining together become the one mysterious Christ, a universal great man. All the saved ones in all times and in all space added together become the Body of this mysterious Christ. Individually speaking, we, the saved ones, are members one of another (1 Cor. 12:27); corporately speaking, we are the mystical Body of Christ. Every saved one is a part of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE CHURCH BEING<br />THE COUNTERPART OF CHRIST</h2><p>In his exhortation in Ephesians 5:22-33, Paul presents the church as the counterpart of Christ. This reveals that the church comes out of Christ and is unto Christ, just as Eve came out of Adam and was unto Adam (Gen. 2:21-23). The first couple in the Bible, Adam and Eve, is a picture of Christ and the church. In His creation, God did not create a man and a woman at the same time. He first created a man, and then He created a counterpart to help him (Gen. 2:18). When the fowl, the beasts, and the cattle were brought before Adam, Adam named them one by one. But for Adam &ldquo;there was not found a help meet for him&rdquo; (Gen. 2:20). Adam desired to have a counterpart, to have someone to match him. However, among the fowl, the beasts, and the cattle, he could not find his counterpart. In order to produce such a counterpart, God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam (Gen. 2:21), and He took a rib out of Adam and built a woman with the rib (Gen. 2:22). The name of the woman was Eve. Eve was the same as Adam in life, nature, and form; therefore, she could be his counterpart. When God brought Eve to Adam, Adam exclaimed, &ldquo;This time it is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh&rdquo; (Gen. 2:23, Heb.). At last Adam had found one who could be his counterpart, his help meet.</p><p>Genesis 2:24 indicates that a man and his wife are one flesh. The husband and the wife are two halves of a whole person. This is a marvelous picture of Christ and the church. Eve had the same life and nature that Adam had. This signifies that the church has the same life and nature that Christ has. Furthermore, Eve had virtually the same image and nearly the same stature as Adam. This indicates that the church bears the same image and has the same stature as Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE CHURCH BEING A UNIVERSAL NEW MAN</h2><p>Ephesians 2:15 says, &ldquo;Having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man.&rdquo; The ordinances of the law are a cause of separation among men. On the cross, Christ not only took away our sin, caused our old man to be crucified, and destroyed the Devil, but He also abolished all the ordinances of the law that cause separations among men. When Christ abolished these ordinances of the law on the cross, He created the two&mdash;the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers&mdash;in Himself into one universal new man. This is God&rsquo;s new creation in the universe. In the old creation, God did not work His nature into any of His creatures, not even into man. In the creation of the new man, however, God&rsquo;s nature has been wrought into man (Col. 3:10) to make the divine nature one entity with the human nature. This new man is the Body spoken of in Ephesians 2:16. Hence, the new man is the Body of Christ, which is the church as God&rsquo;s new creation (2 Cor. 5:17).</p><p>The emphasis of the church being the Body of Christ is on life; the stress of the church being the universal new man is on the person. The body without life is not a body but a corpse. However, when the body makes a move, it is not decided by life but by the person. Hence, in the new man we need to take Christ as our person. Thus, we can glorify God with one accord and with one mouth (Rom. 15:6), and we can all speak the same thing (1 Cor. 1:10). In the church as the new man we are members one of another; but if we desire to glorify God with one accord and with one mouth, we must deny our own person and let Christ be our person. Thus, we can live out the living of the new man.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. THE CHURCH BEING THE HOUSE OF GOD<br />AND THE DWELLING PLACE OF GOD</h2><p>First Timothy 3:15 says that the church is the house of God. In the Old Testament both the tabernacle and the holy temple were called the house of God (Judg. 18:31; 1 Kings 6:1), which was a type of the church. The word house both in the original language and in the English language has two meanings: on one hand it refers to the household, and on the other hand it refers to the dwelling place. Hence, the church as the house of God indicates that the church, on the one hand, is the household, the family, of God, and, on the other hand, it is the dwelling place of God.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Household of God</h2><p>The church is the composition of the believers; the believers are the children of God, who are born of God, having God&rsquo;s life and nature. Hence, they become members of the household of God (Eph. 2:19), the family of God. The members of God&rsquo;s family added together become the house of God, which is the dwelling place of God (Eph. 2:22).</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Dwelling Place of God</h2><p>The church is the house of God, the dwelling place of God on earth, the place in which God can have His rest and put His trust. Hence, the church is the dwelling place of God in spirit (Eph. 2:22). In this dwelling place God lives and moves to accomplish His will and satisfy His heart&rsquo;s desire.</p><p>A house is also the best place for one to express himself. The kind of person you are can be best expressed by your house. Hence, look at a person&rsquo;s house, and you can tell the kind of person he is, because man&rsquo;s house is man&rsquo;s expression. The church as the house of God is the place where God expresses Himself on earth. First Timothy 3:16 shows us that the church is God&rsquo;s manifestation in the flesh. God not only desires to make home in the church and have a resting place, but He also wants to express Himself in the church. He wants to practice His New Testament economy, speak forth His desire, and manifest His glory in the church. All that He is, all that He is doing, and all that He wants to obtain are to be manifested in the church as His house.</p><h2 class="head1">VII. THE CHURCH BEING THE KINGDOM OF GOD</h2><p>Ephesians 2:19 tells us that all the believers, Jewish and Gentile, are fellow-citizens of the kingdom of God and members of the household of God. This shows us that the church is not only the house of God but also the kingdom of God. Both the Lord Jesus&rsquo; word in Matthew 16:18-19 and the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s word in Ephesians 5:5 indicate clearly that the church is the kingdom of God.</p><p>When a person is regenerated and born into the house of God, he enters into the kingdom of God (John 3:5). When he lives a life of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit in the church, he is in the reality of the kingdom of God (Rom. 14:17). When he labors and works for the church according to God&rsquo;s intention, he labors and works for the kingdom of God (Col. 4:11). Thus, the church is the kingdom of God.</p><p>The church as God&rsquo;s house is a matter of life and enjoyment; the church as God&rsquo;s kingdom is a matter of right and responsibility, that we may have the exercise in this age lest we lose the reward and suffer the punishment in the coming age (Matt. 24:45-51; 25:14-30; 1 Cor. 3:13-15).</p><h2 class="head1">VIII. THE CHURCH BEING THE TESTIMONY<br />OF JESUS CHRIST</h2><p>The book of Revelation shows us that the testimony of Jesus (1:2, 9; 19:10) is particular and consummate. The golden lampstands, the churches, in chapter one, the great multitude which no one could number in chapter seven, the bright woman with her man-child in chapter twelve, the harvest with its firstfruit in chapter fourteen, the overcomers on the sea of glass in chapter fifteen, the Bride ready for marriage and the fighting army of Christ in chapter nineteen, and the New Jerusalem in chapters twenty-one and twenty-two are all the testimony of Jesus.</p><p>The golden lampstands in Revelation chapter one signify the local churches. Every local church is a golden lampstand (1:20), the testimony of Jesus Christ, having the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God as the lamps and shining forth the testimony of Jesus from its locality.</p><p>The lampstands are for shining in the night. The present age is a spiritual dark night. The seven lamps of the lampstand are the seven Spirits before the throne (Rev. 4:5); they are for the church to be the lamps of Christ shining out the light in the dark age today. Furthermore, the lampstands are made of pure gold. Gold signifies God&rsquo;s divine nature. Thus, the golden lampstands indicate that the churches are shining out with God&rsquo;s nature in this dark age.</p><p>The golden substance of the lampstand signifies God the Father; the specific shape of the lampstand signifies Christ, since Christ is the embodiment of God; and the seven lamps of the lampstand signify the seven Spirits of God (4:5) as the expression of God. Hence, the golden lampstands signify the churches as the embodiment and expression of the Triune God shining forth, with the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God as the lamps, the testimony of Jesus in the dark age of today.</p><h2 class="head1">IX. THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>The church has two aspects: the universal aspect and the local aspect.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Universal Aspect</h2><p>In the universal aspect the church is uniquely one. At the end of Ephesians chapter one, it says that the church is the Body of Christ. Christ has only one Body which is unique in the universe. Ephesians 2:15 says that Christ created the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers in Himself into one new man, which is the church. Hence, the church as the new man is universal and one. In Matthew 16:18 in the Lord&rsquo;s first mentioning of the church, what is revealed is the universal church for the unique testimony of the Lord in the universe.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Local Aspect</h2><p>In the local aspect the church is expressed in many localities as many local churches. The one universal church expressed in many places on earth becomes the many local churches. Revelation 1:11 says, &ldquo;What you see write in a book and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.&rdquo; The seven cities here each have one church; hence, there were a total of seven churches. The expression of the church in a locality is the local church in that particular locality. The first expression of the church on the earth was the church in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1). Later, there were churches also in Judea and many Gentile places, such as the church in Antioch (Acts 13:1), the church in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:2), and the churches of Galatia (Gal. 1:2). Galatia was a province of the ancient Roman Empire, and there were a number of cities in that province; hence, the churches of Galatia. In every place there can only be one expression of the church. The expression of the church cannot be greater than a locality, nor can it be smaller than a locality. The churches in a number of places cannot be combined to form an alliance of churches, and the church in one place cannot be divided into a number of churches on certain streets, roads, or lanes, or in certain neighborhoods. There can only be one church in one locality. What the Lord revealed in His second mentioning of the church in Matthew 18:17 is the local church for the administration of the church.</p><h2 class="head1">X. THE DEGRADATION AND RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>The church as described above according to the revelation of the Scriptures is truly divine, glorious, bright, and pure. Unfortunately, before the passing away of the apostles, the church began to deteriorate and become desolate at the end of the first century. The degradation and desolation can be seen clearly in the second Epistle to Timothy by Paul, the second Epistle by Peter, the first, second, and third Epistles by John, and the Lord&rsquo;s seven epistles to the seven churches. Hence, the recovery of the church is an urgent need. Soon after the passing away of the apostles, throughout the generations there have always been some lovers and seekers of the Lord who longed to recover the church to her original condition. At the time of the Reformation, the recovery apparently was enlarged. Since then, in the past five centuries the recovery of the church has been continually advancing until it is now in its present state.</p><h2 class="head1">XI. THE NEED FOR OVERCOMERS<br />AND THE LORD&rsquo;S CALLING</h2><p>During the degradation and desolation of the church, in order to maintain and continue the church&rsquo;s testimony concerning Christ, that the church may be recovered to her original state, the need to have the overcomers is a pressing matter and it is something of the Lord&rsquo;s desire. Hence, at the end of each of the seven epistles which the Lord wrote to the seven churches, He consistently sounded out a serious call to the overcomers. Throughout the generations there were many lovers of the Lord who answered His call and were strong to rise up to spread the Lord&rsquo;s testimony and the church&rsquo;s recovery.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>The church is not a chapel, nor any physical building, nor any organization or association in Christianity. The church is a mysterious organism in eight aspects. First, the church is the assembly of those called out of the world by God. Second, the church is the composition of the saints. Third, the church is the Body of Christ, an organism composed of all those who have been regenerated and who have God&rsquo;s life to be the fullness of Christ for Christ to be expressed. Fourth, the church is the counterpart of Christ and is out of Him, unto Him, and one with Him, having the same life and nature as He and resembling Him in likeness and stature. Fifth, the church is a universal new man, created by Christ in Himself through the cross to be God&rsquo;s new creation. The emphasis of the church being the Body of Christ is on life; the stress of the church being the universal new man is on the person. The Body moves by life; the new man acts according to the person. Sixth, the church is the house of God and the dwelling place of God. The believers, who are the constituents of the church, are the children born of God, the household of God, which becomes the house of God; this house is also God&rsquo;s dwelling place for God to have His rest, and for God to live and move, fulfill His desire, and express Himself. Seventh, the church is the kingdom of God. The church as God&rsquo;s house is a matter of life and enjoyment; the church as God&rsquo;s kingdom is a matter of right and responsibility for us to have the exercise in this age lest we lose the reward and suffer the punishment in the coming age. Eighth, the church is the testimony of Jesus Christ, the golden lampstand of God, the definite expression of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;in the dark age of today. The church has two aspects: the universal aspect and the local aspect. The universal church is uniquely one, and it is for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony; the local churches are the many expressions of the one universal church on the earth in many localities, and they are for the church&rsquo;s administration. The church according to the revelation of the Scriptures is divine and glorious. However, before the passing away of the apostles, the church had become degraded and desolate. Hence, there was the need for the recovery and the overcomers. According to His desire, the Lord has sounded the call to the overcomers. Throughout the generations, the recovery of the church has been going on, and there have been overcomers answering the Lord&rsquo;s call.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>Enumerate the eight aspects of what the church is in this lesson.</li><li>Briefly explain the significance of the church being the Body of Christ.

THE DESIGNATIONS</h2><p>The kingdom of God has many aspects, as revealed in the New Testament by the following different designations:</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Kingdom of God</h2><p>The kingdom of God (Matt. 12:28) is a general term that refers to God&rsquo;s reign (Matt. 6:10, 13b; Dan. 6:26b). Its scope is unlimited, comprising eternity past, the patriarchs, the nation of Israel in the Old Testament, the church in the New Testament in this age, the millennial kingdom in the coming age, and the new heaven and new earth in eternity future. The words spoken by the Lord in Matthew 21:43 and the parable preceding it in verses 33-41 show us that the kingdom of God was there with the children of Israel in the Old Testament, but due to their rejection of the Lord, it was given to the church in the New Testament.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Kingdom of the Heavens</h2><p>The kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 16:19) refers to the ruling of the heavens (Dan. 4:26). It began on the day of Pentecost when Christ poured out the Holy Spirit and established His church (Acts 2), and it will continue until the end of the millennium (Rev. 20:7). Its scope is narrower than that of the kingdom of God, since it includes only the church in this age and the millennial kingdom in the coming age. It is a section within the kingdom of God; hence, it is also called the kingdom of God (Mark 1:15, cf. Matt. 4:17; Mark 4:11, cf. Matt. 13:11). The kingdom of the heavens has three aspects: its reality, its appearance, and its manifestation. Its reality and its appearance are the inward and outward aspects of the church in this age; its manifestation will be in the millennial kingdom in the coming age.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Kingdom of God&rsquo;s Beloved Son</h2><p>The kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love (Col. 1:13) is composed of the church in this age, the millennial kingdom in the coming age, and the new heaven and new earth in eternity (cf. 2 Pet. 1:11). The emphasis in Colossians 1:13 is on the kingdom of God&rsquo;s beloved Son in this age as the reality of the church, into which all the believers have been transferred (John 3:5).</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Kingdom of Christ and of God,<br />the Kingdom of the Lord and of His Christ,<br />and the Eternal Kingdom of the Lord<br />and Savior Jesus Christ</h2><p>The kingdom of Christ and of God (Eph. 5:5), the kingdom of the Lord and of His Christ (Rev. 11:15), and the eternal kingdom of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (2 Pet. 1:11), all refer to the millennial kingdom in the coming age and to the new heaven and new earth in eternity as His eternal kingdom which will be brought in by Christ&rsquo;s second coming (Dan. 2:34-35, 44; Heb. 1:8). The overcoming believers in the church in this age, the defeated ones not included, will first enter into the millennial kingdom in the coming age to inherit the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the millennium as their reward; and then they, together with the believers who are defeated in this age but will be perfected in the millennium, will enter into the new heaven and new earth in eternity to enjoy the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth as their eternal portion.</p><h2 class="head2">E. The Kingdom of the Father<br />and the Kingdom of the Son of Man</h2><p>The kingdom of the Father mentioned in Matthew 13:43 and 26:29 refers to the heavenly part of the millennial kingdom in the coming age, which is the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. Only the perfected saints in the Old Testament and the overcoming believers in the church in this age will be able to enter into and enjoy this kingdom (Heb. 12:23; 11:39-40; Matt. 8:11; 13:43). The kingdom of the Son of Man (Matt. 13:41) refers to the earthly part of the millennial kingdom in the coming age. It is the kingdom prepared for the nations who will be restored in the coming age as its people (Matt. 25:34). It is also the kingdom in which the restored kingdom of Israel (Acts 1:6), that is, all Israel who will be saved in the future, will be the priests (See point III.B.1 in this lesson).</p><h2 class="head2">F. The Kingdom Prepared<br />from the Foundation of the World</h2><p>The kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world (Matt. 25:34) is the earthly part of the millennial kingdom, in which the restored nations will dwell as the people (Matt. 25:46b).</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE KINGDOM OF GOD<br />BEING THE CHURCH IN THIS AGE</h2><p>Although the kingdom of God was among the people of Israel in the Old Testament, it was taken away from them in the New Testament and given to the New Testament believers (Matt. 21:43). Thus, it had a new beginning and became the church (Matt. 16:18-19).</p><h2 class="head2">A. Repenting and Believing in the Gospel<br />Being for the Entry into the Kingdom of God</h2><p>John the Baptist came out to preach the baptism of repentance as the opening of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, asking people to have a turn for the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 3:2). Then Jesus came and continued the preaching of His forerunner John the Baptist, telling people to repent for the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 4:17). This indicates that God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is focused on His kingdom. We need to repent&mdash;have a change in our mind, have a turn in our pursuit of life&mdash;and believe in the gospel that our sins may be forgiven and that we may be regenerated by God to have the divine life, which matches the divine nature of the kingdom of God. Thus we may enter into the kingdom of God (John 3:3, 5).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Regeneration Being<br />the Entrance into the Kingdom of God</h2><p>In John 3:3 the Lord said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God,&rdquo; and in verse 5 He said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s words here reveal that regeneration is the unique entrance into the kingdom of God.</p><p>A kingdom is always related to life. The vegetable kingdom is related to the vegetable life, and the animal kingdom is related to the animal life. If you want to share in a certain kingdom, you first need the life of that kingdom. Therefore, in order to enter into the kingdom of God, man needs to be regenerated, that is, to receive God&rsquo;s life in addition to man&rsquo;s natural life.</p><p>The kingdom of God is not only the reign of God, but also the realm and sphere of the divine life. In order to participate in the reign of God and to be in the divine realm, we need the divine life. Only those who have the divine life can be in the divine realm and share the divine kingdom in which God reigns. Thus, we need to be regenerated that we may have the divine life which enables us to enter into the divine realm and participate in the divine kingdom. Even if we were not fallen or sinful, we would still need to be born again and receive the divine life, because regardless of how good, pure, and clean our human life might be, it cannot qualify us to enter into the divine kingdom. Only the divine life qualifies us to enter into the divine realm. Only the life of God meets the divine requirements of the kingdom of God. Regeneration is the unique entrance into the kingdom of God.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Kingdom of God<br />Being the Reality of the Church Life</h2><p>Romans 12 through 16 is concerned with the church life. Romans 14:17 says, &ldquo;For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This proves that God&rsquo;s kingdom life is the church life. The kingdom of God is neither eating nor drinking. The kingdom of God is righteousness toward ourselves, peace toward others, and joy with God in our spirit. These items&mdash; righteousness, peace, and joy&mdash;are the expressions of Christ. They are the characteristics of the kingdom of God as well as the reality of the church life today. Hence, the kingdom in this age is the church. The book of Acts, which is mainly concerned with the producing, the establishing, and the spreading of the church, stresses both the kingdom of God (1:3; 8:12; 14:22; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 31) and the church (5:11; 8:1, 3; 9:31; 11:22, 26; 12:1, 5; 13:1; 14:23, 27; 15:3-4, 22, 41; 16:5; 18:22; 20:17, 28). This shows that the church today is the kingdom of God.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Those Not Remaining in the Church Life<br />Not Inheriting the Kingdom of God</h2><p>First Corinthians 6:9-10, Galatians 5:19-21, and Ephesians 5:5 all mention that the evil or unrighteous ones cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Those who practice evil things such as fornication, uncleanness, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, angers, faction, divisions, parties, envyings, drunkenness, carousings, and things like these shall not inherit the kingdom of God. Moreover, such ones must be separated from the church fellowship (1 Cor. 5:11), just as Paul in his spirit judged the brother who committed fornication in the church in Corinth and charged the church there to separate the evil man from among themselves (1 Cor. 5:1-5, 13) in order to keep the purity and unleavened nature of the church life.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Those Growing and Developing<br />in the Life of God in the Church Life<br />Being Richly and Bountifully Supplied<br />with the Entrance into the Kingdom of God</h2><p>Second Peter 1:11 says, &ldquo;For so shall be richly and bountifully supplied to you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This kingdom is the millennial kingdom within the kingdom of God in the coming age and the new heaven and new earth in eternity. In this eternal kingdom we shall not be subjects; we shall be kings. But in order to be kings, we need maturity in life. According to the word in the preceding verses, 2 Peter 1:1-10, if we want to grow to maturity, we need to stay in the church life and allow the wonderful like precious faith allotted to us (v. 1) to be developed gradually. This faith is an all-inclusive seed, containing all the riches of the divine life. We must be diligent to develop in our faith virtue; in virtue, knowledge; in knowledge, self-control; in self-control, endurance; in endurance, godliness; in godliness, brotherly love; and in brotherly love, God&rsquo;s noble love. By developing these virtues we grow, and eventually we shall reach maturity. As a result, we shall be full of Christ, that is, we shall arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13). Thus, we shall be richly and bountifully supplied with the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, which will be the millennial kingdom within the kingdom of God in the coming age and the new heaven and new earth in eternity.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Spiritual Living of the Church<br />Being the Reality of the Kingdom of the Heavens within the Kingdom of God</h2><p>According to the Gospel of Matthew, the kingdom of the heavens within the kingdom of God has three aspects: the reality, the appearance, and the manifestation. Whereas the reality and the appearance are in this age, the manifestation is in the coming age. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens within the kingdom of God is the inward contents of the kingdom of the heavens in its heavenly and spiritual nature, as revealed by the Lord on the mountain in Matthew 5, 6, and 7. According to Romans 14:17, the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the proper church life today. Therefore, the spiritual living in the church is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. Matthew 5, 6, and 7 disclose the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, which is the spiritual living and heavenly principles of the kingdom of the heavens. It is composed of seven sections: the nature of the kingdom people (5:1-12), the influence of the kingdom people upon the world (5:13-16), the law of the kingdom people (5:17-48), the righteous deeds of the kingdom people (6:1-18), the dealing of the kingdom people with riches (6:19-34), the principles of the kingdom people in dealing with others (7:1-12), and the ground of the kingdom people&rsquo;s living and work (7:13-29).</p><p>In these seven sections we see that the nature of the kingdom people, which is the very nature of the kingdom of the heavens, exercises an influence upon the world. The kingdom people also have a law, which is the new law of the kingdom of the heavens, not the law in the Old Testament. They are those who perform righteous deeds and who have the proper attitude concerning material riches. While they are still living in human society, they deal with others according to the principles of the kingdom of the heavens. Finally, we see the ground of the daily life and work of the kingdom people. All these aspects of the kingdom people not only depict their behavior or outward living; they also constitute the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. The spiritual living of the church today is the living out of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><h2 class="head2">E. The Worldly Appearance of the Church<br />Being the Appearance of the Kingdom<br />of the Heavens within the Kingdom of God</h2><p>The kingdom of the heavens within the kingdom of God in this age has its appearance, in addition to its reality. Its appearance is its outward state in name, as revealed by the Lord on the seashore in Matthew 13. Today, both the reality and the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens are with the church. In Matthew 5, 6, and 7 everything in the seven sections concerning the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is real, pure, spiritual, and heavenly. But the situation in Matthew 13 concerning the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is altogether different. In this chapter we have the tares (vv. 25-30), a great tree which is no longer according to its kind (vv. 31-32), and the leaven (v. 33). The tares here signify the false believers; the great tree, the abnormal development of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens; and the leaven, the inward corruption of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. All these things found in the appearance of the kingdom cause the appearance of the kingdom to be a mixture.</p><p>It is easy to see this mixture in today&rsquo;s Christendom. Today&rsquo;s Christendom&mdash;the worldly appearance of the church&mdash; exactly matches the portrait in Matthew 13 of the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. In Christendom there are millions of tares, a great facade, and corrupting leaven. Whereas everything in Matthew 5, 6, and 7 is real, pure, spiritual, and heavenly, everything shown in Matthew 13 is false, corrupt, mixed, and abnormal.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE KINGDOM OF GOD BEING<br />THE MILLENNIAL KINGDOM IN THE COMING AGE</h2><p>The kingdom of God was only drawing near during the time when John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus were preaching (Matt. 3:2; 4:17; Luke 10:9). Although the descending of the Holy Spirit brought in the reality of the kingdom of God on the day of Pentecost and the church was established (Matt. 16:18-19), the manifestation of the kingdom of God was yet to come. Therefore, the Lord was resurrected from the dead and ascended to the heavens to receive the kingdom (Luke 19:12). At the end of the church age, the Lord will receive the kingdom from God (Dan. 7:13-14) and will come back with the kingdom of God (Luke 19:15). That will occur after the great tribulation when the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ (Rev. 11:15; 12:10). This will also be the manifestation of the kingdom of God, as unveiled by the Lord on the Mount of Olives in Matthew 24 and 25. This manifested kingdom of God is the millennial kingdom in the coming age, comprising the heavenly and earthly parts.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Heavenly Part</h2><p>The heavenly part of the millennial kingdom in the coming age, which will be the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens within the kingdom of God, is called the kingdom of the Father in Matthew 13:43. All the perfected and overcoming saints of the Old and the New Testaments will be priests of God and of Christ, and will be co-kings with Christ for a thousand years (Rev. 20:4, 6) to reign over the nations, the people in the earthly part of the millennial kingdom (Rev. 2:26-27). Daniel 12:2-3 tells us that after being raised up from among the dead, the wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness shall shine as the stars. This word resembles that in Matthew 13:43, which says that the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. What is mentioned in Daniel refers also to the heavenly part of the millennial kingdom.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Earthly Part</h2><p>The earthly part of the millennial kingdom in the coming age will be the Messianic kingdom, which is called the kingdom of the Son of Man in Matthew 13:41. This will be the restored kingdom of Israel (Acts 1:6), the tabernacle of David&mdash;the kingdom of David&mdash;which the Lord will rebuild (Acts 15:16; Mark 11:10). It will also be the kingdom prepared by God from the foundation of the world for the &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; as the people on earth in the coming millennium (Matt. 25:34).</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Restored Kingdom of Israel</h2><p>When Christ comes back, the entire house of Israel will repent and be saved (Zech. 12:10-11; Rom. 11:26); then the kingdom of Israel will be restored (Acts 1:6). The saved Israelites will be priests in the earthly part of the coming millennium, teaching the nations as the people to serve God (Zech. 8:20-23). (See point IV.D in Lesson Twenty-four.)</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Restored Nations</h2><p>When Christ comes back, He will be the Judge of the living to the Gentiles (Acts 17:31; 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1). All the nations on earth will be gathered before Him to be judged by Him according to God&rsquo;s eternal gospel (Rev. 14:6-7). The good ones will be counted by Him as the righteous, the &ldquo;sheep.&rdquo; They will enter into the earthly part of the millennium to be the people (Matt. 25:31-34). (See point III in Lesson Twenty-four.)</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE KINGDOM OF GOD BEING THE NEW HEAVEN<br />AND NEW EARTH WITH THE NEW JERUSALEM<br />AS ITS CENTER IN ETERNITY</h2><p>After the millennial kingdom is concluded, the new heaven and new earth will come as the realm of God&rsquo;s reign, the kingdom of God in eternity. God will reign in it forever and ever (Rev. 11:15), with the New Jerusalem as its center and the restored nations as its surroundings.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The New Jerusalem</h2><p>In the new heaven and new earth in eternity, the kingdom of God will be composed of two kinds of people: the saints, who are regenerated, as the sons of God (Rev. 21:7), and the nations, who will be restored, as God&rsquo;s people (Rev. 21:3b). The regenerated saints as the sons of God will constitute the New Jerusalem to be God&rsquo;s habitation in eternity (Rev. 21:1-3). The throne of God will be in it, from which God will reign to rule over the kingdom in the new heaven and new earth in eternity (Rev. 22:1, 3). All the regenerated saints throughout all the generations, whether perfected earlier or later, will be kings in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 22:5b) to enjoy the eternal blessings of God&rsquo;s eternal life to the fullest extent. These blessings include the enjoyment of the illumination of God as the light of life for eternity (Rev. 21:23; 22:5), the enjoyment of the supply of Christ as the tree of life (Rev. 22:2a), and the enjoyment of the saturation of the Spirit as the water of life (Rev. 22:1; 21:6b). Thus, they will enjoy the riches of the processed Triune God to the fullest extent forever and ever.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Surrounding Nations</h2><p>In the new heaven and new earth, the restored nations will be around the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:24) as the peoples in God&rsquo;s kingdom for eternity (Rev. 21:3). Thus, the New Jerusalem will be God&rsquo;s tabernacle among them. From it God will be their God and He will be with them. The saints, the sons of God, as the constituents of the New Jerusalem, will be kings to rule over them.</p><p>In the church in this age the believers receive God&rsquo;s eternal life (John 3:15) and enjoy the blessing of the eternal life in the initial stage. In the heavenly part of the millennial kingdom in the coming age, the overcoming believers will inherit God&rsquo;s eternal life (Matt. 19:29) and will enjoy the full blessing of the eternal life of God in a fuller way. In the New Jerusalem, the center of the new heaven and new earth in eternity, all the perfected saints will fully enter into the eternal life of God and enjoy the eternal blessing of God&rsquo;s eternal life to the fullest extent for eternity. All three stages are the enjoyment of the eternal life of the processed Triune God in the kingdom of God.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE SEED AND THE DEVELOPMENT<br />OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD</h2><p>The kingdom of God, like the church, is not an organization. It is an organism constituted with God&rsquo;s divine life as the realm of life for His ruling, in which He reigns by His divine life and expresses Himself as the divine Trinity in the divine life. It began with the Old Testament saints and is realized in the church in this age. It will be completed in the New Jerusalem in the millennium and ultimately consummated in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. God&rsquo;s divine life, which is Christ Himself, is the seed of the realm of the divine life that develops into the kingdom for His ruling. As revealed in Luke 17:21, the kingdom of God is Christ Himself.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Seed</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Christ Being the First Seed</h2><p>Christ, as the first seed of life of the kingdom of God, sowed Himself into His believers (Mark 4:3, 26) that He might grow and live in them and be developed from within them to bring forth many grains (Mark 4:20).</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Believers Also Being Seeds</h2><p>The believers, who receive Christ as the seed of the kingdom of God, also become seeds of life (Matt. 13:38), since they have Christ in them as their life. They grow and bring forth many grains by taking Christ as life; thus the kingdom of God is further developed. Such propagation and development will continue until the manifestation of the kingdom of God.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Development</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The Propagation and Multiplication<br />of Christ as the Seed of the Kingdom of God</h2><p>When Christ came out to preach the kingdom of God as the gospel (Mark 1:14-15), He was the unique seed of the kingdom of God. After passing through death and resurrection, He released God&rsquo;s life and dispensed it into His believers, thus bringing forth many grains (John 12:24). At the beginning of the Acts, there were many grains (Acts 1:15) as the spreading of the kingdom of God. Through them the kingdom of God spread again and again (Acts 8:12; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 31) into thousands of believers (Acts 2:41; 4:4; 21:20), making them constituents of the kingdom of God.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Christ Becoming a Great Mountain<br />Filling the Whole Earth</h2><p>Daniel 2:34-35 says that a stone was cut out without hands to smite the great image, signifying that Christ will come down from the heavens to smite the Gentile nations. The stone will then become a great mountain and fill the whole earth. The mountain denotes the kingdom. This means that Christ will be enlarged to become the kingdom of Himself and of God which will fill the whole earth (Rev. 11:15). Then in Daniel 2:44 we are told that this is the kingdom which the God of heaven will set up and which will never be destroyed but will stand forever. This kingdom is the enlargement of Christ, which will spread over the whole earth, signified by the stone smiting the nations and growing into a great mountain. In Himself, Christ is the King; in His enlargement, Christ becomes His great and glorious kingdom that spreads throughout the whole earth.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. INHERITING THE KINGDOM OF GOD BEING<br />DIFFERENT FROM RECEIVING THE ETERNAL LIFE</h2><p>To inherit the kingdom of God (1 Cor. 6:10; Gal. 5:21) is to inherit the eternal life as an enjoyment (Matt. 19:29). It is different from the receiving of the eternal life as our life. The former is a matter of reward in the coming age; the latter is a matter of being saved in this age. To receive the eternal life is to receive God&rsquo;s life that we may be regenerated (John 3:5). It is the central part of God&rsquo;s salvation (John 10:10). Anyone who believes in the Lord Jesus receives this life (John 3:16, 36). To inherit the kingdom of God is to obtain the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s eternal life in the millennial kingdom through our experiences in His eternal life. Through God&rsquo;s eternal life we are born into the kingdom of God in this age. We live in the kingdom of God by the eternal life, experiencing and enjoying the eternal life in this age, so that we may inherit the kingdom of God in the coming age, that is, we may inherit the full enjoyment of God&rsquo;s eternal life as a reward. To receive the eternal life and enter into the kingdom of God, and to live according to the eternal life and inherit the kingdom of God, are both a matter of life. First Peter 1:3 and 2 Peter 1:3-11 show us that we have the life of God through regeneration and have become partakers of the divine nature. Therefore, we should be diligent to pursue the growth and the development of this life until we are richly and bountifully supplied the entrance into the eternal kingdom of God, the kingdom of the heavens within the kingdom of God in the coming age, to enjoy the reward which the Lord has promised to us for our enjoyment (Luke 12:21; James 2:5). To the believers, the kingdom of God is an exercise in this age (Matt. 5:3, 10; 11:12; Luke 9:62; Acts 14:22; Rev. 1:9) and a reward in the coming age (James 2:5; 1 Thes. 2:12; 2 Tim. 4:8, 18). This reward is an incentive to those who respect the Lord&rsquo;s faithful word and diligently exercise themselves through the grace of the life of God (2 Tim. 4:1b). Since there is a reward, there is also a punishment (Matt. 16:27-28; Rev. 22:12; 2 Cor. 5:10). This punishment is a warning to the saints who would disregard the faithful word of the Lord and neglect the grace of the life of God, and who would not diligently exercise themselves (Matt. 5:20; 7:21).</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>The New Testament uses different designations, such as the kingdom of God, the kingdom of the heavens, the kingdom of God&rsquo;s beloved Son, the kingdom of Christ and of God, the kingdom of the Lord and of His Christ, the eternal kingdom of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the kingdom of the Father, the kingdom of the Son of Man, and the kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world, to reveal various aspects of the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is God&rsquo;s reign, comprising eternity past, the patriarchs and the kingdom of Israel in the Old Testament, the church in the New Testament in this age, the millennial kingdom in the coming age, and the new heaven and new earth in eternity future. The kingdom of the heavens is the ruling of the heavens. It is a part of the kingdom of God, including the church in this age and the millennial kingdom in the coming age. The kingdom of Christ and of God, the kingdom of the Lord (God) and of His Christ, and the eternal kingdom of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ all refer to the millennial kingdom in the coming age and the new heaven and new earth in eternity. The kingdom of the Father refers to the heavenly part of the millennial kingdom, whereas the kingdom of the Son of Man refers to the earthly part of the millennial kingdom.</p><p>The kingdom of God is the church in this age. Man enters into it through regeneration. It is also the reality of the church life. The spiritual living of the church is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens in the kingdom of God. The worldly appearance of the church is the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens within the kingdom of God. In the coming age the kingdom of God is the millennial kingdom, composed of two parts, the heavenly and the earthly. The heavenly part is the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens within the kingdom of God, in which the perfected and overcoming saints of both the Old and New Testaments will be priests of God and of Christ and co-kings with Christ for a thousand years. The earthly part is the Messianic kingdom, which is also the restored kingdom of Israel; the saved Israelites in the future will be priests in it, and the restored nations in the future will be the people. The kingdom in eternity is the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem as its center. In the new heaven and new earth in eternity, the kingdom of God is composed of two kinds of people: the regenerated saints as the sons of God and the restored nations as the people of God. The former constitute the New Jerusalem as the habitation of God in eternity. All the regenerated saints, whether they are perfected earlier or later, will be kings in it. They will enjoy the eternal blessing of the eternal life of the processed Triune God to the fullest extent. The latter are around the New Jerusalem to be the peoples of God in eternity, and they will be under the ruling of the former as the kings.</p><p>The kingdom of God is an organism constituted with His divine life, and this kingdom becomes the realm of life for His ruling. He reigns in it by His divine life and expresses Himself in His divine life. It began with the Old Testament saints and is realized in the church in this age. It will be completed in the New Jerusalem in the millennium and ultimately consummated in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. God&rsquo;s divine life, which is Christ Himself, is the seed of the realm of the divine life that develops into the kingdom for His ruling. This kingdom of God is just Christ Himself. Christ, as the first seed of life of the kingdom of God, was sown into His believers and developed from within them to bring forth many grains. The believers also become seeds producing many more grains; thus the kingdom of God becomes further developed. Such propagation and development will continue until the kingdom of God will fill the whole earth as a great mountain. To inherit God&rsquo;s glorious kingdom in the coming age and obtain the full enjoyment of the eternal life of God is different from the receiving of eternal life as our life in this age. The former is to receive a reward in the coming age; the latter is to receive salvation in this age. To the believers, the kingdom is an exercise in this age and a reward in the coming age. This reward is an incentive to the believers who would exercise faithfully. Since there is a reward, there is also a punishment. This punishment is a warning to the believers who would not exercise faithfully in this age.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>Describe briefly the different designations of the kingdom of God.</li><li>Why is there the need of regeneration to enter into the kingdom of God?</li><li>Describe the relationship between the kingdom of God and the church from the aspects of reality and appearance.</li><li>Describe briefly the composition of the kingdom in the coming age.</li><li>Describe briefly the composition of the kingdom of God in eternity.</li><li>Describe the development of the kingdom of God.</li><li>What is the difference between inheriting the kingdom of God and receiving the eternal life?</li></ol><h1 class="series">TRUTH LESSONS&mdash;LEVEL ONE</h1><h1 class="msg">LESSON TWENTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">A KEY VIEW OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(8)</h1><h1 class="subtitle">THE NEW JERUSALEM</h1><h1 class="title">OUTLINE</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The conclusion of the whole Bible and of the entire divine revelation:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>The conclusion of the whole Bible.</li><li>The conclusion of the entire divine revelation.</li></ol></li><li>God&rsquo;s work of the new creation in the old creation:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Using the dispensation of the Patriarchs.</li><li>Using the dispensation of law.</li><li>Using the dispensation of grace.</li><li>Using the dispensation of righteousness.</li></ol></li><li>God&rsquo;s work of restoration in the old creation:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Using a short period of insertion.</li><li>Through His eternal gospel.</li></ol></li><li>The results of God&rsquo;s work of the new creation and of restoration in the old creation:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Producing the redeemed.</li><li>Obtaining the overcomers.</li><li>Constituting the New Jerusalem in the millennium.</li><li>Producing the priests in the millennium.</li><li>Producing the citizens in the millennium.</li><li>Perfecting the immature believers.</li><li>Purging to produce the people in the new heaven and new earth.</li><li>Terminating all the rebellious creatures of the old creation&mdash;a secondary result.</li><li>Constituting the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</li></ol></li><li>The new heaven and new earth:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>The renewed new universe.</li><li>With the new earth as the focus.</li></ol></li><li>The New Jerusalem:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Not a physical city.</li><li>The crystallized product and masterpiece of God&rsquo;s work of the new creation throughout the generations.</li><li>A composition of the redeemed saints throughout the generations:<ol class="decimal"><li>The Old Testament saints.</li><li>The New Testament believers.</li></ol></li><li>The bride of the Lamb.</li><li>The tabernacle of God among men:<ol class="decimal"><li>The city proper being of pure gold.</li><li>The gates being of pearl.</li><li>The wall and foundation being of precious stones:<ol class="lower-alpha"><li>Jasper for the wall.</li><li>Precious stones for the foundation.</li></ol></li><li>The Triune God being the temple and the light of the city:<ol class="lower-alpha"><li>The temple of the city.</li><li>The light of the city.</li></ol></li><li>The throne of the Triune God being the center.</li><li>The flow of the Triune God being the supply:<ol class="lower-alpha"><li>Flowing in the middle of the street of pure gold.</li><li>Becoming the river of water of life as the saturation.</li><li>With the tree of life as the supply.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>The mingling of the Triune God with the redeemed tripartite man.</li><li>The kings in the holy city and the people around it:<ol class="decimal"><li>The kings in the holy city.</li><li>The people around it.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Conclusion.</li></ol><h1 class="title">TEXT</h1><h2 class="head1">I. THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE BIBLE<br />AND OF THE ENTIRE DIVINE REVELATION</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Conclusion of the Whole Bible</h2><p>The New Jerusalem revealed in the last two chapters of the book of Revelation is not only the conclusion of the book itself and of the New Testament; it is also the conclusion of the whole Bible. In the sixty-six books of the Bible, all the records of plain words, prophecies, and types in the Old Testament, beginning from God&rsquo;s creation, progressing through Satan&rsquo;s rebellion, man&rsquo;s fall, God&rsquo;s promise of redemption to fallen man, God&rsquo;s dealings with the Patriarchs, God&rsquo;s calling of His chosen people, their redemption, their being formed into a nation, their failure, and their recovery, and concluding with their looking to and waiting for Christ; and all the records of plain words, prophecies, and signs in the New Testament, beginning from John the Baptist and the ministry of the Lord Jesus, progressing through the Lord Jesus&rsquo; death, resurrection, ascension, and ministry after His ascension, the work of the apostles, the calling, salvation, and maturity of the believers, the establishment and building up of the church, the Lord Jesus&rsquo; second coming and the things that He will do in His second coming, the establishment of the millennial kingdom, the termination of Satan and his followers, including demons and human beings, and the passing away of the old heaven and the old earth, and concluding with the coming of the new heaven and new earth, are consummated in the New Jerusalem. She is the goal of God&rsquo;s eternal economy and the crystallization of God&rsquo;s work throughout the ages.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Conclusion of the Entire Divine Revelation</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is the conclusion not only of the whole Bible, but also of the entire divine revelation. The entire divine revelation recorded in the Old and New Testaments, whether expressed or implied, consummates in the New Jerusalem, which is the greatest and highest divine sign in the New Testament, and the one richest in meaning. She is the heart&rsquo;s delight of the loving God; she is also the meaning of life of God&rsquo;s beloved in eternity. This shows the important position of the New Jerusalem in the Bible and her profound contents in the divine revelation. We must not interpret this noble revelation in God&rsquo;s Word according to our natural view or religious superstition.</p><h2 class="head1">II. GOD&rsquo;S WORK OF THE NEW CREATION<br />IN THE OLD CREATION</h2><p>God&rsquo;s work in the universe is of two categories: the old creation and the new creation. Whereas the sphere of His work of the old creation was the old heaven and old earth of His original creation (Gen. 1:1); the sphere of His work of the new creation is the new heaven and new earth (2 Pet. 3:13; Rev. 21:1), which are the original God-created old heaven and old earth renewed through the burning of God&rsquo;s judging fire. At the center of the sphere of His work of the new creation is the New Jerusalem, the crystallized product and masterpiece of His new creation. Since the fall of man, God has used four different dispensations&mdash;the dispensation of the Patriarchs, the dispensation of law, the dispensation of grace, and the dispensation of righteousness&mdash;to carry out the work of the new creation in man, who is of the Satan-ruined and God-judged old creation, by the Spirit and life of Himself as the Triune God who has been processed through incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension; by His heavenly ministry after His ascension; and by what He will accomplish in His second coming. The result of such a work is the New Jerusalem.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Using the Dispensation of the Patriarchs</h2><p>The dispensation of the Patriarchs extended from the creation of Adam to the giving of the law by Moses (Rom. 5:14a). In this dispensation, God first placed the created, innocent man under His direct government (Gen. 2:9, 16); then He placed the fallen man, the function of whose conscience (Rom. 2:15) had been activated by the knowledge of good and evil, under the government of his own conscience, that man might seek His grace according to His ordained way of redemption (Gen. 4:4) and enjoy His riches by calling on the name of Jehovah (Gen. 4:26). He then further subjected the repeatedly falling men under human government (Gen. 9:6), which was vested with God&rsquo;s authority, for their preservation and existence, that He might have the opportunity to grant them His visitations. Finally, He gave the promise of grace to men, who had fallen to the uttermost and had been called by Him, and led them to look to the coming Christ in whom all the families of the earth would be blessed (Gen. 12:3b; 22:18).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Using the Dispensation of Law</h2><p>The dispensation of law extended from the giving of the law by Moses to the first coming of Christ (John 1:17). In this dispensation God used His law to deal with man by exposing man&rsquo;s sin and weakness (Rom. 5:20a; 3:20b; 8:3a), that man might be led to Christ (Gal. 3:24).</p><h2 class="head2">C. Using the Dispensation of Grace</h2><p>The dispensation of grace includes the period from Christ&rsquo;s first coming to Christ&rsquo;s second coming. In this dispensation God uses grace (John 1:14, 16; 1 Cor. 15:10) to work the fallen sinners into Christ (1 Cor. 1:30) and to work Christ into them (Gal. 1:16a; 2:20b; Col. 1:27b), thus producing the church (Eph. 1:22-23).</p><h2 class="head2">D. Using the Dispensation of Righteousness</h2><p>The dispensation of righteousness (the dispensation of the kingdom) will begin at Christ&rsquo;s second coming and continue until the end of the millennium. In this dispensation God will use the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens to reward, according to His righteousness (2 Tim. 4:8), the perfected righteous ones, the overcoming saints, of the Old Testament (Heb. 12:23; 11:39-40), and the overcoming believers in Christ of the New Testament (Matt. 24:45-47; 25:21, 23), and He will also perfect the immature New Testament believers in Christ (Matt. 24:48-51; 25:26-30). Although the dispensation of righteousness will be times of restoration of all things (Acts 3:21; Matt. 19:28), it will not be a dispensation in the new heaven and new earth when all God&rsquo;s work of the new creation will be finished. Rather, it will still be a dispensation in the old creation, during which God will still be working in His chosen and redeemed ones. There will still be sinners who die accursed (Isa. 65:20), and the nations as the peoples on the earth will still have the rebellious fallen nature of the old creation, such that at the end of the millennium their corrupted and old created nature will reappear to rebel against God (Rev. 20:7-9). Hence, according to His righteousness and for His righteousness&rsquo; sake, God will use the last dispensation of the old creation to discipline and perfect the believers who neglect His grace and are unwilling to be faithful on the way of His grace. God&rsquo;s disciplining and perfecting work will cause those who would not seek maturity in life before, to have maturity in life, and will qualify them to enter into the new heaven and new earth to be the constituents of the New Jerusalem; thus, they will be able to share together with the earlier mature believers the enjoyment of the blessing of God&rsquo;s eternal life in its ultimate consummation in eternity.</p><h2 class="head1">III. GOD&rsquo;S WORK OF RESTORATION<br />IN THE OLD CREATION</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Using a Short Period of Insertion</h2><p>At the end of the dispensation of grace, God will insert a short period, from the beginning of the great tribulation to the end of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21), to carry out His work of restoration in the remaining nations. During the great tribulation, Antichrist will lead the nations on the earth in rebellion against God and persecute God&rsquo;s people. On the one hand, God will smite and destroy Antichrist and the nations who follow him; on the other hand, He will carry out His work of restoration in a group of people of the nations, that they may become His people in the earthly section of the millennial kingdom.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Through His Eternal Gospel</h2><p>During the great tribulation, when Antichrist will persecute the people of Israel and the Christians, God will send an angel to mid-heaven to announce the eternal gospel to those settled on the earth, telling them to fear God, that is, not to follow Antichrist in persecuting the aforementioned two kinds of God&rsquo;s people, and to worship God who has made the heaven and the earth and the sea, that is, not to worship the image of Antichrist (Rev. 14:6-7; 13:14-15). Through the eternal gospel God will gain a group of righteous people, the sheep justified by Christ in Matthew 25:31-40. (See point III.B.2 in Lesson Twenty-three and point IV.E in this lesson.) They will be saved, but they will not be regenerated in the spirit to have God&rsquo;s life. They will merely be restored in their created natural life and be brought back to the original state of God&rsquo;s creation.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE RESULTS OF GOD&rsquo;S WORK<br />OF THE NEW CREATION AND<br />OF RESTORATION IN THE OLD CREATION</h2><p>In the old creation, according to the arrangement of His economy, God uses the aforementioned four dispensations to carry out His work of the new creation in the man of the old creation, and He further uses a short period of insertion to carry out His work of restoration in the remaining nations through His eternal gospel. These two kinds of work produce the following results:</p><h2 class="head2">A. Producing the Redeemed</h2><p>The first result of God&rsquo;s work of the new creation in the old creation is the producing of His chosen, called, and redeemed saints, including all the saved ones in the Old Testament and in the New Testament (Heb. 12:23; Rev. 5:9b).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Obtaining the Overcomers</h2><p>The second result of God&rsquo;s work of the new creation in the old creation is the obtaining of a group of overcomers from among the redeemed. They will be the ones who are perfected and have reached the maturity in God&rsquo;s life (Heb. 11:39-40; Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21).</p><h2 class="head2">C. Constituting the New Jerusalem<br />in the Millennium</h2><p>God&rsquo;s work of the new creation in the old creation produces a third result, that is, the perfected and matured overcomers of both the Old and New Testaments constituting the New Jerusalem in the millennium (Rev. 2:7), which is the heavenly section of the millennial kingdom, the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the age of the millennium (Matt. 13:43). Both the Old and New Testament overcomers will be there to enjoy God&rsquo;s eternal life as a feast (Matt. 8:11; 19:29) and to reign as kings (Rev. 20:4-6).</p><h2 class="head2">D. Producing the Priests in the Millennium</h2><p>At Christ&rsquo;s second coming all Israel will be saved (Rom. 11:26) and be the priests in the earthly section of the millennial kingdom to teach the people of the nations to serve God (Zech. 8:20-23). They should be the twelve tribes of Israelites who will be sealed by the angels, as recorded in Revelation 7:1-8. They are saved through God&rsquo;s pouring out of the Holy Spirit and by their calling upon the Lord&rsquo;s name (Zech. 12:10; Acts 2:18-21). According to the new covenant which God has covenanted with them, they receive the law of life, a new heart, a new spirit, and God&rsquo;s Spirit (Jer. 31:31, 33; Ezek. 36:26-27). Hence, they are regenerated and saved just like the New Testament believers. However, because they are saved after the church has been raptured, they are not included in the church and thus cannot join the overcomers of both the Old and New Testaments to enter into the millennial kingdom, the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, to reign as kings, but can only enter the earthly section of the millennial kingdom to serve as priests. At the end of the millennial kingdom, they will be able to join all the redeemed people of God of both the Old and New Testaments to enter into the New Jerusalem and be included in all the redeemed people of Israel (Rev. 21:12). This is the fourth result of God&rsquo;s work of the new creation in the old creation.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Producing the Citizens in the Millennium</h2><p>In the short period of insertion God will gain a group of God-fearing righteous ones who will be restored (see point III in this lesson) to be the citizens in the millennial kingdom (Matt. 25:34). This is the first result of God&rsquo;s work of restoration in the old creation.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Perfecting the Immature Believers</h2><p>The believers who have been called and redeemed, but who cannot enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the millennium to participate in the New Jerusalem of the millennial kingdom, will also become mature in God&rsquo;s life after they have been disciplined and perfected by God during the millennium, the period of reward and punishment (Matt. 24:48-51; 25:26-30). This is the fifth result of God&rsquo;s work of the new creation in the old creation.</p><h2 class="head2">G. Purging to Produce the People<br />in the New Heaven and New Earth</h2><p>At the end of the millennium, among the nations who are restored to be the peoples in the millennial kingdom, Gog and Magog will be deceived by the Devil to rebel against God. This will be mankind&rsquo;s last rebellion against God, at the end of which the rebellious ones will be devoured by fire from heaven (Rev. 20:7-10). After this last purging of mankind, the remaining ones among them will be transferred to the new earth of the new heaven and new earth to be God&rsquo;s peoples in eternity (Rev. 21:3, 24). This is the second result of God&rsquo;s work of restoration in the old creation.</p><h2 class="head2">H. Terminating All the Rebellious Creatures<br />of the Old Creation&mdash;a Secondary Result</h2><p>Satan (Rev. 20:10) with the demons who are his followers (Rev. 20:13a) and all the unbelieving sinners throughout the generations, those who reject God and would not accept God&rsquo;s way of redemption (Rev. 19:20; Matt. 25:41; Rev. 20:11-15; 21:8), will be judged and cast into the lake of fire to suffer the punishment of eternal fire. Thus, God will terminate the old heaven and old earth and all the creatures who rebel against God. This is a result of God&rsquo;s clearing up of the old creation, after He finishes both His work of the new creation and of restoration in the old creation. The new heaven and new earth thus become the universe with the New Jerusalem as its center (Rev. 21:1-2).</p><h2 class="head2">I. Constituting the New Jerusalem<br />in the New Heaven and New Earth</h2><p>The saints who are perfected in the period of reward and punishment during the millennium, and the Israelites who are restored to be the priests in the millennial kingdom, will join the overcomers, who have ripened earlier, to constitute the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth (Rev. 21:1-2). This is the final result of God&rsquo;s work of the new creation in the old creation.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Renewed New Universe</h2><p>The new heaven and new earth (Rev. 21:1; Isa. 65:17; 66:22; 2 Pet. 3:10-13) with the New Jerusalem as the center will be the new universe which God will renew out of the old heaven and old earth. Although the heaven and earth which were created by God have become old because of Satan&rsquo;s corruption, God&rsquo;s purpose in creating the heaven and earth could not be stopped. On the one hand, God will exercise His almighty power to judge the Satan-corrupted old heaven and old earth, and on the other hand, He will renew the judged old heaven and old earth into the new heaven and new earth; thus, the old heaven and old earth will be rid of their oldness and be renewed into a new universe suitable for God&rsquo;s use to accomplish His eternal purpose and in which He might express Himself eternally and fully.</p><h2 class="head2">B. With the New Earth as the Focus</h2><p>After the coming out of the new heaven and new earth, the holy city, New Jerusalem, will descend to the new earth (Rev. 21:1-2), indicating that the dwelling place of God and His redeemed will not be in heaven but on the new earth. Furthermore, the restored nations, whose rebellious nature will have been completely purged, will become the nations on the new earth around the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:24). In the new universe, the new heaven and new earth, God&rsquo;s focus is on the new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Not a Physical City</h2><p>The New Jerusalem cannot be a physical city, as commonly believed by Christians, for the following reasons:</p><p>First, the New Jerusalem is the crystallized product of God&rsquo;s work in the old creation throughout the generations. If this crystallized product is merely a physical city, it would seem to be too low and would not have any spiritual value.</p><p>Second, the New Jerusalem is the consummation of the entire divine revelation in the Bible. If it is merely a physical city, it would make the divine revelation of mystery not so mysterious after all.</p><p>Third, the revelation of the entire book of Revelation is mainly made known to us by signs (Rev. 1:1) symbolizing the important persons and things, such as the golden lampstands in 1:12, signifying the churches bearing the shining testimony of Jesus Christ; the stars in 1:16, signifying the bright and shining messengers of the churches; the mysterious Babylon the Great in 17:5, signifying the religious Rome; and the bride in 19:7, signifying the overcoming saints as the spouse of Christ. Hence, the New Jerusalem also should be a sign signifying the dwelling place of God and man in eternity.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Crystallized Product and Masterpiece<br />of God&rsquo;s Work of the New Creation<br />throughout the Generations</h2><p>After God finished the creation of all things and man, He used different ways in the different dispensations in the old heaven and old earth to carry out His work in the man of the old creation by choosing, redeeming, renewing, transforming, and glorifying them; thus, He perfects them according to His desire and builds them up to be His eternal habitation, which is the New Jerusalem of His heart&rsquo;s desire. This is the crystallized product and masterpiece of God&rsquo;s work of the new creation throughout the generations.</p><h2 class="head2">C. A Composition of the Redeemed Saints<br />throughout the Generations</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a composition of all the redeemed and perfected saints in both the Old and New Testaments throughout the generations.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Old Testament Saints</h2><p>The names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel are inscribed on the gates of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:12). This indicates that the Old Testament saints are the components of the New Jerusalem. Gates as the entrance into the city indicate that the Old Testament is the child-conductor who will lead the believers to Christ (Gal. 3:24). The Old Testament history of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel leads us into the New Jerusalem through the pearl gates, which signify Christ who has died and resurrected.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The New Testament Believers</h2><p>The names of the twelve apostles are on the foundations of the wall of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:14). This indicates that the New Testament believers are also the constituents of the New Jerusalem. All the New Testament saints who have been led into Christ are being built upon the foundation of the apostles (Eph. 2:20), that is, being built upon the revelation which the apostles received for the building of the church, to become the wall of the New Jerusalem.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Bride of the Lamb</h2><p>Revelation 21:2 and 9 clearly tell us that the New Jerusalem is the bride, the wife of the Lamb. In the whole Bible God repeatedly likens His chosen people to a spouse (Isa. 54:6; Jer. 3:1; Ezek. 16:8; Hosea 2:19; 2 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:31-32) for His satisfaction in love. As the wife of Christ, the New Jerusalem comes out of Christ to be His spouse, just as Eve came out of Adam and became his counterpart (Gen. 2:21-24). The bride is mainly for the wedding day, while the wife is for the entire married life. The New Jerusalem will first be the bride of Christ in the millennium for one thousand years as one day (2 Pet. 3:8), and then His wife in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. The bride in the millennium will include only the overcoming saints (Rev. 3:12; 19:7-9), but the wife in the new heaven and new earth will include all the redeemed and regenerated sons of God (Rev. 21:7).</p><h2 class="head2">E. The Tabernacle of God among Men</h2><p>The New Jerusalem as the tabernacle of God (Rev. 21:3) indicates that all the redeemed and perfected ones will become God&rsquo;s eternal dwelling place. In both the Old and New Testaments God likens His chosen people to a dwelling place (Exo. 29:45-46; Num. 5:3; Ezek. 43:7, 9; Psa. 68:18; 1 Cor. 3:16-17; 6:19; 2 Cor. 6:16; 1 Tim. 3:15). The spouse is for God&rsquo;s satisfaction in love, and the dwelling place is for His rest in expression. The New Jerusalem is God&rsquo;s dwelling place among men (His peoples on the new earth&mdash;Rev. 21:3) for Him to be expressed for eternity.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The City Proper Being of Pure Gold</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a mountain of gold (Rev. 21:18). In typology gold signifies the divine nature. Therefore, this city as God&rsquo;s dwelling place is absolutely composed of God&rsquo;s divine nature. The New Jerusalem itself comes out of God&rsquo;s divine nature.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Gates Being of Pearl</h2><p>The twelve gates of the New Jerusalem are twelve pearls; each one of the gates is, respectively, of one pearl (Rev. 21:21). Pearl signifies Christ passing through death and secreting His resurrection life in resurrection that His believers may have the life of God and enter into the New Jerusalem to be God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Wall and Foundation Being of Precious Stones</h2><h2 class="head4">a. Jasper for the Wall</h2><p>The wall of the New Jerusalem is built with jasper (Rev. 21:18). Jasper is a transformed precious stone (1 Cor. 3:12) that bears the appearance of God (Rev. 4:3) to express God. Hence, the jasper wall signifies that the New Jerusalem, as the corporate expression of God in eternity, bears the appearance of God. The believers were created clay (Gen. 2:7), but they have been regenerated and have the very element of God, and they are being transformed into precious stones&mdash;jasper&mdash;as the expression of God&rsquo;s appearance.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Precious Stones for the Foundation</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a city which has the foundations (Heb. 11:10). The wall of the city has twelve foundations which are adorned with every precious stone (Rev. 21:14, 19-20). The first layer of the wall&rsquo;s foundation, like the wall, is built with jasper. This indicates that the main material in the building of the holy city is jasper, which signifies God expressed in His glory (Rev. 21:11). Twelve different kinds of precious stones signify the unsearchable riches of Christ in different aspects (Eph. 3:8) for a full expression of all the riches of God&rsquo;s glory.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Triune God Being the Temple and the Light</h2><h2 class="head4">a. The Temple of the City</h2><p>There is no temple in the New Jerusalem, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb (Rev. 21:22). The Greek word for temple here denotes the inner temple, the Holy of Holies, signifying that God and the Lamb Themselves will be the place in which we serve God. The holy city as the tabernacle of God is for God to dwell in, and God and the Lamb as the temple are for us to dwell in. In eternity we will not dwell in a material city; we will dwell in the Triune God. We are God&rsquo;s tabernacle, and He is our temple; He dwells in us, and we dwell in Him. In the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem will be a mutual dwelling place for God and man for eternity.</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Light of the City</h2><p>In the New Jerusalem there is no need of the sun nor of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumines it, and its lamp is the Lamb (Rev. 21:23). God is the light of the holy city, and the Lamb is the lamp; God is the content of the lamp, and the Lamb is the light-bearer. This indicates that, as the light of the holy city, God in Christ shines with His glory to illumine the city. Since such a divine light will illumine the holy city, it has no need of any natural light (Rev. 22:5). Although the sun and the moon will be in the new heaven and new earth, the dwelling place for both God and us will be much brighter than either of them, even subduing their brightness. Hence, in the New Jerusalem there will be no night. Outside the city there will still be the distinction between day and night, but within the city there will be no such distinction. There will be no night within the city because we shall have God Himself as the eternal, unchanging light.</p><h2 class="head3">5. The Throne of the Triune God Being the Center</h2><p>Revelation 22:1 shows us that in the center of the New Jerusalem there is the throne of God and of the Lamb. The throne is for God&rsquo;s administration and the exercise of His authority. Sitting on the throne are God and the Lamb. One throne for both God and the Lamb indicates that God and the Lamb are inseparable. God is in Christ sitting on His throne. This is comparable to what is indicated in Revelation 21:23: that God as the light is in Christ as the lamp, and They are one. &ldquo;God and the Lamb&rdquo; indicates that in eternity God is the Lamb-God, the redeeming God. The ruling One in eternity is the redeeming God. His ruling in eternity is based upon the redemption which He has accomplished in Christ. The throne of His administration and ruling in eternity is the center of the dwelling place for both Him and His redeemed. Everything in the holy city is put in subjection under His throne.</p><h2 class="head3">6. The Flow of the Triune God Being the Supply</h2><p>In the New Jerusalem there is a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of the street to supply the whole city (Rev. 22:1).</p><h2 class="head4">a. Flowing in the Middle of the Street of Pure Gold</h2><p>The street of the New Jerusalem is pure gold (Rev. 21:21). The river of water of life flowing in the middle of the street signifies the divine life flowing in the divine nature becoming the unique way in the holy city for the saints to walk in. In the holy city the saints live and walk in God&rsquo;s nature.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Becoming the River of Water of Life as the Saturation</h2><p>The river of water of life is a symbol of the processed Triune God in Christ as the life-giving Spirit (John 7:38-39; 1 Cor. 15:45) flowing out Himself to saturate His redeemed people, the constituents of the New Jerusalem. In eternity all the redeemed people will drink the water of life as their eternal portion (Rev. 21:6; 22:17b).</p><h2 class="head4">c. With the Tree of Life as the Supply</h2><p>On this side and on that side of the river is the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month (Rev. 22:2). The one tree of life growing on the two sides of the river signifies that the tree of life is a vine, spreading and proceeding along the flow of the water of life for the supply of the entire city. The tree of life signifies Christ as the life supply of the saints. In the millennial kingdom the overcoming believers will enjoy Christ as the tree of life as their reward (Rev. 2:7); in the New Jerusalem all God&rsquo;s redeemed will enjoy Christ as the tree of life as their eternal portion (Rev. 22:14, 19).</p><h2 class="head2">F. The Mingling of the Triune God<br />with the Redeemed Tripartite Man</h2><p>The supply of the New Jerusalem is the river of water of life which proceeds out of the throne of the Triune God, with the tree of life growing on the two sides of the river; the light of life also illuminates the entire city. In eternity God&rsquo;s redeemed will drink of the water of the river of life, eat of the fruit of the tree of life, and walk in the light of life. The light of life signifies the Father (1 John 1:5); the tree of life, the Son; and the water of life, the Spirit (John 7:39). The Triune God becomes the life and enjoyment of His redeemed. He is their content, and they are His expression; they dwell in Him, and He dwells in them. This is the divine mingling of the Triune God with the redeemed, transformed, and glorified tripartite man. This mingling is the mutual dwelling for the redeeming God and His redeemed as His corporate expression in eternity. Thus God accomplishes His eternal plan, His eternal economy. &ldquo;Three,&rdquo; signifying God, multiplied by &ldquo;four,&rdquo; signifying the creatures, produces &ldquo;twelve,&rdquo; a particular number signifying the New Jerusalem. This indicates that the New Jerusalem is the divine mingling (&ldquo;twelve&rdquo;) of the Triune God (&ldquo;three&rdquo;) with the created man (&ldquo;four&rdquo;).</p><h2 class="head2">G. The Kings in the Holy City<br />and the People around It</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The Kings in the Holy City</h2><p>All those who have been redeemed and perfected and have matured in God&rsquo;s life will be the kings in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 22:5) to reign over the nations as the people (Rev. 21:24). As the regenerated ones, they will eat the fruit of the tree of life in eternity; that is, they will enjoy Christ as their life supply for eternity.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The People around It</h2><p>The restored and purged nations will be the people on the new earth around the New Jerusalem to be under the rule of the kings in the city. As the merely restored ones, they will be maintained to live in eternity by the healing of the leaves of the tree of life (Rev. 22:2). In the Bible, leaves are a symbol of man&rsquo;s deeds (Gen. 3:7). The leaves of the tree of life symbolize the deeds of Christ. The nations around the holy city are healed by the leaves of the tree of life, taking the deeds of Christ as their leading and regulation outwardly, that they may live the human life for eternity.</p><h2 class="head1">VII. CONCLUSION</h2><p>The Bible is a record and a revelation of God&rsquo;s two great works, the first being God&rsquo;s work of the old creation, and the second, God&rsquo;s work of the new creation. God&rsquo;s work of the old creation is a preparation for His work of the new creation. It is His work of the new creation that will accomplish His divine and eternal economy. The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of His two great works; it is the masterpiece of His divine work and the crystallized product of His works of the old creation and the new creation. The New Jerusalem is mysterious, divine, glorious, and holy. Its revelation is the conclusion and consummation of the whole Bible, including both the Old and New Testaments. Hence, it is here that this volume of the <em>Truth Lessons</em>also draws to a conclusion.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>The New Jerusalem revealed in the last two chapters of the New Testament is the conclusion of the whole Bible, as well as of the New Testament; it is also the consummation of the entire divine revelation. God&rsquo;s work in the universe is of two categories, the old creation and the new creation. The sphere of His work of the old creation was the old heaven and old earth; the sphere of His work of the new creation is the new heaven and new earth, which are the original God-created old heaven and old earth renewed through the burning of God&rsquo;s judging fire. Since the completion of the creation of the old heaven and old earth and everything therein, and since the fall of man, God has used four different dispensations&mdash;the dispensation of the Patriarchs, the dispensation of law, the dispensation of grace, and the dispensation of righteousness&mdash;to carry out the work of the new creation in man, who is of the Satan-ruined and God-judged old creation, by the Spirit and life of Himself as the Triune God who has been processed through incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension; by His heavenly ministry after His ascension; and by what He will accomplish in His second coming. God first used the dispensation of the Patriarchs to lead the created and fallen sinners to look to the coming Christ in whom all the families on earth would be blessed. Because they did not know their own weakness and wickedness, God further used the dispensation of law to expose their condition that they might be led to Christ. Following this, He uses the dispensation of grace to work the fallen sinners into Christ and to work Christ into them, thus producing the church. Finally, He will use the dispensation of righteousness to reward the perfected Old Testament saints and the overcoming New Testament believers in Christ; He will also perfect the immature New Testament believers in Christ that they may arrive at the maturity in His life. At the end of the dispensation of grace, He will use a short period of insertion to carry out His work of restoration in the remaining nations through His eternal gospel, that He may gain a group of righteous ones. His work of the new creation through the different dispensations in the old creation and His work of restoration in the short inserted period will have the following results: (1) all the redeemed people of the Old Testament and New Testament will be produced; (2) among the redeemed, a group of overcomers who are perfected and have arrived at the maturity in God&rsquo;s life will be obtained; (3) the overcomers will be constituted the New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom and become the kings in the heavenly part of the millennium; (4) all Israel will be saved and serve as priests in the earthly part of the millennium; (5) at the end of the dispensation of grace, the remainder of the nations will be restored as the citizens in the earthly part of the millennium; (6) the redeemed but immature believers, who are unable to participate in the New Jerusalem of the millennium, will be perfected and become mature in God&rsquo;s life; (7) the nations, having been restored as the people in the millennium, will be purged and be brought into the new earth of the new heaven and new earth as God&rsquo;s people for eternity; (8) as a secondary result, all the creatures who rebel against God will be terminated and cast into the lake of fire; and (9) all the Old Testament and New Testament saints who have been redeemed and perfected and have reached the maturity in God&rsquo;s life will be constituted the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. After God completes all His work, the new heaven and new earth will be brought in, with the ultimately consummated New Jerusalem as the center. The New Jerusalem is the crystallized product and masterpiece of God&rsquo;s work in the old creation throughout the generations. It is not a physical city. Rather, it is a composition of all God&rsquo;s redeemed believers throughout the ages to be the bride of Christ and the mutual dwelling place of God and His redeemed for eternity. It is also a divine and glorious organism, a mingling of the processed Triune God in the elements of His divine Trinity&mdash;the Father&rsquo;s nature, the Son&rsquo;s life which has passed through death and resurrection, and the Spirit&rsquo;s regenerating and transforming element&mdash;with His redeemed and transformed tripartite man. The all-inclusive and unlimited Triune God, who is a constituent of such a mingling, is its temple, light, lamp, and the life saturation and supply, that it may be His full and consummated expression in eternity to express His unlimited Self from the center to the circumference fully, completely, and eternally!</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>What is the importance of the New Jerusalem?</li><li>What is the difference between God&rsquo;s work of the old creation and the new creation?</li><li>What is the old heaven and old earth?
