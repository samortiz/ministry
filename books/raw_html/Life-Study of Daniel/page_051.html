<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>g. Through His Craftiness<br>Causing Deceit to Prosper in His Hand</H2><P>Through his craftiness he would also cause deceit to prosper in his hand. He would magnify himself in his heart, and he would destroy many who were complacently secure (v. 25a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>h. Standing Up against the Prince of Princes</H2><P>He would stand up against the Prince of princes (God), but he would be broken, yet not by human hands (v. 25b). In all these items also he typifies Antichrist (Rev. 13:6; 17:11; 19:20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>i. The Days for Him to Do<br>Evil Things in the Holy Land<br>Being Two Thousand Three Hundred Days</H2><P>The days for him, Antiochus Epiphanes, to do evil things in the holy land would be two thousand three hundred days, from about 171 B.C. until December 25, 165 B.C., which would be the day when the Jewish hero Maccabeus would cleanse the sanctuary after defeating Antiochus Epiphanes (Dan. 8:13-14, 26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE INTERPRETATION OF THE VISION</H2><P>In 8:15-27 we are given the interpretation of the vision concerning a ram and a male goat with its successors.</P>
