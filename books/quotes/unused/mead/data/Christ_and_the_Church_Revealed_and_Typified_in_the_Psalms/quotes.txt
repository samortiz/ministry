[2]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in the summer of 1969 in Los Angeles, California.
[3]  Some of the Scripture quotations in this book are gathered from a number of better versions and translations which give a better rendering of the passage than the King James Version.
[4]  CHAPTER ONE CHRIST VERSUS THE LAW Psalms 1 and 2 Scripture Reading: Luke 24:27, 44-45; Psa 1 2 INTRODUCTION
[5]  All Christians know that in the Bible there is a wonderful book called the Psalms.
[6]  Yet most of them merely know that this book is wonderful; they cannot tell why it is so wonderful.
[7]  All the Psalms are the expressions of the godly saints drawn from their experiences.
[8]  The writers, being godly saints, did their utmost to utter something in praise to God according to their experiences.
[9]  All the 150 Psalms are divided into five separate books, each of which is composed of a number of Psalms with a distinctive point of spiritual significance.
[10]  Book I: composed of Psalms 1 to 41, indicates how God's intention is to turn the seeking saints from the law to Christ that they may enjoy the house of God.
[11]  PSALM 1 THE CONCEPT OF THE SAINTS CONCERNING THE LAW
[12]  I know you will say that Psalm 1 is an excellent Psalm, and all Christians would agree.
[13]  I know you are all for it, but you are for it according to the human concept.
[14]  The twelve verses of Psalm 2 can be divided into four sections, with three verses in each section.
[15]  The first three verses predict the opposition of the world rulers to Christ.
[16]  CHAPTER TWO CHRIST THE ANSWER TO HUMAN PROBLEMS Psalms 3 to 8 Scripture Reading: Psa 3:4; 5:7, 11; 8:1-9; Heb 2:6-10; Eph 1:22-23
[17]  Now we proceed from Psalm 2 to Psalm 8.
[18]  If you have not seen the difference between Psalm 1 and Psalm 2, it is rather difficult to go on to Psalm 8.
[19]  Sixty percent of Psalm 2 has been quoted by the New Testament, either directly or indirectly.
[20]  The thought of Psalm 2 is the same as that of the New Testament; thus, in a sense, you may find every part of Psalm 2 there.
[21]  But after this clear word, there are Psalms 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.
[22]  Do you realize that the Christ of Psalm 8 is incarnated as a man?
[23]  Without Hebrews 2, it would be difficult to discover the mentioning in Psalm 8 of Christ as a man.
[24]  Hebrews 2 discloses that the man mentioned in Psalm 8 is Christ.
[25]  God made Christ a little lower than the angels this was the incarnation, and this was the man by the name of Jesus.
[26]  CHAPTER THREE CHRIST THE ONE WITH GOD Psalms 9 to 16 Scripture Reading: Psa 9:11, 14; 11:4; 14:7; 15:1; 16:1-11; Acts 2:25-28, 31
[27]  Now let us consider the kind of Psalms that follow Psalm 8.
[28]  They are of the same category as Psalms 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.
[29]  When Peter was on the mount of transfiguration, he spoke nonsense, but when he spoke on the day of Pentecost, he was transparently clear.
[30]  On the day of Pentecost, in Acts 2, he tells us that Psalm 16 is a prophecy of the resurrection of Christ.
[31]  The sixteenth Psalm shows us, was wholly of worth.
[32]  CHAPTER FOUR CHRIST CRUCIFIED Psalms 17 to 22:21 Scripture Reading: Psa 18:6, 22; 17:15; 18:43-44, 50; 20:6, 9; 21:3-5; 22:1-22
[33]  After Psalm 8, we have Psalm 16 as a continuation of the Psalms about Christ.
[34]  Then after Psalm 16, we have no more until Psalm 22.
[35]  In order to understand this Psalm, we must realize that it is one of a group of three Psalms concerning Christ Psalms 22, 23, and 24.
[36]  CHAPTER FIVE CHRIST RESURRECTED, THE SHEPHERD, AND THE COMING KING Psalms 22:22 to Psalm 24 Scripture Reading: Psa 22:22-31; 23 24 PSALM 22:22-31 CHRIST IN RESURRECTION
[37]  As we have seen, the first part of Psalm 22 depicts the death of Christ.
[38]  Now the last part of this Psalm speaks of the resurrection of Christ in a marvelous way.
[39]  But we have here not only one Psalm of Christ, but three Psalms of Christ.
[40]  After the valley, you may think that everything should be so wonderful.
[41]  It is after the valley of the shadow of death that you are qualified and equipped for fighting.
[42]  Psalm 24 is one of the deepest of all the Psalms, and it is rather difficult to understand.
[43]  It opens by saying, "The earth is the Lord's."
[44]  Apparently, the earth today is not the Lord's. Even when this Psalm was written the earth was apparently not the Lord's. But have you realized that on this earth there was at least a hill, which was called the hill of His holiness, and at least that hill was His? Thus, verse 3 says, "Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord?" The earth is the Lord's, but actually today the earth is not the Lord's. Yet on this earth there is at least a hill, at least a spot, which is the Lord's.
[45]  CHAPTER SIX CHRIST BRINGING US TO THE HOUSE Psalms 25 to 41 Scripture Reading: Psa 40:6-8; 34:8; 26:8; 27:4-6; 28:2; 29:9b; 36:7-9; 31:21
[46]  We have covered six Psalms of Christ Psalms 2, 8, 16, 22, 23 and 24.
[47]  Now let us come to the most strategic point, the house and the city, and see how the saints experience and enjoy God there.
[48]  Firstly, they love God's house as the habitation where God's glory dwells: "Lord, I love the habitation of thy house, and the place where thy glory dwelleth" Psa 26:8 .
[49]  Secondly, they desire to dwell in the house of God to behold His beauty, inquire in His temple, be hidden and protected in it, offer sacrifices of joy, and sing praises to Him: "One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple.
[50]  CHAPTER SEVEN CHRIST BECOMING MORE PRECIOUS IN THE HOUSE Psalms 42 to 45 Scripture Reading: Psa 42:1, 4; 43:3-4; 45:1-17 BOOK II PSALMS 42 TO 72
[51]  Now we come to Book II, composed of Psalms 42 to 72.
[52]  As this book indicates how the saints experience God and His house and city through the suffering, exalted and reigning Christ, so it begins with the words: "As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God" 42:1 .
[53]  The saints, being stripped by God, desire to seek God Himself.
[54]  We enjoy the house so much now and we are praising, but after this we enjoy something of Christ in a much deeper way.
[55]  In Psalm 45, Christ, being known by the saints more deeply, becomes the saints' sweeter experience in the local churches, and it is realized that His reign will be over all the earth through His believers, and He will be praised by all the peoples.
[56]  Verse 6 speaks of His kingdom: "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the scepter of thy kingdom is a right scepter."
[57]  After His riding, fighting, and coming back, we have the kingdom with the throne.
[58]  Beginning with verse 9, we enter the second section of Psalm 45.
[59]  The praise about the King should undoubtedly come first, but the praise concerning the queen should follow.
[60]  Suppose you were the King: what part of the praise would make you happier?
[61]  If I were the King, I would delight more in the praise about the queen.
[62]  CHAPTER EIGHT CHRIST AS GOD-KING EXPERIENCED BY US AND REIGNING IN THE CITY Psalms 46 to 48 Scripture Reading: Psa 46 48
[63]  We have seen that the church comes into being out of the experience of the enjoyment of Christ.
[64]  PSALM 46 GOD MEETING OUR NEEDS IN THE CITY
[65]  "God is our refuge and strength, a very ready help in trouble" v. 1 . Where is God our refuge, our strength, and a very ready help in trouble? In the city! God is all this to us in the city.
[66]  Verses 2 and 3 then tell us something as a background for the city.
[67]  PSALM 47 GOD IN CHRIST RULING OVER ALL THE EARTH THROUGH THE CITY
[68]  Then, Psalm 47 continues by telling us that this very God who meets our needs in the city will be, in Christ, the King over all the earth through the city, the strengthened and enlarged church.
[69]  In Brother Watchman Nee's three-volume book, The Spiritual Man, there is a section concerning spiritual warfare.
[70]  That section was composed mostly from articles written by Mrs. Penn-Lewis concerning the experiences of Evan Roberts of Wales, the leader of the Welsh revival of 1904.
[71]  Evan Roberts himself experienced considerable spiritual warfare, but what he experienced was only on an individual, personal level.
[72]  CHAPTER NINE THE ENJOYMENT OF THE HOUSE AND THE CITY OF GOD THROUGH CHRIST Psalms 49 to 67 Scripture Reading: Psa 50:2; 51:18-19; 52:8; 53:6a; 55:14; 61:4; 63:1-2; 65:1, 4; 66:13
[73]  In Book I of the Psalms Christ is emphasized and the house of God is then sweetly presented.
[74]  Many dear Christians who love the Psalms have failed to see this.
[75]  A few have seen Christ, but hardly one has really seen the house of God.
[76]  Furthermore, in Psalm 51:18 the Psalmist says, "Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion."
[77]  Can you explain what it means for God to "do good" unto Zion?
[78]  Sometimes we just read over these verses without at all realizing their intent.
[79]  In Psalm 63 we see a further aspect of the saints' enjoyment of the house: They looked upon God in his sanctuary to see his power and his glory.
[80]  "O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is" v. 1 . This experience is similar to that of a dear brother who has been in the church, but who is now out of it.
[81]  He is in a dry and thirsty place without water; so he is longing for satisfaction.
[82]  CHAPTER TEN CHRIST'S ATTAINMENT IN HIS ASCENSION FOR THE BUILDING OF GOD'S HOUSE Psalm 68 Scripture Reading: Psa 68:1, 4-6, 9-13, 15-32, 35
[83]  Now we come to the highest peak of all the Psalms, Psalm 68.
[84]  When I was a young Christian, I was always afraid to come to this Psalm, because I simply could not comprehend its meaning.
[85]  The third point in this Psalm is Christ's ascension.
[86]  The first point in this Psalm concerns God's move on this earth.
[87]  The second is His victory in Christ; where God moves, God wins the victory.
[88]  After I was saved, I heard many messages and read many books which told how to be a victorious Christian.
[89]  These messages and books indicated that I had many enemies: the world is my enemy; my self is my enemy; my temper, my hatred, and all my problems are my enemies.
[90]  Then these messages and books indicated many wonderful ways to overcome these enemies.
[91]  Next we need to pray that God will strengthen that which He has wrought for us out of the church.
[92]  "Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us out of thy temple" vv.
[93]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE REIGN OF THE SUFFERING CHRIST OVER ALL THE EARTH Psalms 69 to 72 Scripture Reading: Psa 69:9, 35-36; 72:6-11, 15-19
[94]  Psalm 72 is the last Psalm of Book II, and it ends in this way: "Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.
[95]  And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen."
[96]  Psalm 41 closes the first book of the Psalms, and its last verse says, "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting.
[97]  Now we come to the last Psalm of Book II, Psalm 72.
[98]  The Psalms are like a great mountain with many peaks, and here we have another peak.
[99]  Psalm 72 tells us how Christ shall reign over the whole earth and how the saints shall be glorified and blessed with Him.
[100]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE DESOLATION OF GOD'S HOUSE AND CHRIST AS THE SOLUTION Psalms 73 to 76 Scripture Reading: Psa 73:1-3, 12-17, 25-26; 74:2-3, 7-8; 75:2, 4-7; 76:2-4
[101]  Now with Psalm 73 we begin Book III of the Psalms.
[102]  Book III indicates how the saints, in their experiences, realize that the house and the city of God with all the enjoyments thereof can only be preserved and maintained through Christ properly appreciated and exalted by God's people.
[103]  This means that if we would have a consistent experience of the house and the city of God with all their enjoyment, we must appreciate Christ and know Christ in a proper way.
[104]  As we turn to Psalm 73, we must recall again Psalm 1.
[105]  I know that by now you are very well acquainted with our case concerning Psalm 1, but allow me to expose it again in the light of Psalm 73.
[106]  PSALM 74 THE DESOLATION OF THE HOUSE OF GOD
[107]  Now we must go on from Psalm 73 to Psalm 74.
[108]  In Psalm 73 we had the sufferings and deprivations of the saints themselves.
[109]  PSALM 76 THE VICTORY OF GOD IN HIS DWELLING PLACE
[110]  According to the arrangement of all the Psalms, this signifies that the defeat of the enemies of God follows the desolation, just as Psalm 76 follows Psalm 74.
[111]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE WAY OF RESTORATION EXALTING CHRIST Psalms 77 to 83 Scripture Reading: Psa 77:7-13; 78:65-66, 68-69; 79:1; 80:14-15, 17-19; 82:8; 83:2-5, 12, 18
[112]  In Psalms 77 to 83 we are further impressed with the reason for the desolation of God's house and the way of recovery.
[113]  After the desolation, God's dwelling place can only be restored by His people giving the pre-eminence to Christ.
[114]  When Christ is given His rightful position, God will be able to take possession of the earth through the local churches.
[115]  Psalms 79 and 80 tell us how the house and the city of God became desolate, but that the hope of recovery is in Christ, "the man of God's right hand."
[116]  Verses 1 to 3 of Psalm 79 indicate the desolation of God's house and city.
[117]  "O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps" v. 1 . No doubt this refers to the destruction wrought by the Babylonians.
[118]  Suppose now that the leading brothers of that particular local church hear these two young brothers speaking in such a way and are deeply offended.
[119]  They arise to defend themselves and assert their authority.
[120]  If the leading brothers react in this way, it means that they also are not under the headship of Christ, that they also are not giving Christ the pre-eminence.
[121]  PSALMS 81 TO 83 GOD'S INTENTION AND SATAN'S PLOT
[122]  Psalms 81 to 83 tell how Christ will judge and inherit the earth, and how the enemy desires to take God's habitation in possession.
[123]  I must repeat again that the Psalms are written in the style of poetry, and for this reason it is really difficult to understand them.
[124]  You thought they were merely a source of consolation, but now you see in them Christ, God's dwelling place, the house and city of God, and the way God will gain the earth.
[125]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE SAINTS' LOVE FOR THE HOUSE OF GOD WITH CHRIST Psalm 84 Scripture Reading: Psa 84:1-12
[126]  In Book II we have reached the highest peak, with the house and the city as the stepping-stone for the Lord to regain the earth.
[127]  But we still need more, for by the end of Book II we have only seen the positive side.
[128]  Now let us consider the various aspects of the Psalmist's experience concerning the house.
[129]  The first aspect of His enjoyment, poetically speaking, is the two altars.
[130]  "Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, at thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God!" v. 3 . Undoubtedly we are the sparrows, we are the swallows, we are the little creatures, so small and so frail.
[131]  Psalm 84 also shows us the way to Zion.
[132]  We go to Zion, firstly, by trusting in God.
[133]  The more you go on in the local church, the more strength you will gain.
[134]  "They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God" v. 7 . It is not your own strength, but the strength of God.
[135]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN GOD'S HEART IS SET UPON ZION WITH CHRIST Psalms 85 to 89 Scripture Reading: Psa 87:1-7; 89:19-21, 25-27, 29, 36-37
[136]  Before we come to the end of Book III, we need to review the main points we have already covered in the Psalms.
[137]  SUMMARY OF THE FIRST THREE BOOKS OF THE PSALMS
[138]  Now we come to the end of Book III, Psalms 85 to 89.
[139]  In Psalm 85 the saints ask God for restoration, and in Psalm 86 for salvation; but in Psalm 87 we see that God's heart is set on Zion, His city, with Christ within it.
[140]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN ONE WITH GOD IN HIS DWELLING PLACE Psalms 90 to 92 Scripture Reading: Psa 90:1-2, 4, 17; 91:1-2, 4, 9, 11-12, 14-16; 92:1-5, 10, 12-15
[141]  The main points in both the second and third books of the Psalms are identical: each book sets forth the house and the city, and eventually, in the last Psalm of each book, Christ reigning over the entire earth.
[142]  Both Book II and Book III conclude with the same glorious event.
[143]  PSALM 90 THE SAINTS TAKE GOD AS THEIR DWELLING PLACE
[144]  Now we must go on to Book IV, keeping in mind the message of the first three books.
[145]  Book IV tells us that the saints, being joined to Christ, are one with God, so that He can recover His title over the earth through Christ in His house and city.
[146]  Psalm 92 shows the result of taking God as our dwelling place.
[147]  When we and the Lord Jesus take God as our home, the issue firstly is that we will sing praises.
[148]  "It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High" v. 1 . Only by dwelling in God, by taking God as our habitation, and by letting His beauty be upon us, can we be filled with His praises.
[149]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE RECOVERY OF GOD'S TITLE OVER THE EARTH Psalms 93 to 101 Scripture Reading: Psa 93:1, 5; 94:15; 95:1-5; 96:1-4, 6-13; 97:1, 6-9; 98:2-9; 99:1-4, 9; 100:1-4; 101:8
[150]  These nine Psalms tell of the recovery of God's title over the earth through Christ in the house and the city of God.
[151]  Five times in these Psalms we read, "Make a joyful noise unto the Lord," and once, "Make a loud noise."
[152]  After the first group of the first three Psalms of Book IV, we have the second group of the next nine Psalms.
[153]  These nine Psalms are grouped together in a marvelous way.
[154]  All of them speak about the reigning of Christ and the recovery of the earth's title for God.
[155]  CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE EARTH TURNS TO THE LORD THROUGH ZION Psalms 102 to 106 Scripture Reading: Psa 102:12-16, 19-22, 24-27; 104:35b; 105:45b; 106:1, 47-48
[156]  Book IV of the Psalms is a short book, and there are just three main points: firstly, how the saints take God as their dwelling place, thus making them practically one with God Psalms 90 to 92 ; secondly, the recovery of God's title over the earth through Christ in the house and city of God.
[157]  Verse 21: "That men may declare the name of the Lord in Zion, and His praise in Jerusalem."
[158]  This verse mainly stresses the city rather than the house.
[159]  CHAPTER NINETEEN THE HIGHEST REVELATION OF CHRIST Psalms 107 to 110 Scripture Reading: Psa 107:31-32; 108:1-3; 109:1, 30; 110:1-7
[160]  By the end of Book IV we have the consummation, the completion.
[161]  Everything now has been recovered Christ, the house, the city, and the earth.
[162]  Verse 3: "Thy people are voluntary offerings in the day of thy power."
[163]  We have covered the first four Psalms of Book V, Psalms 107 to 110.
[164]  CHAPTER TWENTY CHRIST FOR THE BUILDING Psalms 111 to 125 Scripture Reading: Psa 111:1, 10b; 112:1a; 113:1-3; 115:18b; 116:13, 17-19; 117:1-2; 118:22-24, 26-27; 119:14, 24, 36, 59, 62, 103, 105, 111, 164, 167; 122:1-9; 125:1-2
[165]  In the preceding chapter we have covered Psalms 107, 108, 109, and 110.
[166]  In this group of four Psalms, Psalm 110 is the climax.
[167]  In Book V, we have primarily these two Psalms concerning Christ, Psalms 110 and 118.
[168]  We must worship God for them and thank Him that we have not only Psalm 110, but 118 as well.
[169]  Psalms 120 through 134 are called the Psalms of degree, or the songs of ascent.
[170]  This means that they are the Psalms of ascension, the Psalms of going up.
[171]  CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE THE LORD'S ABUNDANT BLESSING UPON ZION Psalms 126 to 134 Scripture Reading: Psa 126:1-6; 127:1; 128:5; 129:5-8; 132:3-5, 7-8, 11, 13-18; 133:1-3; 134:1-3
[172]  Book V, as we have seen, indicates how the house and the city of God become the praise, safety, and desire of the saints, and how Christ comes to reign over the whole earth through the house and the city of God.
[173]  This is the main theme of this book, and this is the ultimate issue of all the books.
[174]  Now not only do we have Christ, the house, and even the city, but everything is ready for Christ to come, to take over the whole earth, and to reign as the King with His saints through the house and the city.
[175]  Psalm 127:1, "Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain."
[176]  Verses 7 and 8: "We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.
[177]  Arise, O Lord, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength."
[178]  This is figurative of the recovery of the church life.
[179]  After such a wonderful Psalm as Psalm 132, we see a wonderful church life, the wonderful life of the brethren living together in unity.
[180]  "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!"
[181]  CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO THE SAINTS' PRAISE TURNS TO THE KINGDOM Psalms 135 to 145 Scripture Reading: Psa 135:1-3, 21; 136:1-3; 137:1-9; 138:1-2, 4-5; 139:7, 17; 140:7; 142:5; 143:6, 10; 144:9; 145:1-6, 10-13, 18, 21
[182]  The main Psalms of Book V that we have covered so far are Psalms 110 and 118 concerning Christ, Psalms 122, 126, and 132 concerning the house and the city, and Psalms 133 and 134 regarding the life in the house and in the city, that is, the life or the living of unity.
[183]  I advise the young brothers and sisters to memorize all these Psalms.
[184]  Now we have another wonderful Psalm, Psalm 137, one which we should never forget.
[185]  This is a Psalm regarding the remembrance of the experience of desolation, the remembrance of the experience of captivity.
[186]  "I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.
[187]  Psalm 145 tells how the saints praise God for His reigning in Christ and His Kingdom.
[188]  Verse 1 indicates that God is the King in Christ: "I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever."
[189]  CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE CONSUMMATE PRAISE Psalms 146 to 150 Scripture Reading: Psa 146:1-2, 10; 147:1-2a, 12-14, 20b; 148:1-5, 7a, 11-14; 149:1-3, 5-9; 150:1-6; Rev 19:1-9
[190]  After passing through the first one hundred and forty-five Psalms, we are now on the peak.
[191]  All we have to do now is to shout "Hallelujah!"
[192]  Finally we come to Psalm 150: "Hallelujah, praise the Lord, praise the Lord!"
[193]  In this Psalm we have ten different ways to praise the Lord: 1 "Hallelujah.
[194]  I believe we have all been deeply impressed with these four words, Christ, house, city, earth.
[195]  Let us forget about the negative one, the law.
[196]  Let us consider now all the main aspects of Christ in the Psalms: His divinity Psalm 45:6; Heb 1:8 His incarnation Psalm 8:4; Heb 2:6 His humanity Psalm 8:4; Heb 2:6 His human living Psalm 16:1-8 His death Psalm 22:1-21 His resurrection Psalms 2:7; 16:10; 22:22; Heb 2:12; Acts 2:25-32; 13:35-37 His ascension Psalm 68:18; Eph 4:8 His exaltation Psalms 80:17; 110:1 His crowning Psalm 8:5; Heb 2:9 His enthronement Psalm 2:6 His dominion, kingship, and authority Psalms 2:8; 8:6; 47; 72; 89; 110 His priesthood Psalm 110:4 His fighting Psalms 110:5, 6; 45:3-5 His victory Psalm 110:5, 6 His indwelling Psalm 22:22 His shepherding Psalm 23 The stone for the building Psalm 118:22 His coming Psalms 72; 96; 110 His reigning Psalms 93 101
[197]  Now we must go on from Christ to the house.
[198]  We have seen the aspects of Christ and the church as the house in the Psalms; now let us consider the aspects of the church as the city.
[199]  It is a strong city Psalm 31:21 There is a river with streams within it Psalm 46:4 God is in the midst of her Psalm 46:5 She shall not be moved Psalm 46:5 God shall help her Psalm 46:5 The Lord is great in her Psalm 48:1 The Lord is greatly praised in her Psalm 48:1 It is the mountain of His holiness Psalm 48:1 It is beautiful in elevation Psalm 48:2 It is the joy of the whole earth Psalm 48:2 It is the city of the great King Psalm 48:2 God is known in her Psalm 48:3 God is a high fortress in her Psalm 48:3 She is a terror to the enemy Psalm 48:4-6 God will establish her forever Psalm 48:8 It is a city of towers Psalm 48:12 It is a city of bulwarks Psalm 48:13 It is a city of palaces Psalm 48:3, 13 She is the perfection of beauty Psalm 50:2 She is the goal of God's good pleasure Psalm 51:18 She is the salvation of God's people Psalm 53:6 Kings shall bring presents unto her Psalm 68:29 God will save her Psalm 69:35 Those within her shall flourish Psalm 72:16 There God conquers the enemy Psalm 76:2-3 God has chosen her and loves her Psalm 78:68 God's foundation is there Psalm 87:1 Glorious things are spoken of her Psalm 87:3 She is the birthplace of the saints Psalm 87:5 She is the birthplace of Christ Psalm 87:6 The singers and players are there Psalm 87:7 All our springs are there Psalm 87:7 All the wicked will be cut off from her Psalm 101:8 She is built as a compact city Psalm 122:3 The thrones of judgment are set there Psalm 122:5 They shall prosper that love her Psalm 122:6 Peace is within her walls Psalm 122:7 Prosperity is within her palaces Psalm 122:7 All shall be put to shame and turned backward that hate her Psalm 129:5 It is God's rest forever Psalm 132:14 God will abundantly bless her provision Psalm 132:15 Her saints shall shout aloud for joy Psalm 132:16 The horn of David will bud there Psalm 132:17 The Lord blesses others out of her Psalm 134:3 The Lord is blessed out of her Psalm 135:21 She is preferred above our chief joy Psalm 137:6 She is built up by the Lord Psalm 137:2 The Lord strengthens the bars of her gates Psalm 147:13 The Lord fills her with the finest of the wheat Psalm 147:14 Her children are joyful in their King Psalm 149:2
[200]  When we put all these verses together, we see how wonderful this city is.
[201]  Comparing the aspects of the city with the aspects of the house, we see the difference.
[202]  The main aspects of the house speak of God's presence, whereas the principal aspects of the city bespeak God's authority, God's ruling power, God's reigning.
[203]  Now let us consider briefly the aspects of the earth as seen in the Psalms.
[204]  The word earth appears about 190 times altogether in the Psalms.
[205]  The earth has been given to Christ as an inheritance Psalm 2:8 His name will be excellent in all the earth Psalm 8:1 The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof Psalm 24:1 The earth was created by the Lord Psalm 24:2 Christ will come back to take the earth Psalm 96:13 Christ will reign over the earth Psalm 72:8 Christ will make His saints princes in all the earth Psalm 45:16 The earth will turn to Christ Psalm 22:27 The earth will remember Christ Psalm 22:27 The earth will worship Christ Psalm 22:27, 29 The earth will praise Christ Psalm 98:4 The whole earth will be filled with His glory Psalm 72:19
[206]  God's purpose in the entire universe is to express Himself in a corporate way, not just to express Himself through you or me or some other individual.
[207]  This is what the enemy opposes and seeks to frustrate more than anything else.
