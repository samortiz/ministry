   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Man s Spirit Preserved by God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the history of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Of course, man s spirit was also firstly created by God, yet after man s fall, his spirit became deadened and lost its spiritual function toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One crucial hint in the Bible concerning the human spirit has been missed by nearly all the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you read the Bible carefully with your experience of the spiritual life, you could realize that even after the fall of man, God preserved man s spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man s spirit was not only created by God, but also it has been preserved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was influenced by man s fall so that it became deadened and lost its function, but it was not invaded by God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It seems that God drew a line of separation around man s spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is based upon the teaching of Job Job was attacked by Satan, but his life was preserved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Job speaks about the human spirit in a strong way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Job 32:8 reads, But there is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You have to realize that human life actually is the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may say that human life is in the human body because there we have a kind of physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Temporarily you can say that.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Greek word bios is the root for what medical doctors refer to as biological life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But it is difficult even for the medical doctors to tell you what is life in the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, when man s spirit goes away from his body, the life is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And that life is not the physical bios.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That is the real life of man, and according to God s creation in Genesis 2:7, man s spirit came from the breath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That breath is man s spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We know this from Proverbs 20:27 which reads, The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, searching all his innermost parts ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That breath is also man s life, because Genesis 2:7 indicates that when the breath of God came into the nostrils of man, man became a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You cannot divide or separate the human life from the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Actually, the human spirit is the life of man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is hard to understand because life is altogether a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But anyhow you do have this hint in the Bible that the human spirit is the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When God preserved Job s life, it means God preserved Job s spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Satan touched Job s body, and he touched Job s mind, but he never touched Job s life, his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His spirit was preserved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even a fallen sinner, an unbeliever, has a spirit that has been preserved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When you were doing sinful things before you got saved, deep within you, a part was different.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You would say that was your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That is right.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The conscience is the leading part of your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With even the most fallen person, the spirit is preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a fallen person would take care of his conscience, he would never rob a bank; he would not steal; he would not go to sinful places.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All of the sinful things are against the conscience, and the conscience is the leading part of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You have to realize that your conscience has never sinned, even before you were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that even before you were saved your spirit was preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do you know what is the genuine and real gospel preaching?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is to touch the human conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is because the human spirit is preserved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our Spirit Regenerated by God</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The history of our spirit is that it was first created by God and then preserved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Third, our spirit was regenerated by God!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Satan never came into our spirit, and sin has never been in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only vacancy was in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before we were regenerated our spirit was vacant.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One day the very Creator, the source of life who is even life, came into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Right away we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Redeemer, the Savior, came into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we believed on Him and called on His name, receiving Him as our Savior, He came into our spirit.</S>
