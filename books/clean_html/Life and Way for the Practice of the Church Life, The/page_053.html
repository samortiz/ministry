<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ONENESS AND CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Deut. 12:5, 8, 11, 13, 27; 14:22-23</H1><P>I would like to stress again the type of the living of God's people in the good land. The types in the Old Testament are the figures, the pictures, of the spiritual things. In the New Testament we have the teachings and the words about the spiritual things. We all know that a picture is always clearer than any kind of statement. This is why there is a saying that a picture is better than a thousand words. The whole Scripture is one. The Old Testament and the New Testament reveal to us the same thing. Whereas the Old Testament gives us the pictures, the New Testament gives us the statements. When we are not so clear about the statements, we have to look at the pictures.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>KEEPING THE ONENESS</H2><P>The two main things concerning the living of God's people in the good land can be simply stated with two words: oneness and Christ. The life of the children of Israel in the good land as God's people is a life of worship to God. In this life of worship to God, two things are necessary. The first thing is to keep the oneness of the Lord's people. You should not do anything to damage the oneness. Once the oneness is damaged, the proper worship to God is also gone. If any division exists, there is no possibility to have a proper worship that is acceptable and well pleasing to God. This is a serious matter today.</P><P>In the Old Testament we see that throughout the generations the worship rendered by the children of Israel to God was never divided. They never had two temples built up in two places at the same time. There has always been one temple, one center for worship. This is not just a matter of geography. This is a matter of oneness. The oneness of the people of God was always preserved, kept, maintained, in the worship of God. This is because whenever the oneness of the Lord's children is damaged and spoiled, the building is impossible. The building of the church, the temple of God, the Body of Christ, depends upon oneness.</P><P>Furthermore, today under the light of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament, we know that the oneness is the biggest test to our flesh, our natural man, and our soulish life. To find out whether or not you are fleshly, natural, soulish, or worldly, you need to ask yourself just one question: "Am I willing to keep the oneness of the Body?"</P><P>Suppose six young brothers in a certain city come and meet together. In the beginning it is wonderful, but perhaps after three weeks, one of them may feel unhappy about the others. Then he may seek out another three or five to pray with him, and eventually they may decide to meet as another meeting. So probably within half a year, in your city there will be two separate meetings. This means division. Deuteronomy 12:8 says, "...each man doing all that is right in his own eyes." But the oneness limits this. The oneness will not allow you to do whatever is right in your own eyes. Regardless of whether you feel happy about others or whether they are spiritual or not, you have to keep the oneness with them. You have no right to separate yourself from others. This regulation preserves the oneness of the children of God.</P><P>As students, you have a choice of schools. If you are not happy about one school, you can quit and go to another school. But as a Christian, do you have a choice of churches? Today many Christians are frequently changing churches. When one church does not suit their taste, they leave that one and go to another one. When the second church does not suit their taste, they leave again and go to a third one. We must realize that as far as the church is concerned, we must give up our taste. We cannot have a church according to our taste. We have no choice as far as the church is concerned. We have to take what God has appointed, ordained, chosen, to keep the oneness of the Body. This is the biggest test to our flesh, our natural man.</P>
