   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN SPENDING OURSELVES FOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LORD S MULTIPLICATION AND INCREASE Scripture Reading: Matt 28:19; Acts 1:8</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even though I have been in America, for the past five years my heart has been in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have been observing and continually seeking in which direction the Lord desires for us to move.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord s recovery has been in Taiwan for thirty-six years.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>During the first twelve years, I spent seven to eight months a year in Taiwan and the rest of the time in Southeast Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>During those years many full-time serving ones were produced, and the number of saints on the island grew to almost forty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time we increased by leaps and bounds.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Twenty years later, however, the number of saints in Taiwan has not increased but has decreased.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It seems as though the Lord s recovery in Taiwan is grinding to a halt.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>TAIWAN S PROSPERITY AND PROGRESS BEING</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>FOR THE LORD S MULTIPLICATION AND INCREASE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even though the saints continue to love the Lord and zealously preach the gospel so that new ones are regularly baptized, few new ones have remained.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The churches in Taiwan have a more solid foundation, and the saints have progressed in knowing the truth and growing in life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, if we look at the numbers, we see that there is hardly any multiplication or increase.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must be burdened to find out why the Lord s work on the island of Taiwan has not advanced.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must identify what has caused the Lord s work to stop, or rather, to hibernate.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have been observing this matter for the past five years, and up until last October I had not come to a conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, as soon as I finished writing the notes of the Life-study of the New Testament, I became very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I put my pen down and said, I am going back to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It seems as though my age would not allow me to do so, but because of the burden in me, I came back so that together with the brothers we could move forward with the work in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Last October, when we held a conference entitled The All-inclusiveness and Unlimitedness of Christ, we spoke of Christ s multiplication and increase.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These two words, multiplication and increase, express my burden for Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The churches on the island of Taiwan have been under the Lord s blessing since 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have witnessed His blessing for the past thirty-six years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The whole world is amazed at Taiwan s prosperity and progress.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Security is good, the transportation system is developed, education is available to all, and the economy is booming.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, instead of the government restricting the church from preaching the gospel, it grants the church many favors to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because of these five points, we do not have any excuse, nor can we evade our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must not say that the gospel cannot be spread throughout all of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to seize this opportunity to spread the Lord s work in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Taiwan is not large.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The freeway from Keelung in the north to Kaohsiung in the south is a little more than four hundred kilometers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have a rich spiritual possession, together with security, transportation, education, a good economy, and favors from the government, so we have no excuse for not spreading the gospel throughout Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Two hundred years ago, when transportation was not so developed, the Western missionaries went from Europe and America to China to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It took them half a year to travel by boat.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For six months they suffered severe seasickness, and some died shortly after they arrived in China.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who survived the journey established schools to produce qualified teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This was a preparation for the preaching of the gospel to the local people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this way, after only two hundred years the Western missionaries preached the gospel throughout the two major countries in Asia China and India.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Besides this, the missionaries translated the Bible into the local languages of some of the other countries in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They also undertook such a difficult task for the Lord s work in Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even though the circumstances were difficult, it took them less than two centuries to spread the gospel throughout the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have been here for over thirty-six years.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When I left Taiwan, there were dozens of churches and thousands of saints meeting regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, we have been here for more than a quarter century, and yet we have not spread the gospel throughout this island.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the saints who love the Lord should repent and ask for the Lord s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE LORD DESIRING PEOPLE S SOULS</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I returned to Taipei with a heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, in the first message of the conference last October, I spoke of the unlimitedness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ s multiplication is unlimited, and His increase is also unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Contrary to this fact, however, we have entered into a state of hibernation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is unacceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I remember the first time I went to Kaohsiung in 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There were one hundred people in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>That was thirty-six years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we use one hundred as a base number and if the rate of annual increase is ten percent, we would have about three thousand people meeting in Kaohsiung today.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, the regular attendance in Kaohsiung is less than fifteen hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There are more than three hundred towns and villages in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There are not more than fifteen churches in the great plain from Chiayi to Tainan.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>From the viewpoint of statistics, we owe the Lord very much.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For many years all the churches have been stable, without any turmoil, problems, heretical teachings, or disputes.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We worship the Lord for this.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, we cannot say that we have satisfied the Lord s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord charged us to go and disciple all the nations Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He also said, You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth Acts 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have not even taken the gospel to the area surrounding Kaohsiung, not to speak of the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We all need to bring this matter before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must see that the Lord does not desire something outward; the Lord desires souls.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The church in Kaohsiung has been stable for over thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It would not be too much for there to be eighteen thousand saints meeting in Kaohsiung today.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Neither would it be too much for there to be thirty to forty churches that were established by the saints sent out from Kaohsiung.</S>
