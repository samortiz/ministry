<P>Before we go any further, we must first mention one verse in particular. We know that in the seventh dispensation there will be one thousand years. This is the millennial kingdom, and Revelation 20 clearly tells us that the dispensation of the kingdom will actually last one thousand years. Many misunderstand the Sabbath of creation to be a type of this millennial kingdom. Since the millennial Sabbath day is one thousand years, according to 2 Peter 3:8 they think that the previous six days are also six thousand years. They think the seven days of creation are a type of seven thousand years of world history. Their basis is "that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years." This is a mistake, and I do not believe this myself. The teaching in 2 Peter 3:8 does not tell us that the Lord considers one day to be a thousand years. The purpose of this verse is to make clear to the saints that time is not a problem to the eternal God. He is the eternal God; therefore, time has no effect on Him. If we say that the seven days of creation mean seven thousand years because the Lord considers one day as a thousand years, then how do we explain the following clause which says that the Lord considers "a thousand years like one day." Therefore, the real meaning of the verse that the Lord considers "a thousand years like one day" is that in His longsuffering a thousand years is not much. As far as His delaying is concerned, the Lord considers that "one day is like a thousand years." This means that a delay of one day for Him is like a delay of a thousand years. This speaks of the faithfulness of the Lord's promise and the broadness of His grace. This is proven in the following verse. We should not take the word of the Bible out of context to prove our ideas.</P><P>Now we return to our theme. Genesis 1:1 says, "God created the heaven and the earth." This signifies the dispensation of innocence. What God created was perfect, good, and without blemish. During the dispensation of innocence, mankind was also innocent. However, the heaven and the earth created by God did not remain in the same condition as they were when they came out of God's hand. Verse 2 tells us that "the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep." The earth created by God changed from its former appearance. It was judged by God; therefore, it fell into a state of desolation. The former, excellent perfection was lost. This depicts the situation after man was driven away from the garden of Eden. Man sinned, fell, followed Satan's word, and rebelled against God's commandment. They received God's judgment and wrath. They no longer had the right to live in the beautiful paradise of Eden. They were driven away in nakedness, sufferings, and curses. Although they were covered with coats of skins, they lost their original countenance. Henceforth, the only way to describe their condition was that in the sweat of the face he would eat bread, and in sorrow she would bring forth children and be under oppression. This is the beginning and the conclusion of the first dispensationâ€”the dispensation of innocence.</P><P>The work of the first day is a type of the second dispensation, the dispensation of conscience, because the work on this day clearly shows the condition before the flood. Although light was shining, the shining neither interfered with nor helped the creation. The shining of the light only revealed the desolation. At this time even though man received a conscience to differentiate good from evil and understand right and wrong, they did not have God's help to restrain their sinful nature or the sinful deeds issuing from their sinful nature. Aside from revealing man's sinfulness, the conscience does not keep one from doing evil. The work of the conscience is like the shining of God's light into the sinners; it reveals one by one the failures of the sinner and fully exposes even the smallest item. Just as the light of the first day was not able to render help to the desolate world, the conscience is unable to render us any help.</P><P>The work of the second day was the creation of the heavens. It is not difficult to find out the meaning of the heavens in the Bible. Daniel 4:26 says, "After you have come to know that the heavens do rule." According to the Bible, the heavens mainly refer to the position of authority. Water is above the heavens. If we study the properties of water, we know that water is the weakest, most uncertain substance. The expression "weak as water" indicates this. The heavens and water combine to mean weak and uncertain authority. There is authority, but it is weak and uncertain. The work of this day is a type of the dispensation of human rule. After the flood God committed a governing authority to man. Before the flood, when Cain's brother died, he said, "I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?" (Gen. 4:9). After the flood, God commanded, "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed" (9:6). This clearly speaks of human government because God committed to man the authority to execute a death sentence. There was authority, but the man who had the authority was as weak as water. The commandment was committed to Noah, but after a short time Noah exposed his own weakness in the matter of drunkenness and sleeping in nakedness (v. 21). Although God did not commend His work on the second day as being good, His purpose was good. Human government was established by God. He could not bless man's government, but through government He caused man to receive the blessing.</P><P>The work of the third day is a type of the dispensation of promise. In the work on this day, the dry land was separated from the waters. According to the teachings of Daniel 7:2-3 and 17 and Revelation 17:15, we know that the waters refer to the Gentile part of humanity. In the Bible the dry land is a type of the Jewish nation. We can see this frequently in the books of the prophets, because every time the prophets mention "this land," it refers to the land of Judah. Therefore, the separation of dry land from the waters signifies the children of Israel being separated from the Gentiles. The dispensation of promise began with the calling of Abraham. The call to leave Ur of the Chaldees was like the dry land being separated from the waters. Beginning with Abraham, the children of Israel became a people of God's special choice. His call to be separated from the Gentiles was the beginning of the separation of the children of Israel by God. God's purpose in separating the dry land from the waters was for it to bear fruit. This brings us to the second half of the work on the third day.</P>
