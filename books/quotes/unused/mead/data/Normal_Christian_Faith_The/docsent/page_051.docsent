   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE TWO CORPORATE MEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that one cannot separate Christ from truth or from the doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nor can He be isolated from the Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What then is the relationship Christ has with us human beings?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>IMPORTANT CONCEPTS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before we come to look at the relationship Christ has with man, we have to investigate the law of heredity a little.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A life which bears a particular trait or feature in its nature may transmit that same feature to the next generation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Looking at it another way, we can find the temperament and idiosyncrasies of the father in a child.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But whatever is acquired by learning is not hereditary.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, a blacksmith may acquire strong and husky arms through his training, but his children's arms may remain small and thin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whatever is acquired after birth cannot be transmitted to the next generation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a fact and phenomenon recognized by biological science.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is a very important concept in the Bible known as the unity of men.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the Bible, apart from our individual existence, the whole world, regardless of how many millions of people there are, can be considered as being composed of two men.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These two men are corporate, embracing millions of people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The whole of humanity is included in these two men.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are two juristic persons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Due to this reckoning in the Bible, the man Jesus could die for all of us and bear all of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now all of us can receive life through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A student in biology can tell us that there is an amazing concept in biology which is quite contrary to ours: a son's life is considered to be older than that of the father, and a grandson's life is much older than that of his grandfather.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is perfectly true.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The son inherits the father's life and continues it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, the son's life is older than that of his father.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Your life and mine are naturally older than that of Adam, for his ended at the age of a little over nine hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But you and I are still living and will go on living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These are three important concepts we have to consider when we look at the relationship between Christ and man: the heredity of human life, the unity of men, and the continuation of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A HUGE CORPORATE MAN</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Man is not only an individual, existing by himself, responsible only for his own conduct and behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He also belongs to a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every person is a part of a huge life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is a continuation, and he is continuing this huge life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first man in this corporate man had a life that embraced all other human life; his conduct became that of everyone that follows, and his traits are transmitted to all successive generations; they all bear the same features as he did.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a vast subject to be covered.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But we have to understand these concepts before we can see the salvation of God and the relationship of Christ with man.</S>
