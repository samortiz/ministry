   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>While chapter three is about a highly cultured, very religious, God-seeking, God-fearing, moral person, chapter four is about an immoral woman.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although she was quite evil, having had five husbands and living with a sixth who was not her husband, she still tried to speak about religion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She pretended to be religious because the Lord Jesus exposed her evil history.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord said to her, "Go, call your husband and come here" John 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>She said that she did not have a husband.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This was a truth but a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She told the Lord Jesus a lie by speaking the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus, responding to her, said, "You have well said, I don't have a husband; for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you said truly" John 4:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Immediately she changed the subject from her husbands to the worship of God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To talk about her husbands was unpleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because the Lord's word about her husband touched her conscience, she changed the conversation to the matter of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus, in His wisdom, also began to speak about the worship of God, saying, "God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality" John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, the Lord revealed to her that this Spirit, who is God Himself, and who is the One we must worship, is the very living water John 4:24, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The very God who is Spirit is the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We take the water of life by exercising our spirit to contact Him, that is, to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In chapter three of the Gospel of John we are told that we have to be born anew, that is, to have a second birth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then in chapter four the Lord Jesus speaks about drinking v. 14 , in chapter six about eating v. 57 , and in chapter seven about drinking again vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Drinking and eating seem to be two separate things, yet actually they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John 6:35 says, "I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes in Me shall by no means ever thirst."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We eat the bread and we shall never thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Is He the bread for eating or for drinking?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It seems that John 4 is only about drinking and that John 6 is only about eating.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yet even in John 6, which is apparently a chapter only on eating, there is also a word about drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You cannot separate eating from drinking or drinking from eating.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Isaiah 55:1 says, "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters come ye, buy, and eat."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We come to the waters and obtain food.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This proves that the eating and the drinking are just one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In our daily life, it is hard for any of us to eat without drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Have you ever had a meal where you ate without drinking?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eating and drinking always go together.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These two are one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Gospel of John reveals life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This life can only be maintained by the life supply, which is food and water.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since we have received the Lord Jesus as our life, we all have to learn how to drink and eat.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The reason why so many Christians are weak today is because few know how to eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Most Christians know that Christ is the bread of life, but few know the way to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many know that Christ is the water of life, but few know the way to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to be those who not only know how to eat and drink, but who are daily and even hourly eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By eating the bread and drinking the water, we not only receive life, but also obtain the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In chapter after chapter of the Gospel of John, the Lord reveals Himself as our life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We receive Him as our life and partake of Him as our life supply by eating and drinking Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In chapter one the Lord, as the almighty God in the beginning, became flesh, became a man, to be the Lamb of God to accomplish God's redemption for us that He may be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As our life, He is also the feast to us with the wine for us to drink and enjoy in chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The way for us to receive this wine according to chapter three is to be born anew.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The day we received the Lord Jesus, we were born again, and we began to drink Christ as the wine and enjoy His life as a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now we must drink and eat Christ, realizing that the food and drink are mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Day by day we must drink and eat, and eat and drink, enjoying the Lord all the time.</S>
