[3]  CHAPTER ONE CHRIST AS LIFE IN THE SEVEN DAYS OF CREATION Scripture Reading: Gen 1 THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF GOD
[4]  Christ, the expression of God, and the church constitute the central thought of God.
[5]  The central thought of God in this universe and in eternity is to have Christ as His expression through the church.
[6]  If you desire to know the real meaning of the divine Word, you have to know the central thought of this Word, which is Christ as the expression of God through the church.
[7]  THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SIX DAYS OF GOD'S WORK
[8]  Now let us consider the six days of God's work.
[9]  Now let us consider what Christ is in the first chapter of Genesis.
[10]  The Spirit of God in Genesis 1:2 is the Spirit of Christ, who is Christ Himself Rom 8:9-10 .
[11]  CHAPTER TWO CHRIST AS THE EXPRESSION OF GOD Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26-28; Psa 8:4-8; Heb 2:6-9; 2 Cor 4:4-6; Rom 8:29; Eph 4:24; Col 3:10-11 THE MAIN ITEMS OF CREATION IN GENESIS 1
[12]  We have also seen Christ typified in Genesis 1.
[13]  On the first day are the Spirit of Christ, Christ as the word, and Christ as the light.
[14]  The central thought of God is to have such a man with the appearance, the form, the life, and everything of Christ.
[15]  The human race is a figure because it just has the form, the appearance, of Christ, not the life, the substance, and nature of Christ.
[16]  But today we as the church have not only the appearance, the form, of Christ but also the life, the nature, and the substance of Christ.
[17]  May the Lord be merciful to us that we may see the central thought of God, that is, to have Christ wrought into us that we may become a part of Christ for God to have Himself expressed in us and to have His authority exercised through us.
[18]  CHAPTER THREE THE DIVINE LIFE FOR THE BRIDE OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Gen 2:4-25 THE LIFE THAT CAN BRING REST TO GOD
[19]  From the previous chapters we realize that the life of man, the highest life among the creatures, is a life with the image of God and with the authority of God, so this life can bring rest to God.
[20]  To subdue all things is to bring them under the control of God, in subjection to God.
[21]  After being created, Adam was short of two things.
[22]  After we have received God in Christ as life to us, and after we have realized, experienced, enjoyed, and appropriated God as life to us, what will come out eventually will be the bride of Christ.
[23]  The central thought of the divine mind is that we, as living vessels to contain God, have to receive God in Christ and through the Spirit as life and the life supply into us; that we have to be transformed into gold, pearl, and precious stones; and that we have to be built up together as a living Body, a corporate bride with the nature, form, appearance, and essence of Christ as a living counterpart to match Christ.
[24]  CHAPTER FOUR THE CHURCH THE COUNTERPART OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26-28; 2:18-24; Eph 5:30-32; 2:15b-16a; 4:24; 1:22-23; 1 Cor 12:12; John 3:29-30; Rev 21:2, 9; 22:1-2
[25]  In this way man can bring satisfaction and rest to God.
[26]  By the help of the New Testament, we can realize that the man created by God is a type, a figure, pointing to the real man, who is Christ Rom 5:14 .
[27]  Now we have to see how the church comes into being and how the church can be built up as an increase to Christ, a living bride to match Christ, a counterpart of Christ.
[28]  It is as if God brought all these things to His Son, Christ, and Christ said, "There is none good enough to match Me. I have to go to the cross and be broken by God." When He was nailed on the cross and broken, blood and water came out of His side John 19:34 . Blood is for redemption, and water is for giving life.
[29]  CHAPTER FIVE BEING TRANSFORMED BY THE SUPPLY OF LIFE TO BECOME PRECIOUS MATERIAL FOR GOD'S BUILDING Scripture Reading: Gen 2:8-17; Rev 22:1-2 CHRIST THE REALITY
[30]  We have to see that all the things in the old creation created by God are not the real things but are figures and types of Christ.
[31]  However, the more I have been following the Lord, the more I have realized, on the one hand by experience and on the other hand by the revelation of the holy Word, that all the things of this universe in the old creation are nothing but figures and types of Christ.
[32]  For instance, we were made in the old creation according to the image of Christ, so we had the form and the image of Christ, but at that time we did not have the nature of Christ.
[33]  Then you will have a flow, a stream, a river, of living water within you.
[34]  CHAPTER SIX THE PROCESS FOR THE SUBDUING OF THE SERPENT Scripture Reading: Gen 3:1, 13-15; John 3:14; 12:31-32; Rev 20:1-3
[35]  As we have seen, the first two chapters of the Scriptures give us the blueprint of God's plan, and the last two chapters of the Scriptures show us a picture of the consummation of God's plan.
[36]  If you cut off the first two chapters with the blueprint and the last two chapters with the picture and read from the third chapter of Genesis to the twentieth chapter of Revelation, you will realize that the greater part of the Scripture starts with the serpent Gen 3:1 and ends with the ancient serpent Rev 20:2 .
[37]  CHRIST COMING AS THE SEED OF THE WOMAN AND THE BRASS SERPENT
[38]  At the very juncture when man fell, God came in and promised that One would come as the seed of woman Gen 3:15 .
[39]  Therefore, we are clearly told in the Scriptures that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was born through a virgin Isa 7:14; Matt 1:23; Gal 4:4 ; His birth was not of a human father.
[40]  CHRIST ON THE CROSS DEALING WITH SIX ITEMS RELATED TO SATAN
[41]  After Satan came in, he brought in many items.
[42]  CHAPTER SEVEN GOD'S ULTIMATE INTENTION CHRIST AND THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Gen 28:12, 16-19, 22; Exo 40:34; 1 Kings 8:10-11; Matt 16:16-18; 1 Tim 3:15-16; Eph 5:32
[43]  Christ with the church is the great mystery in this universe.
[44]  Let us now see something of Christ and the church in a very brief way from the sixty-six books of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation.
[45]  We all know that Christ is the center, but we must realize that Christ is the center with the church.
[46]  He not only said that that place was the house of God, but he even said that the pillar, the stone on which the oil was poured, was the house of God v. 22 . Do you realize that in this picture there is Christ and there is also the church? The heavenly ladder is Christ, and the house of God made with the stone upon which oil was poured is the church.
[47]  However, if you only realize Christ as the Savior in such a way, I am afraid that you will never realize something of the church, but if you realize that Christ is the heavenly One who comes to the earth to bring heaven to earth and to bring God to man to be mingled together with man, then there will be a great change within you.
[48]  Now let us go on from Jacob to Israel, the house of Jacob.
[49]  The house of Jacob first enjoyed Christ as the Passover lamb Exo 12; 1 Cor 5:7 .
[50]  On the day of the Passover, the Israelites put the blood of the lamb on the two side posts and on the lintels Exo 12:7 , and they ate the flesh of the lamb v. 8 . This signifies that, on the one hand, they enjoyed the redemption of Christ, while on the other hand, they enjoyed Christ as life and the life supply to them.
[51]  CHAPTER EIGHT GIFTS, DOCTRINES, LAW, AND RELIGION VERSUS CHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:22-24, 30; 2:2; Gal 1:15-16; 4:19; Col 1:27; 2:3; 3:11; Heb 1:2; Eph 4:13-16 THE CHURCH BEING OF CHRIST, EVEN CHRIST HIMSELF
[52]  In this chapter we must see something more important than what we have seen in the previous chapters.
[53]  As we have said many times, the church is absolutely something of Christ, and strictly speaking, the church is something as Christ.
[54]  Brothers and sisters, we need to realize that not only are the gifts something other than Christ and not Christ Himself, but even the knowledge and the teaching of Christ are not Christ Himself.
[55]  We have to know Christ in a living way, and we have to minister Christ in a real and living way, not merely in the way of knowledge nor in the way of teaching.
[56]  When you are speaking about Christ, people must be able to sense the presence of Christ.
[57]  Something from Christ, something out of Christ, even something as Christ must be ministered through you to others.
[58]  The apostle Paul told the Galatians that it was God's pleasure to reveal His Son in him Gal 1:15-16 , and he told them that Christ would be formed in them 4:19 .
[59]  Now let us go on to the book of Colossians.
[60]  CHAPTER NINE CHRIST AS THE EXPRESSION OF GOD IN THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Col 2:2; 1:27; Eph 3:4; 5:32; 1:22-23; 1 Tim 3:15-16
[61]  The entire Scriptures with sixty-six books is centered on Christ as the expression of God through the church as His corporate Body.
[62]  The Body of Christ and the Body Life in Romans
[63]  After the first five books of the New Testament are the Epistles, from Romans to Jude, followed by the seven epistles to the seven churches in the book of Revelation.
[64]  All these deal with this great mysterious man by giving us the definition, the explanation, of this great man and telling us how the members of this great man come into being.
[65]  To experience Christ, to feed on Christ, to live by Christ, and to express Christ in a corporate way is the proper and central line.
[66]  Ephesians 1:22-23 tells us that the church is the Body of Christ, who is the Head.
[67]  Christ is the reality of all positive things as shadows v. 17 . Christ is all and in all in the church, the Body, the new man 3:10-11 . Christ is our life v. 4 , and Christ in us is the hope of glory 1:27 . Hence, Christ is everything to us.
[68]  Christ as Our Hope in 1 and 2 Thessalonians
[69]  Next, we come to the two Epistles to the Thessalonians.
[70]  First and 2 Thessalonians deal with Christ as hope to us.
[71]  CHAPTER TEN THE PICTURE OF GOD'S DIVINE BUILDING THE NEW JERUSALEM Scripture Reading: Rev 21; 22:1-2 THE NEW HEAVEN AND THE NEW EARTH WITH THE NEW JERUSALEM
[72]  Revelation 21:1 says, "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and the sea is no more."
[73]  Verse 10 says, "And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God."
[74]  The New Jerusalem is something new, and it is something holy, something separated from all other things unto God to match God.
[75]  Verse 18 says, "And the building work of its wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass."
[76]  Revelation 21:21 says, "And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was, respectively, of one pearl.
[77]  THE RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE AND THE TREE OF LIFE
[78]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE NEW JERUSALEM AS GOD'S CORPORATE VESSEL Scripture Reading: Rev 21:1-3, 9-14, 16-23; 22:1-2
[79]  Students of the Bible realize that the last two chapters of Revelation are the conclusion of the entire Scriptures.
[80]  God, who is the light and who is constantly shining, is in the lamp, who is the redeeming Christ, the redeeming Lamb v. 23b . God is in Christ just as light is in a lamp.
[81]  Here we must review the difference between the old creation of God and His new creation.
[82]  The old creation was an empty vessel as a container to contain God.
[83]  Now we come to the New Testament, which is a further record of building.
[84]  In Matthew 16 Peter confessed to the Lord, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" v. 16 , and the Lord responded, "I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church" v. 18 . If we know Christ in a living way, we will realize that we are material for the building of the church.
[85]  Then he goes on to say, "You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ" v. 5 . This indicates that we are God's building to serve God, contain God, and express God.
[86]  THE NEW JERUSALEM BEING A LIVING COMPOSITION OF LIVING PERSONS
[87]  Now let us see what the New Jerusalem, the divine building, the holy city, is.
[88]  We know that the New Jerusalem is a composition of living persons because the divine record tells us that the twelve gates of the city bear the names of the twelve tribes of Israel 21:12 and that the twelve foundations of this city bear the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb v. 14 . The twelve tribes of Israel are the representatives of the Old Testament saints, and the twelve apostles are the representatives of all the New Testament saints.
[89]  In Revelation, we are also told that the holy city, the New Jerusalem, is the tabernacle of God 21:3 .
[90]  All the people saved by God in Christ through the Spirit are the members to be built up as a living corporate Body, a living corporate city, a living corporate container to contain God in Christ through the Spirit to express the Triune God.
[91]  He desires to have a group of people mingled with Christ, transformed into the image of Christ, and built up together as a corporate Body to contain Christ and express Christ.
[92]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE TWO CORPORATE BUILDINGS BABYLON AND THE NEW JERUSALEM AND THE ASPECTS OF THE NEW JERUSALEM 1 Scripture Reading: Rev 17:1-5; 21:9-10, 2-3, 22-23; 22:1-2; S. S. 6:4
[93]  In this chapter I wish to show you a contrast, a comparison, between two cities, the mysterious Babylon and the holy New Jerusalem.
[94]  However, the enemy of God came in before God did to work himself into the human nature, so that humans have become the materials for Satan to build up an evil, sinful, corporate vessel to contain and express Satan instead of God.
[95]  Now, let us see the history in the New Testament.
[96]  Immediately after we recognize that the Lord Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord tells us that we are stones as the materials for His building of the church Matt 16:18 .
[97]  Now we must go further to see more details concerning this corporate heavenly vessel.
[98]  God is in Christ, Christ is the expression of God, and God in Christ is on the throne at the center of the New Jerusalem Rev 22:1 .
[99]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE ASPECTS OF THE NEW JERUSALEM 2 Scripture Reading: Rev 21:2-3, 18, 21-22; 22:1-2
[100]  According to the divine thought in all the Scriptures, God always sees His redeemed ones as His wife and He Himself as the Husband.
[101]  THE LORD GOD THE ALMIGHTY AND THE LAMB AS THE TEMPLE
[102]  In the preceding chapter we saw the first three aspects of the New Jerusalem.
[103]  THE RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE PROCEEDING OUT OF THE THRONE OF GOD AND OF THE LAMB
[104]  When we have God as light in the redemption of the redeeming One, Christ, and when we are under the authority and recognize the headship and lordship of Christ, and when we experience the divine nature among us, there is always a flow of life, a living stream, flowing among us.
[105]  The eighth aspect of the New Jerusalem is the street.
[106]  The street, the way, is Christ Himself, just as the tree of life is the Lord Himself.
[107]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE ASPECTS OF THE NEW JERUSALEM 3 Scripture Reading: Rev 21:2-3, 10-14, 16-19, 21-23; 22:1-2
[108]  If we study the Scriptures carefully with the help of the Holy Spirit, we will be very clear that God's intention is to give Himself to us as life in Christ and through the Holy Spirit.
[109]  Eventually, when we come to the end of the Scriptures, we have the New Jerusalem as a picture, showing how God is everything to us, how He is life to us in Christ, how He is the living water to us in Christ through the Holy Spirit, how He by being life and everything to us is mingled with us, and how He builds us together as one corporate Body to contain Him in order to express Him.
[110]  In the previous chapters we have covered eight points concerning the New Jerusalem as a picture of the church.
[111]  Now we come to the tenth aspect of the New Jerusalem, the wall of the city.
[112]  The pure gold is related to God the Father as the divine nature; the pearls are related to God the Son, Christ, as the crucified One, the wounded One, in whom we are regenerated; and the precious stones are related to the work of the Holy Spirit.
[113]  As we have seen, the wall of the holy city is built with precious materials pressed and burned by the divine hand.
[114]  We have to realize that we may have the gold as the city itself and the pearls as the entrance to the city, but if we do not have the precious stones, we do not have the wall.
