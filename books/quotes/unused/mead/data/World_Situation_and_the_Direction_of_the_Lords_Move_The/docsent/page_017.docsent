   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>To Work by Contacting People in Preaching</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the High Gospel, in Teaching the Deeper Truths, and in Testifying the Christian Experience</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We also need to work by contacting people in preaching the high gospel, in teaching the deeper truths, and in testifying the Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should always practice to contact people one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not try to preach to a group.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may speak to fifty persons at one time, but eventually we may gain none of these fifty.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The most effective way is to contact people one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to preach the high gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not be influenced by the old concept that people will not understand us if we share things that are deep and high.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The thoughtful people want to hear the deeper truths concerning the real meaning of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is possible that we could share with someone about Genesis 1 in the deepest way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We could ask them to read this chapter with us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then we could say, Here it says that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first thing God did was to call light into being, and then God made the air.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later, God caused the dry land to appear for the existence of the plants, the animals, and man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He created man in His image according to His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Genesis 1 we see the plant life, the animal life, and the human life, but this is not the highest life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The highest life is seen in the next chapter, and that is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For our existence we need the light, the air, and the land, but we are also human beings in God s image according to God s likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God s intention is for us to have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can then grasp the opportunity to ask them to pray with us and call on the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we shared the truth from Genesis 1 with them in such a way, they would wonder where we learned all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can tell them, I was a Christian for years and I did not know these things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But one day I read a message which pointed out all these things in Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This will lead them into a further seeking of the divine truths.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The next time we see them, we could fellowship with them about the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can speak the high gospel to people from any part of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is even possible to preach the gospel from the beginning of Matthew 1.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 1 says, The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From this point, we can say something about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we can proceed by telling the stories about David and Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can eventually arrive at the point of the Lord Jesus being the Redeemer and the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all have to learn the truths.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The entire New Testament has been expounded by us, so we have to study this exposition.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From the middle of August to the middle of December, we will have a special four-month training to equip the burdened ones to go to Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This equipping will mainly be accomplished by an intensified study of the Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After the saints have applied for this four-month training, there will be a process of being accepted to the training, being educated, being trained, and eventually passing the training.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All of us need to study the divine truths in the printed ministry to equip us for the preaching of the high gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should fully abandon the old, traditional, natural way of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must have a change to the scriptural, uplifted way of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even the way of teaching mathematics has been absolutely changed from the way of teaching years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to teach the truths properly, we need to get ourselves qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may feel that we need a lot of time to become qualified, but we do not need that much time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The special four-month training we will have from August through December will help us to become qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may feel that we cannot make it, but the training will help us to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to be equipped to teach the deeper truths of God s economy to those in Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Most in Christianity do not know the high gospel or the deeper truths.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, because of the clergy-laity system, they have not been trained to function as living members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to change our way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The clergy-laity system offends the Lord because it annuls the use of the members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord wants every member of the entire Body of Christ to work, to function.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The traditional way of Christianity with one man speaking and the rest listening kills the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All the saints can speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To oppose the God- ordained way is to oppose the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The clergy-laity system of Christianity annuls the ability, capacity, gifts, and functions of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we go to Europe, we need to forget about serving in the way of one person speaking to a congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Instead, we should spend our time contacting people one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then we can bring the ones helped by us to a home of the saints near the campus.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Spontaneously, we will nourish the ones under our care.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We will obey the Lord s charge to feed His lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I would ask the leading ones to consider their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We may have been managing the church for years with little result.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Should we not have a change?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today Taiwan makes much money because they have changed much within the last twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need the training.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The training helps us to change.</S>
