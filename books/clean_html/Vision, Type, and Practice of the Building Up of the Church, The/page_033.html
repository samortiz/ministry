<h2 class="head1">THE LAVER</h2>
<p>After the altar the next piece of furniture on the way into the Holy Place was the laver. The laver, which was also of bronze, was made from the mirrors of the serving women (Exo. 38:8). The bronze laver held water for cleansing, and it also was reflective. The reflecting function of the laver manifested man&rsquo;s true state and his filthiness, but the washing function of the laver was to cleanse man.</p>
<p>Titus 3:5 speaks of &ldquo;the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This is typified by the laver. After a person is condemned by God and offers everything to God, the Holy Spirit will shine on the weaknesses and filth within him. The exposing of such matters brings in further judgment. The shining and exposing of the Holy Spirit imply judgment. There is, however, a slight distinction between the laver and the altar. The redemption of the altar solves our problem of sin before God, but the washing of the laver washes away our filth.</p>
<p>For example, a brother may not be at peace with his wife. This is sin before God. When this brother is judged, he receives forgiveness by the blood upon the altar and redemption at the altar. However, if he wants to participate in God&rsquo;s building, God&rsquo;s house, the Holy Spirit must expose his not being at peace with his wife as not only a matter of sin before God but also as a weakness within him. Hence, he must not only confess this sin before God by condemning and judging this weakness in God&rsquo;s light in order to be forgiven, but he must also let the Holy Spirit operate in him to wash this weakness by the divine life and deliver him from this filth. Through the washing of the Holy Spirit, not only is his sin removed before God; he is also delivered in his daily living from the weakness of not being at peace with his wife. In other words, by the operation of the power of the Holy Spirit he is enabled to be at peace with his wife. Such experiences qualify us to participate in God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s building begins in the outer court of the tabernacle. Hence, as those who desire to participate in His building, we first need to place ourselves under the divine light for judgment. Second, after being judged, forgiven, and redeemed by God, we need to place ourselves on the altar and offer everything that we are and have, item by item, to God. Third, after offering ourselves in this way, the Holy Spirit will operate to expose our weaknesses and the filth within us so that our filth may be washed away in the laver of the Holy Spirit. At this point we are forgiven and redeemed by the blood upon the altar. All that we have has been put into God&rsquo;s hand, and we are learning to live under the shining and the operation of the Holy Spirit in order to be delivered from earthly defilement and our human weaknesses. This is how we are qualified to be built and participate in God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
<p>We must give heed to this fellowship and begin step by step to experience these basic items. We must give heed to being condemned in God&rsquo;s light, being forgiven by God, placing ourselves completely on His altar, and receiving the shining of the Holy Spirit. We must have these experiences. Otherwise, instead of ascending step by step, we will be leaping futilely for the top. We must start anew from the beginning and accept God&rsquo;s judgment. At the bronze sockets everything is condemned and judged by God. At the silver hooks and silver connecting rods we are redeemed and forgiven. As a result, we will have a righteous, bright, and clean living. Then we must offer everything that God has redeemed and forgiven on the altar and also let the Holy Spirit shine and do a work of washing in us. We must experience these steps in order to take part in the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
