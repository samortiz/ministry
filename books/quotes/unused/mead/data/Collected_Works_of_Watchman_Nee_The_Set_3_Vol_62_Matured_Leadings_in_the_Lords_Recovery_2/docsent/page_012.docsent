   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SERVICE 3 Date:Saturday afternoon, February 18, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place:Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee THREE CRUCIAL FACTORS IN THE CHURCH SERVICE Things</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Watchman Nee: The worst thing that an elder or deacon can do in the church is to reduce a big thing to a small one and then make a small thing nothing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If they take this attitude, there will be no service in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first crucial factor in service is to find things to do.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>People</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once we create things to do, there is the need to find people to do the things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the things remain in our hand, the church will not be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order for the church to be strong, the number of serving ones has to be great.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The strongest church is one where the entire Body serves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The elders and deacons have to be good at searching out men and perfecting them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the past we were afraid of people volunteering, suggesting, and acting in a disorderly way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we do not have to be afraid; we can deal with them and perfect them with the proper authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Method</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After we have things and people lined up, we need to find the method or the way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We will do something right only if we have the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we do things impulsively and whimsically according to our own ideas, we will not get the right results.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are most afraid of people exercising their own thoughts and coming up with many ways in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One person does something according to his own preference, while another person does something else according to his own preference.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are afraid of people acting impulsively without giving any thought to what they are doing and without seeking the Lord adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Having the right people is not the whole story; we must also find the right way before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Never act or work in a foolish way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE CHARACTER AND WORK OF THE DEACONS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Witness Lee: I would still like to fellowship a little from my experience about the character and work of the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The responsibility of receiving leadings from God for the entire church rests on the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They have to lead the church to the knowledge of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The execution of this will, however, rests on the shoulders of the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a church only has strong elders but not strong deacons, its service will not be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, the deacons occupy a very important place.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the Lord comes back, a group of overcomers will take the lead to reign with Christ for a thousand years Rev 20:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our exercise and training today is very much related to our reigning tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today God is training a group of people so that they can rule in the kingdom in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our exercise and training are not just for today but for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today we are in school; the application will be our service in eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the coming kingdom the Lord will assign us greater works.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The work in God's house will continue.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We will not be idle in the coming age Matt 25:21; Luke 19:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, we cannot be satisfied merely with getting things done.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must take care of a few points.</S>
