   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 Shem and Japheth Received the Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>by Covering the Failure</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the prophecy spoken through Noah, it was stated clearly that Japheth would be enlarged by God 9:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This one word needs centuries to fulfill it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>History tells us that the Europeans have been enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Consider the history of the last five centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What an enlargement, an expansion, has occurred with the Europeans since the time of Columbus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This expansion is continuing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This expansion is mainly due to three factors among the Europeans: governmental power, science, and art, including the skills and the trades.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Due to these three things, the Europeans have been constantly expanding.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Americans are the expansion of the Europeans.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually the European culture spread throughout the world through America.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was a fulfillment of the blessing spoken prophetically to Japheth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The one word of prophecy, "enlarged," spoken to Japheth has needed centuries to be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many nations follow the European way of government because the Europeans were strong in this matter, learning it from the Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, the sciences, skills, and arts came out of the Europeans.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All of this is the fulfillment of God's prophecy that Japheth would be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now let us come to Shem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Shem."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The expansion is of Japheth, but God is of Shem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Jehovah, the very God, is of Shem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All of the Jews have to boast, saying, "God is ours."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even the Lord Jesus told the Samaritan woman that salvation is of the Jews John 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whatever is related to God has come out of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Who wrote the Old Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Who wrote the New Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Except for one Gentile, Luke, the physician, the New Testament was written by Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even Luke wrote with the knowledge he received from the Jewish believers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the things concerning God, concerning God's gospel, concerning Christ, and concerning salvation have come out of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Jehovah Elohim was prophesied to be Shem's. Shem does not have government or science; Shem has God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The prophecy declares that the enlarged Japheth must dwell in the tents of Shem 9:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Europeans, including the Americans, are strong, but they need the tents of the Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you do not believe what the Jews preach, you have no tent, no rest.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The descendants of Shem did not build Babylon; they built tents like Abraham did and they built the tabernacle for God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus, one of Shem's descendants, was likened to a tabernacle a tent, John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, the New Jerusalem also will be God's eternal tent tabernacle, Rev 21:2-3 , which bears the names of the twelve Jewish tribes and the names of the twelve Jewish apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The descendants of Japheth, the Europeans, including the Americans, truly have dwelt in Shem's tents of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This prophecy has been and is still being fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Japheth has been enlarged and needs to dwell in the tents of Shem.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ham has been cursed because he was involved in God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He lost the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Under the curse, he became a slave of slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Has this been proved by history or not?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It has.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But turn to Acts 13:1.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"Now there were in Antioch, in the church that was there, prophets and teachers: Barnabas and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen, foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this verse we see that different peoples had become one church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Here we see certain prophets and teachers listed among the prominent, functioning members of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Barnabas and Saul were Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Simeon was called Niger which means black .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From this designation, he might have been a Negro.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Lucius of Cyrene was from Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Cyrene was a city in northern Africa, where Libya is today.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Manaen was brought up with Herod.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Herod, though a descendant of an Idumaean an Edomite was governmentally related to the Romans Europeans .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>So, though Manaen's origin is unknown, he, as a foster brother of Herod, must have been Europeanized.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thus, we see that the five great functioning members of the church in Antioch were composed of two Jews, descendants of Shem, one from Africa and one who might have been a black person, both of whom might have been descendants of Ham, and one who was at least culturally related to the descendants of Japheth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They all became one church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Regardless of whose descendant you are, do not feel disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Since we have been regenerated, we are all the church people.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We were born of different origins, but now we are all in the same church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We all were born in the fulfillment of God's prophecy concerning mankind spoken through Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But our natural status has been changed by the salvation of God in Christ.</S>
