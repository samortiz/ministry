   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Appearing to Those Who Wait for Him a Second Time, apart from Sin, unto Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hebrews 9:28 tells us that Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time to those who eagerly await Him, apart from sin, unto salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 Apart from Sin</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 28 the word sin, which is singular, refers to our sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hebrews 9:26 tells us that Christ has been manifested for the putting away of sin through the sacrifice of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that He is the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moreover, according to 7:27, Christ offered up Himself once for all for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hebrews 9:28 goes on to say that He has been offered once to bear the sins of many.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that He is also the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because sin has already become history, the second manifestation of Christ has nothing to do with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since Christ has put away sin in His first appearing 1 John 3:5 , His second appearing will be apart from sin, having nothing whatever to do with it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other words, Christ appeared the first time to take away our sin and our sins, and He will appear a second time apart from sin Heb 9:24-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2 Unto Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ s second appearing is not only apart from sin but also unto salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When He comes back, He will grant us the highest salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The salvation that we have been enjoying today has not yet reached its highest peak.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The highest peak of Christ s salvation will be His second appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At His coming back, we will enjoy His salvation to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The word salvation in verse 28 has a wide and high meaning, covering many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First, the salvation which Christ will bring to us in His second manifestation is for the redemption, the transfiguration, of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we were saved, we were regenerated in our spirit John 3:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now we are in the process of being transformed in our soul Rom 12:2; 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then at Christ s second coming for the completion of the salvation of our entire being, He will transfigure our vile body into a glorious one Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That will be the redemption of our body Rom 8:23 , the first aspect of Christ s appearing unto salvation in His second manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second aspect of the salvation by Christ s second coming is the deliverance from the vanity and slavery of corruption of the old creation into the freedom of the glory of the children of God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>18-23; Phil 3:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The entire old creation has been subjected to vanity and is under the slavery of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even we who have been saved and who have the enjoyment of the Spirit are also under the vanity and the slavery of corruption of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At His second coming, Christ will free us from this vanity and slavery and deliver us into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At His second coming, Christ will glorify us v. 17 ; that is, He will bring us into His glory to fulfill the word in Hebrews 2:10.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our glorification is the final goal of God s salvation in Christ Rom 8:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have been chosen, predestinated, called, and justified.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now we are being sanctified through the process of transformation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then in His second manifestation, we will be glorified and reach the final goal of God s salvation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the third aspect of Christ s coming salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In regeneration we were born of God and became the sons of God John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this new birth we received the divine sonship in our spirit Rom 8:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After this, we began to enjoy this sonship through the transformation of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The more we are transformed in our soul, the more we enjoy the sonship which has been given to us in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This sonship will become full when our body of the old creation is transfigured into a body of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that the redemption of our body is the full sonship of our new birth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This will be the fourth aspect of Christ s salvation in His second manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God s salvation in Christ is to work Himself into us as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He has given to us His Spirit in our spirit as the firstfruits for our enjoyment v. 23 . The firstfruits of the Spirit are the foretaste for our enjoyment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The full taste will be brought in for our enjoyment by Christ s second manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When our body is transfigured and our entire being spirit, soul, and body is fully saturated with the element of the Triune God, we will enjoy God in full.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That will be our full taste of God, the last aspect of Christ s coming salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The salvation that Christ will bring to us in His second coming will be such a wider and higher one and will fulfill the final and ultimate goal of God s all-inclusive salvation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Before His second manifestation, Christ is ministering to us with this goal in view.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His more excellent ministry in the heavens today, the ministry of His kingly and divine priesthood with His heavenly intercession, is building up such a salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When He sees that the building up of this wonderful salvation has been accomplished, He will appear the second time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That will be His second manifestation in God s economy.</S>
