<h2 class="head1">IT BEING UNRIGHTEOUSNESS TO HOLD BACK</h2><p>Putting this matter in simpler terms, if we do not give, we are being unrighteous. The rent and utilities of the meeting hall all cost money. If we do not give, we are not doing our part, and others are paying for us to sit here. This is unrighteousness, and unrighteousness is sin. Do not think that others do not know and that we can cheat. God knows.</p><h2 class="head1">SETTING ASIDE PART OF ONE'S INCOME FOR GIVING</h2><p>Many people are familiar with the meeting in Acts 20:7, but they have forgotten the giving in 1 Corinthians 16. At that time Paul asked the Corinthian believers to give because the Jerusalem believers were lacking. Today we do not send money to Jerusalem, but there are many local saints who are in need. First Corinthians 16:2 says, "You should." This means that whatever is spoken of is an injunction and a command. Paul said, "On the first day of the week each one of you should lay aside in store to himself whatever he may have been prospered." This means that we should set aside portions of our income ahead of time. Of all the money that we receive, we should designate a portion which cannot be touched. Every time we receive anything, we should set aside a portion for giving.</p><h2 class="head1">BETTER TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE</h2><p>Thank the Lord that we can still find something to give others and to help others with even though we ourselves may be lacking. We must give faithfully before we can receive the Lord's blessing. We should keep our money moving and active and not allow it to become like the stagnant water of the Dead Sea. If we do this, God will do something through our money. The Lord Himself said, "It is more blessed to give than to receive" (Acts 20:35). If we obey the Lord's word faithfully, we will surely see a great blessing.</p>
