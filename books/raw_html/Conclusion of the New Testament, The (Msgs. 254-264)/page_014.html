<h2 class=head2>B. The Composition of All the Old Testament and New Testament Saints, the Sons of God Who Have God’s Life and Nature, to Inherit All That the Processed Triune God Is, Built Together as God’s Eternal Building</h2><p>Hence, the New Jerusalem is the composition of all the Old Testament and New Testament saints. All these saints have been regenerated by God and have become sons of God who have God’s life and nature. Through God’s life and nature, they have been transformed into the image and likeness of God that they may be matured and qualified to inherit all that the processed Triune God is and that they may be built together as God’s eternal building to be the mutual dwelling for God and for themselves. Thus, the New Jerusalem will be God’s rest, satisfaction, and expression in eternity.<h2 class=head2>C. The Mingling of All the Redeemed, Regenerated, Transformed, and Glorified Tripartite Men with the Processed, Consummated, and Triune God</h2><p>The New Jerusalem, as a composition of all the regenerated saints of both the Old Testament and the New Testament dispensations built together with God as God’s eternal building, will also be the mingling of all the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite men with the processed, consummated Triune God. In the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Triune God has been processed and consummated to be one with men, His chosen people. And through the generations in God’s dispensations, the tripartite men have been redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified to be one with the Triune God, who has chosen them in eternity past to be His counterpart, dwelling place, and expression in eternity future. What a wonderful and marvelous mingling of divinity with humanity this will be!<h2 class=head2>D. The Ultimate Manifestation of the Processed and Consummated Triune God for His Expression in Eternity</h2><p>In addition to all these, the New Jerusalem will be the ultimate manifestation of the processed and consummated Triune God for His expression in the regenerated, transformed, and glorified humanity in eternity.
