<h2 class="head1">THE LAMB IN THE LAST TWO CHAPTERS<br />
OF REVELATION</h2>
<p>The last two chapters of Revelation are a continuation of the first two chapters of Genesis, and many things that transpire between these four chapters are a detour. However, some things in the last two chapters of Revelation are not in the first two chapters of Genesis. These things are associated with the Lamb. The first two chapters of Genesis mainly concern Jehovah God, but the last two chapters of Revelation concern God and the Lamb (21:22-23; 22:1, 3). <em>The Lamb</em> refers to many matters that are not found in the first two chapters of Genesis, such as redemption for man to be justified (Rev. 5:6; 7:14). These matters are not in the first two chapters of Genesis, because sin had not yet come in. In the first two chapters of Genesis, God was pleased with the man whom He had created (1:31), and man did not need redemption or justification. Hence, it was sufficient for the creating God, Jehovah God, to have a relationship with man. However, in the last two chapters of Revelation we see not only Jehovah God but also the Lamb.</p>
<p>We must never consider God and the Lamb to be two separate beings. The throne of God reveals that God and the Lamb are one (5:13; 7:10, 17; 22:1, 3). There is only one throne, and this throne is of God and of the Lamb; there are not two thrones. Just as God and Jehovah are one, so also God and the Lamb are one. The name <em>Jehovah</em> means that the creating God has a relationship with man. However, the reference to God and the Lamb means that the creating God has a relationship with man that includes many matters related to the Lamb.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROCESSES OF JESUS CHRIST<br />
BEING IN THE LAMB</h2>
<p>The Lamb includes the processes of Jesus Christ&mdash;from His incarnation to His becoming the Spirit. The seven Spirits in Revelation 5 are the seven eyes of the Lamb (v. 6). This means that the Spirit is related to the Lamb. Everything related to the Spirit is involved with the Lamb.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Jehovah God<br />
Who Has a Relationship with Man</h2>
<p>The first step of Christ is His being Jehovah God. This involves His having a relationship with man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Incarnation to Be Mingled with Man</h2>
<p>The second step of Christ is His incarnation to be mingled with man and His human living of thirty-three and a half years on the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Death</h2>
<p>The third step of Christ is His death. Many things were dealt with through His death. First, He shed His blood to deal with sin, thus removing the record of sin before God (1 Pet. 2:24) and condemning sin through His being judged on the cross (Rom. 8:3). Removing the record of sin by His blood as a ransom is one thing, but condemning sin by His being judged on the cross is another. The record of sin was removed by the ransom of His precious blood, and sin was condemned by His being judged on the cross. Second, His death on the cross dealt with the flesh, lusts, the old man, and the self (Gal. 5:24; Rom. 6:6). These four are inseparable. Third, His death on the cross dealt with Satan (Heb. 2:14). Fourth, Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross dealt with the world (John 12:31; 16:11). Fifth, through His death on the cross, He tasted death on our behalf and dealt with death (Heb. 2:9). His death on the cross dealt with these items for us&mdash;sin, the record of sin, the flesh, lusts, the old man, the self, Satan, the world, and death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Resurrection from the Dead</h2>
<p>The fourth step of Christ is His resurrection from the dead. On the negative side, through His resurrection the Lord was freed from the realm of death, thus overcoming death and swallowing up death. On the positive side, through His resurrection the Lord entered fully into God in His humanity. This resurrection is linked to ascension. When the Lord resurrected, He ascended to the heavens and entered into the heavenly realm as both God and man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Becoming the Spirit and Descending</h2>
<p>The last step of Christ is His becoming the life-giving Spirit and descending. The Spirit entering into man (John 20:22) is the indwelling of the Spirit. The Spirit descending upon man is the outpouring of the Spirit (Acts 2:2-4, 17).</p>
<p>These steps are included in the title <em>the Lamb.</em> Before man fell in the garden of Eden, sin had not come in, man did not have a record of sin before God, Satan had not entered into man, man had not become flesh, the world was not yet, and there was no death. Man did not have these negative problems; instead, there was one positive need&mdash;for God to be mingled with man. In Genesis 3 sin entered into man, man gained a record of sin before God, Satan entered into man, man became flesh, and death entered the world. These negative problems came into being.</p>
<p>If man had eaten of the tree of life and not of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man would have received God, and God&rsquo;s desire would have been accomplished. Created man did not need forgiveness of sins or justification, because there was neither sin nor condemnation. However, after the fall in Genesis 3 man must first be forgiven and justified by the blood of the Lamb in order to receive God, contact God, and enjoy God. Therefore, when the prodigal son returned home, his father told the slaves first to put the best robe on his son and then to prepare the fattened calf for them to eat (Luke 15:22-23). Before man fell, he did not need to put on the robe of righteousness. He needed only to eat, drink, and enjoy God as life. There was no need of forgiveness or justification. But today any sinner who wants to eat, drink, and enjoy God, to touch God as life, must first be forgiven of his sins, justified, and then clothed with the robe of righteousness. Man can eat and be merry with God only after he is clothed with the robe of righteousness. We do not need to deal with the problems of sin, the record of sin, Satan, the flesh, the world, or death, because God became flesh, was crucified, and resurrected from the dead in order to deal with them.</p>
