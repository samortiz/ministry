When they are exhibited before our eyes, we can do nothing but bow down and confess our failure. Paul struggled so hard that he eventually discovered sin to be a law. Sin is not something accidental or incidental; it happens spontaneously. Unless many people first experience the "I find..." in 7:21, they can never have the "thanks be to God" in verse 25. Without discovering this, they find themselves going around in circles for many years.</p><p>A man can have a tooth removed when it bothers him, but he cannot get rid of a law with an operation. For example, consider the traffic lights at a crossroad. You can run the red light once, twice, or many times without being caught by the police. But you cannot run the red lights all the time. Sooner or later you will be caught by the police. Halting at a red light is a law, and one cannot forever go against this law. Sin is not the result of an accidental weakness in the will. Do not try to fight with sin, because sin is a law. This law of sin is very real within man, and it is impossible for man to overcome the law of sin with his own strength. Once you realize that sin is a law, you should no longer try to fight it. If you try to fight it, you will lose because a law cannot change; it remains the same forever.</p><p>Romans 6 and 7 are the foundation for spiritual growth. Unless sin is dealt with, nothing can be accomplished. Yet it is impossible for us to overcome sin by our will. A man can hold up a hymnal by his will, but he cannot do this forever. At the beginning he may not feel the weight of it, but gradually it becomes heavier and heavier. Actually, the hymnal has not increased in weight, but the force of gravity operates on the hand and wears it out. If you try to be good and love others by yourself, you will be like the hand in the illustration above. Sooner or later you will become tired, and sooner or later you will have to resign. It is a losing prop- osition to fight the force of gravity. It is also a losing proposition to counter this evil law with our good will. Our need today is to acknowledge our corruption in Adam and our newness in Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF DELIVERANCE</h2><p>The way of deliverance is to realize that sin is a never-changing law. When we lose hope in ourselves, we will breathe a sigh of relief just like Paul did. Salvation does not depend on any resolution we make within ourselves; it depends on our Savior. The law of sin has no effect on our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. He is not only free from sin; He is a sinless man. In Him there is no law of sin. Today this Christ lives within us as our life, and we have a new law. The law of sin does not exist in Christ; He is like a helium balloon that is constantly ascending. We can hold down a helium balloon for a while, but we cannot hold it down forever. Today Christ lives within us, and there is a new life and a new law that overcomes the law of the will of the old man. Yet many people have not yet discovered this. This is like a person who has never opened a gift that he has received. It is very precious to realize the blessings that come from a genuine regeneration. What we have received is not just a life, but a new law, and this law is able to overcome the law of sin.</p><p>One brother once remarked, "When I exercise my will, I lose my temper less and sin less. Not exercising my will would be unthinkable." But this is not the Christian way. The Christian way is not in the exercise of the will, but in the discovery of another law. In the illustration of the hymnal and the hand, it matters little where you put the hymnal; the law of gravity operates everywhere. If you are not regenerated, it is true that you should not let go of your will. You must control yourself before you can behave in a more proper manner. Once you let go, you will sin, just as the force of gravity will act on any object that is placed in your hand. A regenerated Christian, however, will not need to struggle or strive to do good or to free himself from sin. There is a law within him, the law of life. A Christian first discovers the law of sin and then the law of life. Without discovering the law of sin, one cannot discover the law of life. Today many people do not know that sin is a law. As a result they do not know anything about the law of the Spirit of life in Romans 8. I am not merely teaching; I am helping you to know this law. First we must realize that sin is a law, and then we must realize the law of the Spirit of life in Romans 8. This is the way we will overcome sin.</p><p>Prayer: Lord, in the past we considered sins to be isolated events and countable acts of transgressions. We did not realize that sin is a law. Today we have seen that these seemingly isolated sins are actually a law. Lord, these words may be repetitious, but may those who have heard them receive blessing from them.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 45: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (5) &nbsp; pg 30</div><br></body></html>
