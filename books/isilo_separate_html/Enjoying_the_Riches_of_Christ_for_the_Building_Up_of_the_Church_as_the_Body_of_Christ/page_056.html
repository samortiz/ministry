God has His chosen people among the Gentiles. They, as well as those in Judaism, are His sheep. The Lord brings these two groups of sheep not into one fold but into one flock.<p>Judaism is a fold, and today nearly all of the denominations also are folds. Today the Lord Jesus is the door, not for us to go into the heavens but for us to get out of the denominations. The Lord Jesus is the door out of the fold. The church, however, is not a fold. The church is not a place; the church is a living Body, a living collection of the sheep. Therefore, the church is the flock.<p>The flock needs the fold at nighttime, in the wintertime, or during a storm. At such times the flock needs a shelter. That is the function of the fold. But in the daytime, in the springtime, or in a peaceful time, the flock does not stay in the fold. During such times the flock goes out of the fold and into the pasture. The pasture is Christ. Christ is both the door and the pasture. Christ is the door for us to leave the fold to enjoy the pasture, which is also Christ Himself.<p>Are you in the night, in the wintertime, or in a stormy time? Today I can testify that I am not in the night; I am in the day. I am not in the wintertime; I am in the springtime. Therefore, I do not need any fold. Jesus was my door, and I have come out of the fold by Jesus. Now I am in the pasture feeding on Jesus. This is a picture of the church. The church is not a fold; the church is a flock. This flock is in the pasture feeding on and masticating the tender grass. Every meeting of a local church is a feeding on the green and tender grass. We are in the pasture, not in a classroom or in a fold.<p>If we remain in the folds, how can we be one? In John 10:16 the Lord Jesus said that He had other sheep which were not of that fold. This means that in addition to the fold of Judaism there were other folds. There are many folds, but the flock is one. Today I am not in the fold; I am in the pasture. Where are you? If you are in the fold, you are divided from me. Some may turn this charge to me and say, &#8220;No, you are divided from me.&#8221; I may be divided from you, but it is because I am in the pasture. To be separate from others by being in the pasture is right, but to be divided from others by being in the folds is wrong. If we are in one of the folds, we are wrong. If we are in the pasture, we are right.<h2 class=head2>Oneness By Life</h2><p>How can we be one? John 10:10 says, &#8220;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly.&#8221; The Lord Jesus did not say that He came that they might have knowledge, teachings, speaking in tongues, the gift of healing, or all the other gifts. He said, &#8220;I have come that they may have life.&#8221;<p>In the oldness of Judaism, there were many things, including the law, letters, doctrines, knowledge, and the Ten Commandments. But in John 10, Jesus is so simple; with Him there is only life. We can be one only by the life of Jesus. If we try to be one by the law, you may be for the first commandment, and I may be for the second commandment; another brother may be for the third commandment, and still another brother may be for the fourth commandment. If there are ten brothers, we may all be divided into ten individual groups because we all have different opinions about the Ten Commandments.<p>In Jesus, however, how many lives are there? There is only one life in Jesus. It is impossible to be one by the Ten Commandments, doctrines, or teachings. The more we get into the law, the teachings, or the commandments, the more we are divided. The more we are in the life of Jesus, however, the more we are one. In the life of Jesus, there are no opinions, but if we care for anything other than life, we will be divided and divisive. According to the context of John 10, the way to be one flock is by Christ being life to us.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_055.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_057.html">Next</a> </body></html>
