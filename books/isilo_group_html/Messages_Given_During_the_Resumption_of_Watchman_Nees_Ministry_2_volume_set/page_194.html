In particular, may those who desire to rise up but who cannot rise up not miss Your presence. Lord, if You want to receive a better worship from us, we ask that You do a deeper work within us. Do not let any one of us slip by. Do not let anyone come and go empty-handed. Do not let anyone come and go in sorrow.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST DESTROYING THE FALLEN SATAN<br>THROUGH THE CROSS</H2><P>Brother Chen Keh-san: Isaiah 14 and Genesis 3 show us where sin came from. In Isaiah 14, Satan said five times, "I will." Satan is a creature, and God is the Creator. The creature cannot demand anything from the Creator. A carpenter is the maker, and a chair is being made by the carpenter. The chair cannot demand anything from the carpenter. If you pay attention to the word of the serpent in Genesis 3, you will notice that his words are the same in nature as the words in Isaiah 14. This nature has come into man's heart today. Everyone is under Satan's hand. The Lord came, and Satan's place is lost. The Lord accomplished redemption. He is the "foreign" One, the real Foreigner. He was uplifted, and Satan was defeated.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DEATH OF CHRIST TERMINATING THE FLESH</H2><P>Today, Satan utilizes man's flesh and makes it his puppet. However, man's flesh is what Christ put on. When Christ died, we were all hung on the cross, and the flesh was terminated (Gal. 5:24). In this way, Satan became naked. Hebrews 2 says that Christ through death destroyed Satan who has the might of death. This is like the Japanese Emperor Hirohito being condemned. When he was condemned, the whole Japanese nation was condemned. It is a small thing for one man to be condemned, but it is a great thing for a whole nation to be condemned. The Bible says that the whole world was judged when One was lifted up (John 12:31). The Lord accomplished a great thing on the cross. His death terminated the flesh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CROSS BEING THE GROUND OF OUR VICTORY</H2><P>The cross is the place of death. It is also the place of victory. Other than the cross, there is no victory. To Satan, the cross is the place of condemnation. To us, it is the place of victory. For this reason, no Christian can leave the ground of the cross. If they leave, they will be defeated.</P><P>Some Fukienese say constantly, "Satan is defeated," as if they are chanting curses. Such chanting will never defeat Satan. Only the cross can defeat Satan.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_193.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_195.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 194</div><br></body></html>
