<h2 class="head1">THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LORD<br />OF THE TWO DISCIPLES ON THE WAY TO EMMAUS</h2><p>After the Lord's resurrection, two of the disciples went to Emmaus. On the way they were talking to each other concerning all the things which had occurred, that is, about the things concerning the Lord Jesus which Mary had related. At that moment, the Lord Jesus Himself drew near to them. Yet their eyes were kept from recognizing Him; they did not know the resurrected Lord. They knew the Jesus who was in the flesh. But they did not know the Lord who had resurrected. Resurrection was a mysterious thing to them, and they could not believe in it.</p><p>The Lord conversed with them, taught them, and clearly explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself, beginning from Moses and from all the prophets. Yet they still did not know Him. Although they understood the teachings of the Scriptures and were touched and even burning in their hearts, they still did not know the Lord Jesus. This shows us that doctrines and revelation are two different things. They understood the Scriptures, but they did not know the Lord. They knew the teachings about Christ, but they did not know Christ.</p><p>When it was near evening and they were coming close to Emmaus, they constrained Him to stay with them. As they reclined at table, Jesus took the loaf and handed it to them. Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him. This shows us clearly that there are two kinds of knowledge of the Lord. One kind of knowledge is from the Bible, while the other kind of knowledge comes when the Lord opens men's eyes. Some are very familiar with the Scriptures and can even speak to others about them, but they do not know the Lord Jesus. Others know not only the scriptural teachings, but their eyes have been opened by the Lord and they know the Lord Jesus also. These are two very different things. We must realize that Christianity does not have only the Bible but also personal revelations. It is true that without the Bible, there would be no Christianity in the world. But we have to remember that without revelation, we do not have a personal Christ.</p><p>One problem among God's children is that much of their knowledge is "transmitted" knowledge; it is transmitted from one's mouth to another's ear. One man understands with his mind and transmits it into another man's ear. Everything is transmitted, and hence everything is just a doctrine and teaching. We must remember that it is useless to have Bible knowledge without knowing the Lord. The two disciples that were on the way to Emmaus knew the Scriptures already, and while the Lord was talking with them and explaining the Scriptures to them on the way, their hearts were burning. Yet they still did not know the Lord. The only true knowledge of the Lord is inward knowledge. Do you have such an inward knowledge of the Lord?</p><h2 class="head1">THE SEVEN DISCIPLES' KNOWLEDGE OF THE LORD</h2><p>One day, "Simon Peter and Thomas, called Didymus, and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two others of His disciples were there together. Simon Peter said to them, I am going fishing. They said to him, We also are coming with you" (John 21:2-3). It is strange that they were good fishermen, yet once they had followed the Lord, they could not catch anything when they went back to fish. They caught nothing during the whole night. Even more strange is the fact that as the morning broke, when Jesus stood on the shore, they did not recognize Him. The resurrected Lord Jesus cannot be recognized by human eyes. Peter, John, and James had been with the Lord all the time. Nathanael was one of the earliest ones who knew the Lord. As for Thomas, the Lord even purposely manifested Himself to him in order to remove his disbelief of His resurrection. Yet now, they all failed to know Him. They needed another experience and another power before they could know Him. "Then Jesus said to them, Little children, you do not have any fish to eat, do you? They answered Him, No. And He said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some. They cast therefore, and they were no longer able to haul it in because of the abundance of fish" (vv. 5-6). Then what happened? John, the disciple who reclined on the Lord's breast, recognized that it was the Lord, and he said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put his outer garment around himself and threw himself into the sea. A minute earlier they heard Him and saw Him, yet they did not know that it was the Lord. Now suddenly they knew; they knew in a mysterious way. This knowledge is Christianity. This knowledge is unshakeable; it is an inward seeing, an inward knowledge, and an inward strength. This knowledge gave Peter renewed strength.</p><p>"When they got out onto the land, they saw a fire of coals laid there, and fish lying on it and bread. Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish that you have just now caught" (vv. 9-10). None of the disciples dared to ask who He was, knowing that it was the Lord. Do you not feel that this word is quite ambiguous? If they knew that it was the Lord, they no longer needed to ask Him. They were not without questions; they were just too afraid to ask. They dared not inquire of Him. This means that they did not know, yet they dared not ask because they were afraid. Yet it says that although no one dared to inquire of Him, they all knew that it was the Lord. They did not know it outwardly, but they knew it inwardly. Outwardly they were still wondering who this man was. Yet inwardly, they knew that it was the Lord. They may have said, "I do not know Him when I see His face. I do not know Him when I hear His voice. In my mind, I want to ask Him who He is. But in my heart I do not need to ask Him because I already know that He is the Lord." Have you ever had this experience&mdash;on the one hand, you do not know anything, but on the other hand, you are very clear? This is the experience of many Christians. We are not clear about many things and are bewildered about many things. But at the same time, we are very clear. This is the meaning of revelation. Revelation makes a person clear within; it is knowing something within. Blessed are those who walk according to revelation! Blessed are those who know the Lord according to revelation! Only they have power before the Lord, and only they know what the Lord can do.</p><p>Outward knowledge cannot replace inward revelation. We must have an inward knowledge of the Lord. Once we have inward knowledge, no one can shake us. May the Lord open our eyes to realize what we cannot realize otherwise. With our mind and our senses, we can only know Jesus in the flesh; this knowledge is not that useful to us and does not give us any strength. May the Lord truly reveal His Son in us so that we can be clear within, have inward knowledge and understanding, and have no doubt whatsoever within us.</p>
