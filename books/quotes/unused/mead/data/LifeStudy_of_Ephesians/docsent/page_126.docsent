   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Full Knowledge of the Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The full knowledge of the Son of God is the realization of the revelation concerning the Son of God for our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Son of God refers to the Lord s Person as life to us, whereas Christ refers to His commission to minister life to us that we, as members of His Body, may have gifts for function.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The more we grow in life, the more we shall cleave to the faith and to the realization of Christ and the more we shall drop all the concepts concerning minor doctrines which cause divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then we shall arrive at or attain to the practical oneness; that is to say, we shall arrive at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many Christians do not know the difference between the oneness of the Spirit and the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first is the oneness of reality, and the second is the oneness of practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because the Spirit is the reality of our oneness, the oneness of the Spirit is the oneness of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Oneness is nothing less than the Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If there were no Spirit, then there would be no oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although we have the oneness in reality, there is still the need for the oneness of practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that the oneness of reality must be practiced; that is, it must become the oneness in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, in verse 13 Paul speaks of the oneness of practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Between the oneness of reality and the oneness of practicality there is a distance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason, there is the need to arrive at the oneness of practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The oneness of the Spirit is the beginning, whereas the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God is the destination.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that we must journey from the oneness of the Spirit to the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In other words, we must travel from the oneness of reality until we arrive at the oneness of practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As believers, we already have the oneness of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But we need to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The best way to keep the oneness of reality is to go on, to proceed, toward the oneness of practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have pointed out that the faith in verse 13 does not refer to our act of believing, but refers to the object in which we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every believer in Christ accepts this faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we first believed in the Lord Jesus, we were very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All we had was the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But afterward we became quite complicated by taking in various doctrines, teachings, and concepts, nearly all of which are divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Several young men may be saved at the same time, through the preaching of the same evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the day they are saved, they all accept the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Afterward, however, they take in different doctrinal concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These concepts cause them to be divided from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order for these believers to arrive at the oneness of the faith, they need to be perfected through the work of the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This work of perfecting will cause them to care for the oneness of the Spirit and to lay aside the divisive doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As they arrive at the oneness of the faith, they no longer care for the various divisive doctrines, but care only for the unique faith concerning Christ and His redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By the perfecting work they also arrive experientially at the full knowledge of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They do not pay attention to divisive doctrines or practices, but care only for Christ as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They care for the full knowledge of the Son of God as life experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They desire more and more to experience Christ in their daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By arriving at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, these believers have not only the oneness of reality, but also the oneness of practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now they are able to come together without division and to enjoy oneness in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The oneness in the Lord s recovery is such a practical oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our oneness is the oneness of our unique faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God in our daily experience of Him as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I believe that most of us in the Lord s recovery have arrived at the oneness of practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, we are one both in reality and in practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today many Christians who love the Lord, including a good number of pastors and ministers, have not seen the oneness of practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, they do have the oneness of reality, which is the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many of these Christians say that as long as we are genuine believers in Christ and have the indwelling of the Spirit, we all can be one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In a sense, this is true.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But this oneness is not yet the oneness of practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is real, but it is not practical.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, such Christians need to journey the distance between the oneness of reality and the oneness of practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I praise the Lord that so many of us have traveled from the beginning, the oneness of the Spirit, to the destination, the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have made the journey from the oneness of reality to the oneness of practicality.</S>
