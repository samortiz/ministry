   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>c Jacob Waiting for the Lord's Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At this point Jacob said, "I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord" v. 18 . After speaking about Dan as a serpent by the way and a horned snake on the path that bites the horse's heels, Jacob cried to the Lord for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we see the situation of today's Dans, we also will cry "O Lord, save us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Lord, save us from the Dans, from the idols, and from the other centers of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, save us from the serpent and from the horned snake.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>O Lord, save us from the biting of the serpent."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jacob not only prayed; he also called on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This verse does not say, "I am waiting for thy salvation," or, "I will wait for thy salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It says, "I have waited for thy salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jacob seemed to be saying, "Lord, with this situation with Dan, nothing can help except Your salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only Your salvation can save us from this harm, this damage.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, I have already waited for Your salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, I have cried to You.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have called on You.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, we need Your salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Throughout history, many Dans have become serpents setting up idols to frustrate others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our heart has been deeply hurt by this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 1969 another center of worship was set up, and many young people have been frustrated by it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The heels of many horses were bitten, and many young riders fell backward.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The only thing we can do about such a situation is to call on the Lord and say, "Lord, I have waited for Your salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the past we have seen the Lord's salvation and we are still seeing it today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I can testify that many have been saved from the bite of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have seen that Dan is firstly the continuation of Judah, the continuation of the victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then Dan fell into the worship of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever the worship of idols is introduced, the serpent is there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Behind every image there is an evil spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Behind every idol is the subtle one seeking the worship of people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, when the image was set up, Dan became a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In other words, because Dan was one with the idol, he became Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After this terrible fall, God's salvation came.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Praise the Lord for His salvation!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>History testifies of this, and our present surroundings and environment confirm it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have seen the fall, and we have seen a situation where the serpent has come in. But we have also seen the salvation of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hallelujah, a great many have been saved!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>O Lord, we have waited for Your salvation.</S>
