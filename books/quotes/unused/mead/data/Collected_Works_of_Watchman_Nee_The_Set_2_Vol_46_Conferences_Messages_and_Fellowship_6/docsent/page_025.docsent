   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-EIGHT "THE JOY OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IS YOUR STRENGTH" Scripture Reading: Neh 8:10</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to Nehemiah 8:10, the joy of the Lord is our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not a matter of having strength because we have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His joy upholds us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1 Thessalonians 5:16 Paul commands us to always rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How is this possible?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How can we rejoice in difficulties, distresses, trouble, etc.?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Where does this joy come from?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot manufacture it, because if we do not have it, we just do not have it!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Philippians 4:4 the apostle gives us the secret: "Rejoice in the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, Your joy is my strength!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is the joy of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How often did the Lord rejoice?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The fact of the Lord rejoicing is only recorded once so it is easy for us to get the meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord had apparently failed in His ministry to Tyre and Sidon Luke 10:13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 21 says, "In that hour He exulted in the Holy Spirit and said, I extol You, Father,...because You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to babes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yes, Father, for thus it has been well pleasing in Your sight."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jesus Christ rejoiced to do God's will; He rejoiced in God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord's joy had nothing to do with circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He said, "Father...it has been well pleasing" it is Your will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There was no kicking against, no rebellious thought, no question of why He should go through all this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Father,...it has been well pleasing in Your sight" is all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A man was visiting a school for the blind and asked the children why they were blind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There was an awful silence, and then one child replied with tears running down his face, "Father, it pleases Thee."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to see that our Lord had a joy; it was the joy of God's will being done.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes we have to rejoice in tears.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The source of the Lord's joy on earth was not that He was successful or that the work was prosperous; He rejoiced only in the will of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not that we have to try to copy the Lord, but that the very joy that He had the joy of the Lord is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can have something of the Lord imparted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can have the joy of the Lord; His joy will be our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The worst kind of life to live is a life of reactions in which we are always affected by persons or circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that we are living by something which is outward, something which is not from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What does it mean to live a life of reactions?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It means that when we speak and someone receives our message we are full of joy, but that we are just the opposite when our message is not received.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are affected by this and that; everything causes a reaction in us, and we are constantly up or down.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This kind of life shows that our being is not in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Of course, we are still in the flesh and we do feel things, but these feelings must never be so strong that we live by them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must cease from a life of reactions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But this can only happen when we live by the joy of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we are tempted to be down, we should look up and say, "Has the Lord lost His joy today?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If He has, then we can be content to be joyless!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>None of us can have real strength by being cast down.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we praise the Lord, there is strength.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As soon as we have lost our joy, we have lost our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the reason we are told to give thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should say with a heart bent towards His will, "Lord, I do not mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It has pleased You; therefore, it pleases me."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must live by something that is in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is not a matter of our joy but of His joy; not a matter of our peace but of His peace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we are feeling flat, the only thing that can raise us up is the joy of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to learn to live above our troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To those who love God, everything works for good, and loving God means loving His will.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once one of God's children said, "Our hearts may be riven, but we are praising Thee for Thy will, for what Thou art."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Recorded by P.D.</S>
