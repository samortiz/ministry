   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Since we are wrong, what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we have not done the thing yet, we should stop; if we have committed it, we must repent, confess our sins, and seek the cleansing of the precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is a pity that believers do not walk this way today.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once the conscience reproves, they think about bribing and making peace with it so that the conscience will no longer voice its disapproval.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this situation, believers usually have two choices.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One choice for believers is to argue with the conscience, trying to use reasons to justify their actions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They think that anything that can be justified by reasonings must be according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, they hope that the conscience will also be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Little do they know that the conscience, like the intuition, does not function by reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It knows God's will through the intuition; it condemns whatever is not the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It only speaks on behalf of the will of God and does not care about the reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A believer should not walk according to reason nor do whatever is reasonable; rather, he should do the will of God as revealed in the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever the believer rebels against the moving of the intuition, the conscience will speak out to condemn.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although explanations by way of reason may satisfy the mind, they are not sufficient to satisfy the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once the conscience has condemned a certain matter, it will never accept any reasoning or stop condemning until the matter is removed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Initially, the conscience only testifies of right and wrong; after the believer has grown in the spiritual life, it not only testifies of right and wrong, but also of what is and is not of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, even though many things are good in the eyes of man, they are condemned by the conscience unless they are based on God's revelation and not the believer's initiation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The second choice is that a believer will try to do many other things to comfort the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the one hand, he is not willing to obey the voice of the conscience and follow its direction to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the other hand, he is afraid of the condemnation of the conscience which troubles him and makes him feel miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, he thinks of doing many good things to cover up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He tries to replace God's will with good deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He does not submit himself to God, but he says that his present deeds are as good as God's instructions and perhaps, they are even better, more beautiful, wider in scope, more profitable, more useful, and more influential.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He considers his work as the best.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Regardless of how much he does and how men appraise his work, there is not any spiritual usefulness in the eyes of God It is not how much fat there is, nor how many burnt offerings there are, but how much obedience there is to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If God has revealed in the spirit that something should be removed, then no matter how good your intentions are, no matter how fat your cattle are, or how heavy your gold and silver are, they are not sufficient to move God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The voice of the conscience must be obeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Otherwise, God is not pleased, no matter how good your work is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even if the offering is many times more than what is required by God, it will not stop the voice of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The conscience requires us only to obey; it does not require us to do anything extraordinary to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, let us not have any self-deceiving conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we want to walk according to the spirit, we have to obey the guidance of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not try to escape the "inward rebuke!"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Moreover, listen carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we want to walk according to the spirit all the time, we must humble ourselves and give heed to the corrections of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A believer should not make a general confession, thinking that his mistakes are so numerous that they cannot be articulated.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A vague confession does not allow the conscience to do a thorough job.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The believer must allow the Holy Spirit, through the conscience, to point out his sins one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He must humbly, quietly, and submissively allow the conscience to rebuke and condemn him of his sins one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He must accept the rebuke of the conscience and be willing, according to the mind of the Holy Spirit, to remove everything that opposes God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Dare you allow the conscience to examine your life?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do you have the boldness to let the conscience tell you the real condition of your whole life?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Are you willing to allow the conscience to place your entire living and conduct before you, according to God's mind?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Are you willing to allow the conscience to open up all of your sins?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you are unwilling and draw back, afraid in your heart, this indicates that there are still many things in your life that should be condemned and nailed to the cross; yet you do not obey.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It also indicates that you do not completely submit to God in many things, nor do you walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Between you and God there is still not a complete fellowship, and many obstacles still remain.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Consequently, you cannot say to God, "There is no separation between You and me."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>An unconditional, unlimited acceptance of the rebuke of the conscience and a complete willingness to walk according to its revelation prove whether our consecration to God is complete, whether we genuinely hate sins, and whether we sincerely want to do His will.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many times we are willing to submit completely to the Lord, walk according to the Spirit, and be a man who really pleases God; now is the time to test our intentions, whether they are true or false, whether they are complete or lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we are still involved with sins and not completely cut off from sins, then most of our spirituality may be false.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If a believer cannot walk completely according to the conscience, then he cannot walk completely according to the spirit, because the requirement of the conscience has not been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, other than the "imaginary spirit" which leads him, the real spirit is persistently demanding that he listen to the speaking of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the believer is stricken in his conscience after self-examination, but does not want to be judged by the light of God, does not repent, and is not thoroughly dealt with, then his spiritual life will surely have no real progress.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whether the believer's consecration and work are true or false depends on his willingness to submit completely to the Lord, obeying His commandment and rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After the believer has allowed the conscience to work, he should not just remain at this stage.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A certain sin may have been dealt with already but other sins also need to be dealt with progressively, until all the sins have been thoroughly dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the believer is faithful to deal with all his iniquities and walk according to the conscience, then the heavenly light will shine brighter and brighter within him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then he can discover the sins which were not noticed formerly; he can comprehend more and more each day, reading and knowing the law which the Holy Spirit has written in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In this manner, the believer will know what is holiness, righteousness, purity, and uprightness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The former things that were unclear will be deeply inscribed in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The intuition will be greatly helped, and its keenness in understanding the intention of the Holy Spirit will be increased.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, when the conscience rebukes, the believer should tell God, "I am willing to submit."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He should let Christ be the Lord of his life again, and he should be willing to be taught and rely on the teachings of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If the believer truly follows the conscience, then the Holy Spirit certainly will come to help.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The conscience is the window of a believer's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The light from heaven shines through it so that the believer's spirit and whole being are filled with light.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The entire being of the believer and his spirit will see the light of heaven through it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Every time we think, talk, and do something not good or not befitting the proper conduct of a believer, the heavenly light will shine through the conscience to expose our wrongdoing and condemn our failures.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we allow the conscience to work, submit to it, and remove everything which it condemns, the heavenly light will shine even brighter the next time.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we do not confess our mistakes or remove our sins, the stain of sins will remain and the conscience will be defiled Titus 1:15 because we do not walk according to the teaching of God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then one sin will come after another, one mark will be added to another, causing the window to become darker and darker so that it is difficult for the light to shine through.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Consequently, the believer will sin willfully without feeling uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The conscience will be stifled and the intuition will be dulled by sins.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The more spiritual a believer is, the keener his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There is no believer who is so spiritual that he does not have to confess his sins anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If the conscience is dull and, perhaps, even without feeling, then he must be spiritually degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The greatest knowledge, diligent toil, fervent emotion, and firmness of will, can never replace the keenness of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If a believer does not take care of the conscience and, instead, seeks after mental and emotional progress, he will regress in his spiritual walk.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The sensitivity of the conscience can increase and also decrease.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If a believer gives ground for the conscience to work, his window will become brighter every time.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If he ignores the speaking of the conscience or, as we said before, uses reasonings or other works to replace the demands of the conscience, the conscience will speak again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But after about ten times, it will then stop speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The voice will become softer and softer until it vanishes in the end. Every time a believer does not listen to the voice of his conscience, his spiritual life is damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If he allows his spiritual life to be continually hurt, eventually the believer will definitely fall into a fleshly position.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He will no longer hate sins and aspire for victory as he did in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If he does not face the rebuke of the conscience, he cannot know the importance of listening to the voice of the conscience and walking according to the spirit.</S>
