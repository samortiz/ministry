   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ACTS MESSAGE SEVENTY THE PROPAGATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN ASIA MINOR AND EUROPE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PAUL S COMPANY 36 Scripture Reading: Acts 27:1-44</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapters twenty-seven and twenty-eight of Acts Luke gives us a long narration of Paul s voyage from Caesarea to Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may wonder why Luke includes such a lengthy and detailed record.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In certain matters he is very brief, but the record of this voyage is very detailed and vivid.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After considering this matter, I believe that the reason for this detailed account is that Luke intends to present a picture that conveys some important points.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>SATAN S ATTACK</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first of the points conveyed in Luke s lengthy narrative of Paul s voyage is Satan s attack on the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Satan was constantly behind the scene attacking Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the reason that the voyage was difficult, with many hardships, and took such a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The weather in particular was very bad.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Acts 27:4 says, And from there we put out to sea and sailed under the shelter of Cyprus because the winds were contrary.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Later, after boarding an Alexandrian ship, they sailed slowly for a considerable number of days and came with difficulty off Cnidus v. 7 . Then with difficulty they came to a certain place called Fair Havens.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, after putting out to sea again, there beat down from the island a hurricane wind called a northeaster v. 14 . Satan was behind these difficulties, attacking the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE LORD S SOVEREIGN CARE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the picture portrayed in Acts 27 and 28 we also see the Lord s sovereign care.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord is over all things, including the wind and the storms.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord was sovereign over the centurion named Julius who brought Paul to Rome and over all the soldiers who were with him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In His sovereignty, the Lord caused this centurion to show kindness to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Concerning this, 27:3 says, And on the next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius, treating Paul kindly, allowed him to go to his friends to receive care.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Probably some soldiers accompanied Paul, and it is likely that Paul was still in chains.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, the Lord sovereignly took care of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In His sovereignty the Lord also sent an angel to Paul in the midst of a violent storm, when those on the ship had abandoned all hope of being saved vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>20, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul testified that the angel had said to him, Do not fear, Paul; you must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has granted you all those who are sailing with you v. 24 . As we shall see, this word indicates that there on the boat Paul had a little kingdom composed of two hundred seventy-six citizens.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Luke and Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, were with Paul on the ship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Luke functioned in two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First, as a medical doctor, he took care of Paul s health.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Second, he functioned as a newsman to record the details of the voyage.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We thank the Lord for this record.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more we read it, the more we realize how significant it is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Luke s detailed account of the voyage we see that the Lord overruled Satan s attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everything that happened took place at the right time so that Paul s life was preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>PAUL S LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The picture in these chapters of Acts also shows Paul s life, behavior, and character.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We see Paul s ascendancy over the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We also see the wisdom and dignity of his human life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No doubt, Paul s life was a life of living Christ and magnifying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we read this portion carefully, we shall see that here Paul was living the very life that he aspired to live in Philippians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In that chapter Paul says that he pursued Christ in order to be found in Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>9, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I read Acts 27 and 28, I find Paul in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Throughout a rough and difficult voyage, Paul lived a life of ascendancy and dignity and full of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although he was a prisoner, he behaved like a king.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, he had foresight and wisdom to handle matters.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No doubt, the Lord was with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the one hand, he was a prisoner, one among two hundred seventy-six passengers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the other hand, he was the center, the focus, of the situation, whether on the ship or on the island where they wintered after the ship was destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In every circumstance Paul lived a life of ascendancy.</S>
