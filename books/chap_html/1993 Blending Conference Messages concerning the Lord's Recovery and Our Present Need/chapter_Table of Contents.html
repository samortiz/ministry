For such a blending, we need You. We need Your Spirit, we need Your mercy, we need Your blessing, and we need Your presence. Lord, be with us to the uttermost. Bless us with Your presence. Visit each one of us and touch us. Touch our spirit that You may gain us, that we may gain You. Lord, thank You for this blending. We want to learn how to be blended in You, with You, and through You. Blend us all together that You may have a way to go on for Your recovery. Cover us with Your prevailing blood. We can never forget Your enemy, the subtle one, the evil one, the devil, Satan. Lord, put him to the corner throughout this conference. We look to You for the victory over all the enemies. Give us the liberty, give us the freedom, and give us the boldness. Anoint us; this is what we need. Thank You, Lord. Amen.</P><P>The four banners for this conference are very simple, yet they are all-inclusive. I hope that in this blending conference we will all be anointed and deeply impressed with these four banners:</P><ol class="decimal"><li>The all-inclusive Christ is the God-allotted portion to the saints&#151;Col. 1:12</li><li>He is the Firstborn both in creation and in resurrection that He might have the preeminence in all things&#151;Col. 1:15-18</li><li>In Him all the fullness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell bodily&#151;Col. 1:19; 2:9</li><li>In the new man, He as our life is all the members and in all the members&#151;Col. 3:4, 10-11</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. WE NEED TO BE VITAL FOR THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>Our being blended is for us to be vitalized, to be made living and active. In these days our need is to be vitalized, that is, to be made vital for the Lord's recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. WE SHOULD CONDEMN THE CONDITION IN SARDIS</H2><P>We all need to have some inward realization concerning our present situation. The first aspect of our condition may be deadness. If we are not vital, we will surely drift into this kind of condition and this kind of situation. We need to condemn the condition in Sardis: having a name that we are living and yet being dead, and having nothing completed but having all things dying (Rev. 3:1-3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. WE SHOULD ABHOR THE SITUATION IN LAODICEA</H2><P>The second aspect of our condition may be lukewarmness. We also need to abhor the situation in Laodicea: being neither cold nor hot but lukewarm, and being about to be spewed out of the Lord's mouth (vv. 14-16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. HENCE, WE SHOULD HATE DEADNESS AND LUKEWARMNESS THAT WE MAY BE VITALIZED</H2><P>We all need to be vitalized by the Lord. We should hate the deadness characterized by the church in Sardis and the lukewarmness characterized by the church in Laodicea.</P><P>In order to be vitalized, we need to be blended with one another, not only as individuals but also as the churches. We need to learn the lesson of how to be enriched, how to be vitalized, to be living and active, by being blended together.</P><P>In this blending conference we are burdened to cover seven messages. I will speak in four of these messages; the remainder of the speaking in all seven messages will be done by various brothers selected from among the clusters of churches in Southern California. After each message a number of saints from the churches will share to confirm the striking points in the messages.</P><P>W.L.</P></td></tr></table></div>
