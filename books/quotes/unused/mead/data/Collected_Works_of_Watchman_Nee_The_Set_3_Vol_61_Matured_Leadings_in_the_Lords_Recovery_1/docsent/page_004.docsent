   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED TO BE STRICT AND DESPERATE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN GOD'S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>James Yen: For the past few months I have not learned anything.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My personal walk and my work in the past have been merely a kind of outward pursuit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As our brother pointed out in Kuling, I only have a kind of emotional appreciation; there is no real consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I am not working, I fall into passivity and laziness; but when I work, I am condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is the way to my deliverance?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Watchman Nee: My advice is for you to keep on working, because the more you hold yourself back, the more there will be leaks and holes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The real lessons a person learns do not come from retreats or "spiritual" meditation; a man cannot wait until he has improved before joining the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It never works this way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we want to wait until we have reached a certain standard, we may find that we have less and less in our hands as time goes on.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We advance by learning and working from our present position; we do not attain a certain standard and then begin to work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I hope that you can be desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Forget about the feeling of condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you look at yourself you will leak and drift further.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You must not wait.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once you wait, you become more lax.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You have to gird up yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everyone who was used by God in the past centuries was a strict person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There should not be any lethargy in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brother Ke-san is responsible for the work in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some do not feel happy about this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They even ask, "Why has he been appointed as a responsible one?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He has his virtues, however.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He never stops or rests.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is very strict with himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While others fall, he remains standing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all know that his physical health is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may apply the clich , "He does not have enough food to last another day," to others, but with him we can say, "He does not have enough energy to last another day."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is a man whose energy does not extend beyond the day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He works beyond his own measure; nevertheless, it is because of him that the leadership in the Fukien region has been established in the past year.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Witness is also strict.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not easy for him to be knocked down.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is willing to pay the price, to be desperate, and to not spare himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He often says that a man cannot make the excuse that his health is poor.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whatever he wants to do and whatever he says he will do, he always gets done.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If one way does not work, he finds another way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is so desperate that he is not discouraged by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I advise you to learn from these two brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Apply yourself to the work in a desperate way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not wait.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more you wait, the emptier you will become.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>BEING STRICT IN THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>AND RELAXED IN FEELINGS</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Mrs. Yen: The Lord has opened the way for me to do more visitation recently, but I feel that I do not have any co-worker to coordinate with me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Various limitations in the environment and a sense of inadequacy within have limited me from rendering much practical help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When I do not visit, I feel condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When I do visit, I feel very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Recently, I have seen that I am short of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I love to argue and reason, and every time I argue and reason, I find myself unable to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Watchman Nee: Your condition requires two different dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What I mean is this: In conducting your work you have to be strict, but in dealing with your feelings you have to be relaxed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you become tense in your feelings, you will bring suffering to yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If this frigidity is pushed to the extreme, no one will be able to touch you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When a rubber band is not fully stretched, there is room for more stretching, and it does not give any noise when plucked.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If it is fully stretched, however, it will make a sharp noise the minute it is touched.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No one will be able to stretch it further; it will break immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Since the Kuling training, it has become manifest that you are a person who reacts quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You have to learn to trust in God and believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When something happens, do not be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do not worry too much and do not consider too much.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You also must help Brother Yen be more strict in the work and less tense in feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When feelings become too tense, our endurance goes down, and our capacity for more burden is reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What is endurance?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the world endurance is expressed in an inward stiffness and outward stoicism toward the slightest stretching.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But true endurance leaves more ground for inward stretching by men or by the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you are too full of your own feelings, you will not have room to accommodate others.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You have wasted too much of your feelings on yourself and have left nothing for others.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you can be more reserved in your feelings and do not use them all up, you will find it easy to endure.</S>
