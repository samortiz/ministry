   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Submission to the Authority of the Ministry 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ministry Being the Authority</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Authority is related to the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Authority is also related to ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Please remember that all the members have their special gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The ear, the eye, the mouth, the hands, and the feet all have their gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These gifts are the ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As long as there is the ministry, there is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why does the ministry have the authority?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is because each one receives different ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The difference in ministries produces the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the same time, with the authority in the ministry there are the limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God may grant grace to me to be an ear and to enable me to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the one hand, He intends that I serve the Body with my hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the other hand, He intends that I accept my own limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If I want to see, I have to ask the eyes to help me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The problem today is that those who cannot hear insist that they want to hear, those who cannot speak insist that they have to speak, and those who cannot run insist that they have to run.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You have to realize that for others to do something is equal to your doing that same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Your gift is their gift.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the same time, you have to learn to be limited and to realize that the church is a Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Need to See One's Limitations</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some people simply do not know how to study the Bible or to teach the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet they insist that they have to do it, and the result is many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the Lord is gracious to you and He makes you a hand, you can raise up this hand as high as you want.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if you say that in addition to being a hand, you want to see also, you will not succeed even if you try it as long as you live.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should pray, "Lord, cause me to see my limitations."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you are all-inclusive, then you become the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The acceptance of our own limitations is a principle of coordination, and it is also the greatest test.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who realize their own limitations will fellowship in everything and will seek help and counsel in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must realize that authority is in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The ear has a ministry of hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, the ear has the authority of hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you do not see your own limitations, you will not be able to submit to authority even if you want to.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only those who have seen their own limitations can coordinate with other members.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some brothers think that they can expound the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They think that they are Bible expositors.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Actually, they do not know how to expound the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet they insist that they have to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The result is many strange teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>With a Christian, there is not much difference between the self and the individual life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some people never understand what Paul meant when he said that "all are yours" 1 Cor 3:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to realize that we are born into a rich family.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You can rejoice because you are rich.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Within you, there is always the feeling that you should accept authority.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Your inner man always wants to submit and to accept the authority of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the one hand, we have to see our limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the other hand, we have to see that whatever the Lord has established is an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is the Lord who gives some the ability to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That ability is that person's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Submission to the Ministry Being</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Submission to God</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>While we are learning to submit to the ministry, we are submitting to God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A person cannot say that he will only submit to God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Of all the authorities that God has established on this earth, ninety-nine percent of them, that is, the overwhelming majority of them, are deputy authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Bible says that we have to submit to our husband and our rulers, and the younger ones have to submit to the older ones.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Other than one or two instances, all the cases of submission are submission to deputy authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Those who cannot submit to deputy authorities cannot submit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Although the eyes see, it is actually the head that is causing the eyes to see.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If the eyes are separated from the head, they will be finished.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What you touch may be the eyes, but behind the eyes is the head.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If a person sees the Head behind the gifts, it will not be difficult for him to submit.</S>
