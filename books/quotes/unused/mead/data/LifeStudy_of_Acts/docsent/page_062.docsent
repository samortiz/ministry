   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Strong Word to the Opposers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 51 Stephen spoke a very strong word to the opposers: You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in hearts and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, you also do!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since Stephen was full of the Spirit v. 55 and was one with the Lord the Spirit 1 Cor 6:17 , to resist him was to resist the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, the Lord indicated to Saul, one of his persecutors Acts 7:58; 8:1 , that he was persecuting Him 9:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verses 52 and 53 Stephen continued, Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And they killed those who announced beforehand concerning the coming of the Righteous One, of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers; you who received the law by the disposition of angels, and did not keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 53 disposition indicates to transfer to the care or possession of another.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE STONING OF STEPHEN</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Acts 7:54 says, Now when they heard these things, they were cut to their hearts and gnashed their teeth at him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here the Greek word translated cut means sawn through.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Stephen Seeing the Glory of God</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>and Jesus Standing at the Right Hand of God</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 55 continues, But being full of the Holy Spirit, looking intently into heaven, he saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Greek word for full is pleres, an adjective form of pleroo, according to the usage here and in 6:3, 5; 11:24; and Luke 4:1.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 7:55 Stephen was filled with the Spirit inwardly and essentially, as mentioned in 13:52.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This refers to life, not to work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to 7:55, Stephen saw the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was a great vindication and encouragement to the persecuted one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 55 says that Stephen also saw Jesus standing at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord in ascension is usually referred to as sitting at the right hand of God Matt 26:64; Heb 1:3, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But Stephen saw Him standing there.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that the Lord was greatly concerned for His persecuted one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Stephen did not care for the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, being full of the Spirit, he looked intently into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 7:2 Stephen said that the God of glory appeared to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now we are told that Stephen saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the entire New Testament this occurred only once.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 7:56 Stephen said, Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The earth rejected Stephen and was closed to him, but the heavens opened up to him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that the heavens were with him and for him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verses 57 and 58 say, But crying out with a loud voice, they covered their ears and rushed upon him with one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And having thrown him outside of the city, they stoned him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man called Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here we see that Saul, who later became an apostle 13:9 , was a helper of the persecutors in slaying Stephen.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Saul must have been deeply impressed with what was taking place as Stephen was stoned.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Stephen Calling Upon the Name of the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Acts 7:59 says, And they stoned Stephen as he was calling upon the Lord and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here we see that while Stephen was being stoned, he called upon the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be sure, Stephen did not say in a weak, mild way, Lord Jesus, have mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the contrary, he loudly called on the Lord s name, saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to verse 60, Stephen knelt down and cried with a loud voice, Lord....</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From the case of Stephen we see that calling on the name of the Lord is something audible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 60 says, And kneeling down, he cried with a loud voice, Lord, do not hold this sin against them!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>And having said this, he fell asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here we see that Stephen prayed for his persecutors in the same way as his Lord, whom he loved and lived Luke 23:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE DEVASTATION OF THE CHURCH IN JERUSALEM Saul Approving of the Killing of Stephen</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The first part of 8:1 says, Saul was approving of his killing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whenever we approve something, as Saul did, we consider ourselves to be somebody.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we do not regard ourselves as somebody, we shall not approve anything in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We simply shall not care what others do.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Both those who criticize the church and those who approve what the church does, regard themselves as somebody.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In 8:1 the young man Saul approved the persecution and killing of Stephen, considering himself to be somebody.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Actually, as 8:3 indicates, Paul did become somebody he became the leading persecutor of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A Great Persecution</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>against the Church in Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Acts 8:1b says, There occurred in that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem; and all were scattered throughout the countries of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This was the first church established in a locality within the jurisdiction of a city, the city of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It was a local church in its locality, as indicated by the Lord in Matthew 18:17.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It was not the universal church, as revealed by the Lord in Matthew 16:18, but only a part of the universal church, which is the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The record of the New Testament concerning the establishment of the church in its locality is consistent throughout 13:1; 14:23; Rom 16:1; 1 Cor 1:2; 2 Cor 8:1; Gal 1:2; Rev 1:4, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All Scattered except the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Acts 8:1 clearly says that all the believers were scattered throughout the countries of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Since the Bible says this, we need to believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord s gospel was powerful and prevailing in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although only the twelve apostles remained, it did not take long before a great many others came to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Before the persecution there must have been thousands of believers in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then during the great persecution against the church, all these believers left, with the exception of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But because the gospel was prevailing, soon after the scattering of the saints, a good number of others rose up to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It seems that the more the believers left, the more others came to believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This seems to be the only way to understand this matter in 8:3 in the light of the book of Acts as a whole.</S>
