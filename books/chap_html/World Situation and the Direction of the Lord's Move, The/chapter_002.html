<h1 class="title">THE NEED OF THE SPREADING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRUTHS<br />
FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY<br />
AND RESTORATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 3:15-16; Acts 8:27-37; Heb. 5:11-12; 9:1-10; 2 Tim. 2:15; 2 Pet. 3:15-16</h1>
<p>In chapter one we saw the recent changes in the world situation and the need of an appropriate direction for the Lord&rsquo;s move in His recovery today. In this chapter we want to see the need of the spreading of the divine truths for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and restoration. I hope that our hearts would be touched through this fellowship.</p>
<p>Some Christians may refer to the need of the spreading of the gospel, but in this chapter I want to stress the divine truths. The Bible unveils to us not only the gospel in a narrow sense but also the entire divine revelation. Actually, the gospel includes all the divine truths. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are called the four Gospels. They cover many things which are altogether neglected and missed in today&rsquo;s Christianity. When I say &ldquo;the divine truths,&rdquo; I am referring to the New Testament economy of God, which is the gospel.</p>
<p>Paul called his entire sixteen-chapter Epistle to the Romans &ldquo;the gospel of God&rdquo; (1:1). The gospel of God in Romans does not include merely the truth concerning justification by faith in the first four chapters. It also includes the Body of Christ in chapter twelve and the local churches in chapter sixteen. Even the local churches are included in the gospel. Without the church, where is the gospel? According to my experience, the gospel would be very deficient and poor without the church. Actually, the entire New Testament is the gospel, from the first page of Matthew through the last page of Revelation. The New Testament as the gospel is typified by the Old Testament. Thus, we may say that the gospel actually includes the entire Bible.</p>
<p>God has spoken in the Bible, and He is still speaking today. The Bible is a record of God&rsquo;s speaking in the past, but God has not stopped speaking. He is still speaking today in His Son (Heb. 1:2), and His Son is speaking in His servants, the members of His Body (cf. 2 Cor. 13:3). His speaking in His servants is God&rsquo;s gospel, which includes all the divine truths.</p>
<p>God does everything by speaking. Genesis 1 shows that God&rsquo;s speaking was His work. God said, &ldquo;Let there be light: and there was light&rdquo; (v. 3). Speaking is God&rsquo;s work. In John 5:25 the Lord said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear shall live.&rdquo; This refers to those who are dead in spirit, according to Ephesians 2:1 and 5 and Colossians 2:13. Hence, to live in this verse means to be alive in spirit. This shows that even salvation is carried out by God&rsquo;s speaking.</p>
<p>Our preaching comes from God&rsquo;s speaking. We do not preach our word but His word for Him to speak. When He spoke, the old creation came into being. When He speaks, the new creation, the believers in Christ, comes into being. Hebrews 1:1 says that God has spoken. Furthermore, God is still speaking in every member of the Body of Christ. Every member of the Body is a mouthpiece through whom God can speak. This is why 1 Corinthians 14:31 says that we can all prophesy. The word <em>all</em> in this verse includes the sisters also (1 Cor. 11:5; Acts 2:17-18). As members of the Body of Christ, all of us can speak for the Lord and should speak for the Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery spreads through those who speak for Him. In the early 1960s, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery came to the United States through the divine speaking.</p>
<p>God has surely spoken in the Bible. The greatest thing produced among mankind is the Bible. Although God has spoken in the Bible, man does not understand what He has spoken. About thirty years ago when I came to the United States, I began to speak about the human spirit. Wherever I spoke concerning this, people told me that they had never heard that they had a spirit. God has spoken in the Bible that He created a spirit for man. Zechariah 12:1 says that the Lord stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him. Man&rsquo;s spirit is as important for God as the heavens and the earth. The heavens, the earth, and man are three important items in this universe, and the most crucial thing within man is man&rsquo;s spirit. Second Timothy 4:22 says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit.&rdquo; This is a verse in the Bible, but who understands it? Years ago many people told me that if I had not spoken about the human spirit, they would have never known that they had a spirit within them. First Thessalonians 5:23 strongly shows that man is of three parts: spirit, soul, and body. However, not many teach the revelation of the tripartite man.</p>
<p>We have spoken much concerning God&rsquo;s economy. The word <em>economy</em> is the Greek word <em>oikonomia</em> anglicized, which has been translated into <em>dispensation</em>
 or <em>stewardship</em> in the New Testament. In the book of Ephesians, this Greek word is used three times&mdash;in 1:10; 3:2; and 3:9. But outside of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, who has taught, preached, or expounded the Bible on the truth of God&rsquo;s economy? People may teach husbands to love their wives, and wives to submit to their husbands, but who knows what God&rsquo;s economy and God&rsquo;s dispensing are? This again shows that God has spoken in the Bible, but there is not much understanding of what God has spoken.</p>
<p>Many Christians know from the Bible that God is the unique God who created the universe and man. They know that men became fallen sinners. Therefore, God so loved the world that He sent His Son to save us through His death on the cross. He shed His blood, and we are redeemed. However, who knows why we have been redeemed? Many think that we have been redeemed to go to heaven. Very few know the purpose of our redemption according to the divine revelation in the Bible.</p>
<p>Even the word <em>church,</em> a translation of the Greek word <em>ekklesia,</em> has been misunderstood. Many think that the church is a building with a high tower. Some teach people that since they are children of God, they should behave themselves so that they can please God, glorify God, and make God happy. If they do this, they will go to heaven. Otherwise, they will suffer perdition. This teaching is absolutely false and unscriptural. Others in Christianity teach positive thinking. They proclaim that positive thinking will make people rich. There are also many teachings today concerning how to have a successful marriage.</p>
<p>I am sharing these things to illustrate the lack of the divine truths today in Christianity. I am so burdened to see the truths of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery spread to the whole earth. Much of what is spoken in today&rsquo;s Christianity is superficial and even superstitious. Millions of copies of the Bible have been sold, but who knows what the Bible speaks in its proper sense adequately? John 4:24 says that God is Spirit and that those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality. However, who knows what it means to worship in spirit and reality? God has spoken in the Bible, but who understands what He has really spoken?</p>
