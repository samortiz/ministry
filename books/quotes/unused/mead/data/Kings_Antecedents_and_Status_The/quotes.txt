[2]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Orange County, California during April and May of 1974.
[3]  With every book of the Bible we need a general sketch.
[4]  Christ is Jehovah God incarnated to be the King-Savior who came to establish the kingdom of the heavens the heavenly rule by saving His people from sin of rebellion through His death and resurrection.
[5]  Christ, as Jesus Jehovah the Savior and Emmanuel God with us , is the King, the Baptizer, the light, the Teacher, the Healer, the Forgiver, the Bridegroom, the Shepherd, the Friend, the wisdom, the rest, the greater temple, the real David, the Lord of the Sabbath, the greater Jonah, the greater Solomon, the Sower, the seed, the Feeder, the bread, the crumbs under the table, the Christ, the Son of the living God, the rock for the church, the Builder of the church, the Founder of the kingdom, the present Moses, the present Elijah, the Head of the corner, the Lord, the resurrected One, the One with authority, and the One ever-present to His people in resurrection.
[6]  Now we come to the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew.
[7]  We may answer by saying that He is the Son of God, but this genealogy does not have such a term.
[8]  This book of generation says only that Christ is the son of David and the son of Abraham, not the son of anyone else.
[9]  In the Old Testament there was a clear prophecy that Christ would be the son of Abraham.
[10]  The Gospels reveal that Christ came to inherit the kingdom, that He offered Himself unto death and He was resurrected, that He spoke the word of wisdom, that He brought blessing to all people, that He is building up God's house, and that He will come to receive the Bride.
[11]  The genealogy in Matthew begins with Abraham, but the genealogy in Luke goes back to Adam.
[12]  Abraham, as a called one, was justified by faith Gen 15:6; Rom 4:2-3 .
[13]  He was the only heir Gen 21:10, 12; 22:2a, 12b, 16-18 , and he inherited the promise of Christ Gen 26:3-4 .
[14]  Matthew 1:2 also says, "Jacob begot Judah and his brothers."
[15]  When the Lord Jesus returns, the overcoming saints will be with Him to be priests of God and co-kings of Christ Rev 20:4-6 .
[16]  Whatever is recorded in the Old Testament is related to Christ.
[17]  If we want to understand the genealogy of Christ, we must go back to the Old Testament and read it carefully.
[18]  If we do this, we shall realize that the Old Testament is a record of Christ.
[19]  The land is Christ, and the double portion of the land is not the ordinary, common enjoyment of Christ, but something special, something extraordinary in the enjoyment of Christ.
[20]  From Tamar we go on to her son, Pharez Matt 1:3 .
[21]  If we are to know the story of Boaz, we must read the book of Ruth It is a good story.
[22]  Boaz is a type of Christ, and Ruth is a type of the church.
[23]  This means that Christ, as our real Boaz, has redeemed both us and the birthright.
[24]  Boaz redeemed his kinsman's inheritance and married the man's widow Ruth 4:1-17 ; hence, he became a notable forefather of Christ, a great associate of Christ.
[25]  As a brother and a Boaz, you should take care of others' birthright of Christ, not only your own birthright.
[26]  In other words, you should not only take care of your own enjoyment of Christ, but also others' enjoyment of Christ.
[27]  Although the Bible does not have much to say about Jesse, what it does say about him is important.
[28]  Isaiah 11:1 says that Christ will be the shoot "rod" should be "shoot," Heb out of the stem of Jesse and a branch out of the root of Jesse.
[29]  Isaiah 11:10 says that Christ is the root of Jesse, indicating that Jesse came out of Christ.
[30]  A Jesse is a person who brings forth Christ, who branches out Christ by being rooted in Christ.
[31]  When you branch out Christ, do not forget that Christ is not only your branch, but also your root.
[32]  At this point, the record of this genealogy does not say "Joseph begot Jesus," as mentioned of all the foregoing persons; it says, "Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus" Matt 1:16 .
[33]  Jesus was born of Mary, not of Joseph, since it was prophesied that Christ would be the seed of a woman and born of a virgin Gen 3:15; Isa 7:14 .
[34]  Christ could not have been born of Joseph, because Joseph was a man and a descendant of Jeconiah, of whose descendants none could inherit the throne of David Jer 22:28-30 .
[35]  However, Mary was a virgin Luke 1:27 and a descendant of David Luke 1:31-32 , the right person of whom Christ should be born.
[36]  The marriage of Joseph with Mary brought him into relationship with Christ and united into one the two lines of Christ's genealogy for the bringing forth of Christ.
[37]  53 which shows that the generation of Christ begins from God and continues until it reaches Jesus.
[38]  From God to David the genealogy was one line, and from David to Jesus it was two lines; yet these two lines were united through the marriage of Joseph and Mary.
[39]  The Jesus who was brought forth by Mary fulfills the prophecies: the prophecy concerning the seed of woman Gen 3:15 ; the prophecy of a virgin bringing forth a son Isa 7:14 ; the prophecy of Abraham having a seed who would bring blessing to all the nations Gen 22:18 ; the prophecy to Isaac and Jacob, which was the same as the prophecy made to Abraham Gen 26:4; 28:14 ; the prophecy made to Judah that Judah would be the royal tribe Gen 49:10 ; and the prophecy made to David 2 Sam 7:12-13 .
[40]  In this message we come to the birth of Christ.
[41]  By His sovereignty, God brought Joseph and Mary together in marriage to bring forth Christ to be the legal heir to the throne of David.
[42]  According to Luke 1:26-38, the birth of Christ was carried out through Mary's surrender.
[43]  The birth of Christ was a great fulfillment of prophecies in the Old Testament.
[44]  There are no prophecies in chapters one and two of Genesis, but in chapter three, after the fall of man, after the serpent had worked himself into man through the woman, God gave a promise.
[45]  The wonderful One who was born in this wonderful way is Jehovah.
[46]  The name Jesus means "Jehovah the Savior" or "the salvation of Jehovah" Matt 1:21 .
[47]  Do not think that when we call Jesus we are just calling the name of a man.
[48]  It is difficult to separate Jesus from Joshua because Jesus is Joshua, and Joshua is Jesus.
[49]  Jesus was the name given by God, and Emmanuel was the name called by man.
[50]  Without Him we cannot meet God, for God is He, and He is God.
[51]  We call on Jesus and we find God; yet we wonder whether or not Jesus is God.
[52]  Although the last part of Matthew 1 seems to deal with the birth of Christ, it actually deals with the names of Jesus and Emmanuel.
[53]  Jesus is not only the Savior, He Himself is also our salvation.
[54]  Instead, you should say, "Lord Jesus, come to me and be my salvation."
[55]  Whether you hate Jesus or love Him, whether you are for Him or against Him, you realize that the name of Jesus is a special name.
[56]  We should not only say that we believe in the Lord Jesus, but also declare that we believe in the name of Jesus.
[57]  It is an act of faith in which we take one who believes in the name of Jesus and put him into this name, baptizing him into the Person of Jesus.
[58]  The name of Jesus is also for us to be saved.
[59]  The name of Jesus has been given to us purposely that we may be saved.
[60]  To the lame man whom he met at the gate of the temple Peter said, "Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk" Acts 3:6 .
[61]  Then Peter said to the people, "By the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth...doth this man stand here before you whole" Acts 4:10 .
[62]  When we believe in the name of Jesus and are put into the name of Jesus, we are placed into a living Person, that is, in the Holy Spirit.
[63]  Even for a believer of many years, the best way to touch the Lord Jesus, to enjoy the Lord Jesus, to share something of the Lord Jesus, is not to say very much, but to go to the Lord and call, "Jesus!
[64]  We may also pray in the name of Jesus John 14:13-14; 15:16; 16:24 .
[65]  Rather, I would say that in our prayer it is good to call on the name of Jesus and say, "O Jesus!
[66]  In the name of Jesus, you will have a real burden to pray, and it will be very easy to have the assurance that your prayer has been heard and answered.
[67]  If we call on the name of Jesus, we shall have the assurance that we shall receive what we have asked.
[68]  After the Lord Jesus told us to pray in His name, He proceeded to say that the Spirit will come to dwell in us John 14:13-17 .
[69]  From our experience in China, where there were many cases of demon possession, we have learned that when we cast out demons, we must tell them that this Jesus is not the ordinary, common Jesus, but that He is the designated Jesus.
[70]  We must say, "Demon, I come in the very name of Jesus, the Son of God, who was incarnated to be a man, who was born of a virgin in Bethlehem, who was raised in Nazareth, who died on the cross for my sins and for the sins of this person that is possessed, who was resurrected from the dead, and who has ascended to the heavens.
[71]  Through all the things that can be done in the name of Jesus, we see that whatever we do and whatever we are must be in the name of Jesus.
[72]  Satan's Hatred of the Name of Jesus a. Attacking This Name
[73]  One night, as we were preaching on a street corner, a man about thirty years of age was very bold to scoff at the name of Jesus.
[74]  Whenever you have some experience of Jesus, you will be able to say that He is God with you.
[75]  Whenever we experience Jesus in a certain way, we realize that Jesus is God with us.
[76]  We can never separate the Spirit from the presence of Jesus.
[77]  When we call on the name of Jesus, we receive the Spirit, who is the Person, the reality, and the realization of Jesus.
[78]  In the previous messages we have covered the genealogy of Christ and the birth of Christ.
[79]  By this we see that the Bible has an intention: in Luke it is to prove that Jesus was a man; in Matthew it is to show that Jesus was a kingly child.
[80]  Matthew 1 reveals that Jesus, the Messiah, has come.
[81]  If you had been an Israelite at that time, you would have said, "You tell me Jesus has come, but how can I find Him?"
[82]  Thank the Lord that the matter of finding Jesus was not initiated by us: it was initiated by God.
[83]  Many times you have the vision, but when you consider the matter in your mind, you are distracted and misled by your natural concept.
[84]  Myrrh signifies death and also the fragrance of death.
[85]  Among the human race, death has no fragrance; however, with Jesus there was the fragrance of death.
[86]  They presented gold, frankincense, and myrrh, signifying that the child Jesus had the divine nature; that His life would be a life of resurrection, full of the fragrance of frankincense; and that His life would be full of the fragrance of death.
[87]  If we read the four Gospels, the biographies of Jesus, we shall see that in the life of Jesus the gold, the frankincense, and the myrrh were very prevalent.
[88]  After the wise men had found Christ, had worshipped Him, and had offered Him these precious treasures, they were warned by God to return another way Matt 2:12 .
[89]  Whenever we find Christ and meet Him, we are always told not to return to the original way.
[90]  We have the Bible, and Christ is coming, but how shall we find Him?
