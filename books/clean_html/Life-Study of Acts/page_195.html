<h2 class="head1">PAUL IN CAESAREA</h2><p>According to Acts 24:27, the Lord set aside a two-year period in which Paul was kept in custody in Caesarea. In these years Paul must have thought about what had taken place in Acts 15 and 21.</p><p>In Acts 21 we see the weakness of Paul in facing the religious mixture in Jerusalem. Although Peter and John were with the Lord on the Mount of Transfiguration, they were silent concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy in Acts 21. As we have seen, James spoke on behalf of the believing Jews who were still zealous for the law (21:20). Did James not have any light concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy? It seems that he was very dull in his understanding of this. Although Peter and John had been enlightened regarding God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, they did not do anything about the situation of the mixture of the New Testament grace with the Old Testament law in Jerusalem. It seems that Paul was the only one burdened about that situation.</p><p>As we consider the scene portrayed in these chapters of Acts, we see that the central figure was actually the Lord Himself. He played the major role in these chapters as the One who was sovereign over everything. Eventually, the Lord delivered Paul from the difficult situation in Jerusalem, preserving his life from the plotting Jews, and placed him in custody under the Roman government in Caesarea. Although Paul was in custody, he was not actually in prison. Felix &ldquo;directed the centurion to keep him in custody, and yet that he should have some liberty, and that no one should prevent his own people from attending to him&rdquo; (24:23). As 24:26 indicates, Felix&rsquo;s purpose in allowing Paul&rsquo;s friends to visit him was to gain money for himself. Although Felix&rsquo;s purpose was to get money, the Lord had His own purpose in keeping Paul in custody in Caesarea. There in Caesarea Paul did not have anything to do, and he was safely kept from trouble.</p><h2 class="head1">PREPARED TO WRITE MORE EPISTLES</h2><p>What do you think Paul did during those two years of custody in Caesarea? Do you think that, after having passed through so much turmoil, Paul did nothing except read the Scriptures? Paul surely must have recalled his experiences in chapters fifteen and twenty-one. He must have thought about the things through which he had passed. He might have compared his recent experiences with the revelation he had received in the past, especially with the revelation he had received in Arabia. I believe that Paul reviewed the entire situation from Acts 15 onward in the light of the revelation that had been given to him. As he reviewed matters in this way, the light may have become clearer and clearer. This, of course, is our inference based upon the study of the New Testament.</p><p>As Paul considered the situation in Acts 21, he may have felt unhappy with James and also with Peter and John. He may have regretted what had happened. Then Paul may have realized that it was necessary for him to write more Epistles. The content of Hebrews, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians may have been deep within him during the years in Caesarea.</p><p>I have spent time studying what Paul did for two years in Caesarea. I believe that during this time Paul reviewed his experience from Acts 15 and 21, comparing it with the revelation he had received from the Lord and with the situation he had observed in Jerusalem with James, Peter, and John. I believe that the more Paul reviewed his experience, the more burdened he became to put out further writings. Paul may have realized that he would not soon be released from the custody of the Roman government. He may have anticipated a lengthy stay in Caesarea. I believe that during the two years he was there, he was prepared by the Lord to write the eight Epistles of Hebrews, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon.</p><p>Books like Hebrews and Ephesians could not have been written without adequate preparation. The writing of such Epistles requires a great deal of preparation. Before Paul could write Hebrews and Ephesians, he first had to enter into the depths of God&rsquo;s revelation. Before writing these Epistles, he needed a time of thorough consideration. Paul was given this time, a time of preparation, during the two years he was kept in custody in Caesarea. Later, when he was transferred from Caesarea to Rome, he had the opportunity to put out the books of Hebrews, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. Of course, he was also able to write 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon. It would be very helpful to review especially Hebrews, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians against the background of Acts 15 through 24. If we do this, we shall visualize these four Epistles in a new way with more light.</p>
