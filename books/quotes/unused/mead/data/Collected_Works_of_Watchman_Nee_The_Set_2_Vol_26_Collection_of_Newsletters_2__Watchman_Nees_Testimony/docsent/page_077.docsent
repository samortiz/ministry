   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD AS MY HEALER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When I first became aware of my illness in 1924, I was feeling feeble, there was pain in my chest, and I had a slight fever.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I did not know what was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Dr. H. S. Wong said to me, "I know you have faith and that God can cure you, but allow me to examine you and diagnose your disease." After the examination he spoke to Brother Wong Teng Ming for some time in a very low voice.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At first, even though I asked, they would not tell me the result of the examination.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when I informed them that I was not afraid, Dr. Wong told me that I was afflicted with tuberculosis and that my condition was so serious that prolonged rest would be necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I could not sleep that night; I did not want to meet the Lord without having completed my work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I was very depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I decided to go to the countryside for a rest and have more fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I asked the Lord, "What is Your will for me?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If You wish me to lay down my life, I am not afraid to die."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For half a year I could not grasp the Lord's will, but there was joy in my heart, and I believed the Lord could never be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The many letters I received during this time did not convey encouragement or consolation; rather, they rebuked me for overworking and for not taking adequate care of my life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One brother reproached me by quoting Ephesians 5:29, "For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brother Cheng Chi-kwei of Nanking invited me to his home where I could rest and at the same time help him translate Dr. C.I. Scofield's Bible correspondence course.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At this time some thirty brothers and sisters came to me for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I spoke with them regarding the question of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I came to realize that God's hand was on me for the express purpose of turning me back to my first vision; otherwise, I would have ended up walking in the path of a revival preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Day after day passed without my tuberculosis being cured.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Though I exerted myself to write and to study the Bible, I found it exceedingly strenuous.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I had a slight fever each afternoon, I could not sleep at night, and I frequently experienced night sweats.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Upon being advised to take more rest, I replied, "I am afraid that I might rest to such a degree that I become rusty."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I felt that even though I might not live long, I should believe that God would increase my strength and that I must work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I asked the Lord concerning any unfinished work He had for me to do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whatever He wanted me to do, I would ask Him to spare my life to do it; otherwise, I felt there was nothing upon earth worth living for.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For awhile I was able to arise from bed, but eventually I could not even do that.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On one occasion I was asked to conduct a gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I exerted myself to arise and asked the Lord to strengthen me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While walking to the meeting, I was forced to lean against a lamp post every now and then for rest.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Each time this happened I would say to the Lord, "It is worthwhile to die for You."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some brothers who knew that I had done this rebuked me for not sparing my health.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To this I replied that I loved my Lord and would give up my life for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After praying for over a month, I felt that I should write a book concerning what I had learned before God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>My concept had been that one should not write books until he was old, but when I considered that I might be leaving this earth, I felt I should begin writing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I rented a small room in Wusih, Kiangsu province, where I shut myself up and spent my days writing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At that time my disease became so aggravated that I could not even lie down.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>While writing I sat on a chair with a high back and pressed my chest against the desk to alleviate the pain.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Satan said to me, "Since you will soon be dying, why not die in comparative comfort rather than in pain?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I retorted, "The Lord wants me just like this; get out of here!"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It took four months to complete the three volumes of The Spiritual Man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The writing of this book was a real labor of blood, sweat, and tears.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I despaired of life, yet God's grace brought me through.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After completing each time of writing, I would say to myself, "This is my last testimony to the church."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Though the writing was done in the midst of all sorts of difficulties and hardships, I felt that God was unusually near to me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some felt God was ill-treating me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brother Cheng wrote saying, "You are exerting yourself to the uttermost; some day you will regret it."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I replied, "I love my Lord and I would live for Him."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I wrote The Spiritual Man during my long illness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When it was ready for publication, about four thousand dollars were needed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since there were no means on hand, I asked God to fill the need.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only four co-workers knew of this need.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No one else knew.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Before long the Lord provided four hundred dollars, and we entered into a contract with a printer to commence printing the book.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was agreed that should we fail to pay the subsequent installments, we would not only forfeit the cash down payment of four hundred dollars, but we would also pay for the default.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We therefore prayed concerning this matter with one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At that time I was still confined to bed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whenever the printer came for his payment, the Lord had always provided us with the means.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Seeing that we were able to maintain good faith, the printer said, "No one but you church people make payments so punctually."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Following the publication of the book, I prayed, "Now let Your servant depart in peace."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At the same time my disease worsened.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I could not sleep peacefully at night, and when I awoke I turned incessantly from side to side.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Physically, I was a bag of bones.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I had night sweats, and my voice became hoarse.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>People had trouble hearing me speak, even when they placed their ear to my mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Several sisters took turns waiting upon me, one of whom was a veteran nurse.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whenever she saw me, she would weep.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>She testified, "I have seen many patients, but I have never seen one whose condition was as pitiful as his.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I am afraid that he can live only three or four more days."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When someone told me of this, I said, "Let this be my end. I realize I am going to die soon." One brother telegraphed the churches in various places, telling them there was no more hope for me and that they need pray for me no more.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>One day I asked God, "Why are You calling me away so soon?"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I confessed my trespasses before God, fearing that I might have been unfaithful concerning some matter.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At the same time I told God that I had no faith.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>On that same day I devoted myself to fasting and praying and presented myself to Him once more.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I told Him that I would do nothing but what He assigned me.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>From morning until three o'clock in the afternoon I fasted.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>At the same time the co-workers earnestly prayed together for me in Sister Ruth Lee's home.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As I prayed to God to grant me faith, He spoke His words to me, words which I could never forget.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The first sentence was, "The just shall live by faith" Rom 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The second sentence was, "By faith you stand" 2 Cor 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The third sentence was, "We walk by faith" 2 Cor 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>These words filled me with great joy, for the Bible says, "All things are possible to him who believes" Mark 9:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I immediately thanked and praised God because He had given me His words.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I believed that God had cured me.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The test came immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The Bible says, "By faith you stand," but I was still lying in bed.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A conflict arose in my mind: Should I get up and stand or remain lying down?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We all know that human beings love themselves and consider it more comfortable to die in bed than to die standing.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Then the word of God manifested its power, and ignoring all else, I put on my clothing, clothing which I had not worn for a hundred and seventy-six days.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>As I left the bed to stand, I perspired so profusely that it was as though I had been soaked through with rain.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Satan said to me, "Are you trying to stand when you can't even sit up?"</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I retorted, "God told me to stand," and I rose to my feet.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Being again in a cold sweat, I nearly fell down.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I kept repeating, "Stand by faith, stand by faith!"</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I then walked a few steps to get my trousers and socks.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>After putting on my trousers, I sat down.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>No sooner was I seated than the word of God came to me that I should not only stand by faith but also walk by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>I felt that the ability to rise and walk a few steps to get my trousers and socks was already something marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>How could I expect to walk further?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>"Where do You want me to go?"</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I asked God.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He answered, "Go downstairs to Sister Lee's home at number 215."</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>A number of brothers and sisters had been fasting and praying for me there for two or three days.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Walking within the room might be all right, I thought, but how could I walk downstairs?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>I prayed to God, "Oh God, I can stand by faith, and by faith I am also able to walk downstairs!"</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Immediately, I went to the door leading to the staircase and opened it.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>I tell you honestly that when I stood at the top of the staircase it seemed to me to be the tallest staircase I had ever seen in my life.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>I said to God, "If You tell me to walk I will do so, even if I die as a result of the effort."</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>But I continued, "Lord, I cannot walk.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>I pray that You will support me with Your hand while I am walking."</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>With one hand holding onto the rail, I descended step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Again I was in a cold sweat.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>As I walked down the stairs, I continued to cry out, "Walk by faith, walk by faith!"</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>With each step down, I prayed, "O Lord, it is You who enable me to walk."</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>While descending those twenty-five steps, it seemed I was walking hand in hand with the Lord in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Upon reaching the bottom of the stairway, I felt very strong and went quickly to the rear door.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>I opened the door and headed straight for Sister Lee's home.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>I said to the Lord, "From now on, I will live by faith and will no longer be an invalid."</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>I knocked at the door just as Peter did in Acts 12:12-17, but without Rhoda to open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>When the door was opened and I entered the house, seven or eight brothers and sisters gazed at me.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>They were speechless and motionless.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>For about an hour everyone sat quietly as if God had appeared among men.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>I also sat there full of thanksgiving and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Then I related all that had happened in the course of my being graciously healed.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Exhilarated and jubilant in spirit, we all praised God aloud for His wonderful work.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>That same day we hired a car to go to Kiangwan in the suburbs to visit Dora Yu, the famous woman evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>She was greatly shocked to see me, for she had received recent news of my imminent death.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>When I appeared, I was looked upon as one who had been raised from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>That was another occasion of joyful thanksgiving and praise before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>On the following Sunday, I spoke on the platform for three hours.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>About four years ago, I went to an auction at the house of a German doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Upon inquiring I found that this doctor was the one who had taken x-rays of my chest many years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>He had taken three pictures and told me that there was no hope.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>When I asked him to take another picture, he said that there was no further need.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>He then showed me another person's chest x-ray and said, "This person's condition was better than yours, yet he died at his home two weeks after this picture was taken.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Don't come to see me anymore; I don't want to make money out of you."</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>When I heard this, I went home extremely disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Then, four years ago, I read an advertisement in the newspaper concerning the auction of a building and furniture of a certain famous German doctor who had died.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>When I discovered that this doctor was the one who had taken x-rays of my chest many years ago, I lifted up my hands to praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>I said, "This doctor has died.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>He said that I would die soon, but now he is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>The Lord has shown me His grace."</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Under the Lord's blood, I said, "This doctor, who was stronger than I, has died, but I have been healed by the Lord and am still alive."</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>On that day I bought many things from his house for memorial.</S>
