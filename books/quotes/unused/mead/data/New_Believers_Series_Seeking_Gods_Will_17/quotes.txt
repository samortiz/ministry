[1]  SEEKING GOD'S WILL Scripture Reading: John 7:17; Matt 10:29-31; 18:15-20; Rom 8:14; Psa 119:105; 1 John 2:27 I. THE NEED TO OBEY GOD'S WILL
[2]  Before we were saved, we did everything according to our own will.
[3]  However, we should have the assurance that not only do we want to obey God's will, but God Himself also wants us to obey His will.
[4]  Not only do we seek to know His will, but God Himself also wants us to know His will.
[5]  Luke 12:6 says, "Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria?"
[6]  Romans 8:14 says, "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God."
[7]  God not only guides us through the environment but also speaks to us and guides us from within through His Spirit.
[8]  If we did not have a new spirit within us, God would not have given us His Spirit, and the Holy Spirit could not have dwelt within us.
[9]  He will give us a sense and show us what is of God and what is not of God.
[10]  God's will is not only revealed through the environment and made known through the indwelling Spirit; it is also revealed to us through the Bible.
[11]  His will is revealed through the various experiences of men of the past, and all these things were recorded in the Bible.
[12]  As much as it is possible, you should also fellowship with those who know God in the church to see whether they will say amen to your guidance.
[13]  First John 2:27 says, "And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things..."
[14]  Finally, even if we have all the right methods, not everyone knows God's will.
[15]  If you have an intense and absolute desire to do God's will, God will make known His will to you even when you know nothing about the methods.
[16]  If your heart is completely inclined toward the Lord and you say, "Lord, I want Your will; I really want it," God will show you His will.
[17]  Since God has humbled Himself to make His will known to man, we must seek to know His will, and we must worship, treasure, and do His will.
