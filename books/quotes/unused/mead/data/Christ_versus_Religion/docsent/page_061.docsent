   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LOVING, FEEDING,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOLLOWING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the disciples dined on the meal Jesus prepared, the Lord said to Peter, "Simon, son of John, lovest thou me more than these?" v. 15 . In effect, the Lord was saying to Peter, "A few days ago you said that though all others should deny me, you would not.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But you did, and you did it three times; so I must ask you three times also, 'Do you love Me more than all the others?'</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>" Peter replied, "Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What he may have meant was this: "Lord, I really don't know whether I love You or not.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You know.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And even if I did know, I would not dare to say it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Just a few days ago I said that I would never deny You, but immediately afterwards I did.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whatever I say doesn't count, but whatever You know really counts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, You know that I love You."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Peter was not sure exactly how to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But this is not the point.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Listen!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord said to Peter, "Feed my lambs."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then the second time the Lord told him, "Tend my sheep."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And then the third time, "Feed my sheep."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord did not tell him to teach or instruct, or even to edify, but just to feed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our love for the Lord must issue in our feeding of His lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Finally, the Lord Jesus gave Peter one additional word, "Follow me" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>19, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I say this especially to the young brothers and sisters love the Lord Jesus, feed His lambs, and follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nothing else is required.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>True service to the Lord consists of loving Him, feeding His lambs, and following Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And where is He?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must follow Him in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must exercise our heart to love Him to love is a heart matter Mark 12:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But to follow the Lord is a matter of the spirit, for the Lord today is in our spirit I Cor.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must simply love Him with our heart and follow Him by exercising our spirit; then we will be nourished by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With the nourishment by which we are nourished, we may then feed His lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is absolutely nothing of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Don't think that you need to know the Bible, go to seminary or Bible college, and receive a religious education.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You don't need that.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You need the first, best, and genuine love for the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord asked Peter, "Lovest thou me more than these?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must answer, "Yea, Lord; Thou knowest that I love Thee."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The service of the Lord in this New Testament dispensation is not a matter of knowledge or education, but absolutely a matter of loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The degradation of the church began with the loss of this "I have this against thee, that thou didst leave thy first love" Rev 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As long as we have the first, best, and genuine love for the Lord, we are safe.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then we must follow Him who is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We love Him with all our heart, and we follow Him by our spirit; then whatever we do is just to feed His lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now you may realize where we should stand and where we must stand.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have the Lord Jesus, the resurrected, living One meeting with us all the time anywhere, everywhere, anytime, everytime, without any schedule, plan or arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All we need to do is simply to love Him with all our hearts and follow Him by our spirit, thus obtaining the nourishment to feed others.</S>
