   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Filled with the Spirit of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning Bezalel, 31:3 says, And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all workmanship.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we would build God s dwelling place, we must be a people filled with the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By our natural life and ability and in our natural man, we are not able to do this work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nothing natural is capable of building God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only the Spirit of God can build His own dwelling place through us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are the instruments, the means.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The actual ability, capacity, strength, and power must be God Himself as the Spirit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to verse 3, this filling up with the Spirit of God involves four matters: wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and workmanship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is difficult to explain the difference between wisdom, understanding, and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Hebrew word rendered workmanship also means craftsmanship.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For the building of God s dwelling place, we need craftsmanship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It takes skill to be able to build even a small table.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This skill, this workmanship, involves knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But it is not sufficient to have only knowledge; we also need understanding and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is possible for us to have knowledge without understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, the sisters may have some knowledge of how to measure materials used in making clothing and how to cut these materials.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But it takes understanding to know how to put the materials together to make an article of clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I know something about the suits I wear, but I do not have any understanding at all concerning how they are actually made.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I may know the length of my sleeves and the kind of material used in making my suits, but I do not understand how a tailor goes about making them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I use this as an illustration of the difference between knowledge and understanding and of the fact that we may have knowledge but still be lacking in understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may also take the matter of listening to messages as an illustration of the difference between knowledge and understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may know all the verses used in a particular message.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, although you know these verses and may even be able to recite many of them, if you put all the verses together, you may not have any understanding of them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For the understanding of the verses, you need to listen to the ministry of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then you will begin to have understanding as well as knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In listening to a message we first may have the knowledge of the verses and then an understanding of what the verses mean.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, we may have both knowledge and understanding of verses, but still not have any revelation concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Someone may say, I know these verses, and I also understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But as far as I am concerned, there is nothing here for me to see.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But as a minister of the Word continues to open the Word to you, you eventually begin to see what is revealed in the verses being considered.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a matter of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Moses was with the Lord on the mountain, God showed him the design of the tabernacle and all the furniture and utensils.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Moses learned the dimensions of the ark, the showbread table, the incense altar, and the bronze altar.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He also learned what materials were to be used in making these things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But suppose Moses had said to certain ones of the children of Israel, Here is a description of the design, dimensions, and material of the tabernacle and its furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Please go and make the tabernacle and all the furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No one could carry out this work without knowledge, understanding, and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Certain students in a history class may have a thorough knowledge of the material they are required to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They may spend hours reviewing the chapters in their history book, studying them very closely.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They may become so familiar with much of the material that they can almost recite it word for word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If a history examination is based on the material in the textbook, these students will receive an excellent grade because they have knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But should the professor ask them other kinds of questions, questions that go beyond the textbook, these students may not know how to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although their knowledge is adequate, they are lacking in understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They may know the material in the textbook, but they do not understand how to put all this material together to present a certain view.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For instance, they may not know how to summarize all the material related to a particular subject.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Students with knowledge may do well on a test that calls for information.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But they may not do well on an essay examination that requires reasoning and interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A student without understanding may be able to recite a lot of material, but he will not be able to pass an examination that requires reasoning and interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is another illustration of the fact that knowledge alone is not sufficient; we also need understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As we have already pointed out, knowledge and understanding are not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We also need wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Suppose an instructor in a history class asks the students to write how they would handle a particular matter if they were the minister of foreign affairs of a certain country.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In order to answer such a question, not even understanding would be sufficient; it would be necessary to have wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Perhaps through these illustrations you can get some idea of the difference between knowledge, understanding, and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Beginning in Exodus 25, we have a description of the tabernacle and all its furnishings and utensils.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>First we have a knowledge of the design, the dimensions, and the materials involved with all these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But if we do not have understanding, we shall not be able to put our knowledge together to make a conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Understanding is the ability to make conclusions based on knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But even if we have both knowledge and understanding, we still need wisdom in order to construct the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It takes wisdom to realize what part should be made first.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If those who made the tabernacle did not have wisdom, they would have wasted a great deal of time before they found the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Actually, the way of doing something is equal to the wisdom required for doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord Jesus once said that He is the way John 14:6 , and Paul says that Christ is our wisdom 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>By putting these verses together, we see that wisdom and the way are one.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For example, there may be several ways to drive a car from one city to another.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But if a driver is wise, he will have the wisdom to take the best way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Every good driver has wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A foolish person may know how to drive a car, but he will not have the wisdom concerning the way he should take to get from one place to another.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When he comes to a crossroad, especially a crossroad where three highways come together, he may be confused and not know which way to go.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Although he has knowledge, that is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The driver of a car needs understanding and also wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is another simple illustration pointing out the differences between knowledge, understanding, and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>From my experience and observation in the church life, I have come to realize that elders in the churches may be short of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When some hear this, they may wonder how it is possible for elders in the Lord s recovery to be lacking in knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Knowledge is a vast field.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Who can claim to know everything related to the building up of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is impossible for anyone to have such a complete knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>For example, 31:4 and 5 say, To devise skillful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all workmanship.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Do you understand the significance of working in gold, silver, and bronze?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Do you know how to cut stones for setting?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Do you know how to carve wood?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Do you know what it means in 35:35 to work in blue, in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The significance of all these matters has much to do with the building up of the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Elders, do you really know what sanctification is?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Do you know what is the wood used in the building of God today?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You may realize that wood signifies humanity, but do you know how to carve humanity?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Many elders have never thought about these things.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Therefore, they do not have the knowledge of them.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Most elders, however, do have an amount of knowledge, but they may not have understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Suppose a brother and sister in the church are having a difficult time in their married life.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They are constantly fighting with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Do you as elders really understand their problem?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>You may know much about them, but do you truly understand their case?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Perhaps you only know how they are behaving outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>You may not understand the reasons for the situation and the inner causes.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>You may not have any understanding of the influence of their background.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This indicates that you may know what is happening between them, but you do not actually understand their case.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Perhaps some elders would be able to understand the problem of this married couple.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>However, they may still be lacking in wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>They may not have the wisdom to help this couple grow in life and gain more of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>In order to build up the church, the elders need knowledge, understanding, and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If all the elders in all the churches had knowledge, understanding, and wisdom, after not too long a time the condition of all the churches would be glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In every church there would be a rich foretaste of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>In this message I am not relying on dictionary definitions of knowledge, understanding, and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>My realization of the difference between knowledge, understanding and wisdom as all these are related to the building up of the church comes from years of experience and observation.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We may use family life as a further illustration of the difference between knowledge, understanding, and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Taking care of children is a great burden, a serious responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The parents, especially the mother, first need a knowledge of their children s condition and situation.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Then the parents need an understanding of their children s motive, desire, disposition, character, and environment.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The mother and father need to consider all the factors, including the influence of the relatives and the family background, that will affect the raising of the children.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Then they need to look to the Lord and pray to Him for wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>They may pray, Lord, we know the things concerning our children.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Also we have some understanding of their disposition, character, and environment.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Lord, give us the wisdom to know how to care for them and to raise them.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>In order to raise our children properly, we need knowledge, understanding, and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>The principle is the same with the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>If we would be used of the Lord to build the church, we need knowledge, understanding, and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>No human writings can compare with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>The Bible is a book filled with divine wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>According to the Bible, the most noble task is the work of building up God s dwelling place with all the furniture portraying Christ and our Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>For the carrying out of the noble work of building up the church, God s dwelling place on earth today, we need to be filled with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all workmanship 31:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Only when we have the proper knowledge, understanding, wisdom, and craftsmanship shall we be able to carry out the noble work of building God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>This message is not only for elders; it is for all the saints of all ages, including the young sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>We are not an organization, and we do not have either laymen or clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>We all are simply God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Therefore, all of us may be like Bezalel, Oholiab, and the wise-hearted ones to whom God has given wisdom v. 6 . We all may be wise-hearted and have a part in building the most noble structure in the entire universe God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>This message is neither a sermon nor an ordinary Bible teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>My burden is to show you from these verses what is on God s heart and what He wants us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>The Lord desires a dwelling place on earth, and He wants His people to build it for Him by being filled with the Spirit in knowledge, understanding, wisdom, and craftsmanship.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>I can testify that I expect the Lord to do much with the saints in the Lord s recovery, especially with the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Young sisters, do not say, Oh, this matter of building the church doesn t have anything to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>We are young sisters, still in high school.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>This is a job for the elders or for the older saints.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Instead of viewing the matter in this way, we all need to realize that the noble work of building up the church is for every one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>We all need to treasure the Lord s speaking concerning the building up of His dwelling place, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>I hope that you will not take this message in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>May we all see what is on God s heart concerning the noble work of building His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>May we also see our need to be filled with the Spirit of God in knowledge, understanding, wisdom, and workmanship so that we may do the noble work of building.</S>
