   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The spirit today is not the original spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our spirit is no more just a natural spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our spirit is now the regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Regeneration means that God the Spirit indwells our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The natural spirit has no regeneration, but the mingled spirit means regeneration because a divine Spirit has entered into our original spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the divine Spirit enters into our natural spirit, right away we are regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You have to be assured, and you have to thank the Lord, that you do have something within you that has no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Your regenerated spirit has no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To say that our spirit is up or our spirit is down is not so accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even to say that our spirit is weak is not so accurate, because our spirit has been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In our spirit there is the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With the divine Spirit mingled with our human spirit, how could such a spirit be weak?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not your spirit that is weak; it is you, your mind, that is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To say that our spirit is weak would seem to indicate that the divine Spirit could be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the divine Spirit never leaves us, and He is never weak.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is always strong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once He comes in, He remains for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The New Testament says clearly that God has not given us a weak or timid spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 2 Timothy 1:7 Paul said, God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From this verse you can realize that whenever you feel weak, it means you are in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever you feel you are down, you are in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the contrary, you can know that you are in the spirit when you are strong and when you are up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The problem is this: we are used to speaking things and doing things by habitually using our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In a sense we don t exercise our mind, we simply use it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We spontaneously use our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Habitually we use our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you would pray before doing something, you would discover whether or not that something is from your mind or from your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you pray and contact the Lord before doing something, and your feeling is still to do that something, it may be of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If something is simply from your mind, after you pray and contact the Lord, you will sense right away that you shouldn t do it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that your intention is not from the spirit, but from the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although we may say doctrinally that we need to turn to the spirit, according to experience it is a little different.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many things in the spiritual life are hard to explain by human utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In a sense it is okay to say we need to turn to our spirit; actually it is not so accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not merely a matter of turning to your spirit, but of checking out that you are in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When you check out that you are in the mind, right away you are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In a sense you don t need to turn.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To turn to the spirit is a little too late.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example if you lose your temper, and you realize that you have lost your temper, and you turn to your spirit, that is too late.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you feel that you are weak you have to condemn that and tell Satan that God has never given you such a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You have to tell Satan that God has given you a strong spirit of love and of power and of a sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Oh, we do have a regenerated spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>And our regenerated spirit is so strong!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No unbeliever has a strong spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Their spirit is dead and dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But our spirit has been made alive; it has been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even the divine Spirit is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even the Triune God is in our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How can such a spirit be weak?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is against the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>STRENGTHENED INTO THE INNER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Why then do you have some problems?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is because your mind goes to the wrong place.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Your mind takes the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Instead of being set upon the spirit, it is set upon the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Ephesians 3:16 says that we need to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some translations read in the inner man, but the Greek word means into the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Your inner man is always so strong, but your being is not strong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You need to be strengthened into the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When you, your being, goes into the inner man, you are strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When you are strengthened into your inner man there is no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But when you get out of the inner man you are weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For example, when you turn on the switch the entire building enjoys the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But when you turn off the switch, the entire building loses the enjoyment of the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In like manner, when your mind goes to the spirit, you get into regeneration and the enjoyment of the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But when your mind comes to the flesh, you get into the fall, into hell.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When your mind goes down to the flesh, you have to prepare yourself to get into hell.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Many philosophers and ethical scholars endeavor to be right and to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Sometimes the strong willed ones may have some success.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But most of the time they are defeated because their mind has no place to go for victory.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Their mind has to gain the victory by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Most of the good philosophers are ethical, and their teachings mainly build up a kind of character, that is, they mainly build up the mind including the will.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They endeavor to build up the mind to have a success.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But the problem is that they do not have a regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>At most they have a dead spirit with a dormant conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even many of the teachings among Christians are simply sermons or speeches to edify the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>According to many Christian concepts, Christian growth means to get more and more knowledge into the mind and to make the mind more knowledgeable of the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They do not emphasize their regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When they talk about regeneration, they always consider that to be something of the Holy Ghost who is far, far from them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They don t realize that regeneration is something in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Even most of them do not know that they have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>So they simply do their best to edify their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Actually, many Christian teachings today are very much the same as the philosophical, ethical teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They have no spirit for their mind to go to.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We have a place we can go to.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We have our regenerated mingled spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We have such a destination, and we have such a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But the pitiful thing is that we don t go to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Either we stay in ourselves, in our mind, or we go down to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When you are quiet and calmed down and nice you are in your mind, in the central station.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>But after a while your husband or your wife may cause you to react and to stir up your mind to go down to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Then you lose your temper and have a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Sometimes, though, you are really in Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>You make up your mind that you will do good.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>You will yourself to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>But as long as you don t will yourself to do good, sin in you is dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The lust in you is dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>But when you will yourself to do good, you just wake up the dormant lust.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Then there is a fighting, a warring.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Whenever there is such a warring, your mind is always defeated by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is the reason why Paul puts chapter seven of Romans before chapter eight.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>By reading these two chapters carefully, you could see that chapter eight is a real continuation of chapter seven.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>In chapter seven there is no way because there is no spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This means there is no better station that you can go to.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>But when you come to chapter eight, you have a better station.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>It is not the central station, but the upper station, the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>You have a spirit, so from chapter eight Paul talks about the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Actually, all of chapter eight is talking about the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The spirit is our refuge, our rescue, our upper station.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>When we reach that, everything is okay.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>It is better even for us to stay there in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>In 8:5 it seems there is the matter of going to the spirit, and in verse 6 it seems there is the matter of staying with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>But we know the problem: our mind is not flat or square.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>It seems to be round with a lot of oil and water upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>It is so easy for this round slippery ball to slip away from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The more you try to get your mind to remain upon the spirit, the more it slips away.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>This is why we need the following verses in chapter eight.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>All the following verses give us many items to keep the mind set upon the spirit and to make the mind stand with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>You have to realize this kind of speaking is not a general speaking concerning God s salvation and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Rather, the speaking in this Training is very fine.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>This was also Paul s way of speaking in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Romans 8 is a long chapter mainly on the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Even this title indicates that it is not a rough teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>It is a fine teaching, a kind of diagnosis of our sick person and an analysis of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>This means there are five things related to our being: first, there is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Second, it is not a natural spirit but a regenerated spirit, mingled with the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Third, there is our body.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Fourth, there is the fall related to our body, causing it to become the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>According to Romans 8:23, one day we will experience the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>But that is not today.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Today our body is not the original body created by God; it is the fallen body, the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>The flesh indicates the fall, and the redemption of the body is still not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>It will be in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>That will be the full sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>At that time we will be fully sonized.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Today, because we have been regenerated, our spirit has been sonized.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Our spirit has been made a part of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>But our body has not yet been made a part of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Our body still remains flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>The fifth item related to our being may be considered as a neutral part, our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>You have to realize that the Bible does not indicate that our mind has been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>Nor does it say that our mind will be transformed at the coming of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>The Bible shows us that the transformation of our mind is occurring right now.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Our spirit has been regenerated, and our body will be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>But our mind is neutral.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>In a sense, it is somewhat blank.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>We have to realize that we are a tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>One part our spirit has been rescued, saved, regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>One part our body remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>But another part our mind is neutral.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>Today the problem is this: to what part should we go, or to what part should our mind go?</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>To say what part we should go to means to say what part our mind should go to.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>We all must go to the spirit and even remain in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>But our mind is a kind of round and slippery thing, always moving.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>So we need the grace that is revealed in the following verses of Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>This will make our mind stable and stop our mind from turning and moving.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>Sometimes we say that we make up our mind to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>We must realize, though, that God does not want us to make up our mind to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>God wants us to use our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>Whenever we pray to contact the Lord, spontaneously our mind turns to the spirit through the praying.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>Whenever you mean business in calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, right away your mind is turned to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>Before you called, your mind may have been rolling away, but now it is set upon the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>At other times you may fellowship with the saints or sing to the Lord and find that something in your being is turned to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>This means the mind is turning to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>At other times you may pray-read the Bible or you may read some of the messages and spontaneously you find that your mind is turned to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>You get nourished and watered in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>When you remain in your mind, you starve and dry up.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>But when you turn to your spirit, water and food are there.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>All these spiritual experiences are just the matter of the mind turning to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>It is good for the mind to be turned to the spirit, but it is not the best.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>Why does your mind need a turn?</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>Because it is away from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>It is best to keep your mind remaining in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>Many times when you call on the Lord s name, or sing, or pray, or fellowship, or read the Bible, or read the messages, you have the feeling they don t turn you.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>They just keep you there.</S>
   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>They strengthen your abiding there.</S>
   <S PAR='179' RSNT='1' SNO='179'>They strengthen your abiding in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='180' RSNT='1' SNO='180'>We need to learn to do these things habitually and in a continuous way.</S>
   <S PAR='181' RSNT='1' SNO='181'>Don t just do them occasionally, but as a practice, a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='182' RSNT='1' SNO='182'>Under any kind of circumstances and at any time you can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='183' RSNT='1' SNO='183'>Sometimes you have wanted to pray, but you could not because your mind was rolling like a round ball.</S>
   <S PAR='184' RSNT='1' SNO='184'>But eventually something happened within and you were able to pray and to praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='185' RSNT='1' SNO='185'>This means your mind has been brought back to the spirit again.</S>
   <S PAR='186' RSNT='1' SNO='186'>When the mind goes down to the flesh, you are just an enemy to God.</S>
   <S PAR='187' RSNT='1' SNO='187'>It is not just your flesh that is an enemy, but you yourself are an enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='188' RSNT='1' SNO='188'>The mind on the flesh is enmity against God.</S>
   <S PAR='189' RSNT='1' SNO='189'>That is you.</S>
   <S PAR='190' RSNT='1' SNO='190'>When our mind goes to the flesh, we become wild and rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='191' RSNT='1' SNO='191'>We could never be submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='192' RSNT='1' SNO='192'>Furthermore, when your mind goes to the flesh and remains there, you become those who are in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='193' RSNT='1' SNO='193'>When your mind goes to the spirit and remains there, you are those who are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='194' RSNT='1' SNO='194'>When your mind goes down to the flesh and remains there, you are those who are in the flesh and you cannot please God.</S>
   <S PAR='195' RSNT='1' SNO='195'>We all have to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='196' RSNT='1' SNO='196'>The mind is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='197' RSNT='1' SNO='197'>It is the mind that can make us either in the spirit or in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='198' RSNT='1' SNO='198'>When the mind remains in the spirit, we are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='199' RSNT='1' SNO='199'>When the mind remains on the flesh, we are in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='200' RSNT='1' SNO='200'>We become those who are in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='201' RSNT='1' SNO='201'>What kind of person we shall be depends upon where our mind goes and stays and remains.</S>
   <S PAR='202' RSNT='1' SNO='202'>We all have to practice the matter of praying and calling on the Lord s name and fellowshipping and pray-reading the Word of God and reading the life materials and singing and attending the meetings in order to bring our mind to the spirit and keep it there.</S>
   <S PAR='203' RSNT='1' SNO='203'>If you practice these things, they will either turn your mind to the spirit or keep your mind in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='204' RSNT='1' SNO='204'>There is no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='205' RSNT='1' SNO='205'>It will not work simply to make up your mind to be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='206' RSNT='1' SNO='206'>You have to practice these things.</S>
   <S PAR='207' RSNT='1' SNO='207'>If it is hard for you to practice these things you have to pray: Lord have mercy upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='208' RSNT='1' SNO='208'>I am sick.</S>
   <S PAR='209' RSNT='1' SNO='209'>Have mercy upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='210' RSNT='1' SNO='210'>Furthermore, we have to pray for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='211' RSNT='1' SNO='211'>I pray for all of you quite often.</S>
   <S PAR='212' RSNT='1' SNO='212'>Although I may not remember all your names, when I pray for you I have your faces before me.</S>
   <S PAR='213' RSNT='1' SNO='213'>We have to pray for each other.</S>
   <S PAR='214' RSNT='1' SNO='214'>There is a law in the spiritual world that God s works need our prayer as a kind of cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='215' RSNT='1' SNO='215'>When we pray, God works.</S>
   <S PAR='216' RSNT='1' SNO='216'>When we pray, He operates.</S>
   <S PAR='217' RSNT='1' SNO='217'>When we stop praying, His operation also stops.</S>
   <S PAR='218' RSNT='1' SNO='218'>So we have to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='219' RSNT='1' SNO='219'>I believe we all could testify that many times spontaneously from within we wanted to pray, we wanted to call on the Lord s name, we wanted to come to the meeting, we wanted to read the Bible, we wanted to sing, to praise, to read the life material.</S>
   <S PAR='220' RSNT='1' SNO='220'>We all can testify that we have been preserved by the Lord in such an aspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='221' RSNT='1' SNO='221'>This kind of aspiration is a kind of preserving to us.</S>
   <S PAR='222' RSNT='1' SNO='222'>Practicing these things will keep your mind remaining on the spirit.</S>
