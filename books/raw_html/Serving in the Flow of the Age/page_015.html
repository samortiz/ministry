        <h2 class="head1">HELPING PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We should not use our former experiences to &ldquo;teach&rdquo; others. No one can become spiritual because of teachings, and no one is so spiritual that he does not need to contact the Lord. Spirituality is like breathing. Even though a person may have been breathing for eighty years, he will die if he does not breathe today. When a person is born, he must breathe in order to live, and if he lives to be eighty years old, he still must breathe in order to not die. This principle applies to our spiritual life. When Brother Watchman Nee ministered in mainland China, he fell ill several times, but he still ministered in the meetings and called on the Lord loudly. He overcame his physical pain. He maintained his life and service by constantly breathing, contacting, and eating and drinking the Lord. Brother Nee was a Christian whose living was not a matter of human effort.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT HAVING MAN-MADE SPIRITUALITY<br />
BUT LIVING CONSTANTLY IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Brother Nee once said sadly to me, &ldquo;Brother Witness, it is incredible! Christians can lie.&rdquo; He said this because some Christians were incriminating him with lies. It was hard for me to believe that Christians could lie. Gradually, I came to know that Christians are capable of anything if they are not in spirit. Furthermore, I learned that the results that come from the human efforts of Christians are not reliable. There may be some positive results today, but their efforts will fail tomorrow. Being a Christian is a matter of a living, not of human effort.</p>
<p>By the time I was in my sixties, I had seen many things, but I never saw an occasion as wild as what occurred in Hong Kong one year. At that time, about fifty dissenters came to the meeting hall in Hong Kong and stood outside the door. The elders were worried that they would cause a disturbance, so they did not want to open the door. When the dissenters said that they would not do anything, the door was opened. Once the door was opened, however, they came in shouting and striking things; it was like a riot. One of the brothers among them, who specialized in preaching spirituality, even turned off the lights, frightening nearly a thousand people who were left in the dark. When the lights were turned back on, a dissenter rushed onto the platform. Some young men saw this, and they took him off the platform. He responded by striking out at them, and the young brothers had to restrain him. I would have never imagined that Christians could do such things. This shows that man-made spirituality is worthless and unreliable; we have no need for man-made spirituality.</p>
<p>We must look to the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and live in the Spirit constantly. If we are not living in the Spirit, we will depend on our &ldquo;spiritual seniority.&rdquo; However, as soon as we are not living in the Spirit, our doctrinal understanding is worthless. We must bring people to the Lord, who is the living Spirit, and help them to live in this living Spirit. Only this is reliable; everything else is unreliable.</p>
<p>We must no longer try to work out a spiritual living; instead, we should look to the Lord for His mercy so that we may practically live in Him and spontaneously live in the Spirit. If we do not live in the Spirit, there will only be disputes and quarrels; I believe that we all have had such experiences. The only way that can save us and deliver us from ourselves is to live in the Spirit, in our living Lord.</p>
<p>Once we are in the meetings, we must forget about keeping rules or following past procedures; instead, we should simply exercise our spirit and release our spirit. We can read the Bible, sing hymns, testify, or share, but we must never adhere to methods. We just need to exercise our spirit and release our spirit in order to go forward on the right track.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SOME PRACTICES CONCERNING SUPPLYING THE WORD</h2>
<p>Even if we have seen the vision, know the way that the Lord is taking today, and know how to lead the brothers and sisters, we still need the supply of the word. Supplying the word is not something that should be difficult or dull. There are many ways to do it. For example, the churches in the United States are not all the same; they have many different practices. In principle, they use the same material, but they differ only in how the material is used. Although the material is the same, they are not rigid in how it is used.</p>
<p>In some churches all the brothers and sisters read one printed message per week. When they meet together on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, they share what they have read and gained. In such a gathering, the saints stand up one by one to share the supply that they have received from the message. They rarely speak for over a minute, but their speaking is very living and rich. Thus, within an hour and a half, as many as one hundred saints have shared. This practice is very fresh, lively, and rich.</p>
<p>Another church asks four or five brothers to read a message. They not only read the message, but they come together and fellowship over it. Then in the meeting of the church they lead everyone in the reading of the message. They do not necessarily read from the first page to the last. When they finish reading, the brothers take turns to say something about the message, but they do not simply repeat the printed message. Instead, they speak from their spirit, and then the other brothers and sisters share. This is also very living and very good.</p>
<p>Yet another church asks some brothers to read through a message thoroughly and summarize it into an outline. The outline is then handed out to the brothers and sisters during the meeting. Everyone reads and pray-reads the verses, and then they read the outline. After reading the outline, everyone shares. This also is very rich. Sometimes the leading ones may say more, but there is no set rule. In short, the important point is to not rigidly repeat the message but to apply it very flexibly. Nevertheless, the specific center, the basic content, is the same.</p>
<p>If we really see this, we will not act individualistically when we serve in our respective localities. When we lead and supply the local churches, we must fellowship in one spirit and seek the way that the Lord has given to us. In principle, we must be in the center of the vision and keep up with the Lord&rsquo;s flow. The way that each locality takes in practice, however, depends on the responsible brothers in each locality having fellowship in one spirit; it should not be according to anyone&rsquo;s method. A leading from the Lord will come out of the fellowship in one spirit, and then we should lead according to this leading. Only then can the Lord bless us.</p>
<p>When a local church has outside visitors, for example, we have a habit of inviting them to give a message. Inviting visitors to give a message is altogether a dead rule that must have no place in our meetings. When brothers visit, everyone who meets together should exercise his spirit. We should not be focused on whether a certain one speaks or does not speak. Everyone must be in the spirit, and the Spirit should lead; then there will be a supply. Once I was in a meeting, and the brothers invited me to speak after the saints were finished. Although I had something to say, I did not say anything. We should eliminate the thought of always inviting visitors to speak. In our gatherings a person whose spirit is released should speak, and a person whose spirit is not released should not speak. It is not necessary to always invite someone to speak. Neither is it necessary to never invite someone to speak. When a certain elderly co-worker from the Far East went to a meeting of a church in the United States and no one asked him to give a message, he marveled that the church did not invite him to speak. If someone has the leading of the Spirit and a burden, he should speak; being in the spirit in a meeting is all that matters. It does not matter whether one is a local saint, a visiting saint, a new saint, or an experienced saint; living absolutely in the spirit is all that matters.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
