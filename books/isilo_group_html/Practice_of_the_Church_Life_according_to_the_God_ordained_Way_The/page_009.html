By Thorough Prayer</H2><P>The way to have a clear view concerning the present situation of the Lord's recovery is by thorough prayer (Eph. 1:16; 3:14). When you hear the things spoken by the dissenting ones, do not take them at face value. These sayings in themselves are only the "shell"; they are not the "kernel." When you hear anything concerning the Lord's recovery, you should not receive it immediately. Instead, you should bring it to the Lord in prayer. You should not pray only once but should pray again and again concerning what you have heard, until you have prayed thoroughly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In a Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation</H2><P>In order to have a clear view concerning the present situation, we need to have a spirit of wisdom and revelation. Paul desired to help the Ephesians to know God's economy intrinsically. Concerning this, he prayed twice. In Ephesians 1:17 he prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation. He did not pray concerning the mind or the emotion; he prayed concerning the spirit, and this spirit is not a spirit of knowledge and understanding but a spirit of wisdom and revelation. To know God's economy intrinsically, we need more than knowledge and understanding; we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</P><P>Then, in Ephesians 3:14-19 Paul prayed for "this cause": that we may know Christ in such a way that He will be able to make His home in our hearts. For this particular cause Paul did not pray lightly; rather, he prayed in an earnest and formal way, bowing his knees to the Father.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Without Prejudice</H2><P>To have a clear view concerning the present situation of the Lord's recovery, we must be without prejudice. We should not say anything out of prejudice. Rather, we should learn to be quiet and bring every problem to the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Without Partiality</H2><P>In order to have a clear view of the present situation, we must also be without partiality; that is, in any controversy we should not take sides.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Without Personal Affection</H2><P>We must also learn to view the situation without personal affection. We should learn not to express our personal likes or dislikes concerning anything. We need to know who we are. We are nothing. We are small slaves of the Lord, and in His great house we should not say that we like or dislike certain things. We should say, "If the Lord shows me so, I will take it."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Without Self-opinion<br>but Full of Spiritual Discernment</H2><P>Finally, we must be without self-opinion but full of spiritual discernment (1 Cor. 14:29b). The English letters o, c, and e are sometimes difficult to distinguish. If we do not exercise discernment, we may read something wrongly. In the Chinese language a number of characters differ only slightly in form. For example, the character for heaven and that for monster are nearly the same. Thus, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish them.</P><P>When we attempt to get into the intrinsic nature of the twenty "problems" raised by the dissenting ones, we can see that none of them is simple. Every one is very crucial. And these twenty items show clearly that there must have been a conspiracy among the dissenting brothers. Without a conspiracy, no one could have put forth all these items. To enter into the intrinsic nature of all these items, we must not have any opinion but must be full of discernment.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Practice of the Church Life according to the God-ordained Way &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
