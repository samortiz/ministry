   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF DEUTERONOMY MESSAGE SIX THE REHEARSAL OF THE LAW 1 Scripture Reading: Deut 5:1-21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before we begin to consider the rehearsal of the law, I would like to speak a word concerning the Divine Trinity, which is the basis for the revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning the Divine Trinity, there is in the Bible an important principle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This principle is that anything related to the Father, who is the source, is onefold; anything related to the Son, who is the course, is twofold; and anything related to the Spirit, who is the flow, the consummation, the totality, of the Triune God, is threefold.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When God's salvation or any of His attributes reaches us, it reaches us in a threefold way because this reaching involves the three of the Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To understand this principle we need to consider how the Triune God reaches us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Father reaches us in the Son as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Father is in the Son, and the Son reaches us as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that when the Spirit reaches us, the Father and the Son also reach us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Gospel of John reveals that when the Father sent the Son, the Son did not come by Himself but came with the Father John 8:29; 16:32b .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, when the Son sent the Spirit, He sent the Spirit as Himself John 15:26; 14:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, when the Spirit comes, the Father and the Son also come.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the Triune God reaching us as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Any attribute is onefold with the Father, twofold with the Son, and threefold with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Love is God's greatest attribute.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With the Father love is onefold, with the Son it is twofold, and with the Spirit it is threefold.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We see this threefoldness in 2 Corinthians 13:14, which says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Love is the source of grace, and grace is the coming forth, the expression, of love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fellowship is the transmission of the grace which is the embodiment of love.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The love of God is in the grace of Christ, and the grace of Christ with the love of God is transmitted in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From this we see that when something of the Triune God reaches us, it comes to us in a threefold way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although the book of Deuteronomy often uses the expression "Jehovah your God," it does not explicitly mention Christ or the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, in this book there are synonyms of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These synonyms are the word, the law, the commandments, the testimonies, the statutes, and the judgments the ordinances .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because all these are things spoken by God, in totality they are the word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The law, the commandments, the testimonies, the statutes, and the judgments are all the word, and the word is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Romans 10 Paul interprets the word in Deuteronomy as Christ, referring in verse 8 to "the word of the faith."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may think that the word in Deuteronomy is the word of the law, but Paul regards it as the word of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The commandments, the testimonies, the statutes, and the judgments are the word, and the word is the word of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since all these are synonyms of Christ, as we are reading Deuteronomy we may want to replace them with the word Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To keep the law is to keep Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To love the commandment is to love Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To receive the testimonies and judgments is to receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have pointed out that Deuteronomy does not speak of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, Paul's interpretation in Romans 10 implies the Spirit; it implies that the Christ whom he is describing is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul says, "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart" v. 8 . To be in our mouth and in our heart, this word, which is Christ, must be the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In his interpretation of Deuteronomy 30:11-14, Paul presents a wonderful description of Christ as the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected One.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ is the One who came down from the heavens in incarnation; thus, there is no need for anyone to ascend to the heavens to bring Him down.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is also the One who came out of the abyss, out of Hades, in resurrection; thus, there is no need for anyone to descend into the abyss to bring Him up.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Where is the Christ who came down from the heavens in incarnation and who came up from the abyss in resurrection, and what kind of Christ is He today?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This Christ is in our mouth and in our heart, for He is now the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the biblical Christ, the Christ unveiled in the interpretation of Deuteronomy in Romans 10.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Christ unveiled in Deuteronomy and Romans is the very God who became incarnated as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This One was crucified and resurrected, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit, who is the air for us to breathe by calling upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is everywhere, waiting for people to call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Romans 10:12 tells us that He is "rich to all who call upon Him."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we first call, we receive Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As we continue to call upon the name of the Lord, He becomes our life supply, our strength, and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we have the understanding concerning the Christ found in Romans 10, we will come to the book of Deuteronomy in a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We will regard Deuteronomy as an extract of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I hope that we all will have such an understanding as we now begin to consider the rehearsal of the law in 5:1-21.</S>
