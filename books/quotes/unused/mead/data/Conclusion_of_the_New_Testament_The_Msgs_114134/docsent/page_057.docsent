   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ii By the Ascension of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The believers being justified by God is also evidenced by the ascension of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 16:10 the Lord Jesus said that the Spirit will convince the world concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that the Father has been fully satisfied with the Lord s redemptive death and has accepted Him in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The proof that the Father is satisfied with Christ s redemption is that the Father resurrected Him from among the dead and exalted Him to His right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, the resurrection and ascension of Christ are the evidences proving that His redemption has satisfied God and has met all the demands and requirements of God for our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus was released from death to he exalted to the heavens at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One of our hymns speaks of this:</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Father God, Thou hast accepted</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jesus as our Substitute;</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Judged the Just One for the unjust,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Couldst Thou change Thy attitude?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a proof of perfect justice,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At Thine own right hand He sits;</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He, as Thy full satisfaction,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Righteously Thy need befits.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hymns, 20</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, the ascended Christ, who sits at the right hand of God, is an evidence that we, the believers in Christ, have been justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>2 Subjectively</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have seen that the believers have been justified objectively, that is, outwardly and positionally.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now we need to see another aspect of God s justification, and this is the subjective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be justified by God subjectively is to be justified by Him inwardly and dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>a By Receiving the Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>through the Positional Justification</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The believers are justified subjectively by receiving the divine life through the positional justification.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Being justified objectively gives us the position to receive the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the reason Romans 5:18 speaks of justification of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because we have been justified objectively, we have been brought up to the standard of God s righteousness and now we correspond to it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, we are justified unto life spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Adam we were condemned unto death, but in Christ we are justified unto life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Justification is for life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Justification changes our outward position and life changes our inward disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we have both justification for our position and life for our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Justification issues in, results in, life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have received the divine life, and this life is now working in us to make us righteous in many things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is an inward, subjective justification.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Through such a subjective justification, our being and living are justified by the divine life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, God justifies us not only objectively from without but also subjectively from within.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>b By Christ in His Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are also justified subjectively by Christ in His resurrection Rom 4:25b .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As the resurrected One, Christ is in us to live for us a life that can be justified by God and is always acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The resurrected Christ is now living in us a life that is absolutely righteous, a life that can be justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is not outward justification through Christ s redemption; rather, this is inward justification by Christ s life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ s redemption gives us objective justification by faith, but His resurrection life within us gives us the subjective justification by God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now God is positioned by Christ s blood to justify us outwardly, and He is also positioned by the resurrected Christ to justify us inwardly.</S>
