   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>He came to God not to ask God to help him change himself when he went home because he knew that he could not change.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He could not improve or correct himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He knew he had sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He would perish because he had sins and did not have the One who could substitute for the punishment for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He looked to the substitutionary Savior; therefore, he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Dear readers, we all are sinners and cannot save ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus came specifically to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He did not come to be our model or to be our pattern, He came to die for us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He came to die for you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You and I have sins and deserve to die.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus came to die for your sins and mine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, you and I do not have to die.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree" 1 Pet 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"For Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous" 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins" 1 John 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This matter is most important.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since the Lord Jesus died and propitiated for us, now we do not have to perish but can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the Lord Jesus did not die and propitiate for us, we would have to bear our own sins and die, that is, perish.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is true that the tax collector was a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But he depended on the Savior who died for him and who propitiated for him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, he had no sins and did not have to die or go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The tax collector was able to go to heaven not because of his own merit but because of the merit of a third party, the merit of the Savior's saving work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Likewise, all those who go to heaven are justified not because of their own righteous deeds, but because they rely on the work of the cross of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The tax collector came before God for the propitiation of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"For whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How then shall they call upon Him into whom they have not believed?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rom 10:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The tax collector cried to God because he first believed in God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was saved because he believed God would propitiate for his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Justification is by faith and salvation is also by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He knew well the truth concerning salvation: "For by grace you have been saved through faith" Eph 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He knew he lacked something.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He also knew that except for God's mercy, nothing else could make up for his lack.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He asked God to have mercy on him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He knew that salvation was by grace and "not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us" Titus 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He knew God gives grace through the Savior and that he needed a Savior to die for him to propitiate for his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He prayed for God's grace and beseeched for God's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He asked by faith, and He believed in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, he obtained it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The tax collector went to heaven because he obtained God's mercy and received the Savior's propitiation for him, not because he was remarkable and outstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For a sinner to go to heaven, there is no need to pay a price because the Lord Jesus has already paid the full price on the cross on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Pharisee perished because he did not have a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The tax collector was saved because he had a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Salvation and perdition have nothing to do with you or your behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A man as good as the Pharisee could not avoid going to hell, while a man as wicked as the tax collector could go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One went to hell not because he was wicked, and the other went to heaven not because he was good.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The difference between them was whether or not they believed in the Lord Jesus who died for us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That was all!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"He who believes into the Son has eternal life; but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him" John 3:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The decision between eternal life and eternal death depends solely upon whether or not one believes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today I beg and beseech you to quickly believe in the Lord Jesus' vicarious death, and you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The good man went to hell and the wicked man went to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The good man did not go to hell because of his goodness, but because he did not believe in the Lord Jesus as his Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The wicked man did not go to heaven because of his wickedness, but because he believed in the Lord Jesus as his Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, if you want salvation, you must realize that salvation is not merchandise.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You do not have to gradually behave yourself better and earn your salvation as a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Salvation is God's free grace, freely given to all sinners who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God does not care how wicked you are.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you are willing to receive the Lord Jesus as your Savior and if you believe that His death was for you, you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord Jesus has already borne all the punishment for your sins; no sin will be able to stand up to accuse you in the day of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You are completely and absolutely saved.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God does not care how good you are.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you do not receive the Lord Jesus to be your Savior and if you do not believe that His death was for you, you will surely perish.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Your goodness cannot cover your wickedness and cannot redeem your wickedness; you will still perish.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God has ordained that those who believe in the Lord Jesus will be saved and that those who do not believe will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Good unbelievers will go to hell, but wicked believers will go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, good man, please do not be proud, because your goodness will not save you!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, wicked man, do not be discouraged, because your sins will not condemn you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Thank and praise God!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>How wonderful is His salvation!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The people of the world are like this tax collector, helpless and hopeless sinners, and we all deserve eternal punishment in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Yet God caused the Lord Jesus to die for us on the cross, so that when we believe in Him and receive Him as our Savior, we will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>How great is this grace!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>So sinner, please follow the tax collector!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Humble yourself before God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Confess your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Come before God with faith, asking God, "God, be merciful to me, a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Save me by the Lord Jesus' substitutionary death on the cross!"</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God will surely save you.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Thank God that He has such a salvation.</S>
