   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Right and Wrong Are in God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Man should not do anything out of a knowledge of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rather, he should do all things out of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The principle of discerning good and evil is the principle of living by right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before Adam and Eve took the fruit, their right and wrong were in God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If they did not live before God, they knew nothing; both their right and wrong were just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But after man received of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he found a source of discerning between right and wrong apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As a consequence, after man's fall, there was no need for him to seek after God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He could get along by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He could isolate himself from God and judge between right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The work of redemption enables us to turn back to God for our right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christians Needing to Submit to Authority</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All authority is from God because everything is ordered by God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we trace any authority upward, we eventually will come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God is above all authorities, and every authority is under Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once we touch God's authority, we touch God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Basically, God's work is not carried out by power, but by authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He upholds everything by the word, which is of His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Creation came about through the word of His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His word is His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not know how God's authority works.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But we know that God accomplishes everything through His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The centurion whose servant was sick knew that there was an authority above him to which he should submit, inasmuch as there were those under him who submitted to him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, he only needed the Lord to say one word, and he believed that the matter would then be taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He knew that all authority was in the Lord's hand; he believed in the Lord's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why the Lord said that He had found no faith greater than this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Meeting God's authority is the same as meeting God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today God appoints authorities everywhere in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the orbits in the universe are established by Him; all the ways in the world are set up by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, they are all under His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Offending God's authority is the same as offending God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A Christian should submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The First Lesson for a Worker</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Being to Submit to Authority</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our position is to be under others' authority on the one hand, while having others under our authority on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Other than God Himself, everyone, including the Lord Jesus, has to submit to authority on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should see authority everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Both at home and in school there are authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When you see a policeman on the street, even though you may know that he is incapable and that his learning is not as high as yours, you have to consider him as God's appointed authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When a few brothers are together, they should know how to line themselves up immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everyone should know where he stands.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A worker should know who is his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some never realize who their authority is.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They have never submitted to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>With us there should never be right or wrong, good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Wherever we go, we should first know who is the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you know who you have to submit to, you will spontaneously know what position you should occupy in the Body, and you will stand in your proper position.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But there are many Christians today in whom there is not even a thought about submission.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For them everything is confused; with them there is no such thing as keeping one's position.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Submission is the first lesson for those who work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is actually the major part of their work.</S>
