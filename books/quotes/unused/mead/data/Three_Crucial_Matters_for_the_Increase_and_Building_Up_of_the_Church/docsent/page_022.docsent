   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING FAITHFUL IN MATERIAL OFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO THE LORD AND CARING FOR THE LORD S NEED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even though the Linkou project will require several million Taiwan dollars, we should not put all our money into this project and neglect the development of the work in the communities.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must labor simultaneously in both areas.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The brothers and sisters should labor before the Lord and learn how to use their money so that by faithfully giving, they can gradually attain the amount they have pledged to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not forget the amount of our pledge, and we should not take money from that amount to use for other purposes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some brothers and sisters will ask whether the cost for purchasing the land at Linkou, developing the plans, and constructing the hall exceeds our original budget.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This may be true, but we believe that the churches around the world will contribute to this project.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We believe that when the offerings of the overseas churches are added to the offerings of the churches in Taiwan, the lack will be taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This will not be a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must be faithful to fulfill the offering we pledged to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As long as the brothers and sisters faithfully make their offerings, according to their vow to the Lord, the completion of the large meeting hall will not be a heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We believe that the Lord will continue to bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Related to the spread of the community work, the brothers and sisters still need to do their best before the Lord to support the needs of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then the full-time brothers and sisters will be adequately supported and will have a stable living without anxieties.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This will enable them to work in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the full-time saints are hindered financially, it will affect the brothers and sisters who want to go full time in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They will lack the boldness to give themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, we must take good care of the present full-timers so that future full-timers will be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This does not mean that the full-timers do not have faith, but they need to take care of their families.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The purpose of this fellowship is not to deprive the brothers and sisters of food and clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, it is for them to live a normal life and take care of their children s education but not spend even one penny on unnecessary items.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>May the Lord s blood cover me; this is what I practice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I buy only the clothes and items that I need, and I make a budget so that any surplus can be used for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we would all practice this, the Lord s blessing would be upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the experience of the believers and the promises in the Bible, if we are faithful to the Lord, He will open the windows of heaven and pour out blessings upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Malachi 3:10 says, Bring the whole tithe to the storehouse that there may be food in My house; and prove Me, if you will, by this, says Jehovah of hosts, whether I will open to you the windows of heaven and pour out blessing for you until there is no room for it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When this word was spoken, there were many defeated ones among the Israelites, which resulted in the situation recorded in the book of Haggai: You have sown much, but you bring in little; you eat, but there is no satisfaction; you drink, but there is no being filled with drink; you dress yourselves, but there is no warmth in doing so; and he who earns wages, earns wages to put them into a bag with holes 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should believe that our Lord is real and living and that He is faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All His words in the Bible are trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For the past sixty years I have been following Him, relying on Him, and believing Him; hence, I can testify to you that I have seen His multifarious riches manifested in our faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brothers and sisters, it is a blessing and a glory for us to be willing to see the Lord s need and to give our all for His use.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should consider what would happen if we all consecrated everything we have for the Lord s use.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Gradually, three thousand, four thousand, and even ten thousand people would be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Seeing the fruit of our material offerings would make us joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Luke 16:9 the Lord said, Make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today we are happy when we see people being saved, and when we enter the kingdom, there will be people welcoming us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I believe that we will be surprised to see those who will welcome us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They will say to us, The money you gave provided the way for me to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We truly believe that this will happen; otherwise, the Lord would not have spoken this word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should all believe this word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord makes the way, and He gives the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is necessary for us to complete the large meeting facility.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After the meeting facility is completed, we will discover that it does not fully meet our need.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, we will need more large stations in Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung, Hualien, and Taitung to meet the need of spreading the work to the entire island.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must also proceed with the development of the community work in the city of Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must take care of these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Prayer: Lord, You have heard our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We believe that it is from You, and we ask You to come in and accomplish it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Bless the brothers and sisters for the sake of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Bless their homes, their children, and their jobs so that they can give themselves, their households, their time, and their money.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Lord, for the sake of the increase and spread of the churches, bless this country, our society, and the development of this island.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Glorify Your name.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The day of Your coming is near.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We ask You to gospelize, truthize, and churchize Taiwan so that Taiwan can become an island that is full of Your testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>May all the glory be to the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Amen.</S>
