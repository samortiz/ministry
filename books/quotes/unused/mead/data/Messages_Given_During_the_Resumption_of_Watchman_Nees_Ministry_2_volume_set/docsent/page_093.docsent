   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Sacrificing God's Word</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>on account of Our Own Experience</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many times, we sacrifice God's word on account of our personal experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because our individual experiences are partial and fragmentary, we do not have a complete, overall view of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Men think that the sun comes out in the day and the moon comes out at night.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They think that the moon only appears at night and disappears in the daytime.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, the moon is there both in the daytime and at night as well.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When a person comes to God, he often makes judgments based on his own experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Most people like to arrange the truths in a sequence, such as putting justification first and sanctification afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet the Bible puts sanctification before justification 1 Cor 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, justification and sanctification are two sides of one truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, we need to be delivered from human weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One cannot affect or sacrifice God's word on account of human weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not only should we be delivered from doubting God's word; we must also be delivered from jeopardizing God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Under God's ordering, our knowledge of the individual life and our knowledge of the Body life should happen at the same time; we should not say which one comes first and which one comes later.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not Taking What We See Today as the Whole Truth</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We cannot judge God's word by what we see in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What we see today is still limited.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps fifty years from now, other brothers will rise up to say that we are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We only wish we could climb higher than we are to see God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Just as we are not saved and then regenerated, in the same way we do not first receive an individual life and then come to realize the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Just as salvation and regeneration happen at the same time, in the same way the realization of the individual life and that of the Body life happen at the same time Acts 9:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In every age, there are truths of that age.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are also errors of that age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We cannot make the truth of an age become an error just because we do not have enough knowledge about that truth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Take again the example of baptism and the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The two things should happen at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After a person is baptized, immediately he should experience the laying on of hands, and immediately he should be brought to see the coordination, the Body, and to be joined to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Due to the fact that some truths were recovered first and some later, men set a sequence to the order of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why we cannot consider what we have seen today as the whole truth, nor can we judge God's word by our own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Never forget that we are ministers of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Need for a Clear Vision of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The oneness of the Body is based on the knowledge of the life of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First we have to see that we have received the same life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After this seeing, we become one in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Without this seeing, we have a big lack.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A person who has not seen the Body will feel that he is not much different from a person who has seen the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But a person who has seen the Body will realize that with those who have not seen the Body, there is a big lack.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is like an unsaved person considering a saved person more or less the same as he is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yet the saved person sees in the unsaved person a big lack.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>CONCERNING THE PRACTICE Finding the Ones to Submit To</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After we have such a realization, we come to the second step.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The first step has to do with God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The second step has to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First we must have God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then this word must be applied to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the Body, the first thing we have to learn is to find out who are those whom we have to submit ourselves to.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must know who are those who are ahead of us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All the authorities in the Bible are deputy authorities and not direct authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What we have to learn is not to have others submit to us, but to have ourselves submit to others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When I go to work, I do not first ask who my subordinates are.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rather, I must first ask who my superior is.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you go to another person's house to be the maid, you do not first ask who the children are, but who the lady of the house is.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we allow the inner life to operate freely, we will find out who are the ones we have to submit to.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We may think that submission will make us unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Actually, the opposite is true; submission makes a happy person, and insubordination makes an unhappy person.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Only when we submit to one another will there be coordination one with another.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This kind of coordination is most pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The real submission is not one that is imposed from without, but one that comes as a result of the operation of the life within.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is wrong to submit to anyone because of his high position or material riches.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To do so would make us no different from the political organizations of today.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our submission is not brought about by any outward factors, but by the demand of the life within.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This kind of submission may bring us tears.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Yet, at the same time it brings us joy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We may feel that we are suffering, but we are at the same time rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Sometimes the ones whom you submit yourselves to may give you a hard time, but you can still say "amen."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is true submission.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A true submission is one which neither makes a person suffer, nor causes him to feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, it draws an "amen" from his spirit and gives him peace in his spirit.</S>
