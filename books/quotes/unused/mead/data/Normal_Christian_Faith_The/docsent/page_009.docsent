   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THERE IS GOD IN THE HEART</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do we have any desires other than social identity and self-propagation?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What other cravings do we have?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Deep in everyone there is a craving for God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whether they are highly civilized races, such as those among the Caucasians, or the ancient civilizations, such as the Chinese civilizations, or the African natives and uncultured aborigines, they all have a common craving --God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As long as they are men, they have a yearning for God, no matter what race or nationality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You cannot argue against it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everyone is seeking after God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everywhere man is craving for God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By applying the principle that we just mentioned, we can see that since our heart feels the need for a God, there must necessarily be a God in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since there is a need for God in the heart, there must be the existence of God in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If no God exists, we would never have such a craving in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all have an appetite for food.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the same way, we all have an appetite for God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It would be impossible to live if there was only an appetite for food but no food.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Likewise, it would be impossible to live if there was a capacity for God but no God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT GOD?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once an atheist rudely rebuked me in a loud voice: "You said that a man has the psychological need for a God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But there is no such thing, and I do not believe in it."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I said, "Well, do you mean to say that you never think about God?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In fact, even while you were talking, you were thinking about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that you do have a capacity for God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no one who has never thought about God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He may try not to think much about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since this thought is in you, there must be such an object outside of you."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE WORDS AND THE HEART</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A young man once came to me to argue about God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was vehemently against the existence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He gave me one reason after another for saying that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As he was enumerating the various reasons why God should not exist, I listened to him quietly without saying a word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then I said, "Although you insist that there is no God and support yourself with so many arguments, you have lost your case already."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He said, "What do you mean?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I went on to explain: "Your mouth can say as much as you want about there not being a God, but your heart is on my side."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He had to agree with me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although one can give all sorts of reasons in the head, there is a belief in the heart that no argument can defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A stubborn person may give a thousand and one reasons, but you can have the boldness to tell him, "You know better in your heart that there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why bother to look for evidence outside?"</S>
