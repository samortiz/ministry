   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>As the Son of God As God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Chapter one quotes the prophecies in the Old Testament to tell us that the Son, through whom God speaks, is God Himself v. 8 . The angels, however, are merely the servants of God and even of those who inherit God's salvation vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>6-7, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who inherit God's salvation are men.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, we are the masters, and the angels are our servants.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the Son of Man As Man</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Chapter two tells us that this very Christ, who is the Son of God and who is God Himself, one day became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This very God came into man to mingle Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By the incarnation of Christ the position and standard of man was very much uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The incarnation of Christ uplifted man's standard and position because God Himself became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Formerly, the angels could boast of their position in heaven, but now we can return the boast to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can say, "Angels, you do not have God within you, but we do.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God is not one with you, but God today is one with us!"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By the incarnation, God took the same position as man, and man shared the same position with God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the president of the United States came into our meeting and sat among us, everyone would feel uplifted in position, sharing the same rank with the president.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today, however, man and God share the same position, because God became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hebrews 2 tells us that one day this man, Jesus, who for a time was made a little inferior to the angels, resurrected and ascended to the third heaven and was crowned with glory and honor v. 7 . A man is now in heaven crowned with glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once again we can boast to the angels and say, "Angels, you are in heaven, but you are not crowned.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is now a man crowned in heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, who is higher, man or the angels?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Would you rather be a man or an angel?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We no longer should prefer to be angels.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should be fully satisfied to be a man, having Christ within us and being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Him we also are crowned with glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Moreover, He and we, we and He, have the same life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He has the divine life, and we do also.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is the Son of God, and we are the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are His brothers, and He is our elder Brother.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The angels, however, are merely our servants, but we are sons of God and brothers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By Christ's incarnation He put on the human nature, and through His resurrection and ascension we have His divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now if God says to us, "You are humans," we can reverently say, "Yes, but You too have the human nature."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If He says, "I have the divine nature," we can say, "Lord, we have the divine nature also."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the reason that man today is superior to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Moreover, one day Christ will bring all His dear ones, the sons of God, His many brothers, into glory v. 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this way, the first two chapters of Hebrews tell us that Christ as the Son of God, the very God Himself, through His incarnation, ascension, and glorification made Himself the same as we are and made us the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are human, and He made Himself human.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is divine, and He made us to have the divine life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since He is such a man, and at the same time God Himself, He is superior to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the message of Hebrews 1 and 2.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In chapter one Christ is God, and in chapter two He is man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is the God-man, the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not Neglecting So Great a Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Within this section there is the first warning.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The first four verses of chapter two exhort us to be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have so great a salvation that brings us into the nature of God and the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we neglect such a salvation, we will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Hebrew believers should not go back into Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Judaism at most there is God in name only, along with the angels, but there is no reality of God and nothing of the human nature uplifted into the divine nature and brought into the divine glory.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The great salvation mentioned in 2:3 is much higher than Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we neglect such a great salvation, we will lose much.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our Christ is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is the reality and glory of God, and He is superior to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, if we are one with Him, we also are superior to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have to tell the angels that we are superior and that they are merely our servants.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All the angels, regardless how wonderful they are, are only our servants, ministering to us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Acts 12 tells us that Peter had an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When Peter knocked at the door of the house of Mary, those within said, "It is his angel" v. 15 . We all have an angel as our servant, and sometimes the Lord may give us a number of angels to protect us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are superior to the angels because we are in Christ and Christ is superior to them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, there is no need to return to Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Let us forget Judaism and cling to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Christ is God not only in name but also in reality, and He is a man in the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are now one with Him, so both we and He are superior to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the first section of this book, the writer helped the Hebrew believers to drop Judaism by taking Christ as the superior One.</S>
