   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. NO UNCERTAIN SOUNDING OF THE TRUMPET IN THE LORD S MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For also if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for battle?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 Cor 14:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord s Ministry</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>the Sounding of the Trumpet</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>for the Army to Go to War</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Paul s word to the Corinthians in 1 Corinthians 14:8, he was referring to the matter of speaking in tongues with a definite interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He said that if there is not a definite interpretation of a person s tongue-speaking, this is like sounding the trumpet with an uncertain sound.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may think an item like tongue speaking is too small for our consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we have seen, another item that has been sounded is that there are two lines in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may think that these are small things which are not related to the Lord s Person, to His deity, to His divinity, or to His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Speaking in tongues with or without a definite interpretation and some feeling that there are two lines in the Lord s recovery may be considered by some as minor things which are not related to the major items in the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They have nothing to do with the Lord s headship or with the Lord s redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are not something modernistic which deny the authority of the Bible or deny God s existence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some of the so-called workers, the leading ones, like to think that they can take another line, not following the one line in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They may consider this and speaking in tongues without a definite interpretation small matters which we do not need to pay attention to.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To some extent I myself have had this kind of thought in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although I gave such a serious word that my toleration is over, some brothers may feel, not in a negative way, but in a very positive way concerning me, that they love me and do not think that I need to be that serious about little things such as these.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I had the same kind of thought in the past, but through my study I realized that in the New Testament the illustration of a trumpet being sounded to prepare others for battle is only used in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This illustration in 1 Corinthians is not used in relation to the person of Christ in His Godhead or to the crucial, eternal redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This illustration is used concerning a minor point, the interpretation of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let us read 1 Corinthians 14:6-8 to see the context of this illustration: But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation or in knowledge or in prophecy or in teaching?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even lifeless things, whether flute or harp, in giving a sound, if they give no distinction in the sounds, how will it be known what is played on the flute or on the harp?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For if indeed the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for battle?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>So also you, unless you give by the tongue an intelligible word, how will it be known what is being said?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For you will be speaking into the air.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is concerning the matter of speaking in tongues, something which we consider to be so small, that the Apostle Paul inserted this verse with the word battle in it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No one among us would consider a battle a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>An army that is fighting a battle needs the morale, a fighting unity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to maintain this morale even a little dissension concerning the smallest matter has to be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If that little dissenting talk is not killed, the morale will be annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There will be no more morale, and surely the army will lose the fight, the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This warns me concerning the seriousness of the Lord s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord s ministry is like the sounding of the trumpet for the army to go on to war Num 10:9; Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord s ministry is a matter of a battle 2 Tim 2:3 and note 1 Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God s Fighting Army</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to realize that the Lord s church today is a fighting army.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are doing something more serious than any battle on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are fighting against God s enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church is God s army, and this is fully revealed and illustrated in many aspects in Ephesians 6.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Ephesians is a book on the Body of Christ, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It tells us that the Body of Christ, the church, is the fullness of the One who fills all in all 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It also tells us that this church is the new man created in Christ on the cross 2:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, this church is the kingdom of God, the household of the very God 2:19 , and the wife of Christ, His counterpart 5:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul eventually tells us in Ephesians that the church, the Body of Christ, with such a tremendous status, is a warrior to fight against God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whatever Christ is and whatever Christ has done should be used and applied as aspects of the armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to wear Christ as our breastplate 6:14 and as our shield v. 16 . We have to have our loins girded with Christ v. 14 , and we have to wear Christ as a pair of shoes for our standing to fight the battle v. 15 . The church is not a mere group of people collected together.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The church is a universal and divine army fighting for God in the universe against His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In modern history there have been two world wars, but we must realize that the church today is undertaking a universal war.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The space of our war is much larger than today s space studied by scientists.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Most of their study is confined to a single galaxy, but many, many millions of galaxies and beyond form the space in which we are fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are fighting the enemy in the heavenlies, in the universal space.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our battle is great beyond measure.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are not undertaking a small battle merely for the United States or for the world.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our battle is universal.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Paul s speaking concerning the matter of interpretation of tongues, he considered that it was related to this universal battle that we are undertaking.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In his talk concerning the interpretation of tongues, he used an illustration the sounding of a trumpet for the battle.</S>
