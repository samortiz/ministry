   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Practical Truth</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John's word here is an accusation against the teaching of deputy authority in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the divine revelation in the holy Word, there is deputy authority in God's economy, both in the Old Testament, such as with Moses and the priests who taught the people the divine oracle, and in the New Testament, such as with the elders, who take care of the church 1 Tim 3:5; 5:17; Heb 13:17 , and the apostles, who establish the churches and teach the saints 2 Cor 10:8; 13:10; 1 Cor 4:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A local church is under the authority of Christ as the Head, represented by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, the saints in a local church should obey the elders Heb 13:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The churches as the Body of Christ are under their Head, Christ, represented by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, the churches should obey the apostles 2 Cor 2:9; 7:15; 10:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To obey the elders in a local church and to obey the apostles among the churches does not mean that the obeying one does not need to obey the Lord directly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When he is seeking the leading directly from the Lord, he should also take care of the elders in the local church, because he is living and working in the church as a part of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the churches are seeking the leading directly from the Lord, they should also take care of the apostles, because they are all living and working with the apostles in the churches as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether in a local church or among all the churches, we should be Body-conscious, taking care not only of the Head but also of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since we are living and working in the Body, we have the Body with the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We cannot have the Head without the Body; neither can we have the Body without the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should seek to obey the Head with a relationship to the Body, and we should also seek to obey the Body with a relationship to the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all need to realize that in our natural life we are very independent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So, to take care of obeying both the Lord and the elders or the apostles at the same time is not an easy thing for us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, we may unconsciously feel that the teaching concerning the obeying of God's deputy authority is overly stressed or even unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In any case, to say that there is no deputy authority of the Lord is surely unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fear within those who are not willing to obey the elders in a local church or the apostles in the churches might, according to their feeling, bring their conscience into bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Any kind of fear that causes the saints to feel bound in their conscience and not free to do whatever they feel led of the Lord is not needed or healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Such a fear might be due to the saints' independence, or to their unwillingness to be one with the elders, or to their holding of a view concerning the church life which is different from the view held generally by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If it is due to the saints' independence, then the saints need to learn how to live the Body life; if it is due to the saints' unwillingness to be one with the elders, then they need to learn more concerning how to be in one accord with the elders in the church life; if they are holding a different view than the church's view, then they need to learn more lessons that they may go along with the church or the churches in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Regardless of what the fear is due to, it is always better to obey the elders in a church or the apostles among the churches at the same time as one obeys the Lord, rather than to obey only the Lord without caring for the elders in the church or the apostles among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the saints need to be ushered into a Body-consciousness and to be helped to pay the price of the giving up of their independence, their freedom to be different, and their subjective view, so that the Body of Christ can be built up in the Lord's way.</S>
