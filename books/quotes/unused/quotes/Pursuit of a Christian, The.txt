Throughout the history of mankind, there have been varied opinions about this, but until now there is still no definitive answer
In addition to church history, Christians should know the proper Christian goal so that they may establish the proper Christian model
The Christian goal is truly a mystery in the universe because it has been hidden in a countless number of matters and things
If man receives God he will have the inner satisfaction joy and peace his eyes will be enlightened and all his problems will be resolved
Please remember that before the fall of man and his subsequent removal from God's presence, man was in fellowship with God
Music came into existence after man had lost the enjoyment of God due to his fall and removal from God's presence
It is used to describe a person who acts against principle for a moment's relief or comfort and thus brings endless sufferings upon himself
Their participation in all these forms of amusement proves that they have lost God and that there is a great distance between them and God
Whenever we ask others to provide us a little pleasure or sympathy, this proves that we do not have God-we have lost God
If we are still looking for water, this proves that we have not drunk to the full and that we are still thirsty
These kind of people do not like dancing, going to bars, or playing mah-jongg; they only enjoy seeing a lot of money in front of them
Although he no longer desires anything in his heart, his heart remains empty and needs to be occupied and filled with something
For this very reason, man becomes confused, his vision is blurred, and he is unable to discern his own inclination
Whether it is a strand of hair, a feather, or a handkerchief, whenever it comes into contact with the flypaper, it gets stuck
Man's fall resulted in two situations: one is that man fell into material things, and the other is that he fell into sins
Those who stress material enjoyment seek satisfaction and solace in the material world because they do not have God
They stress the enjoyment in food, clothing, housing, and transportation, and eventually they are overtaken by their lusts
Man exists in the world solely for his living, which is maintained by food, clothing, shelter, and transportation
Some manifest their lusts in a crude way without any cosmetics or adornment while others manifest their lusts in a refined and noble way
Those who worship Buddha chant and beg, hoping that the gods who bestow blessings and peace will respond to all their pleas
If a person wants to follow the Lord, he must sell all his possessions and give to the poor, and then he will have treasure in the heavens
In the New Testament, Paul, a man who knew God, said that material things are refuse, dung, and stinky, worthless things
Some are even bewildered and ask, 'Do you really mean to say that we should not care about our food and about our living?
God's salvation is to deliver us from the fallen condition of the material world, just as He has delivered us from our lusts
They did not care for anything other than Christ; they gave up their wealth and fame and were willing to suffer hunger and martyrdom
Another time, when Francis was meditating before God, someone teased him, saying that he was thinking about getting married
Air cannot get into a cup which is filled with water; the water must be poured out before air can get into the cup
We may say that Christ, the Bible, the church, and fellow Christians are four things in a Christian's possession
A Christian possesses these things not just in his mind; rather, he has these four things because he has the Lord Jesus living in him
In terms of the Body, its element is the enlargement of Christ; in terms of the members, their element is also Christ
If a person calls himself a Christian yet does not have Christ as an element in him, then he is a Christian in name but not in reality
The ending ianos, denoting an adherent of someone, was applied to slaves belonging to the great families in the Roman Empire
Disciples of Christ are those who have Christ within them as their life, their power, their preferences, and their everything
When others see us, we are just 'cups' outwardly, without any flavor, yet after a few sips of us, they have drunk of Christ as the 'tea'
If someone claims that he is a Christ-man yet does not have Christ in him, then he is the greatest deceiver in the world
Each one can decide according to his or her preference when to wake up, when to go to bed, what to eat, and when to come home
If the marital relationship is such how much more should our walk and living be since the Lord has entered into us and become united with us
After having Christ, we must always inquire of the Lord, seeking His approval in whatever we do in our daily living
Many foolish people do foolish things because they neglect the Lord who lives in them and care only for their own preferences and desires
Many people find it difficult to believe that God exists, but for us it is even more difficult to believe otherwise
There was a couple who had just been married, and the husband began to complain about his wife to others, saying, 'There is no one like her
They say things as they like, they play politics as they desire, and they treat others as they wish; they do not care a bit how Christ feels
All who are Christmen should always meditate on the words of the Bible so that they may be wise unto salvation be preserved and be protected
In our daily living, in matters great or small, we should search the Bible and find out what it says that we should do
If a tree stands alone on a high mountain, it cannot easily remain standing; if it grows in a dense forest, it cannot easily topple
A normal Christian in a locality should take the ground of that locality as the sphere in which to meet and serve with the saints there
When we have problems, we should inquire not only of the Lord and of the Bible, but we should also inquire of the saints
We should look into the matters with them to find some solutions either in the church meetings or through private fellowship
Sometimes because a church is big, it is not easy for the leading brothers to make decisions in matters related to the brothers and sisters
If someone in the church in Taipei is thinking about going to Taichung, he should ask where the church in Taichung meets
Sometimes we may feel that the meetings are too long and boring and do not realize that they are actually a great blessing to us
Every day we take our meals, but we do not realize the preciousness of food until we have been starved for three days
When we are hungry, we are not particular about what we are going to eat; at such a time everything is good to our taste
Whenever we touch the church, we touch a great matter; this will affect the way we take for our entire Christian life
Although intimacy may not be a sin, please remember that intimacy deadens our spirit and causes us to lose the Lord's presence
Once you go beyond the limit and your relationship with the saints becomes a friendship, then you must reject it
In addition we should further know how the Bible came into existence how it was handed down how it was translated and what its functions are
Because man understands only the human language, and because God desires to speak to man, God must use a language which man can understand
The universe is so mysterious and so great, yet it came into being through creation and is upheld and borne by Christ
Those who know God, however, can understand His revelation because they have the Spirit within and the Bible without
We all know that the voice in the receiver comes from someone who is outside the receiver but speaks through the receiver
The voice is breathed out by the singer, stored onto a record, and then it is played back through the record player
We all know that the voice and the words stored on the record are exactly the same as the voice and the words uttered by the singer
It was the same in the beginning when God breathed out His thoughts to be received into men and then spoken out by men
There were at least forty writers, yet they all wrote under the divine inspiration over a period of more than 1500 years
When the Lord Jesus was on earth, since printing had not yet been invented, the Bible had to be copied by hand on sheepskin
History tells us that they wrote on sheets made from the choicest sheepskin and exercised the greatest possible care in copying
They were required to wipe their pen before writing the name of God in any form, and to wash their whole body before writing Jehovah
The following four passages, however, were written in Aramaic: Jeremiah 10:11; Daniel 2:4-7:28; Ezra 4:8-6:18; and Ezra 7:12-26
The Bible in common use today, however, was not translated from the original manuscripts because they have all been lost
Of these three manuscripts, the oldest and most complete copy is known as the Vaticanus manuscript and is being kept in the Vatican Library
Later it was deposited in the Royal Library of Russia until 1933 when it was sold to the British Museum in London for 100000 pounds sterling
384 the church father Jerome undertook the revision of the Latin New Testament; his work of retranslating was completed in A
After the completion of its work, the committee transmitted all the texts from England to America by telegraph
During his stay, he translated the Bible into the Chinese language with the help of a Chinese helper by the name of Liang Ya-fa
Subsequently, various Chinese Bible versions came off the press, but nearly all of them were in classical Chinese
A year later, a joint convention of the missionary societies of various Protestant denominations in China was held in Shanghai
After twenty-eight years of laboring, in 1919, the entire Union Version was completed using the official Chinese language
Daily read one chapter of the New Testament and three chapters of the Old Testament; this is to read four chapters a day
More importantly, this will cause us to be nourished and supplied every day; we will not only increase in knowledge but also grow in life
In time, when you come back to that portion, you will spontaneously understand more and eventually understand it thoroughly
If we read the Bible in this way, the more we read, the more we will be helped and the more our spiritual life will grow
Today related to time the church has been on the earth for two thousand years related to space the church has spread over the whole globe
Just consider if an object were to pass through my hands and your hands and then through another two hundred hands, what would become of it?
They did not have many of the things that are found in the Bible, yet they had so many other things that are not found in the Bible
They had altered almost everything except the fundamental truths such as Jesus being our Savior and Jesus being the true God
The believers met at times in public squares, sometimes in the portico of Solomon, and at other times in their homes
The concept of building physical places for worship did not exist until the degradation of the church under Roman Catholicism
Those who are knowledgeable about architecture all agree that the best buildings and structures in Europe are the cathedrals
Peter's Cathedral in the Vatican was built at a cost of 90,000,000 pounds sterling, which is equivalent to several times that in dollars
The temple in the Old Testament was a physical building, and the temples or shrines of the Gentile idols were also physical structures
When the church was first raised up, the worship of God was 'neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem' but 'in spirit'
When the Lord began His recovery in China, Christians were raised up to take the way of the recovery in many major cities
They placed the bread and the cup on a table used for offering sacrifices, and in this way they worshipped and remembered the Lord
Today, however, it seems that we cannot break the bread or worship the Lord unless we have a piano and a table
Someone may say that in the Catholic Church the cathedrals are imposing, the sacred songs are solemn, and the bishops are awe-inspiring
It was marvelous to him but not to us because the early church was the same way-considering the physical things as nonessential
Rather, when the church has the presence of God with His life, power, and strength, this is really God's blessing
Sometimes the believers have a desire to meet outdoors, but some are concerned about not having a podium or a piano
We may have different functions and points of emphasis, but essentially your service and mine should not be different
Before they were saved, they lived for mammon, but from the day they were saved, they were separated from the world by the Lord
Basically, those who joined the church for rewards were not regenerated or saved and therefore could not serve God
When the number of such ones increased, some of them decided to bring the Judaic system and practice into Christianity
Some Christians saw the truth in the Bible concerning baptism-that a person should be baptized after believing in the Lord
Up to the present, in the Roman Catholic Church the priests still handle the sacred duties and serve God on behalf of the common people
On the one hand, the brother who says this shows that he cares for the souls of people, and we should be joyful about this
In degraded Christianity everyone cares only for his own affairs while turning over the service of God to a few pastors or clergymen
If there are eighteen hundred saints in the church but only two to three hundred are serving God, that is the degradation of the church
We must all be clear that in the church there is no one who rules and there is no one who specializes in prayer
The Catholic Church has become so great that she has a pope who has become the king of kings so that his commands cannot be altered
Although the pope cannot rule the whole earth, he does rule over the Catholic Church throughout the whole world
Please remember, whenever the church talks about procedures or regulations, then that church has already become degraded
The church does not have great wealth, and when the church has a little excess, it is distributed to the poor and the needy
We have many brothers and sisters who still do not have a place to live; they are still lacking in many things
We should not be rich before the Lord but live a simple church life, a life that is 'as poor yet enriching many' , just as Paul did
From the Scriptures we can see that according to God's will and ordination, as well as His salvation, a Christian is an extraordinary person
In such a current, people simply follow the flow in the world, even though they do not all follow the bad examples to do bad things
People in the world all go with the tide, but not the Christians, because they have received the Lord's salvation
Although many Christians know that they have been saved, they do not know where the difference lies between them and the unbelievers
Fish live in water not because they are odd but because they have a life that enjoys staying in water and that is also able to stay in water
Honestly speaking, as Christians, we should voluntarily set aside some of our possessions and share them with the poor and the needy
To him who wishes to sue you and take your tunic, yield to him your cloak also; and whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two'
According to the teaching and the principle shown in the Bible, resisting one another does not issue in peace and joy
The Bible rightly says that when brothers contend with one another, what they gain is dung, and they will not have joy
If we are not like this, there may be two problems: either we are not saved or the life within us is not adequately manifested
Christians, however, are reluctant to make it known and feel uncomfortable, even unhappy deep within, if it has been made known
Christians can praise God and be filled with joy only when they help others without making a public display and without being known
They may feel that they have not committed any sin or done anything wrong, yet their spirit cannot be uplifted
We can see that some brothers and sisters cannot pray because they act contrary to the nature of the life within them
In todays society whether in hospitals in schools in offices or in other organizations it is very difficult to find people who do not lie
Although others will not find fault in us, our spirit will be deadened, and we will not be able to pray or give praises to God
Christians must all be clear that this is not just a teaching or a principle in the Bible rather it is the peculiar nature of the life in us
To go against the tide means that, for instance, even though everyone believes it is all right to lie, we are troubled within
Others lie but we cannot-this is the distinction between us and the worldly people, and this is also our peculiarity
We are also knowledgeable, spiritual, and pious before God because Christ has increasingly gained ground in us
Unfortunately, this matter has long been neglected and even today has not been given sufficient attention by Christians
It used to be that Christ was Christ and we were we, but now Christ has come into us and has been joined with us
We may have already been saved for a period of time, yet we think it strange when asked if Christ is living in us
We all know that our sins have been forgiven and that when we die we will be with God, but we may have never heard about Christ living in us
Before we were saved, we were merely human beings, but on the day we believed in the Lord and were saved, Christ came into us
From the time we were saved, we have been preoccupied with improving ourselves, hoping that we will be better than before
God's hope is that the more Christ lives in us, the more He will be able to gain ground in us and be expressed through us
Every saved one hopes that God will grant him more strength to help him reform himself so that he can do good deeds
God hopes that Christ can have more ground in us, while we hope that we can improve ourselves; these two hopes are totally different
From the day we were saved, God's salvation is simply the Lord Jesus Himself coming into us and being mingled with us
Before the day comes when we fully enjoy God's complete salvation, our Christian life is a life of contradictions
We have said that Christians possess four things-Christ, the Bible, the church, and fellow Christians-and that Christians are also peculiar
When a person first becomes a Christian, he begins to experience a life of countless contradictions from morning to evening
Strangely enough, from the day he is saved and becomes a Christian, he begins to experience inner contradictions
It seems that whenever he has a certain feeling, he will have another feeling, and the two feelings usually are contrary to one another
In the early stage of salvation a normal Christian is filled with contradictions if this is not the case perhaps he has not yet been saved
When the argument is getting out of control, something within them will bother them and not allow them to go on quarreling
Gradually, we learn that whenever we have a sense within, the best thing is to kneel down and pray until we are one with the inward sense
Rather, the more we pray, the more we sense the presence of God; the more we pray, the sweeter His presence is
At that stage, the degree of contradiction diminishes because he has matured to a point where he is totally lost in Christ
After we are saved, we usually experience certain contradictions because Christ in us wants us to gain Him, and He also wants to gain us
Because we do not know His intention and are not accustomed to it, the more we pursue Him, the more contradictions we experience
When our prayer times are very good and our fellowship with the Lord increases, the contradictions during the day increase
If we have good prayer times and have good fellowship with the Lord, our contradictions will definitely increase
All confused ones are ones with contradictions, and the ones with contradictions are those who have Christ in them as their Lord
After receiving instructions from them on how to resolve the difficulty, he returned home to act according to their advice
If he had done according to what the two elderly brothers had advised, the outcome would have been totally different
The two brothers considered the matter according to common experience and although their consideration was right the Holy Spirit intervened
If we have a problem before the Lord and our fellowship with Him has been interrupted, the contradictions will disappear
Perhaps we have stayed away from sin, yet we have not committed ourselves to Him to be mingled with Him and be lost in Him
We have to remember that the more a saved person pursues the Lord, the more he goes through these kinds of contradictions
Before reaching that stage, however, we have to remember that a Christian is definitely filled with contradictions
When a Christian lives a normal life before God, he will display certain characteristics that will distinguish him from other people
Titus 2:14 says that God redeemed us from all lawlessness and purified to Himself a particular, or peculiar, people
If a person who has received God's salvation lives in such a salvation to be a normal Christian, his living will appear peculiar to others
As those who have received God's salvation, Christians in their normal living are considered peculiar by the world
The more a person loves the Lord, the more he looks peculiar before men and experiences contradictions within himself
Another example is when a non-Christian receives an invitation to a banquet, and he begins to consider whether he should go
If we want to be those who follow Christ, we have to follow the sense in our innermost part because that is where Christ dwells
After we have received God's salvation, this salvation abides in us and requires us to have our starting point from within
It is not a matter of whether we like or dislike this clothing; rather, it is a matter of having a sense of disapproval while we are praying
Regardless of anything else, a normal Christian must take his inner sense as the starting point of his daily walk
We all know that the skin of the soles of our feet is hardened and thickened through much walking and consequently becomes insensitive
Perhaps some weddings are from Babylon, while others may even be from the bottomless pit; not all weddings originate from Jerusalem
Since we are saved, we need to bring every matter before the Lord and pray, 'Lord, since You live in me, what would You like to do'?
Many Christians who are getting married focus on the outward considerations rather than the inward peace as their starting point
The fact that they have to ask for forgiveness is a strong indication that they did not do things according to the inner sense
Though, when some older ones hear about two young people getting married, they would eagerly offer their advice even before being asked
In order to be a normal Christian before God we need to learn to do everything from within, from our innermost part
Do not draw up a set of human regulations for them do not ask them to do things according to our insight and do not make decisions for them
Human views human methods Christian traditions and even biblical teachings are all outward if they have not passed through the inner sense
Some have been saved and have received blessings from God, but they live neither in their spirit nor in God's blessings
In conclusion, Christians are peculiar before men, contradictory within themselves, and live in their deepest part before God
Some Christians encountered many difficulties and made many mistakes when they first began to walk on this path
Sometimes a person prays a little bit and eagerly desires to be heard by others or be followed by others with more prayers
In the Middle Ages in France, there was a renowned preacher who was well praised and whose preaching was very well received
He found a wooden board and placed two children on one end, himself on the other end, and began to play seesaw with them
It is because outwardly a spiritual man is very plain and, like Paul, may even be weak in bodily presence and contemptible in speech
He has the spiritual weightiness within, and he is a person who conducts himself in Christ and who lives before God
If a Christian walks like the worldly people, even though he may not be a false Christian, he is surely a questionable Christian
If a Christian lives before God and maintains fellowship with Him, his inward sense and outward behavior usually are in contradiction
In other words, a proper Christian always experiences contradictions between his inward sense and his outward behavior
A Christian who acts and moves from within is spontaneous, ingenuous, and honest, without outward pretense and imitation
Whatever he does in his daily walk, he does it out of his innermost part, because that is where the Spirit of God dwells
Inwardly he is in the light and he is good, while outwardly he is spontaneous and does not engage in mere outward activities
His inward being always disagrees with his outward conduct and he constantly has a sense of contradiction between the inward and the outward
Besides being peculiar being contradictory and taking his innermost part as the starting point a Christian is led by the Lord in all things
A saved one must be led by God in all things, such as how he should behave, how he should walk, and how he should live
In other words, they pray and inquire about important matters but not about the trivial things in their daily living
A normal and healthy Christian is one who lives with the Lord and who brings everything, both great and small, before Him
Parents are not happy if their child is so capable in doing everything that he does not need them all day long
Bosses dislike to be troubled by their employees; parents, however, are not bothered by children continually coming to them
A husband and wife are the best example; after they have been married a long time, they begin increasingly to look alike
After he gave the first message, many were astonished at how his intonation and gestures were exactly like mine
Similarly, if a Christian constantly seeks after God and has fellowship with God, then God's nature will spontaneously become his
If we have fellowship with God daily, the nature and elements of God will spontaneously be constituted into our being
In his autobiography he said that before he would do anything, he would ask God if a certain matter pleased Him
He would ask if God wanted him to do it, because God might want something to be done in the universe but not necessarily through him
When Muller was clear that God wanted him to do it, the third thing he would do was to ask God when He wanted him to do it
Muller would bring these five points before God and would carefully ask, 'O God, is it Your intention to do this thing?
There was a Christian boss who, while transacting business with others, would often say, 'I have to go back and consult my Boss'
Otherwise, there is definitely something wrong with this Christian, even if people perceive him as right and proper
They will ask, 'Is this Christian inside or outside of God, or perhaps has he not yet entered into the grace of God'?
Oftentimes a potter will pick up some unmolded clay, pat it gently, shave off the excess, and make straight the crooked angles
We should not use our believing in the Lord as a means to obtain some blessings according to our will and not according to His will
In order to be led by the Lord we need to conduct ourselves in the world not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God
Perhaps we are afraid that if our abilities are demolished, we will not have anything and will not be able to do anything
We have to absolutely consecrate to God our family and our whole being with all that we have and all that we are
We do not have to rigidly kneel down to pray, but we have to inquire of God inwardly, bringing the matter before Him to discuss it with Him
In summary, Christians possess four things-Christ, the Bible, the church, and fellow Christians as their companions
