   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this lesson we will continue to see Jesus Christ as the center of the New Testament, from His resurrection to His eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I. HIS RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Jesus died and was buried for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then very early on the first day of the week, the day after the Sabbath, He resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At that time there was a great earthquake, and an angel of the Lord descended out of heaven and came and rolled away the stone which was against the entrance to the tomb Matt 28:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ s resurrection is crucial to the accomplishment of God s divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Its significance is profound and its contents extensive.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this lesson we can give only a brief account as follows:</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. The Process of His Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Peter 3:18 unveils what happened when the Lord Jesus died on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The second half of the verse says that He was put to death in flesh, but made alive in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The crucifixion put Christ to death only in His flesh, not in His spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His spirit did not die at the cross when His flesh did; His spirit rather became more active with the power of God s life, so that in this empowered spirit He went to Tartarus, the deep pit, to the fallen and imprisoned angels to proclaim God s victory through His incarnation in Christ and Christ s death in the flesh over Satan s scheme to derange the divine plan 1 Pet 3:19 and notes .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>While the Lord Jesus was being put to death in the flesh, because His spirit became active by the empowering of God s life, He was resurrecting at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Roman soldiers outwardly were executing the death penalty on Jesus, the Triune God the Father, Son, and Spirit was also doing the work of resurrection in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the beginning of the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then, His divine power of resurrection set His soul free from Hades and enabled His body to leave the tomb; hence, His whole being spirit, soul, and body was resurrected Acts 2:31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His resurrection began with His spirit, passed through His soul, and consummated in His body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>B. The Achievements of His Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The resurrection of the Lord Jesus was an exceedingly great accomplishment of His eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The main achievements may be divided into seven items:</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First, Christ s resurrection was God s vindication and approval of Him and His work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Jews who persecuted Him said that the words He spoke and the things He did were a blasphemy to God and that He was liable to death John 5:16-18; Matt 26:64-66 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They therefore killed Him on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God, however, raised Him from the dead Acts 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was God s vindication and approval, not only before the Jews but also before the whole universe, of Him and His work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, He was also raised because of our justification Rom 4:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was a great accomplishment of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Second, Christ s resurrection was a sign of His universal success.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without resurrection, all that He had achieved before His resurrection would be nullified with His death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, He had authority to lay down His life, and He had authority to take it again John 10:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, His rising up from among the dead is a sign indicating that what He had done prior to His death was successful and that it has an eternal efficacy in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Third, Christ s resurrection was also His victory over death, including Satan, Hades, and the grave Acts 2:24, 31; Heb 2:14; Rev 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the cross He tasted death on behalf of everything Heb 2:9 , nullified death 2 Tim 1:10 , and destroyed and cast out Satan John 12:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without resurrection, however, He could not show His victory over death including Hades and the grave and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Fourth, Christ s resurrection was His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Through His resurrection, His divinity was released from the shell of His humanity which concealed His glory, enabling Him with His humanity to enter into the divine glory Luke 24:26; 1 Cor 15:43 ; hence, God glorified Him in resurrection Acts 3:13, 15a .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Fifth, in His resurrection Christ was made the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was God who is the Spirit John 1:1; 4:24 , incarnated John 1:14 , taking the form of human flesh Phil 2:6-7; Rom 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Through His death and resurrection He was transfigured to become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b , that He might impart God s life to His believers John 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sixth, in His resurrection Christ was born as the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was the only begotten Son of God from eternity John 1:18 ; then He was incarnated and was born to be the Son of Man John 1:14 , bringing God into man that divinity might be mingled with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In resurrection He was begotten in His humanity to be the Son of God, that is, the firstborn Son of God Acts 13:33; Rom 8:29 , bringing man into God that humanity might be mingled with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In His flesh He was altogether a man; He was the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His humanity needed to be begotten as the Son of God through death and resurrection that He might be the firstborn Son of God among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In His divinity He became flesh to be born as the Son of Man; in His humanity He entered into resurrection to be begotten as the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the twofold result of His two births in time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Seventh, in His resurrection Christ caused His believers to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ s resurrection was the germination of the new creation, and in this new creation God regenerated us 1 Pet 1:3 that we might become the many sons of God Heb 2:10 to be God s new creation in resurrection, which is also the newborn child mentioned by the Lord in John 16:21.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The many sons of God regenerated through Christ s resurrection are the many grains as His propagation, produced by Him as the grain of wheat that fell into the earth and died John 12:24 , and made into one bread to be His Body 1 Cor 10:17 , His church Eph 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He, the Firstborn from among the dead and the Firstborn of God among many brothers, became in resurrection the Head of the Body, the church Col 1:18 .</S>
