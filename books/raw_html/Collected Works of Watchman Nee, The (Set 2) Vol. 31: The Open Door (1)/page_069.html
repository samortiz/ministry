<h2 class="head2">Ning-Hai, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Respected brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>We received The Open Door today and learned that the brothers and sisters are still laboring to bear the responsibility of the holy work for the Lord's name. We should sing Hallelujah together and praise the Lord Jesus Christ for His grace! We have also been comforted. The war has caused us to remember our brothers and sisters in the assembly in Shanghai. We now know that God has protected His children according to His promise. Enclosed, please find X dollars for printing costs. We also ask that you continue to send us subsequent issues of The Open Door. Please read 2 Thessalonians 1:2 to the end of the chapter.</p><p>Tu Yun-sien, Ge Shi-lien<br />February 2<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Lan-Si, Chekiang Province</h2><p>To Brother Tsi-yi in the Lord:</p><p>Lan-Si is still peaceful. Last Lord's Day, when we were preaching the message in the meeting, bombing occurred, but we continued the meeting as usual. We can say that no one was frightened. Praise the Lord Jesus Christ because He surrounds us with His grace and disciplines us with His authority. Psalm 46:10 says, "Be still and know that I am God." May we be able to keep the commandment of this word and testify that we are His children. I have already received The Open Door. I hope you continue to send it in the future. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Ma Chuan-foo<br />January 25</p><h2 class="head2">Sin-Chang, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Lan:</p><p>I received the card and the second issue of The Open Door. Thank you. Please do not worry about me. I am enclosing an order form. Please continue to send the publication. Brother Lu Kui-tsao left on his return trip to Shanghai this morning. He intends to either get into the artificial limb business or repair shoes. I have been back in Sin-Chang for almost six months now. I see eye patients daily. I have gone into the countryside to hold meetings several times and have seen the Lord's blessing. I really want to return to Shanghai, but I am not clear about the Lord's arrangement, so I am waiting. Our area has now become part of the war zone. Please pray for me. May you have peace in the Lord. Greet Brother Watchman and Sister Ruth. Please greet the assembly in Hankow.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Yu Cheng-hwa<br />January 15<br />[Address omitted]</p>
