   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONDEMNATION OF THE CONSCIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Whenever there is something wrong either with God, with man, or even with ourselves, our conscience condemns us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If, for example, I tell a lie to a brother, immediately there will be a condemnation in my conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The condemnation of the conscience must be dealt with right away; otherwise, it becomes an offense.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Condemnation is right temporarily; it is normal in a negative sense.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, we should not have condemnation in our conscience all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we do, it becomes an offense, a blame, or a charge in the legal sense.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, whenever we have condemnation, we must deal with it by confessing and by applying the cleansing of the redeeming blood.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must say, "Lord, forgive me."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we deal with that wrongdoing by applying the blood, the condemnation is dealt with, and it is over.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If, however, we do not deal with the condemnation but rather live in it, it will become an offense and a blame within us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This will hinder, frustrate, and even damage our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As long as we are in the old nature walking on this earth, we are not perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, to have some condemnation is normal, in a negative sense.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, we should have no offense.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must have a conscience void and clear of offense.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not deal with condemnation right away, our conscience will be spoiled.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We will not have a conscience void of offense; rather, we will have a conscience with offense.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I say again, this will damage our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE KEENNESS OF THE CONSCIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Concerning the conscience, there is a difference between sensitivity and keenness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You may say that I am splitting hairs, but some times we have to split hairs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the nuclear scientists did not split something smaller than a hair, we would not have nuclear power.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Keenness is right; with the conscience there should be keenness, not sensitivity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sensitivity is abnormal, while keenness is normal.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I do not want to be a sensitive person, but I would like to be a keen person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To say that a sister is sensitive is not a good description, but for a brother to be keen is a good qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The consciousness of our conscience must be keen, but it may become too much so.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When it becomes too much, the conscience is sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To be keen is at a normal level, but to be sensitive is over the level.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we seek the Lord, deal with our conscience, and are faithful to the consciousness of our conscience, our conscience will be keen and tender.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is right; we all need a keen and tender conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, we must be careful not to go too far, or our conscience will become sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The worldly people and even the Christians who do not seek the Lord and walk in spirit are careless in their feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even if they tell a lie, they do not care; they have no feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many times they are even happy when they lie, because they can do it successfully.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After we are saved in a proper way, however, there is the consciousness in our conscience that we cannot tell lies.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we tell a lie, right away there is a sense in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then the more we go on with the Lord, the more we have a consciousness in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Right after we are saved, we know not to tell lies, but we may still have some freedom to speak certain other things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But after we love the Lord, seek Him, and learn to walk in the spirit, the ruling, reigning, and governing in our conscience becomes stricter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then we not only do not have the freedom to tell lies, but we also do not have the freedom to speak whatever we want to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to go along with the inner sense not to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we do not go along with the inner sense and speak something against the inner sense, even if what we speak is true and is good, we will be under condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more we walk with the Lord and follow Him in the spirit, the keener our conscience will be.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is right and good.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At this point, however, there is the possibility that our conscience will become sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It may seem that we have to say something, but we may have the sense to be careful, that to say something is wrong, so we do not say it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we do not say it, however, we may still have the sense that we need to say it; to not say it is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then we do not know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we speak, there is condemnation, and if we do not speak, there is accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is beyond the proper level.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is sensitivity, and it is abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When a brother or a sister stands in the meeting, we may sense that he or she has learned the lesson of dealing with the conscience but has become too sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A brother may say, "I'm afraid I am going to say something wrong, but I'm afraid if I do not say it, I will also be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I don't know whether or not I should speak."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This kind of sensitivity bothers us very much.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If a radio is too sensitive, it does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Similarly, our spirit is very delicate, like the filament in a lightbulb.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If it is only a little wrong, it will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The conscience is more delicate than the fellowship and the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is easy to have a conscience too dull or too sensitive, but it is rather hard to keep our conscience always so keen.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we do keep it keen, it will operate like a good radio.</S>
