<h1 class="title">THE EIGHT STAGES<br />
OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE IN ROMANS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 3:9, 20, 24; 5:11-12, 19; 6:3-6; 7:18; 8:2, 4-6, 28-29; 12:2-5</h1>
<p>In this chapter I am burdened to speak concerning Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to the Romans. Readers of the book of Romans know quite well that this book reveals the stages of the Christian life. Among the sixty-six books of the Bible, it is this book that gives us a clear picture of the Christian life from its beginning to its maturity. If we are going to be normal and sound Christians, we have to know clearly the eight stages of the Christian life that are revealed to us in this book.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRST STAGE&mdash;<br />
SINFUL AND UNDER GOD&rsquo;S CONDEMNATION</h2>
<p>The first stage of the Christian life in the book of Romans is that of a man who is sinful and is condemned to death under the righteous judgment of God (1:1&mdash;3:20). This is the stage into which we were all born. Before we became Christians, we were sinful persons. As such, we were condemned to death by the righteous God. It was while we were in this stage that we became Christians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SECOND STAGE&mdash;<br />
BEING JUSTIFIED AND REGENERATED</h2>
<p>In the second stage, we see a man who has been justified through the redemption of Christ, has been accepted by God, and is now boasting because of the hope of the glory of God (3:21&mdash;5:11). Originally, this man was under the condemnation of God. Now, however, there is no more condemnation because he has been justified through Christ&rsquo;s redemption (3:24; cf. 5:16). As a result, this man has become a person who is full of joy and boasts because of the hope of the glory of God (v. 2). In this stage, we who were once under God&rsquo;s condemnation are saved, justified, and regenerated.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE THIRD STAGE&mdash;<br />
REALIZING THAT IN ADAM WE HAVE SIN AND DEATH</h2>
<p>In the third stage of the Christian life as seen in Romans, we see a saved and regenerated person who realizes that he was originally born in Adam and has thus inherited sin and death (5:12-21). After we have been born again, we may, perhaps very quickly, come to the point where we realize that because we were born in Adam, we are sinners and are destined to die. Coming to this realization is the third stage of the Christian life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOURTH STAGE&mdash;<br />
REALIZING THAT WE HAVE BEEN<br />
BAPTIZED INTO CHRIST</h2>
<p>The sixth chapter of Romans presents to us the fourth stage of the Christian life. When we realize that we are in Adam and therefore have sin and death, we also realize that we have been baptized into Christ. Originally, we were in Adam; now we are in Christ. We were born in Adam (cf. 5:17; 1 Cor. 15:22), but we have been baptized into Christ (Rom. 6:3; Gal. 3:27). On the day that we received the Lord Jesus as our personal Savior and were baptized, we were put into Christ. Whereas in Adam we received sin and death, in Christ we have righteousness and life (Rom. 5:17-18). Righteousness is versus sin, and life is versus death.</p>
<p>We as Christians have been not only regenerated but also transferred out of Adam into Christ. This transfer is similar to a transfer out of one house or building into another. We have &ldquo;moved&rdquo; out of Adam into Christ. We are no longer persons who are in Adam but persons who are in Christ. The old man, the old nature, and the old life have been crucified on the cross (Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20). They have been put to an end.</p>
<p>If you are a Christian, sooner or later there will come a day when the Holy Spirit will make you realize the glorious fact that you, on the day of your baptism, were transferred out of Adam into Christ. I believe that when you see this glorious fact, you will say, &ldquo;Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! I am now in Christ!&rdquo; Our being in Christ is a glorious fact. Apparently, we are in Los Angeles or some other location, but actually we are in Christ. Christ is not only our life; He is our realm and our sphere (Rom. 8:1; Eph. 1:3). Sin and death were once our inheritance, but now we are in Christ, who is our sphere and our everything.</p>
<p>When the Lord revealed this glorious and precious fact to me in 1932, I was beside myself before God. I do not encourage you to try to repeat my experience. However, when you see the glorious fact that you are now in Christ, you will not be able to keep yourself silent. You will be beside yourself. You will say, &ldquo;Hallelujah! Praise the Lord that I am now in Christ!&rdquo; Although the phrase <em>in Christ</em> is composed of just two little words, the fact of being in Christ is not small. It would be good if you would frame these two words and hang them on your wall. Hallelujah! We are in Christ! What a glory!</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Practical Way to Live in the Mingling of God with Man &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
