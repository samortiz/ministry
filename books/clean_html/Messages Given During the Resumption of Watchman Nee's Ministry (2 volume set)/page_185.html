<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>At Home in the Fellowship of the Body</H2><P>The Body is not a teaching; it is a life. Anyone who acts contrary to the demand of this life will not feel comfortable or be at ease. This life not only demands that we love and be patient; it also demands that we behave as Body Christians. Twenty years ago, God might have tolerated your being an independent Christian. But all those who want to meet God's demands today feel the need of fellowship, the Body fellowship. Once a person is in this fellowship, he feels at home. The Christian life is a matter of life; everything issues from the demand of this life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Offering Up Everything for the Body Life</H2><P>I was saved twenty-three years ago. At that time I did have the opportunity to make money. Yet, when money came into my hands, after a few months I did not have the peace.</P><P>In reading the history of the early martyrs, we find a story about a group of soldiers who once rounded up some Christians in order to torture them. One Christian could not stand the pressure and withdrew. But a soldier who saw the glorious expressions on the faces of the martyrs ran up and asked to fill in the place of the one who had withdrawn.</P><P>From today on, if you are still an independent Christian, you will not feel comfortable. This is not simply a demand of love, it is a demand of life. All those who will not offer up themselves will go away sorrowing, just as the young ruler did (Matt. 19:21-22). All those who offer up themselves will say, "Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!" Every time you meet God's demand, He will become your strength. Today, we need to meet all of God's demands. If you only meet part of His demands, He will not work for you. Only when you meet the Lord's full demands will He work for you.</P><P>One sister hoarded many legs of ham in her house. The Lord constrained her to consecrate. When she took up one leg, she felt that it was too big and tried to change for a smaller one. When she took up the second one, she still felt that it was too big. When she picked up the third one, she still felt that it was too big. In desperation she said to Satan, "Satan, if you say one more time that this is too big, I am going to give every one of them away!"</P><P>God's commandment to the Israelites was that they first had to put their feet into the waters of the Jordan before the waters would open up and the power would come. Brothers and sisters, give yourselves boldly to the Lord! Do not worry about anything any longer!</P>
