WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES</h2>
<p>Verse 6 says, &ldquo;&lsquo;For whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives.&rsquo;&rdquo; This is a quotation from Proverbs. It reveals the purpose of the Lord&rsquo;s discipline.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Discipline Being the Arrangement of Love</h2>
<p>God does not have the spare time to deal with all the people of the world. He disciplines only those whom He loves. He disciplines us because He loves us. He disciplines us because He wants to make us vessels. God has no time to discipline everyone in the world, but He disciplines His own children because He loves them. Therefore, discipline is God&rsquo;s provision of love. Love arranges the environment that we should be in. We call this arrangement His discipline. Love measures everything that comes our way. It orders the things that we encounter in our daily life. This measurement is His discipline. Discipline is for our greatest profit and for bringing us to the loftiest goal in God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And He scourges every son whom He receives.&rdquo; All those who are disciplined have the ground to say that they are received by God. Scourging is not a sign of God&rsquo;s rejection; it is a proof of His acceptance. I say again, God does not have the time to deal with everyone; He wants to spend His time on the sons whom He loves and receives.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Discipline Being the Father&rsquo;s Education</h2>
<p>Once you become a Christian, you should be prepared to accept discipline from God&rsquo;s hand. If you are not His child, God will let you go. He will allow you to live an undisciplined life and walk your own way. But once you have accepted the Lord Jesus as your Savior, once you are born of God and have become His child, you have to prepare yourself for His discipline. No father has the time to discipline another man&rsquo;s child. Whether his neighbor&rsquo;s son is good or bad is not of his concern. A good father, however, will always discipline his own son in a definite way. He will deal with his son strictly according to guidelines that he has set in his mind. He will not discipline his son in a mindless and haphazard way. He will train his son according to a few objectives, namely, honesty, diligence, long-suffering, and noble aspirations. The father puts together a certain curriculum to discipline his son. He molds his son into a certain character. In the same way, since the day we were saved, God has been arranging a curriculum for us. He wants us to learn certain lessons so that we will be conformed to His nature. He wants us to be like Him in many things. This is why He arranges, disciplines, and scourges. His goal is to make us a certain kind of person.</p>
<p>At the very beginning of his Christian life, a child of God must realize that God has prepared many lessons for him. He has made many provisions in the environment and has ordered many things, experiences, and sufferings for the purpose of producing a certain kind of character and disposition. This is what God is doing today. He wants to build up a certain kind of character in us, and He does it by ordering all kinds of circumstances to come our way.</p>
<p>The minute we become Christians, we have to realize that God&rsquo;s hand is guiding us in all things. The ordained circumstances will come, and the scourgings will come. As soon as we get off the right way, His scourges will be upon us and will goad us back to the way. Every child of God should be prepared to accept God&rsquo;s disciplinary hand. God disciplines us because we are sons. God does not waste His time on others. He has no time to discipline those who are not His beloved sons. God has no time to reprove those who are not yet accepted as sons. Scourging and discipline are expressions of God&rsquo;s love and acceptance. Only Christians can have a share in God&rsquo;s scourging and discipline.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages for Building Up New Believers, Vol. 3 &nbsp; pg 52</div><br></body></html>
