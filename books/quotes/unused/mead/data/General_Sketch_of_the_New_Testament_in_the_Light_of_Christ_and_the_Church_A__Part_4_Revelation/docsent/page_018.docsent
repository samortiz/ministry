   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SEVENTH TRUMPET</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 11:14 marks the beginning of the seventh trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It reads, The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is coming quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second woe is the sixth trumpet, while the third woe is a part of the seventh trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 15 continues, And the seventh angel trumpeted; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the time the seventh trumpet sounds, the mystery of God will be finished, and the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verses 16-18 say, And the twenty-four elders who sit before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshipped God, saying, We thank You, Lord God the Almighty, He who is and who was, because You have taken Your great power and have reigned.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And the nations became angry, and Your wrath came, and the time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to give the reward to Your slaves the prophets and to the saints and to those who fear Your name, to the small and to the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Your wrath in verse 18 is the wrath of the seven bowls, the final wrath of God on the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In addition, at the close of this age, before the millennium, the dead will be judged concerning who should share in the resurrection of life before the millennium and who should be left to the resurrection of condemnation after the millennium at the judgment of the great white throne.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The giving of the reward to His slaves the prophets occurs before the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the start of the thousand years the Lord will reward His servants, and at the end of the thousand years the Lord will judge the resurrected dead.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Destroying those who destroy the earth is carried out in part in Revelation 16 to 18.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord destroys the religious Babylon, for example, in chapter seventeen and the material Babylon in chapter eighteen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By this we can see that the seventh trumpet includes many matters, even the things into eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE SCENE IN HEAVEN AFTER THE TRUMPETING</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>OF THE SEVENTH TRUMPET</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Revelation 11:19 is a crucial verse, which says, And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple; and there were lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and great hail.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The lightnings, voices, thunders, and earthquake correspond exactly to 16:18, indicating that these two verses refer to the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Careful students of the Bible realize that the book of Revelation with twenty-two chapters has two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first eleven chapters form one section, and the last eleven form another.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In chapter four there is a throne in heaven with a rainbow; the prophecy in the first section is under the vision of this throne.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In chapter eleven, however, there is another vision, not of the throne but of the temple in heaven, and not with a rainbow but with an ark.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The throne with a rainbow is the source and center of the prophecy of the first section of this book, while the temple with the ark of testimony is the source and center of the prophecy of the second section.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we have seen, the throne refers to God s authority, and the rainbow refers to God s covenant concerning the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, the first section of the prophecy of this book tells us that the very God who is on the throne with authority is about to execute His judgment on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, while judging this earth, He still remembers His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE SECOND SECTION OF REVELATION,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>GIVING DETAILS CONCERNING GOD S ETERNAL PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The second section of the prophecy of Revelation is not a direct continuation of the first section.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It may be compared to Genesis 2, which is not a direct continuation of Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Genesis 1 gives a complete record of God s creation in a general way, but more details are needed in order to show us God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In chapter one alone it is difficult to see the eternal purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These details are in Genesis 2, which contains many figures, telling us that man was created with three parts in order to partake of the tree of life so that he will be transformed to be gold, bdellium pearl , and onyx, the precious materials for the building up of the New Jerusalem as the eternal Eve, the eternal wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The prophecy in the first section of Revelation unveils matters extending into eternity, but it only gives a general record of how God, who is on the throne in the heavens, comes to judge the earth to clear up the situation that He may reign on the earth for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It does not show us the purpose of God in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, there is the need of a supplement, the second section of this book, to give us details concerning God s eternal purpose and how God will fulfill His purpose as the One who dwells in the temple with His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now God is not only the One on the throne but also the One in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is not only the One with a rainbow but the One with the ark of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first section of Revelation shows us God s judgment to clear up the things on the earth, based on the fact that He is the unique One with authority on the throne and a rainbow as a reminder to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The second section, however, speaks not merely of God s judgment but of how God has an eternal purpose to build up a temple as a habitation for Himself with Christ, the ark of the testimony, as the content.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God is the One who dwells in the temple with the testimony for His expression and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the second section speaks of God doing things to prepare a habitation, a temple, for Himself that He may have His testimony within it as its content.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the first part of the prophecy of this book, from chapter four to chapter eleven, we cannot realize what God is seeking after.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can only see that God, as the One on the throne with the rainbow, is judging to clear up the situation on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the second section, however, we can trace what God is seeking after.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He desires to have a habitation with His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now He is in the temple, but one day the temple will be replaced by a city.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God is not satisfied with the temple in which He dwells, so He is preparing another, bigger habitation, which is the city of New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this city there is no more temple 21:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the temple in 11:19 there is not a rainbow but the ark of testimony, that is, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ, the testimony of God today, is in the temple in the heavens, but God needs to work Him into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then the city will take the place of the temple in the eternity to come, and Christ will be the very ark of testimony in that city.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today this ark of testimony is in the temple, but God s intention is to work this ark from the temple into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the central thought of the second part of this prophecy.</S>
