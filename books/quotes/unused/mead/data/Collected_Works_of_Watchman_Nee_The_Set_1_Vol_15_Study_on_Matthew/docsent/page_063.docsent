   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MATTHEW CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The words "there are some" in Matthew 16:28 refer to Peter, James, and John.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"His kingdom" refers to the kingdom of the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The kingdom of God lasts for eternity, while the kingdom of the Son of God refers only to the heavenly part of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here, it is the kingdom of the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>See Matthew 13:41 and Psalm 8.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Revelation 3:21 mentions two thrones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The throne in which we will participate is the throne of the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>See Revelation 1:13, where the Lord is the Son of Man .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"In His kingdom" refers to the glory in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why does the preceding portion call for self-denial?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When will one see the realization of gaining the soul through losing it, and losing the soul through saving it?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"For the Son of Man is to come" v. 27 . The preceding portion mentions death and resurrection; here, in verse 27, it mentions His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What does His coming mean?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 28 is an explanation of this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Peter, James, and John were with the Lord on three special occasions: in the house of Jairus, on the mount of transfiguration, and in Gethsemane.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This chapter reveals the beauty of the kingdom of the heavens; what happened was not a type but the real kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First it was revealed and then was taken back again.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 2 Peter 1:16, Peter mentioned the "coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This proves that it was the actual coming of the kingdom of the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"Some...shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These three persons had indeed seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 1: "And after six days Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and brought them up to a high mountain privately."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"And after six days."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Works and battles have all passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Luke says eight days, because the first day was also included.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Matthew is a book of doctrine; hence, it was not written carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Peter, John, and James, all three, were ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Privately."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All great revelations are revealed in private.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only in private can one receive God's revelation and God's fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 2:"And He was transfigured before them, and His face shined like the sun, and His garments became as white as the light."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord was transfigured in His position as the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no possibility of change as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was not transfigured from the Son of Man to the Son of God, but from the humble, suffering, rejected Son of Man to the One receiving the kingdom, honor, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>With such glory in view, is it not worthwhile for one to bear the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This proves that Peter's word, "God be merciful to You, Lord!" in 16:22 was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This encourages us to suffer and to bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"His face."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only Matthew pays attention to the glory of the King.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The sun is a type of the kingdom, which also means glory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 3:"And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, conversing with Him."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"Moses and Elijah."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The way that the three gospels record them is different: Mark says "Elijah with Moses" Mark 9:4 because Mark speaks concerning the Slave.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Moses was a servant of God and was therefore placed in a lower position.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Luke says "two men" Luke 9:30 because Luke speaks concerning man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"Moses and Elijah" one is a representative of the law, and the other is a representative of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The two spoke with the Lord all the time, not only once.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The law says that the Lord became a sacrifice for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The prophecies foretell how He will become the King and receive glory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The law refers to His suffering, while the prophecies speak of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"Conversing with Him."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They were probably talking about how the Lord fulfilled the law and the prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Luke said that they "spoke of His departure, which He was about to complete in Jerusalem" Luke 9:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 4:"And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You are willing, I will make three tents here, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Peter opened up his mouth the third time, and again he spoke words of ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Peter could only fish.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He could only do his part at Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius; he could not make tents.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The latter was Paul's business, which is to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord was a carpenter; therefore, He was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Peter's expression here showed that he understood the joy of the glory in the kingdom of the heavens; therefore, he did not want to go down from the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"Make three tents."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is wrong, because: 1 Peter thought that one could enjoy the glory of the kingdom of the heavens without suffering, losing the soul, or bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He did not feel the need to descend from the mountain in order to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There were demons at the foot of the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many people are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When God blesses them a little, they would not strive to make any more progress.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They become lazy and avoid sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Instead, they desire to have the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>2 Many think that the kingdom is now and that the millennium is now.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is like Peter and the other disciples, who thought that they could enjoy the kingdom of the heavens right then.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>3 Peter thought that Moses and Elijah could stand in the same position as the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the world, the Lord indeed had emptied Himself and had made Himself of no reputation.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But in the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord is the highest One.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Moses and Elijah were men among men and were respected by all.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But they could not be ranked in the same position with the Lord, for the Father loves only the Son see the following , and every knee shall bow unto the Lord Isa 45:23; Rom 14:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Moses resurrected from the dead, and Elijah was the first one to be raptured; yet they could not be ranked together with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Lord would not answer Peter's question.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The answer that is without an answer is the best answer.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Peter had forgotten the acknowledgement in chapter sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Verse 5:"While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Hear Him!"</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>"While he was still speaking."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God interrupted Peter's senseless speaking and did not want him to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Therefore, He said, "Hear Him!"</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>"A bright cloud."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is for the Holy of Holies, which appeared when God descended on the holy mountain Exo 24:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The "voice" is an experience pertaining to the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>"My Son, the Beloved."</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This elevated the Lord to a position above Moses and Elijah, signifying that grace far exceeds the law and the prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The same words were spoken during the Lord's baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Why was there the need for repetition?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Lord's baptism was an indication of His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The incident here indicates the Lord's determination to be crucified by refusing Peter's intervention .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Today God also delights in the obedient ones who bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>God delights in the suffering ones who receive the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>"Hear Him!"</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Do not speak rashly, but hear Him.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Many people can only talk but cannot hear.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>What should they hear?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>They should hear all the words that the Lord speaks, especially those concerning self-denial and the bearing of the cross Matt 16:24-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>"Hear Him!"</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Now there is only He; there is no more Moses and Elijah.</S>
