   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Now she determines to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>She realizes that she is not advancing in her faith and that her feeling is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The meaning of rising up is to no longer lie on the bed and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord teaches her to transcend over a rest that depends on time and place.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Previously, she treasured a rest that depended on time and place above everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But after the Lord has taken her a step further, she realizes that a rest that depends on time and place is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, she wants to rise up and move away from this rest, and learn to experience the rest that is satisfied in every kind of circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After she arises, she wants to "go about the city."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Formerly, this city referred to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now it refers to the heavenly Jerusalem and to everything that is heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>She seeks Christ among all the heavenly things, matters, and people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Perhaps she has spent a considerable time studying many doctrines in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps she has read many books by others and has participated in many meetings with spiritual persons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Perhaps she has done all these, and perhaps she has even sought "in the streets, and in the broad ways."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The "streets" are the ordinary roads, whereas "the broad ways" are the wide roads.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These are the places where the citizens pass, the places of communication.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These are the means where they receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord is "the way."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other words, these are the usual means by which God's people receive fellowship and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She has tried them all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These may include confession, repentance, prayer, fasting, meeting, and fellowship between the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They may even include faith and trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But she cannot find the Lord in these places.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In searching for sinners, we have to go to the "streets and lanes" as in Luke 14:21.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But in the New Jerusalem, there are only streets.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before God there are no small lanes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The world always takes small lanes, but spiritually, this cannot be done.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Lord purposely goes away and takes away man's feeling of His presence, it is difficult to recover it through man's ways of seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By now the maiden has learned at least one lesson: the Lord is not in the place of the bed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If she cannot find Him within, she has to look for Him without.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If it is true that prayer is not for prayer, that Bible reading is not for Bible reading, and that a quiet time is not for a quiet time but for His presence, then to a certain point, prayer, Bible reading, and quiet time have to be relinquished before we can find His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The maiden begins to leave her bed and to communicate with God's other children.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She learns to take God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She no longer has coverings, and she does not care for her "face" any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She no longer tries to cover her inner emptiness with outward works.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She learns to mingle herself with God's other children and to solve her spiritual problems in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Formerly, the only way to solve her spiritual problems was with the bed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now she can walk through the city and search in the streets and the broad places.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although she has not met the Lord, He is inside the city.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although she has not met the Lord along the paths she travels, these journeys are indispensable for her.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Soon she will meet the Lord; it is only a matter of time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 3 says, "The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The words "go about" can be translated as "parade."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These watchmen are charged by God to watch over souls Heb 13:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They go about the city; they are the ones who are familiar with spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Perhaps in the past, these ones rendered much help to the maiden.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although the maiden has not sought them, their duty puts them in a place where they see the maiden.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The maiden thinks that perhaps these ones can tell her where her beloved is.</S>
