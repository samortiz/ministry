   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE A NEW REVIVAL BY LIVING THE LIFE OF A GOD-MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>My burden in this chapter concerns a new revival.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need a new revival, a revival that has never occurred in history.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the history of the church there have been a number of revivals.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Reformation at the time of Martin Luther can be considered a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, that revival was a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After the Reformation a number of small revivals took place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Out of these revivals the private churches, such as the Baptist church, the Presbyterian church, and the Methodist church, were produced.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the eighteenth century a great revival was brought in by Count Zinzendorf with the Moravian Brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This revival included the practice of the proper church life to some extent.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A century later the Brethren were raised up in Great Britain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The revival that they brought in was improved and greater than that under Zinzendorf.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Watchman Nee considered the Brethren revival as a fulfillment of the church in Philadelphia in Revelation 3, and D. M. Panton, a student of Robert Govett, said that the influence of the Brethren revival was greater than that of Luther's reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The difference was that Luther's reformation was widely propagated, but the Brethren revival was the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not wanting to make a show, the Brethren preferred to conceal themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Among them were a number of great teachers, including John Nelson Darby and William Kelly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today it is difficult to find a photograph of one of the Brethren teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Brethren revival was nearly like the sun shining at noon, but it lasted only a relatively short time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The most prevailing time of the Brethren revival was around 1850.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By the end of the First World War the Brethren were divided into more than a thousand divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At that time the sun had set on the Brethren revival.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the beginning of the twentieth century the Welsh revival took place, which was quite prevailing but only for a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then the Lord went to China.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As Brother Nee said, to the Lord's move China was a virgin land not touched fully by the deformed Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brother Nee told me privately that the Lord was forced to go from Europe and America to China to take a virgin land to begin something new from the third decade of the present century.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From China the Lord's recovery has spread throughout the globe now, and it is here with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What kind of revival is this?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A revival is always the practice, the practicality, of the vision that people have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Martin Luther saw a vision concerning justification by faith, and he began to practice what he saw.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Reformation came out of that practice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Zinzendorf saw something of the oneness of the church, and he practiced what he saw.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At his time a number of groups of believers were suffering persecution by the Catholic Church and the state churches in northern Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many of these persecuted believers fled to Zinzendorf's estate in Saxony in southern Germany, and Zinzendorf received them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After they arrived, they argued among themselves over their doctrinal differences.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One Lord's Day Zinzendorf called them together and convinced them to stop their arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They signed an agreement to keep the oneness among them and to lay aside their differences in doctrine and in their religious backgrounds.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On that day, history tells us, while partaking of the Lord's table, they experienced the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By this they all were revived.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That should be considered as a kind of revival of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE NEED OF A REVIVAL IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What kind of revival do we have today?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In other words, what kind of model has been raised up among us?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As a rule a revival should always be the practice of the vision we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, from the time I came into the recovery I have been watching over the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From Brother Nee's time until today, for seventy-two years, our practice has never come up to the standard of our vision that we have received of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brother Nee stressed two things: Christ as life to produce the church and the church as the Body of Christ to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But, sorry to say, it was not only the outsiders who did not know these things; even among Brother Nee's co-workers, who were my contemporaries, very few have fully entered into the realization of these two matters.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Not to mention the matter of the Body of Christ, they did not even see the matter of Christ as life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They stressed matters such as leaving the denominations, baptism by immersion, head covering, and the way to practice the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In 1934 a letter came to me from Brother Nee saying that our emphasis was not on leaving the denominations, on baptism by immersion, on head covering, or on the practice of the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He added that from that day forward, whoever preached and taught only those four things was not our co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He said that the vision we had received from the Lord concerned Christ as our life to produce the church, not as an organization but as a Body, an organism, to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This, he said, is what we have seen, and this is what we should preach and teach.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Brother Nee wrote these words twelve years after the beginning of the recovery in China in 1922.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>From the time that I began my ministry until today I have put out many books concerning the vision that we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Through all the years, in mainland China, in Taiwan, in southeast Asia, and in the West today, in our practice we have never come up to the standard of what we have seen.</S>
