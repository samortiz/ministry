"Greatly frightened." Who would not be afraid of God's descending?</P><P>Verse 7:"And Jesus came to them and touched them and said, Arise, and do not be afraid." "Do not be afraid"-because we are still in the age of grace.</P><P>Verse 8:"And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone." "They saw no one except Jesus Himself alone." The glory of the Son of Man covers everything. The law, the prophecies, the voices (visions), and the companions will all pass away. Only Jesus remains. May we have only Jesus.</P><P>Verses 1-8 reveal the kingdom of the heavens on the holy mountain. (1) Christ receives glory and becomes king; (2) Moses signifies the believers who have died and resurrected (1 Cor. 15:52; 1 Thes. 4:13-17); (3) Elijah signifies the believers who will be raptured while still alive (1 Cor. 15:52; 1 Thes. 4:13-17); (4) Peter, James, and John signify the untransformed Israelites as the people in the kingdom (Ezek. 37:21-28); and (5) the people at the foot of the mountain signify the nations (Isa. 11:10-12). From verse 1 through verse 8, we see that after a man dies, his body changes, but his form remains the same as before. The three disciples knew Moses and Elijah. The rich man died and he recognized Abraham.</P><P>Verse 9:"And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man is raised from the dead." "Tell...to no one." Why is this? This is because the Lord had already been rejected, and to draw the unbelievers by His glory was quite meaningless. To draw people while they are touched is meaningful, but it is useless to draw the unbelievers. The three disciples were all special ministers; therefore, they needed special strengthening.</P><P>Verse 10:"And the disciples asked Him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?" The three asked this question because they had just seen Elijah. They still had a fresh image and thought that the revelation on the mountain was the fulfillment of the prophecies (Mal. 4:5).</P><P>Verse 11:"And He answered and said, Elijah indeed is coming and will restore all things." "Elijah indeed is coming." According to God's arrangement, if a man was willing to receive the testimony of John, he would know that John was Elijah (Matt. 11:14). Although he was not Elijah reincarnated, he had the spirit and power of Elijah (Luke 1:17).</P><P>Verse 12:"But I say to you that Elijah has already come; and they did not recognize him, but did with him the things they wished. So also the Son of Man is about to suffer by them." It is a pity that no one received John's testimony, and they even "did with him the things they wished." Today we cannot see Elijah, because the Son of Man was rejected. If one mistreated the forerunner, he would surely mistreat the Son of Man also. Since Elijah was rejected, the Messiah also would be rejected. Therefore, although there was the glory on the mountain, it had to remain covered because there was no need for such testimonies in this age. The Lord also said that the slave is not above his master (Matt. 10:24). The Messiah was rejected, and Elijah also was rejected. Again He said, "He who rejects you rejects Me" (Luke 10:16). Without the Messiah, what is the use of having an Elijah?</P><P>Verse 13:"Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them concerning John the Baptist." The Lord did not mention John's name, but the disciples already knew that He meant John. Although sometimes the Bible does not mention something directly, we should understand the Lord's mind.</P><P>Verses 14-15:"And when they came to the crowd, a man came to Him, falling on his knees before Him and saying, Lord, have mercy on my son, for he has epilepsy and suffers terribly; for often he falls into the fire and often into the water." The general subject of this section (vv. 14-21) is the Lord's feelings toward man's unbelief. No other deed or achievement can reveal this kind of feeling. "A man." This one was a remnant and was obviously a sinner. When the son was possessed, he was thrown "into the water" and "into the fire." Water is cold and fire is hot. This means that when a demon takes possession of a person's body, he makes the person feel either cold or hot. In other words, the person becomes an epileptic. There are many demons of this kind.</P><P>Verse 16:"And I brought him to Your disciples, and they were not able to heal him." The disciples thought that casting out demons was an easy thing and that they had the experience. Since they had been with the Lord for quite a long time, they assumed that they should have this ability. In spiritual matters one should never assume anything. If you do not have the real capability, you will surely fail. The disciples wanted to try; it is no wonder that they failed. The disciples could not cure the man and were instead deceived by the demon, which signifies that the Jews will be deceived by Satan's power during the great tribulation.</P><P>Verse 17:"And Jesus answered and said, O unbelieving and perverted generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to Me." Here we can see the suffering given to the Lord through the heart of unbelief. Endurance is a suffering. The suffering of unbelief is worse than that of being scolded or beaten. "How long shall I be with you?" When the Lord was in the world, He had to endure all the time. He had no choice but to endure; therefore, He had to say this. (Because the Lord was honest, people did not like to dwell with Him; this was the Lord's heart.) "Unbelieving" is toward the Lord, while "perverted" is toward oneself. "Bring him here to Me." The father (and the mother), the child himself, and several of the disciples did not have the solution. The Lord said these words to show that only He had the solution. The child's father was comforted immediately. These words are truly precious and comforting. Why did he not go to Jesus first?</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 15: Study on Matthew &nbsp; pg 64</div><br></body></html>
