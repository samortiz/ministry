   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GOSPEL AND THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Gospel of Mark opens with these words: The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Perhaps you would say the gospel is the glad tidings, the good news.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This, of course, is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But what is the good news?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I was young, I was taught that the good news is what is spoken of in John 3:16: For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There can be no doubt that this certainly is good news.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, in the Gospel of Mark we do not read anything about God loving the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead, 1:1 speaks of the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then we are told in 1:14 that the Lord Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In His preaching He declared, Repent and believe in the gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is not a word here that the Lord Jesus preached about God s love or that He said the time had come to believe in Him that we might have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1:15 the Lord Jesus said that the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has drawn near.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, we need to repent and believe in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we read 1:14 and 15 carefully, we shall realize that the gospel is actually the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 14 says that the Lord Jesus preached the gospel of God, and verse 15 says that the Lord declared that the kingdom of God had drawn near.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because the kingdom of God had drawn near, people should repent and believe in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here we see that the gospel and the kingdom of God are synonymous.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The kingdom is the gospel, and the gospel is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the kingdom of God were only a sphere for God to exercise His authority or a dispensation for Him to administer His government, it is not likely that such a kingdom could be a gospel to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But in Mark it is revealed that the kingdom of God is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the Lord Jesus preached the gospel of God, He preached the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A DEFINITION OF THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is the kingdom of God?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Strictly speaking, the kingdom of God is a Person, and this Person is the Son of God incarnated to be the Son of Man with the name Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First this wonderful Person came as the Sower.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second, He is the seed sown by Himself as the Sower.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the Sower sows the seed into us, this is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may say that, according to 1 Corinthians 3:9, the kingdom is God s farm.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the kingdom is the Sower sowing the seed into human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today this kingdom is the farm of God, and this farm is the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is growing on God s farm?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s farm grows Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the concept not only of the Gospel of Mark, but also of other books in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, in his first Epistle Peter says, Having been regenerated, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God 1 Pet 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here we see that we have been born of God because we have the seed of God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the last book of the New Testament, Revelation, we have the harvest of the seed sown in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Gospels the Lord Jesus was the Sower.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But in Revelation 14 He will come as the Reaper.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What was sown by the Lord in the Gospels grows in the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually, it will ripen in Revelation 14, and there will be the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Consider Revelation 14:14 and 15: And I saw, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud One sitting like the Son of Man, having a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, Send forth Your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This harvest will be the aggregate of the mature believers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, these believers will be kings with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have been emphasizing the fact that in the Gospel of Mark we see a life that lives according to God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whatever the Lord Jesus did in preaching, teaching, casting out demons, healing the sick, and cleansing the leper was according to the New Testament economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now in chapter four of Mark we see that this life is a sowing life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The life that is according to and for God s New Testament economy is a life of sowing.</S>
