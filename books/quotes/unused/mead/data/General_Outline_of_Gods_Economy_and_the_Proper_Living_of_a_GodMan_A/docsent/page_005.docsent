   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gen 1:2; Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>3:10; Matt 1:18, 20; 28:19; 2 Cor 13:14; Col 1:15, 20; Rom 6:6; 1 Pet 1:3; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Exo 30:22-30; 1 John 2:27; Eph 1:23; Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6; Rom 8:4, 13; Phil 1:19</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prayer: Lord, we worship You that You are God, You are the speaking God, and You are the revealing God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We thank You from the depths of our being that from the time You raised up Your recovery in China, You have been speaking to us and giving us revelation continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We truly worship You today that You have brought us to the high peak of Your revelation to show us something which most people have not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through all these years, Lord, You have opened up the revelation in Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Due to our dullness, however, we have been very slow in our progress so that after seventy years the church has just arrived at this situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We truly look to You to enable us to speak this mystery which cannot be expressed with human words.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the mystery of mysteries and the revelation of revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Be with us and anoint us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We trust in Your Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let us not only see the light in Your Word but also receive the supply in Your Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Pour out Your Spirit at this time and anoint us that You may spontaneously unveil us, illuminate us, enlighten us, and speak to us not only to the whole meeting corporately but also to each one individually.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have a deep realization that You, our Lord, often meet the needs of many by the same speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>O Lord, perform a miracle, a wonder, again among us right now.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Cleanse us with Your precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By the blood of the Lamb we overcome our accuser daily and stand before our righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE ACCOMPLISHMENT AND APPLICATION OF GOD'S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this message I have a deep feeling to speak to you a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Actually, I have already spoken to you concerning this mystery in the past thirty years little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some of the items were spoken in one conference and others were spoken in another conference.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some were spoken thirty years ago and others were spoken just last week.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The main points of the mystery which I want to fellowship with you were already made known to you and printed in books.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In these thirty years I have given thousands of messages, of which forty to fifty were on this mystery, which is the mystery of mysteries, but I did not point it out to you in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is this mystery concerned with?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the previous message we saw God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now we need to go on further to see that God's economy needs to be carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Any kind of enterprise requires two steps: The first step is to make a product and the next step is to distribute it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When a company plans to manufacture something, first it has to make the product and then it has to promote the sale of the product.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One is production, and the other is application.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The entire Bible covers God's economy in these two aspects: its accomplishment and its application.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The accomplishment of God's economy is a very crucial item, but this time we will not touch it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this message we need to see how God applies His economy after it has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE APPLICATION OF GOD'S ECONOMY BEING ALTOGETHER HINGED ON THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The application of God's economy is altogether hinged on one word Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The application of God's economy is dependent on the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Bible, the Spirit first refers to the Spirit of God Gen 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Afterwards the Bible shows us that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Jehovah Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then the New Testament goes on to show us that the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, is the Holy Spirit Matt 1:18, 20 , the Spirit who is separated from the common things and thereby is sanctified, made holy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This matter is very deep.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"Holy" refers to God's nature, because God's nature is holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When holiness is applied to us, that is God imparting His holy nature into us and thereby making us holy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without God's element, how can we be made holy?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In chemistry, if a certain element is missing, it is not possible to obtain the desired result.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How marvelous it is that the name of God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Such a name, however, is not disclosed in the Old Testament; rather, it is somewhat concealed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, 2 Samuel 7:12-14 says that David would have a seed, who would call God "Father" and God would call Him "Son."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>So you see the Father and the Son were there.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the Old Testament the Spirit was clearly mentioned as "the Spirit of God" and the "Spirit of Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the Old Testament the name the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is concealed, unlike in the New Testament, in which this name is referred to in plain words.</S>
