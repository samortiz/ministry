   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Inquiring of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we learn to come to God and behold Him in a quiet spirit, we will spontaneously worship and praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After worshipping and praising God, we must learn to inquire of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should ask if He wants us to pray about a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not immediately pray about different matters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, we should first have a discussion with Him, asking Him if we should pray for a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All prayers should be initiated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He should be the one who initiates them within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Abraham s intercession before God in Genesis 18 is a model intercessory prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God wanted to destroy Sodom; however, He wanted to save Lot, and He needed a man to intercede for Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everything that God wants to do to man and every grace that He intends to bestow on man can be fulfilled only after man prays.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is an unchanging principle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God intended to save Lot, but He needed a man to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Who could He find?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He could find only Abraham, a man who lived before God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are two precious portions in Genesis 18.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first is Abraham walked with them God and the angels to send them away v. 16 . This is a sweet word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God came to Abraham s tent and visited him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Abraham ministered to God and fellowshipped with Him while God ate and drank in his tent.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God spoke to Abraham concerning his begetting of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After that, God finished His business with Abraham and was free to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But while He was leaving, Abraham walked with God to send Him away.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible says that Abraham was called the friend of God James 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is vividly portrayed when Abraham sent God off.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, God visited Abraham; He ate, drank, and fellowshipped with him as a friend in his tent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the other hand, Abraham sent God off also like a friend.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was as if God said, Abraham, good-bye!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then Abraham seemed to respond, Let me walk with You a distance to send You off.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They behaved like two intimate friends who were unable to part.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are certain things that God does not reveal until we walk a distance with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If Abraham had not walked a distance with God that day, but had instead promptly parted with God, God would not have had a way to save Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When God visited Abraham, it seems as if He accomplished only that part of His business that pertained to Abraham; the part that pertained to Lot was still hidden in God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God s heart was on Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He intended to judge and destroy Sodom, but His child Lot was still in the city of Sodom and needed to be rescued.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, God could not rescue Lot, because He needed someone who was one with Him to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In visiting Abraham, He settled the business He had with Abraham and was waiting for Abraham to do something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But He did not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we visit friends, it is easy for us to tell them what we are doing for them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But it is not easy to ask them to do something for us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This was what happened when God visited Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although God wanted Abraham to do something for Him, it was not easy for Him to say anything, because He did not know if Abraham was willing to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He did not know whether Abraham was one with Him in His inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It was as if God said that He was leaving, but Abraham would not let Him go; he walked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then God stopped and said, Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Gen 18:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The sending away issued in something.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God said that He was going down to see the situation of Sodom, and that He was going to judge it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This word hinted at God s intention to save Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He did not say this in plain words.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Abraham was a man living before God, and he understood God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He knew that though God did not mention Lot, He cared for Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Here we find the second precious word: Abraham remained standing before Jehovah v. 22 . In the first precious word Abraham walked with God to send Him away.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the second precious word Abraham remained standing before God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>While he was standing before Him, he prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This prayer was intercessory prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Such intercessory prayer is fully initiated by God and motivated by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is conceived out of fellowship with God, out of touching His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Abraham began to pray for Lot, but he did not mention Lot s name.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It seems as if both God and Abraham were speaking in a riddle.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How do we know that Abraham s prayer was for Lot?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In 19:29 we are told that when God destroyed Sodom, He rescued Lot on account of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore the subject of that intimate talk and riddle between God and Abraham was Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But God did not say that it was Lot, and Abraham did not expose it either.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the surface both were speaking about Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Actually, they were speaking about Lot s deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Abraham s intercession truly touched God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I hope that we would see that as we breathe in God, we should learn to touch God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should not bring many things to God, nor should we ask for many things.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we do, God will disappear, and we will not touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must learn to stop our being and touch the burden within God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The most precious prayers are those that are initiated by God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God knows all the matters that concern us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, we must ask ourselves if we can say, Lord, I believe You know all the things concerning me.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Although I am in a difficult situation, You have not initiated anything within me, and I will not pray for this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If in our prayer we can tell the Lord that we will not pray for any matter, we have learned a great lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>At least we should pray, God, You know that I am bearing a big burden.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Do You think I should pray for any matter that concerns me?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We may then bring the matters to Him one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If there is an echo within when we touch a certain matter, we have touched God in that matter and can proceed to pray for that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But if God s presence is not there, and there is no sense of God when we touch a certain matter, we should drop that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Whenever we pray, we should stop immediately when we do not touch God or sense His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We should no longer pray for that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>However, as soon as we touch God, we should continue praying.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We should pray for the items that bring us into His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>No matter how many burdens we have or how many difficulties we face, we should never pray according to these difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Rather, we should pray according to God s initiation and presence.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Prayer is fully a matter of man mingling with God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We should never utter a prayer in which we pray, but He does not pray.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We cannot enjoy God in such prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We must have the confidence to say that He is praying as we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We must also have the confidence to say that our prayer follows His prayer and is directed by His prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In this way, He bears us in His prayer, and He joins us in His prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Every word of our prayer touches Him, and we enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Brothers and sisters, no matter what the content is of such prayer, it is initiated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It touches God, and it mingles the praying one with God and joins him to God.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The more a person prays this way, the more he breathes in God and the more God is added into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The result of such prayer is not only the accomplishment of the things prayed for this is secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The main result is that when one prays this way, even in the process of his prayer, he receives God and enjoys God.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The primary thing is that man gains God.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The secondary thing is that man s prayers are answered.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Allowing God to Finish Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Lastly, one must learn the lesson of allowing God to finish speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This was what Abraham did.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>After Jehovah finished speaking, He left.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We must learn the lesson of allowing God to finish speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We should not be afraid that this will take too much time, and we should not worry that this will delay our affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>God cares for us more than we care for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>He will not forsake us.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The importance of prayer is not in praying for things.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The importance of prayer is in touching and absorbing God.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Although we should have the faith that He will accomplish whatever we ask, this is secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We must learn to touch Him and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Our prayer should be directed by Him and joined to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The most crucial need among God s children is to learn to pray by absorbing and breathing in God.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>May the Lord be gracious to us and perfect us in this way.</S>
