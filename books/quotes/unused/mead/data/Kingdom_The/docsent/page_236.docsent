   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Going on to Enjoy Christ More</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us read Hebrews 6:7-8: "For the earth which drinks the rain which often comes upon it and brings forth vegetation suitable to those for whose sake also it is tilled, partakes of blessing from God; but bringing forth thorns and thistles, it is disapproved and near a curse, whose end is to be burned."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we do not leave the foundation and go on to experience more of Christ, we are like a piece of ground which drinks the rain, but does not bring forth the proper fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This will cause us to suffer a loss, but it does not mean that we ourselves will be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is to suffer something for not going on.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let us go on!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not linger here.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not go back to lay the foundation again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The foundation has been laid, so let us build upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means we should go on to enjoy Christ further and further.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may fall many times, but we must rise up and applying the blood, go on with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The enemy, Satan, will always try to keep us lingering at the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You have to tell that subtle one that you have the blood of the Lord Jesus and that you have the foundation already laid.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must go on to enjoy Christ as our great High Priest ministering in the heavenly sanctuary, not according to the commandments of the law, but according to the power of an indestructible life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is our High Priest, not according to the order of Aaron, but according to the order of Melchisedec, able to save us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We simply must enjoy Him more and more, not caring for the past and not caring for anything behind us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must press on!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Satan always reminds us of our past and what we did yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to tell him we only care for today and the expectation of tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not care for yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all have to forget the things that are behind us and press forward to the things that are ahead of us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let us go on to enjoy Christ more.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>SUPERIOR TO THE OLD COVENANT</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have covered three sections of the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is superior to the angels in the first section, He is superior to Moses and Joshua in the second section, and He is superior to Aaron and all the priests in the third section.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The fourth section, chapter eight through chapter ten, shows that Christ with His blood is much superior to the Old Covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The New Testament gives us, not the law in letters outside us, but the law of life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we do not need anyone to teach us Heb 8:8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have the living law within us, which is much better than the outward law of letters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In addition, His precious blood purges and cleanses our conscience so that we may serve the living God Heb 9:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The New Covenant is a better covenant, much superior to the old one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the time Hebrews was written, there was the danger that the Hebrew Christians might be convinced to go back to Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Perhaps their friends and families were endeavoring to draw them back to Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They may have pointed out to the New Testament believers that the Old Covenant was given by God and was so wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because the Hebrew Christians were staggering between the Old Covenant and the New Covenant, the Apostle Paul warned them concerning the Old Covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He told them that the Old Covenant had been fulfilled that it was over.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no more sacrifice for sins because when Christ died for sins, He finished the sacrifice for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ fulfilled the type of the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, there is no more sacrifice for sins 10:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To go back once more and offer the Old Testament sacrifices for sins would be a real insult to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, Paul told them they should not stop meeting with the believers 10:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They should not neglect their assembling together with the other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To stop meeting with the believers meant to go back to Judaism, which was a sinful thing in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To go back to Judaism was to sin willfully.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What a serious matter this was!</S>
