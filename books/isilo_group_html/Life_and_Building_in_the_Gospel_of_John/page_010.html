<p>In John 6 we see a picture related to man&rsquo;s livelihood. In this chapter there were crowds by the sea waiting to be fed and who were willing to make the Lord king by force. This is altogether related to man&rsquo;s livelihood. Although many of us would have been happy to be made king, the Lord did not want to be such a king. He did not come to be such a king but to be the Word. In some situations He would not even perform miracles. To the crowds He said, &ldquo;Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you&rdquo; (v. 27). He also said, &ldquo;Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die&rdquo; (vv. 49-50). This again speaks of the Lord being the Word. The picture in chapter 6 shows that the Lord did not want man to worship Him as God nor to serve Him as the Lord; He wanted to be the Word, the bread of life, to be received and obtained by man as life.</p>
<p>Then the Lord said, &ldquo;The bread which I will give is My flesh&rdquo; (v. 51). The people could not understand the Lord&rsquo;s word and asked, &ldquo;How can this man give us His flesh to eat?&rdquo; (v. 52). Then He said, &ldquo;Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves. He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life...For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink&rdquo; (vv. 53-55). This created even more confusion, but the Lord explained, saying, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (v. 63). This shows that the Lord was the Word. He was the Word, and in Him was life. The bread of life that the Lord spoke of was the Word, which contained the nourishment of life in order for man to have life.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, however, many of the disciples found the word too hard to accept and went back one by one (vv. 60, 66). Jesus, therefore, said to the disciples who remained, &ldquo;Do you also want to go away?&rdquo; Simon Peter answered Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life&rdquo; (vv. 67-68). Peter often spoke nonsense, but this time he spoke clearly. This is the very life that we want to receive; this is the eternal life that is in Him as the Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN BEING MADE ALIVE<br />
WHEN HE TOUCHES LIFE IN THE WORD</h2>
<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God (1:1). This Word was in the beginning with God (v. 2). All things came into being through Him, and in Him was life (vv. 3-4). He is the Word to utter God forth and to speak God into man. Once this Word enters into man, man touches life. Once man has life, he is made alive, and he is fed, strong, assured, and restful.</p>
<p>When we come to a meeting, we often are not full of joy, but as soon as we touch the Word in the meeting, we are released, strengthened, and uplifted. We may come dead, but we become living when we touch the Word. We may come sorrowful and full of heavy burdens, but we become joyful, and our heavy burdens fall away when we touch the Word. We may dislike a brother, but he becomes lovely to us when we touch the Word. We have many such experiences when we touch God as the Word.</p>
<p>We should not touch life only when we meet; we should also touch life when we pray. Many Christians have a concept that we should pray to a high and lofty Lord. They think that prayer is related to worshipping Him from afar and that we have no relationship with Him. Such prayers are not proper Christian prayers. Proper prayers touch God, who is speaking as the Word in our spirit; we should touch God, who is the Word. When we touch Him, we touch the Word, and when we touch the Word, we are enlivened. When we pray in this way, we will be connected to Him, and we will be full of light. Furthermore, we will be inwardly strengthened and satisfied.</p>
<p>We also need to touch life when we read the Bible. Many feel that the Bible is the word that the God of heaven has given to us and that we should piously kneel and read it. After reading in this way, however, we will still feel that God is far from us. We should read the Bible to touch God, who is the Word, in order to receive the life that is in the Word. Once we touch the Word, we will have life.</p>
<p>As Christians, we should touch God as the Word in our gatherings, in our prayers, in our Bible reading, and in our daily life. As we walk on the street, we can contact Him and touch Him as the Word. He will enter into us and speak Himself into us to be our life. This is true Christian worship. The worship that we render to God is different from the worship rendered to God by people in various religions. People in all religions worship a distant God, and there is no contact between them and God, because God is not the Word to them. However, the worship that we render to God involves touching God by worshipping in our spirit because He is the Word in us. Our God is not only God but also the Word. In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, the Word was God, and in Him was life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life and Building in the Gospel of John &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
