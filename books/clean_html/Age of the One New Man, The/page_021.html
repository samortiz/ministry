<h2 class="head2">The Way of Faith</h2>
<p>How do we carry out the support for the full-time serving ones? There is no set practice. There is only one way&mdash;the way of faith. If we love the Lord, come to Him, and receive a burden to preach the gospel in every place, we will have no way to escape. On one hand, serving the Lord brings us joy, but on the other hand, it is a heavy yoke. On the day of my salvation I was yoked to the Lord. I have wanted to escape many times, but I could not escape. Sometimes it seemed that I succeeded, but I did not feel at ease or satisfied. Hence, it is not up to us, just as we could not choose to be male or female, or Chinese or American. Similarly, becoming a Christian was not up to us; it was determined by God before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4).</p>
<p>Because we have believed in the Lord, our serving full time is not up to us. When we come to the Lord and are touched by His love, we are willing to preach the gospel. The more we come and go, the more we lose interest in other things. As a result, we might offend our parents, because they do not understand why we go to meetings all the time and have no interest in other things. It may be that we cannot explain why we have no interest in other things, but we are delighted to serve the Lord. We have been chosen, called, and separated by God. This is our destiny, and it cannot be changed. The way of faith is the only way to live such a life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Experiencing the Faithfulness<br />
of God in Our Hardships</h2>
<p>Although the way of faith is glorious and bright, there are hardships. Because I have experienced this, I can assure you that no hardship will cause you to starve to death. Every hardship is an opportunity to experience the faithfulness of God.</p>
<p>It is much easier to take this way today than it was in the past. When we took this way, it was truly difficult because this way had not been opened, and there were few churches and few saints. Today, however, this way has been opened, and there are a good number of churches and saints. The Lord can move the churches and touch the saints to care for the needs of His serving ones. Even if most of the saints are not touched, the Lord will still send people to supply us, just as He sent ravens to bring bread and meat to the prophet Elijah (1 Kings 17:2-6).</p>
<p>In 1936 I was working in Tientsin and Beijing in northern China. At the end of the year, Brother Watchman Nee called a nationwide co-workers&rsquo; conference in Shanghai because he had received new light from the Lord. (The messages released in this conference are included in the book entitled <em>The Normal Christian Church Life.</em>) We took a train on January 1, 1937, to Shanghai. After the conference I was invited to visit the churches in Hangchow, Nanking, Tsinan, and other places. My family was in Tientsin, while I was traveling in the south. One day my wife and children ran out of food, so they knelt down in front of the bed to pray. Before long an elderly sister knocked at the door. She was not acquainted with my wife, and she was not fluent in the northern dialect, because she was Cantonese. She told my wife that while she was at home, she did not have peace. The Lord urged her to deliver a package of food and some money to my family. This timely supply met the needs of my family.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Full-timers<br />
Exercising to Maintain Their Living<br />
and Caring for the Needs<br />
of Their Fellow Workers</h2>
<p>We need to exercise faith and to take the way of faith. However, this does not mean that the church should not pray or that the church should not make any arrangements for the support of the full-time serving ones. It is proper for the church to pray and to arrange for the support of the serving ones. Nevertheless, whether or not the church cares for the needs of the full-time serving ones, the full-time serving ones should live by faith. This does not mean that the saints do not need to receive the burden to care for the needs of the full-timers. The Lord moved that elderly sister to deliver the supply in a timely way to my family; she did not wait for a meeting to deliver the supply.</p>
<p>On one hand, the church and the saints should receive the burden to care for the needs of the full-timers. On the other hand, the full-time serving ones should be able to maintain their living. Paul said, &ldquo;These hands have ministered to my needs and to those who are with me&rdquo; (Acts 20:34). Paul worked with his own hands not only to maintain his living but also to minister to the needs of his fellow workers. During China&rsquo;s War of Resistance against Japan, the Chinese economy was doing poorly, and it was difficult for the co-workers to live. Brother Watchman Nee opened a pharmaceutical company to minister to the needs of many co-workers in a hidden way. But some believers criticized him for going into business. In 1948, when his ministry was resumed, Brother Nee spoke of this matter with tears in one of the revival meetings in Shanghai. He said that his going into business was like a widow&rsquo;s remarrying in order to raise her children. There were around five hundred saints in that meeting, and all wept when they heard this word. This shows how Brother Nee cared for the needs of the co-workers. We all need to learn to have faith not only for ourselves but also for others.</p>
<p>May the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood cover me to say that from 1949, when I started the work in Taiwan, until 1952 the Lord raised up nearly eighty full-time serving ones. I received a burden from the Lord to care for the living of these serving ones so that they would not be deprived of food. My ministry ministered to the needs of about one hundred eighty people every month. Because of what I had experienced, I was concerned for the new serving ones. Not many saints had been led to care for them directly, because their gift had not yet been manifested. For example, many believers might have ministered to Paul but not to Timothy. Hence, Paul had to take care of Timothy. This is the principle.</p>
