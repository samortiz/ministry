   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Because the world is full of sin, some groundwork must be done before the Holy Spirit can operate.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After man fell into sin, it became difficult for the Holy Spirit to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first thing God did after man sinned was to send the Lord Jesus to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since man had become a sinner, the Lord Jesus had to first come.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It would have been useless for the Holy Spirit to come first.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus must first judge a sinner before the Holy Spirit can begin His work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is why the first parable in Luke 15 is on the good Shepherd, the Lord Jesus, who came to seek the lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The second parable is on the woman, the Holy Spirit, who came to sweep the house and look for the lost coin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without Christ's work of redemption, the Holy Spirit cannot work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The work of the Holy Spirit cannot commence until the work of Christ has been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because the work of Christ has been completed, the Holy Spirit can begin His work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, there must first be the work of redemption in Genesis 6, before there can be the work of the Holy Spirit, as typified by the dove, in chapter eight.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God must do one thing first before the Holy Spirit can come to perform His work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Genesis 6:13 says, "And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In God's eyes, the whole world was full of sins and violence; it was fully corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God said that its end had come.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Men had reached the end of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God could do nothing except to bring them to their end. When God saw that the earth was full of sins and violence, He judged it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God put all flesh and all living creatures through the judgment of the flood and destroyed them all.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many Christians are not clear about the place of the world in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Exhorting the brothers and sisters to forsake the world is like a mother trying to pull a piece of chocolate out of the mouth of a child.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is so difficult because men have not seen the significance of the world in God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Salvation is not just a personal matter, but a corporate matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sin is not only a personal matter, but a corporate matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was not just the Jews who crucified the Lord Jesus; the world crucified Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Jews are not the only ones who are at enmity with God; the whole world is at enmity with God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a nation is at enmity with another nation, is the enmity a personal matter or a national matter?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We know that it is not a personal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a few citizens of one hostile country are well-disposed toward the citizens of another country, the relationship is a personal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whether or not a citizen of the hostile nation is good is not the question.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The fact is that the whole nation is at enmity with another nation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One does not hate a citizen of a hostile nation because his own parents are killed by the hostile nation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a relationship between one nation and another.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not only is the world at enmity with God as far as each individual person is concerned, but the total realm, organization, tradition, system, and everything of the world is at enmity with God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as you have a part in the worldly realm, organization, tradition, or system, you are at enmity with God, and you are in need of being saved from it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you see this, you will not exhort others to do this and that to improve themselves, remove their shortcomings, amend their ways, do good, or free themselves from other ills.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All these efforts are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In God's eyes, the whole world is corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God is at enmity with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who love the world cannot love God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If anyone loves the world, the love of God is no longer in him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who want to be friends with the world are at enmity with God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is God's view.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brothers and sisters, do you want to be delivered from hell, that is, the lake of fire?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I suppose we all do.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We want to be in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many people want to be saved because they want to be delivered from hell, the lake of fire, and go to heaven, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the kind of salvation many people want.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But the Bible speaks very little of this kind of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Bible calls this kind of salvation justification, or acceptance by God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But there is another kind of salvation in the Bible, which is salvation from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we are not saved from the world, we cannot be saved from the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Genesis 6:8 says that God found only one man, Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The first man was corrupted and had come to his end; he was hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, God found a second man, Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This second man found favor in the eyes of God; he is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Through him God established a way of salvation for man to be delivered out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God ordered him to make an ark of gopher wood, and all the living creatures the fowls, cattle, and every creeping thing, each after its kind were brought into the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then He sent rain to the earth, and the flood came and covered the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Who were the saved ones?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They were the ones who were delivered from the world, the ones who were in the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The ones who were delivered from the world were the ones who were delivered from the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Those who are saved from the world are the ones who are saved from the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It will not be sinners who will go to hell, but the world that will go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Preachers always tell others that sinners will go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Actually, the world will go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As long as you are a person in the world, you will go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Once I met a person on a boat, who asked, "Who deserves to go to hell?"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I answered, "People like you."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Every person, as long as he is a human being, deserves to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The meaning of salvation is to be saved from the community of the perishing ones.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is to be saved out of the perishing realm.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Although we are not individual criminals, we are still sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Bible does not say that we are criminals, but that we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It says that everyone in the world is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Suppose a brother has not committed a certain kind of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Since he has not broken the law, he is not a criminal.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Therefore, we cannot say that everyone in the world is a criminal.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Yet everyone is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Hence, salvation is being delivered from the world; it is to save a person out of the God-condemned world.</S>
