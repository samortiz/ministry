<h1 class="title">THE TEACHING OF THE APOSTLES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:20; 1 Tim. 6:3; Matt. 16:16-18; Eph. 3:5; Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4; 5:32; Jude 3; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; cf. 1 Cor. 16:12; Acts 13:2, 4; 2 John 9-11</h1>
<p>The ministry of the New Testament is to build up the Body of Christ according to the teaching of the apostles. <em>The teaching of the apostles</em> is a special term in the Bible (Acts 2:42). It has a deep and strong background, that is, Judaism. Outwardly speaking, Judaism is linked to the Old Testament, which existed among the Jews for one thousand five hundred years. During the period of time beginning with Moses and continuing until the coming of the Lord Jesus, Judaism became strongly and firmly established among the Jewish people. All the Jewish people, men and women, young and old, had a deep impression of Judaism. Their conversations, practices, and daily life were all according to the law of Moses, that is, the teachings of Moses. For this reason, God even arranged for a group of priests, who were required to come before God every day to offer sacrifices, burn incense, and light the lampstand in the Holy Place. These same ones also bore a commission before man, that is, to speak and teach the law of Moses.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THE THINGS THAT THE LORD JESUS COMMANDED</h2>
<p>When the Lord Jesus came, He was the first one who kept the law. It can be said that ever since the law was given through Moses, no one had ever fully kept the law. Only Jesus of Nazareth fully kept the law. Moreover, He also complemented the law. Although the law was good, it was not good enough; although the law was complete, it was not sufficiently complete. For example, the law says, &ldquo;You shall not kill&rdquo; (Exo. 20:13), but the law does not say, &ldquo;You shall not hate.&rdquo; Hence, in Matthew 5:22 in His teaching on the mountain, the Lord Jesus complemented the law. He told His disciples, &ldquo;Everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment.&rdquo; Anger is the motive of murder. The Lord Jesus not only dealt with murder but also with the inward motive. The law says, &ldquo;You shall love your neighbor&rdquo; (v. 43), yet if we love only our neighbors, only the good ones, what shall we do with those who are not good, such as our enemies? Hence, the law is incomplete. The Lord told us as a complement to the law, &ldquo;Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you&rdquo; (v. 44). On the one hand, the Lord Jesus kept the law of God, and on the other hand, he complemented the law.</p>
<p>Such matters as keeping dietary regulations and keeping the Sabbath are matters of ceremonial law. No one can fulfill the ceremonial law because no one can be man&rsquo;s food and rest. However, when the Lord Jesus came, He was the rest typified by the Sabbath and the reality of the various offerings. Only He was able to fulfill the ceremonial part of the law. He did not abolish the law but fulfilled and complemented it. He fulfilled every item in the law. The second paragraph of footnote 2 in Matthew 5:17 reads, &ldquo;Concerning the law there are two aspects: the commandments of the law and the principle of the law. The commandments of the law were fulfilled and complemented by the Lord&rsquo;s coming, whereas the principle of the law was replaced by the principle of faith according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill&rdquo; (5:17). Through keeping the law, the Lord complemented the law and fulfilled all the commandments of the law. In the law of the Old Testament the ten main commandments, such as to honor one&rsquo;s parents and not to steal, concern human ethics and man&rsquo;s relationship with God. The Lord kept, fulfilled, and complemented all the laws of the moral commandments.</p>
<p>In the Bible there is the testimony of the law. In the Old Testament age the principle of God&rsquo;s dealing with man was according to the testimony of the law and based on the law. If man did well and was perfect, he could live; otherwise, he had to die. Hence, we see that when man kept the law, he was justified, but when man disobeyed the law, he was condemned. This was the principle with which God dealt with man in the Old Testament. This principle is based on the law and has nothing to do with faith; therefore, we can say that in relationship to the law, faith is not found in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus came, He fulfilled and complemented the law. He put the law aside, and thereafter, the principle by which God deals with man was no longer based on the law but on faith. Hence, faith became the principle with which God deals with man in the New Testament. This faith, that is, the faith, is what we believe in. The contents of the entire New Testament are in faith. God deals with us based on the principle of faith. Whoever believes is justified; whoever does not believe is condemned. This is entirely different from the principle of the Old Testament. The Old Testament is based on the principle of keeping the law; the New Testament is based on the principle of believing in the Lord Jesus, that is, on the principle of faith. If we understand the law in this way, we will be clear concerning it.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_052.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_054.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 2: Leading the Saints to Practice the New Way Ordained by the Lord &nbsp; pg 53</div><br></body></html>
