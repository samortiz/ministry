Small and finite as we are, we human beings cannot understand it thoroughly; even less can we define it in a full way
Many things relating to the matter of life are not within the comprehension of men; men can only have a general idea of them
We are not able to comprehend such a comparatively small mystery as man, to say nothing of the Triune God the Father, Son, and Spirit
Although we cannot understand this mystery of the trinity of the Godhead, we can receive and enjoy this mysterious God
All that He is for us to enjoy is revealed in the Scriptures; we can simply accept it according to scriptural revelation
Although we cannot fully understand it, yet we may, according to all that is declared in the Scriptures, accept whatever is said
We must believe that this is due to the matter of the three persons of the Godhead the Father, Son, and Spirit
The Lord says in Matthew 28:19, 'Baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
When He speaks here of the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit, the name which is used is in the singular number in the original text
He became their life , and He became also the bread of life for them to eat and enjoy that they may live by Him
According to your mental understanding there are three Gods, but according to your experience there is but one
In Genesis 1:26, not only is the word 'God' used in triple number in the original language, but God speaks of Himself as 'us'
In Exodus 3:6 the Lord said to Moses, 'I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'
Although He is one God, yet there is the matter of threefoldness, that is, the threefold person the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
In Numbers 6:24-26 the Lord commanded the priests in the Old Testament to bestow a threefold blessing upon the children of Israel
The reason they praise God by repeating the word 'holy' three times is, without any doubt, because the God whom they praise is one-in-three
Following, in verse 8, it says that the God whom they praise speaks of Himself as 'us,' plural, which means He has a threefold Person
The Lord here, of course, is God, and the One whom David calls 'my Lord' is the Lord Jesus, as He Himself indicated in Matthew 22:42-45
The Lord Jesus is God, but here it says that God speaks to Him, and that between God and Him there is the difference of 'my' and 'thou'
It was possible to baptize people into the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit, that is, to baptize them into the Triune God
In eternity without a beginning God the Father has planned according to His desire; in time God the Son accomplishes it
Today, when we preach the gospel, we are telling people that man needs such a God; man needs Him as his Savior, life, and all
Revelation 4:8: Here we read that the four living creatures in the heavens give threefold praise to God, saying, 'Holy, holy, holy'
Praise the Lord, we can simply receive and enjoy this mysterious One according to what the Scriptures have said!
John 14:7-11 says, 'If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also: from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him
II, page 265, says, ' 'The Lord' as here spoken of, 'Christ,' 'is the Spirit,' is identical with the Holy Spirit
Oswald Sanders in his Spiritual Maturity page 144 says William Barclay comments Paul seems to identify the Risen Lord and the Holy Spirit
It is the experience of the Christian life that the work of the Spirit and the work of the Risen Lord are one and the same
The last Adam, of course, is the incarnated Lord Jesus, and the life-giving Spirit, of course, is the Holy Spirit
The Lord was made flesh and became the last Adam, and later, after death and resurrection, became the life-giving Spirit
In addition Romans 8910 shows us that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of Christ is simply Christ Himself
Brother Watchman Nee in Hymns, 490, verse 5, says, 'Thou, Lord, the Father once wast called, / But now the Holy Spirit art'
The Lord Jesus said, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God'
If God says there is one Spirit, then there is one Spirit; if God says there are seven Spirits, then there are seven Spirits
If we insist on analyzing it, one will say 'seven,' another will say 'one,' and we will begin to contend with one another
In the Old Testament, the structure of the lampstand was quite unique: below was one lampstand; above were seven lamps
It is correct to say that there is one lampstand, and there is nothing wrong with saying that there are seven lamps
Without question, He is one Spirit; but He is also called 'the seven Spirits,' that is, the sevenfold, intensified Spirit
In the same principle, while our unique God has three persons Father, Son, and Spirit we should never consider Them as three Gods
Although They are three, yet They are one God; although one God, yet there are the three persons Father, Son, and Spirit
Most Bible expositors say that 'the angel of the Lord' here refers to Christ, the second person of the Triune God
He is the first person, the Father; He is the second person, the Son; and He is also the third person, the Spirit
If we understand this principle, there will be no more question as to how the Son could pray to the Father when the Son is the Father
The Father who listens to the praying is the Son who prays; and the Son who prays is also the Father who listens to the prayer
The Triune God the Father, Son, and Spirit has the aspect of being three-in-one and also the aspect of being one-in-three
From the aspect of the three-in-one, 'the Word was God'; from the aspect of the one-in-three, 'the Word was with God'
From the aspect of the three-in-one, 'the Lord is the Spirit'; from the aspect of the one-in-three, it is 'the Spirit of the Lord'
Corinthians 13:14: 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all'
The fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the flowing into us of the grace of the Son, together with the love of the Father, for us to enjoy
The fellowship of the Holy Spirit brings the grace of Christ, and in the grace of Christ there is the love of God
All that the Father has is in the Son, and all that the Son has is received by the Holy Spirit, who brings Him into us for us to enjoy
John 2:23 says, 'Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that confesseth the Son hath the Father also'
The Father is in the Son, and the Son is the Spirit who comes into us for us to have and enjoy as the Triune God
The Scriptures say that the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son , but the Bible never says that the Son is in the Spirit
It is not that the Son who is in the Spirit comes into us, but it is that the Son who comes into us is the Spirit
Christ is in the Holy Spirit' is a traditional saying, while 'Christ is the Spirit' is the scriptural expression
May the Lord grant us the spirit of wisdom and revelation that we may discern what is of man's tradition and what is from divine revelation
In this Spirit there is ascension and transcendency, and in this Spirit there is also glory and enthronement, kingship and kingdom
It is rather difficult to say whether this spirit is the Holy Spirit or our spirit, for it is the mingled spirit of these two spirits
We must not walk according to our emotions, nor according to our mind, nor according to our will, but just according to this spirit
The Lord Spirit will become our living and our all, and we will enjoy all the riches of the Triune God the Father, Son, and Spirit
