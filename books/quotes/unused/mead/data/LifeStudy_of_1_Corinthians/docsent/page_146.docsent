   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ALTAR AND THE TABLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 18 Paul again refers to Israel: Look at Israel according to the flesh; are not those who eat the sacrifices fellowshippers of the altar?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that in 10:1-13 Paul presents Israel as a type of the believers today.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not think that the remainder of chapter ten has nothing to do with the type of Israel in verses 1 through 13.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the contrary, the second portion of this chapter is a continuation of the first portion; it is not separate from it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word translated fellowshippers also means joint participants.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who eat the sacrifices of the altar are not only fellowshippers with one another and with the altar, but also joint participants of what they eat.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Their participation in what they eat makes them one with the sacrifices of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since the altar is the base of the sacrifices offered to God, eating the sacrifices of the altar makes the eaters its fellowshippers, its joint participants.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This also illustrates the fact that eating makes the eater one with what he eats.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eating sacrifices to idols does the same: it identifies the eaters with the demons behind the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 18 Paul surely means that the fellowship of the altar is a type of the fellowship of the blood and body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To put it simply, it is a type of the fellowship of the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the fellowshippers of the altar are types of the fellowshippers of the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Israel had an altar, but we have a table.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the altar there were the offerings; on the table there are the blood and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The one is the type, and the other is the fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whereas the children of Israel were fellowshipping around the altar, we are fellowshipping around the table.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>IDOLS AND DEMONS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verses 19 and 20 Paul says, What then am I saying?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That what is sacrificed to an idol is anything?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Or that an idol is anything?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not want you to become fellowshippers of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here Paul s composition takes another leap, apparently without any transition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verses 19 and 20 Paul speaks of idols, sacrifices to idols, and demons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>An idol and a sacrifice to an idol are nothing 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But behind them are the demons, who are abominable and hateful to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The believers who worship God should abstain from identifying themselves with demons and becoming fellowshippers of demons through eating sacrifices to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since demons are the reality of idols, so the eating of sacrifices to idols makes the eaters their fellowshippers, their joint participants.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The eaters of sacrifices to idols become not only fellowshippers with demons, but also joint participants of demons, making themselves one with demons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>TWO TABLES</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In verse 16 Paul speaks of the fellowship of the blood and body of Christ; in verse 18, of fellowshippers of the altar; and in verse 20, of fellowshippers of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then in verse 21 he goes on to say, You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here we see that there are two tables: the table of the Lord and the table of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To partake of a table is to eat of it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To drink the cup of the Lord and partake of the table of the Lord is to identify ourselves with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To drink the cup of demons and partake of the table of demons is to make ourselves one with demons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verse 22 Paul concludes this portion of chapter ten by saying, Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Are we stronger than He?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord is the jealous God Exo 20:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Idolatry is utterly abominable to God and hated by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we participate in fellowship with demons, making ourselves one with them, we shall provoke the Lord to jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, we must flee from idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE MEANING OF IDOLATRY</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do you have an adequate understanding of 10:14-22?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You may say that here Paul speaks concerning the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Why, then, does he open this section with a charge to flee from idolatry?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In verse 14 he does not say, Wherefore, my beloved, attend the Lord s table every Lord s day.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Instead, he says, Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The correct understanding of this section is that Paul talks about the Lord s table using idolatry as a background.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have pointed out that in 10:15 Paul encourages the saints, as prudent men, to judge what he says.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He appeals to them as those who can discern, investigate, realize, and apprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we read Paul s word in a discerning way, we shall want to know why he tells us to flee from idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We shall also want to know what he means by the term idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Is Paul s meaning limited to the actual worship of a graven image?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To be sure, Paul s meaning is not this restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In 10:7 he says, Neither become idolaters, as some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to play.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is a definition of idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is a difference between idol worship and idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Idol worship involves bowing down before an idol and worshipping it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Idolatry is wider in scope, for it involves eating, drinking, and playing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this country people may not worship idols, but they may practice idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the holidays or on weekends they may give themselves over to various forms of amusement and entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They may eat and drink and rise up to play.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even to eat sacrifices to idols in an abusive way is to become involved with idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should neither worship idols nor become involved with idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As we have seen, the meaning of idolatry is much broader than the meaning of idol worship.</S>
