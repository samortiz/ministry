<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. On Their Wickedness</H2><P>Jehovah's judgment was also on their wickedness. Their wickedness burned like a fire, devouring thorn and thistle. It burned in the forest thickets, and it rolled up into a column of smoke (v. 18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Jehovah's Judgment&#151;His Overflowing Wrath</H2><P>At the overflowing wrath of Jehovah, a land was burned up, and the people were like fuel for fire (v. 19a). No one spared even his brother (v. 19b). One carved on the left side, but was hungry; and another ate on the right side, but was not satisfied. Each ate the flesh of his own arm: Manasseh, Ephraim, and Ephraim, Manasseh, and these together against Judah. But by all this Jehovah's anger was not turned; His hand was still outstretched (vv. 20-21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. On Their Injustice</H2><P>Jehovah's judgment also came upon their injustice. Concerning this, 10:1 and 2 say, "Woe to those who decree decrees of iniquity,/To the busy writers who are busy writing trouble, /In order to turn the needy away from judgment,/And to tear justice away from the poor among my people;/That widows may be their spoil,/And they may plunder orphans." These verses indicate that there was no justice in Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Jehovah's Judgment&#151;the Day of Visitation</H2><P>Isaiah 10:3 says, "And what will you do for the day of visitation/And for the devastation that comes from afar?/ To whom will you flee for help?/And where will you leave your glory...?" Here the day of visitation refers to the day of judgment, and glory refers to wealth. Verse 4 goes on to speak of one crouching behind prisoners and falling behind the slain. But by all this Jehovah's anger was not turned; His hand was still outstretched.</P>
