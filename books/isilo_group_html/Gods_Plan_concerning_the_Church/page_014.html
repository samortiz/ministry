OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p><em>Question: Are the believers who are not on the ground of the church no longer the church? Are they no longer acceptable?</em></p>
<p>Answer: When the children of Israel were taken captive to Babylon, they left Jerusalem and lost the proper ground, but this does not mean that they were no longer Israelites. It is foolish to say that the children of Israel who were in Babylon were not Israelites. The children of Israel lost the ground of God&rsquo;s people, but they were still God&rsquo;s people. In the same way, many believers are not on the ground of the church, but they are still part of the church.</p>
<p>Although the Israelites in Babylon were God&rsquo;s people, it was not right for them to remain in Babylon. They needed to return to Jerusalem. Those who knew God&rsquo;s will and cared for His intention returned to Jerusalem when the seventy years of their captivity were fulfilled (Dan. 9:2; Ezra 1:3, 5). They might have exhorted each other, saying, &ldquo;As God&rsquo;s people, we should be in Jerusalem instead of Babylon; we should go back.&rdquo; However, some among them might have said, &ldquo;It is not necessary to return. Since we are already God&rsquo;s people, it does not matter whether we are in Babylon or in Jerusalem; all that matters is that we fear God and live before Him. Daniel fears God and lives before Him, but he has remained in Babylon. As long as we are like Daniel, fearing God and living before Him, we can be anywhere. It does not matter whether we are in Babylon or Jerusalem.&rdquo; We cannot justify such teachings, nor can we say that this is right. The fact that Daniel remained in Babylon was something of God&rsquo;s sovereign arrangement for the interest of God&rsquo;s people; moreover, when he was in Babylon, he prayed three times a day toward Jerusalem (Dan. 6:10), praying desperately for God&rsquo;s people to return to Jerusalem (9:16, 20). Therefore, no one can take Daniel&rsquo;s remaining in Babylon as an excuse.</p>
<p>Just as it was wrong for the children of Israel to remain in Babylon, it is also wrong for believers to not stand on the ground of the church. All the Israelites who cared for God&rsquo;s intention returned to Jerusalem. Likewise, all the believers who care for God&rsquo;s intention should return to the ground of the church. Just as the Israelites should not have taken Daniel&rsquo;s remaining in Babylon as an excuse and thus have refused to return to Jerusalem, the believers today should not take spirituality as an excuse and thus refuse to return to the ground of the church. Some believers do not care about the ground; they care only about being spiritual and full of Christ. As long as they are spiritual and full of the stature of Christ, the fullness of Christ, the ground that they are on does not matter to them. These believers say that they do not need to be concerned about whether they are on the ground of the church. We cannot justify or agree with such a view and teaching, nor can we say that this is right. Some spiritual believers are not on the ground of the church. However, because of God&rsquo;s sovereign arrangement, we dare not judge them, just as Daniel was under God&rsquo;s sovereign arrangement. Nevertheless, we can say that no matter how spiritual a person may be, he should return to the ground of the church. If he has to remain somewhere apart from the ground of the church, he should be like Daniel and set his heart toward the God-ordained ground and pray for the ground instead of opposing the ground or discouraging people from returning to the ground.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN<br />
THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH AND<br />
SPIRITUAL CONDITION</h2>
<p><em>Question: Some of the saints who have returned to &ldquo;Jerusalem,&rdquo; that is, to the ground of the church, are not spiritual and strong. However, some of the saints in other Christian groups love the Lord fervently, serve the Lord zealously, and do their best to keep the Lord&rsquo;s word. Are they wrong?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This is indeed true. The spiritual condition of many of who went back to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel was very improper. Some married Gentile women (Neh. 13:23), some were not in one accord (6:17-19), and some were timid (4:10-12). All these conditions were discouraging. Nevertheless, although their condition was poor, the ground they stood upon was right. They were in Jerusalem. Although the condition of Daniel was good, we cannot say that the ground he stood on was right or that he should have stood there. He was not in Jerusalem but in Babylon, a ground that God opposed and cursed. This shows clearly that spiritual condition and the ground of the church are two entirely different matters. It is possible to have one and not the other. God&rsquo;s intention is that we pay attention to both our condition and the ground. Even if someone is as spiritual as Daniel, we cannot say that the ground he is upon does not matter.</p>
<p>Let us consider several people. The first example is Madame Guyon. I am afraid that hardly anyone among us loves the Lord more and has a greater measure of Christ than Madame Guyon. However, we cannot acknowledge that she stood on the proper ground. She was in the Catholic Church, on a ground that we oppose. Her case clearly shows that although a believer may be very spiritual, he may be on an improper ground. He may be right in his spirituality, but the ground on which he stands may be absolutely improper.</p>
<p>Andrew Murray was also a strong and influential saint, but he was in organized Christianity. His ground was organized Christianity, not the genuine church. He was not on the proper ground. Dr. F. B. Meyer was renowned in recent church history, and even T. Austin-Sparks greatly commended him, yet he too was still in organized Christianity. It can be said that his spiritual condition was very proper, but the ground of the church on which he stood was absolutely wrong. We need to completely separate considerations of spiritual condition from the ground of the church. We should not take a person&rsquo;s spiritual condition as the standard for the ground of the church.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>God's Plan concerning the Church &nbsp; pg 14</div><br></body></html>
