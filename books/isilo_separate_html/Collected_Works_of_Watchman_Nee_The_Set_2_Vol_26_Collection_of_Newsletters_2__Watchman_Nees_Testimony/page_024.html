The Beginning and Condition<br />of the Meeting in Chang An</h2><p>Originally, there were a few brothers in this locality who met in Lien T'ou. It is not far from here to Lien T'ou (about seven miles). Why did they separate? It was probably because a few brothers preached only one side of the truth. They gained part of the truth but had not seen the whole picture. They erroneously explained the matter of worshipping God and made up a new term&mdash;"New Testament Assembly"&mdash;and said that the church is not restricted by location or numbers, and that as long as two or three were gathered in one accord, they could meet in any place. Many brothers heard this and wanted to separate immediately. Although the experienced brothers exhorted them to wait before separating, some of them wanted to meet closer to home and were afraid of the distance, so they had much to say. The brothers then separated. When they separated, there were just a few people. They have not increased at all, nor has their spiritual condition improved. In fact, they have backslidden and are not clean now! Fortunately, after the conference in Lien T'ou, they were dealt with. If they had not received this dealing, they would be in danger now. Many brothers are exhorting them to go back to the meetings in Lien T'ou, but they still do not really want to. Oh, it is really easy to separate but difficult to combine. There are five brothers and sisters in the table meetings. There are also about five or six people who come to listen to the messages but who do not take the table yet. Brother Chang Yung Fu is responsible every Lord's Day.</p><h2 class="head2">17. The Beginning and Condition<br />of the Meeting in Hsiao Chien</h2><p>This locality did not have a meeting originally. It is a newly opened place. A brother from Lien T'ou came here to preach the gospel in 1929. Some people believed, and they began to meet in a brother's home. Their numbers increased gradually. Some of the brothers and sisters among them are very godly and precious. Unfortunately, the brother who led them to believe had a heart of love but did not have any talent for leading. Neither was he clear about the characteristics of the church. Therefore, he allowed a few unclean ones into the meeting and allowed them to do what they wanted. Fortunately, after the conference in Lien T'ou, they were dealt with, and the unclean ones were sifted out. There are now five brothers and sisters in the table meeting. There are seven others who come to hear the messages but who do not take the table yet. The brothers from Lien T'ou bear the responsibility every Lord's Day. The brothers in Ya Yang have already given a report about the condition of the churches there, so I will not be repetitious.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Huang Lu Ch'uan<br />August 14, 1934</p><h2 class="head1">NEWS FROM HU SHAN, P'ING YANG,<br />CHEKIANG PROVINCE</h2><p>To my dear brother in the Lord, Mr. Nee:</p><p>Thank God! He led me to your conferences in Shanghai twice. I gained much benefit. Unfortunately, I was attacked in my mind this year, so I have not written to greet you. I am sorry. I have recently been freed somewhat by the Lord's grace. I will tell you something of what happened and of the problems in our locality.</p><p>In 1931 I was enlightened by the Lord to see something of myself. Afterwards, I did not want to live and work in the way that I had been. I decided to spend more time praying, reading the Bible, and waiting for the Lord's will. Satan came in at this time to strongly attack my mind and to work in my environment. (My nephew got sick and died, my wife and daughter became ill, I lost some possessions, and the brothers misunderstood me, etc.) These things caused my mind to be darkened, and I felt there was no way out. I suffered much in this condition! Thank the Lord, at the proper time, the news of the third conference in Shanghai came. My heart desperately prepared to go. The hateful enemy frustrated me on many sides, but the Lord heard my prayer, and I was able to attend the meeting. Praise and thank God! In the ten days of the conference, I really felt the Lord's presence and seemed to see His face with my own eyes and hear His voice with my own ears. I was very touched by the message of testimony on how to receive spiritual blessings. The messages that solved my problems were on Christ as my life and the experience of sufferings. The dark clouds in my heart dispersed, and darkness became light. My heart was very happy. My spirit really wanted to stand up and testify in the last testimony meeting, but I was frustrated by my utterance.</p><p>Hallelujah! My previous condition has passed. However, my wife's illness is not completely healed. A call to go out and work appears to have come, but I dare not move lightly. Please pray for this much that God's will would not suffer loss in me. With regard to the small problem in our local meeting, there is a brother who has committed the sin in 1 Corinthians 5. The brothers' exhortations are useless, so we can do nothing but cut him off. His evil nature unexpectedly exploded, and he troubled the responsible brothers with a loud voice and evil looks. When the brothers saw his condition, they were grieved to the point of tears. What is the best way to deal with this matter? Please advise us. We also hope that the brothers and sisters in Shanghai will pray for us much so that the Lord's work would not be affected.</p><p>Please send five issues of Collection of Newsletters beginning with the sixth issue to me in care of Ho Wei Ch'i, Hsiao Chia Crossing, P'ing Yang, Chekiang Province. Peace in the Spirit!</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chou Ta Ch'ing<br />February 8, 1934</p><p>Greet Brother Chang Kuang Jung, Brother Witness Lee, and Brother Shih Chiu Jung.</p><p>Note from Watchman: If this brother really causes this many difficulties for the brothers, he must be cut off. This proves that the brothers were correct in cutting him off. There is nothing to do but use prayer in authority. This is the time for us to prove Christ's victory and the strength of our prayer.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> </body></html>
