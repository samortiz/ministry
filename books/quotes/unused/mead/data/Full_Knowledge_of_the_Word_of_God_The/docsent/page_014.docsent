   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GAINING LIFE THROUGH PRAY-READING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning the matter of understanding God's Word, I have mentioned four points.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, we must understand God's Word literally.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second, whereas literal comprehension requires that we use our eyes and our mind, we also need to use our spirit to pray-read God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Word of God is the bread of life and the spiritual milk; it is also God's breathing out.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since it is food, we need to eat it; since it is milk, we need to drink it; and since it is breath, we need to breathe it in. By pray-reading we are able to eat, drink, and breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is what is lacking among many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They exhaust their minds to study the letter of the Bible, but they do not use their spirit to pray-read the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, Jesus said to the Pharisees, "You search the Scriptures and you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life" John 5:39-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To study the Scriptures is one thing, but to come to the Lord by prayer to touch Him and gain His life is totally another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The common problem of today's theological seminaries is that they place too much emphasis on mental exercise to study the letter of the Bible in a doctrinal way, thus neglecting the use of their spirit to pray-read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I read a book about a contemporary of John Wesley named George Whitefield.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His preaching was even more powerful than that of Wesley.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He prayed on his knees over the Greek New Testament from beginning to end. His biography mentions that whenever he preached the gospel or ministered God's Word, he prayed for a long time beforehand over what he would say.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No wonder his preaching was so full of authority and power!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One day he was speaking about hell.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He described it so vividly that one person from the congregation stood up quickly and ran to a huge column in the assembly hall.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He held onto the column and cried, "Oh!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Be careful, or else we will all fall into the lake of fire!"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whitefield's preaching was so powerful that it seemed that he was presenting the lake of fire before the eyes of the congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>BEING CLEANSED BY PRAY-READING</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The matter of pray-reading the Lord's Word is not a theory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We read the Word with our eyes and comprehend the letters with our mind; then we need to use our spirit to pray-read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may try this not only with Bible passages of comforting and enlightening words; even pray-reading the genealogy in the first chapter of Matthew a few times will cause you to sense the painting of the inner anointing, just as drinking a good beverage will make you feel fresh and living.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On one occasion, someone said to Brother Nee, "I do not have a good memory, and I often forget the verses which I just read.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It seems that I am wasting my time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What I read in the morning I will forget by the evening; I might just as well not read the Bible at all."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Brother Nee answered, "No, it makes a great difference whether or not you read.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You see, it is just as one cleans rice in a bamboo basket in a pond.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the basket is immersed, it is full of water.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But when it is taken out of the pond, the water is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By repeating the process of immersing the basket and taking it out of the water eight or ten times, the rice is washed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When you get up in the morning, you read the Bible and pray a little; but later, after working for two hours, you have forgotten all the verses which you have read.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yes, the words are gone, but the effectiveness of the washing still remains."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, in reading the Bible we do not need to understand it too clearly in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Exercising our mind too much might distort the meaning of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The most important thing is to let our spirit be fed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every morning we should immerse ourselves in the water of the Lord's Word eight or ten times.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Two hours later we may become dry again.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But even though there is no more water, neither is there any more dirt; we have been cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, when we read the Lord's Word, having used our mind to understand it, immediately we should turn to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not think that you are smart and can compose a prayer by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let me tell you, young people, the best way to pray is to use the words of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For example, we can convert Matthew 1:1 into a prayer: "O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I worship You.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I love You, Son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>O Lord Jesus, You are the Son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How precious!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You are also the Son of David.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Oh, the Son of David!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Lord Jesus, Son of David!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The generation of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Jesus the name is so sweet!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Oh, Christ the name is so high!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Jesus Christ, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Jesus, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Jesus Christ, amen!"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Brothers and sisters, the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have to read the letter, because this is how the Bible is written, and we have to use our mind to comprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, we must convert the letter of the Bible into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Once they have been converted into prayer, God's words become spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Not only so, we also need to take a further step: having understood and prayed over the words, we need to seek the revelation of life by going beyond the letters.</S>
