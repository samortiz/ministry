It says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit." The "last Adam" refers to Christ. The word "became" implies that a process has taken place for Him to be the life-giving Spirit. Today, if you ask people who God is, some will say that He is the Creator. Others may say that He is also our Redeemer and Savior. Not many will say that God is the Spirit.</P><P>As the Spirit, God is not simple, for He is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. This Spirit includes divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. This Spirit is the all-inclusive compound Spirit we saw in the previous lessons.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE PROCESSED GOD</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Becoming a Life-Giving Spirit</H2><P>[In eternity past God existed alone. Then, in time, He created all things. At a certain point in history, this creating God, the Creator of all, became a man. This crucial step is called incarnation. By means of incarnation, God put on man with all of creation, for man is the head of creation. The Lord Jesus, God incarnate, lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years. When He was crucified, all creation was crucified with Him. This means that not only did Christ go to the cross, but the very man God had put on Himself with the entire creation went to the cross with Him. Therefore, Christ's death on the cross was an all-inclusive crucifixion. After His crucifixion, Christ was buried in a tomb. The man and the creation which were crucified with Christ were also buried in that tomb. After three days, Christ arose from the dead in His resurrection. Through resurrection and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. Furthermore, in His ascension to the third heaven, He was crowned and became the Head and the Lord over all. Then He descended upon His Body as the all-inclusive Spirit.</P><P>Because God, after completing the work of creation, passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension, we may speak of Him as the processed God. The diagram portrays the process through which He has passed.]</P><P style="align:CENTER">[The Process of the Divine Economy]</P>
