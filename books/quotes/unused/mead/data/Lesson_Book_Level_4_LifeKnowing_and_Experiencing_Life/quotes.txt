[2]  Lesson One DIVINE AND ETERNAL LIFE Scripture Reading 1 John 5:12; John 3:36, 16; 1 Cor 15:45b; Eph 4:16b Outline Three Greek words for life Only the life of God being life The life of God being divine The life of God being eternal The life of God being indestructible We have this life and can experience it every day The experiences of this life The issues of this life The maintenance of this life Text I. THREE GREEK WORDS FOR LIFE
[3]  There are three Greek words denoting the English word life.
[4]  One word is zoe, denoting the divine, eternal, uncreated and indestructible life of God.
[5]  Although there are three types of life for man, yet only the life of God is really life.
[6]  WE HAVE THIS LIFE AND CAN EXPERIENCE IT EVERY DAY
[7]  As a result of regeneration we all have this life and we must thank and praise Him for giving us this life.
[8]  However, we must explore further to better understand this life, so that our experience will be correct and enriched.
[9]  This flowing out of the Triune God means that His content, which is Himself, first flowed out through Christ; then it flowed out as the Spirit to be received by us as life.
[10]  Lesson Three THREE LIVES AND FOUR LAWS Scripture Reading Gen 2:7; Rom 5:12, 19; John 3:15; Rom 8:3; 7:15-16, 22, 24; 8:2, 4, 6, 13 Outline Man having three lives The created life of man in the soul The evil life of Satan in the flesh The divine eternal life of God in the Spirit Four laws related to man The law of God outside of man The law of good in our mind The law of sin in our flesh The law of the Spirit of life in our spirit Our experience of the three lives and the four laws Text I. MAN HAVING THREE LIVES
[11]  In order to learn more about the divine life and its experiences, we must understand the three lives in man.
[12]  B. The Evil Life of Satan in the Flesh
[13]  God's intention in creating man is for man to express Him.
[14]  The law of God, written on stone tables, was given by God to men through Moses during Old Testament times.
[15]  This law, being outside of us, enables us to know what God condemns and what He justifies; it requires us to reject what God condemns and do what God justifies in order to comply with God's holy, righteous, and good statutes.
[16]  When we received the Lord and were saved, the Spirit of God together with the life of God entered into our spirit and mingled with our spirit to become the Spirit of life.
[17]  36:23-28; Rom 8:29; Phil 2:8; John 1:4; 8:12; Psa 36:9; 119:105, 130; 2 Cor 4:6; 3:16 Outline The law of life The definition of the law of life The function of the law of life God's desire is accomplished by the law of life The light of life Life is from light Light is in the Word of God Light is the inner sense of life The way to be enlightened Text I. THE LAW OF LIFE
[18]  Although we have talked about the law of life in the last lesson, we must spend more time on this subject, because the law of life is crucial to our experience of life.
[19]  Without a clear understanding of the law of life, we may try to be a good Christian without the power of life, or we may do nothing and wait for God to do everything for us.
[20]  The law of life is not there to regulate us from within, telling us what to do and what not to do.
[21]  Rather, its main function is to free us from the law of sin and death Rom 8:2 and to conform us to the image of Christ Rom 8:29 so we may express all that God is in our daily living.
[22]  Since life rests with light, with what then does light rest?
[23]  From the Bible we see that light rests with the Word of God.
[24]  Lesson Five THE GROWTH OF LIFE Scripture Reading Gen 2:9; 1 Cor 8:1; 13:2; Eph 3:19; 4:13; Rom 8:6; 2 Cor 4:16 Outline What is not the growth of life?
[25]  The improvement of behavior The increase in knowledge What is the growth of life?
[26]  The increase of the element of God The increase of the stature of Christ The expanding of the ground of the Holy Spirit The decrease of the human element The way to grow in life Text
[27]  I. WHAT IS NOT THE GROWTH OF LIFE? A. The Improvement of Behavior
[28]  Though we need much improvement, improvement of behavior may not be of life.
[29]  We may say that to experience life is to experience the Holy Spirit; therefore, to grow in life also means to allow the Holy Spirit to gain more ground within us.
[30]  To experience God To experience Christ To experience the Spirit The first experience of life regeneration Why regeneration is necessary?
[31]  Christ is God's manifestation and embodiment; He is God becoming our experience.
[32]  Therefore, all our experience of God is the experience of Christ and is in Christ.
[33]  To experience Christ is to let Christ live both within us and out from us; to take Christ as life and thus to live by Christ.
[34]  It is this Holy Spirit of life who causes us to experience the indwelling of Christ, and it is this Holy Spirit of life who causes us to experience the resurrection power of God in Christ Rom 8:9-11 .
[35]  According to the Scripture, to be regenerated is to be born of the Spirit John 3:3-6 .
[36]  Originally our spirit was dead, but at the time we believed, God's Spirit came to touch our spirit; thus our spirit obtained God's life and was made alive.
[37]  In brief, to be regenerated is to be born once again, to be born of God John 1:13 , or, apart from our original human life to obtain God's life.
[38]  Lesson Seven THE SENSE AND FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE Scripture Reading Rom 8:6; Eph 4:19; 2 Cor 13:14; Phil 2:1; 1 John 1:1-7; 2:27 Outline The sense of life The scriptural basis The source of the sense of life The function of the sense of life The fellowship of life The source of the fellowship of life The medium of the fellowship of life The meaning of the fellowship of life We must maintain the fellowship of life The function of the fellowship of life A cycle of life
[39]  Where does the sense of life we are speaking of come from?
[40]  The life of God rests in the Holy Spirit of God, and it is through the Holy Spirit of God that the life of God enters into us and lives in us.
[41]  Therefore, if we desire to have fellowship of life, we must not only have the life of God, but also live in the Holy Spirit of God.
[42]  Questions How is the sense of life revealed in Romans 8:6?
[43]  Lesson Eight CONSECRATION Scripture Reading 2 Tim 4:7-8; 1 Cor 6:20; 1 Pet 1:18-19; Gal 4:5; 2 Cor 5:14-15; Rom 12:1; Lev 3:5, 11 Outline The basis of consecration The motive of consecration God's love The meaning of consecration to be a sacrifice The purpose of consecration to work for God The result of consecration to abandon our future Text
[44]  In order to experience the Lord, we also must be a consecrated person, because the time it takes to grow is long.
[45]  Between the time we are regenerated till the time we are matured, we will face many situations that we may not be happy about.
[46]  Since the meaning of consecration is to become a sacrifice, the thing offered is something which is entirely for God.
[47]  When we first consecrate ourselves, our experience is similar to an embryo in the mother's womb one cannot distinguish the ear, the eye, the mouth, and the nose.
[48]  As we grow in life, however, these five points related to the experience of consecration gradually become formed in us.
[49]  Then we really have a feeling that we have been bought by God and that all our rights are in His hand.
[50]  Lesson Nine PRESERVING OUR WHOLE BEING FOR LIFE Scripture Reading 1 Thes 4:4; 1 Cor 12:3; 1 Thes 5:16-19; 2 Cor 7:1; Acts 24:16; 1 John 1:7-9; Rev 12:10-11; Rom 6:6; 2 Tim 2:22 Outline Preserving our spirit for life Exercising our spirit to contact God Keeping our spirit living Keeping our spirit from defilement Dealing with our conscience to stay living Clearing the arteries of our psychological heart Concerning the mind Concerning the will Concerning the emotion Preserving our body Text
[51]  I. PRESERVING OUR SPIRIT FOR LIFE A. Exercising Our Spirit to Contact God
[52]  Our spirit is composed of three parts: the conscience, the fellowship, and the intuition.
[53]  Our spirit is mainly for us to fellowship with God.
[54]  This contact with God spontaneously gives us a sense of God, a consciousness of God.
[55]  Though we may try to preserve our spirit, we may often become deadened or defiled.
[56]  These feelings indicate to us that we have a problem with God, that the fellowship of life is cut off.
[57]  If we would preserve our body, we should live a life that never follows the old man, that never follows our soul.
[58]  Lesson Ten OBEYING THE TEACHING OF THE ANOINTING Scripture Reading 1 John 2:20, 27; John 1:1, 14; 1 Cor 15:45b; Exo 30:23-25; Rom 8:2, 4, 6, 13 Outline The meaning of the anointing The Holy Spirit The Old Testament type The moving of the Holy Spirit to sanctify us The anointing and the purpose of salvation The anointing and the fellowship of life The anointing and the applying of the blood Knowing the teaching of the anointing The anointing The understanding of the mind The feeling of the conscience Obedience to the teaching of the anointing Walking according to the Spirit Living in fellowship Living in the presence of God The result
[59]  Obeying the teaching of the anointing is the crucial and central experience of our spiritual life.
[60]  V. KNOWING THE TEACHING OF THE ANOINTING A. The Anointing
[61]  The teaching of the anointing comes from the anointing and is the natural result of our being anointed.
[62]  When the anointing is moving within us, on the one hand, it anoints God into us, and on the other hand, it reveals God's mind to us.
[63]  Therefore, the teaching of the anointing has two aspects: first, through the anointing we gain more of God Himself, more of God's components; second, through the teaching we know His mind and live in Him.
[64]  Each time we experience the anointing within us, we gain firstly more of God Himself, more of God's components; this, then, produces a result it causes us to know what God wants us to do.
[65]  Concerning the teaching of the anointing, the Holy Spirit attends to the anointing, and we take care of the obedience.
[66]  Since the anointing is vital to God's presence, we need to obey the teaching so we can experience more of the anointing.
[67]  Then we can live at all times and in all places in the presence of God, living in the light of His face and touching His presence moment by moment.
[68]  When man passes through the veil of the flesh and lives in the presence of God, he enters into the Holy of Holies and lives in the spirit, having fellowship face to face with God.
[69]  Lesson Eleven BEING FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT Scripture Reading Rom 5:5; 1 Cor 15:45b; John 14:16-17; 20:19-22; Acts 13:52; Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4-5, 8; 2:1-4; 1 Cor 12:13, 3; Rom 10:12-13; Acts 2:38; 1 John 1:7-9; Eph 5:18b-19a Outline The need to be filled with the Holy Spirit Who is the Holy Spirit?
[70]  The two aspects of the Holy Spirit The essential aspect for life The economical aspect for power The inward filling of the Spirit for life The outward filling of the Spirit for power The way to be filled with the Holy Spirit The manifestation of being filled with the Holy Spirit Text I. THE NEED TO BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT
[71]  In the past ten lessons, we have shared with you some basic knowledge concerning life and some basic experiences of life for the growth of life.
[72]  V. THE OUTWARD FILLING OF THE SPIRIT FOR POWER
[73]  In Luke 24:49 the Lord Jesus said, "I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you until you are clothed with power from on high.''
[74]  In Acts 1:4-8 He also said, "Wait for the promise of the Father you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you.''
[75]  Lesson Twelve CLEARANCE OF THE PAST Scripture Reading 2 Cor 5:17; Luke 19:1-10; Acts 19:18-19; Rom 8:5-6 Outline Scriptural basis The object of the clearance of the past Unrighteous matters Improper matters Evil and unclean matters Old ways of living The basis of the clearance of the past The degree of ending the past Text
[76]  In the next few lessons we want to see the things that hinder our growth in life.
[77]  If by the Spirit, we deal with these things, we will experience more life and growth.
[78]  Lesson Thirteen DEALING WITH SINS Scripture Reading Matt 5:23-26; 1 John 1:9; Prov 28:13; Luke 19:8; Lev 5:14-16 Outline The scriptural basis The object of our dealing with sins The basis of dealing with sins The limit of our dealing with sins The practice of dealing with sins Dealing with sins and life Text
[79]  "Dealing'' implies that we follow the leading of the Holy Spirit to purge away all the difficulties which hinder the growth of life.
[80]  The more we are being dealt with, the more God's life grows in us.
[81]  Since dealing with sins has such a close relationship with our spiritual life, we should endeavor to experience this lesson continuously.
[82]  Lesson Fourteen DEALING WITH THE WORLD Scripture Reading 1 John 5:4; Gen 2:9; 4:14, 16, 20-22; James 4:4; 1 John 2:15-16; 1 Pet 3:20-21; 1 Cor 10:1-2; Rom 8:6 Outline The difference between sin and the world The formation of the world Man's need A godless civilization Satan's system The definition of the world The contents of the satanic system Delivered from the world through baptism The objects of dealing with the world The basis of dealing with the world The extent of dealing with the world The practice of dealing with the world Not loving the world The regenerated spirit overcoming the world
[83]  Knowing and dealing with the world is very important in the initial experience of our Christian life; therefore, we shall study it carefully.
[84]  Man fell by committing sin and was expelled from the garden of Eden!
[85]  The world in our daily living consists of people, activities, and things which usurp the place of God in us.
[86]  Whenever we deal with the world which we are conscious of, we should deal with it until we have peace and life within.
[87]  Lesson Fifteen DEALING WITH THE FLESH AND THE SELF Scripture Reading Rom 7:23; Gal 5:19-21; Phil 3:3-6; Exo 30:31-32; Rom 8:8; Gal 2:20; Rom 6:6; Gal 5:24; Rom 8:13; Matt 16:21-25 Outline The definition of the flesh The corrupted body The whole fallen man The good aspect of man The position of the flesh before God God cannot mingle with the flesh God and the flesh cannot exist together God is determined to remove the flesh The Bible's conclusion of the flesh Dealing with the flesh The objective fact The subjective experience by the Spirit The definition of self Self is the soul life The damage of self Dealing with self The objective fact The subjective experience Bearing the cross Applying the experience of dealing with self In the fellowship of the Holy Spirit Letting the Holy Spirit execute the crucifixion of Christ upon us
[88]  Sin is ugly and the world is possessing, yet they are still outward.
[89]  We need to see further how to experience life in a deeper way dealing with the flesh and the self.
[90]  What is the position of the flesh before God?
[91]  Questions Give the three definitions of the flesh in the Bible.
[92]  Lesson Sixteen DEALING WITH THE NATURAL CONSTITUTION, INDIVIDUALISM AND DIVISIVENESS Scripture Reading Gen 28:20-22; Acts 7:22; Eph 1:22-23; 5:23b, 25b; 4:16; 1 Cor 1:13; 12:20-21, 25 Outline Natural constitution Definition Dealing with the natural constitution Individualism Definition Dealing with individualism Divisiveness Definition Divisiveness damages the Body of Christ
[93]  Dealing with the natural constitution is a deeper dealing.
[94]  Individually, we may grow in life and express the Lord in our daily living, yet that is not the fullness of Christ.
[95]  Before we were saved, we probably did not realize that such an element existed within our being, that in our natural life there is the tendency to be divisive.
[96]  Lesson Seventeen TWO KINDS OF FRUIT OUT OF THE DIVINE LIFE Scripture Reading Gen 1:26; 2:8-9; Rev 2:7; 22:1-2; 2 Pet 1:1, 3, 8-11; Gal 5:16, 22-23; John 15:5, 16 Outline Life bears fruit The fruit of Christian virtues The fruit of saved persons regenerated with the divine life Bearing two kinds of fruit for a rich entrance into the coming kingdom Text I. LIFE BEARS FRUIT
[97]  If you have seen the points from the previous lessons and practice accordingly, you will have much experience of life and growth in life.
[98]  According to the Bible and according to our experience, this life produces two categories of fruit.
[99]  THE FRUIT OF SAVED PERSONS REGENERATED WITH THE DIVINE LIFE
[100]  Lesson Eighteen BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST IN ONENESS Scripture Reading John 1:12; 1 Cor 12:27; Matt 7:17-18; John 14:6; 15:16; Matt 28:19; 1 Pet 2:2; Eph 4:3, 11-12a Outline Life issues in the building up of the Body of Christ The Body of Christ being an organism not an organization The way to build up the Body of Christ By the gospel By the growth of life By keeping the oneness of the Spirit By perfecting the saints By the functions of the perfected saints Text I. LIFE ISSUES IN THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST
[101]  The second issue of life is the Body of Christ.
[102]  As the members of the Body of Christ, we need to be constituted with Christ as our life and be built up in oneness so that corporately, we may become the fullness of God.
[103]  THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING AN ORGANISM NOT AN ORGANIZATION
[104]  The Body of Christ, the church, is not an organization but an organism, an issue of the dispensing of the Triune God into us as life.
[105]  Ephesians 4:3 says, "Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.''
[106]  Without oneness, there is no way to build up the Body of Christ; therefore, we all must be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit.
[107]  Lesson Nineteen REIGNING IN LIFE, THE KINGDOM REWARD, AND THE NEW JERUSALEM Scripture Reading Gen 1:26; Phil 3:11, 21; Matt 25:10, 12, 21, 23, 30; 1 Cor 3:15; Rev 2:26; 20:4; 22:12; Eph 5:25-27; Rev 21:10-11, 23; 22:1-2, 5 Outline Reigning in life The kingdom reward The New Jerusalem A city of life A city under God's authority A city of fellowship A city of light A city of fruit-bearing A city of oneness A city of blessing A city of transformed men A city of the expression of God A city of the dominion of God Text I. REIGNING IN LIFE
[108]  Another issue of life that we can experience in this age is reigning in life.
[109]  Simply speaking, to reign is to exercise authority for God to rule all things and in particular to deal with His enemy.
[110]  After we have experienced life and grow in life, resulting in the issues of fruit-bearing, building up of the Body of Christ, and reigning in life, we have made ourselves ready for the Lord's return.
[111]  Therefore, as young Christians, we must aspire to receive the kingdom reward by being normal Christians, experiencing life every day to grow in life until we reach maturity, bearing fruits of virtue, bearing fruits of people, building up the Body of Christ, and reigning in life for God.
[112]  Lesson Twenty MAINTAINING A STRONG SPIRIT BY CALLING AND PRAYING Scripture Reading Acts 2:21; Rom 10:12-13; Acts 9:14; 22:16; 2 Tim 2:22; 1 Cor 1:2; Psa 116:2, 4, 13, 17; Isa 12:2-4, 6; 1 Thes 5:17; 1 John 1:7-9; Matt 18:18-19; John 15:16 Outline The need to have a strong spirit Calling on the name of the Lord Calling in the Old Testament Practiced by New Testament believers The purpose of calling The way to call The need of practice Praying to contact, to enjoy, and to fellowship with God Praying to exercise God's authority for God's eternal purpose Text
[113]  In these remaining five lessons we will address the matters concerning the maintenance of life in our daily life and the church life.
[114]  It is not enough just to know about life and know about how to experience life, we also need to know how to maintain the life that is in us.
[115]  Calling on the name of the Lord is the easiest, the fastest, and the best way to exercise our spirit, to touch our spirit, and to maintain a strong spirit.
[116]  Why do we need to call on the name of the Lord?
[117]  Lesson Twenty-One BEING ENRICHED WITH THE WORD BY PRAY-READING, READING, STUDYING, AND MEMORIZING Scripture Reading John 1:1, 14; 6:63; 1 Pet 1:23; 2:2; Matt 4:4; Jer 15:16; Job 23:12b; Eph 6:17-18a; Col 3:16; Eccl.
[118]  12:1; Psa 119:11 Outline The importance of the Word of God to the believers The essence of the Word of God being life to the believers The function of the Word of God giving life to the believers Causing men to be regenerated Being the believers' spiritual milk Being the believers' bread of life Using our spirit and our mental faculty to receive the Spirit and life from the Word of God By pray-reading By reading By studying By memorizing Text I. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WORD OF GOD TO THE BELIEVERS
[119]  Most Christians know that the Bible is the Word of God.
[120]  USING OUR SPIRIT AND OUR MENTAL FACULTY TO RECEIVE THE SPIRIT AND LIFE FROM THE WORD OF GOD
[121]  You also need to use your mind in studying the Word of God.
[122]  Lesson Twenty-Two SPEAKING THE WORD OF CHRIST TO REMAIN IN LIFE Scripture Reading Acts 5:20; John 15:2, 6; Eph 5:4; Col 3:8; Eph 4:29; 1 Cor 12:2, 3; Eph 5:18-19; 2 Cor 4:13; Rom 10:14, 17; 1 Cor 14:26, 4-5, 12, 31 Outline Being channels of life Living organs to speak Christ Speaking for the dispensing of life Speaking in the Holy Spirit Speaking by the spirit of faith Speaking at every time and in every place to every person Speaking in the meetings Text I. BEING CHANNELS OF LIFE
[123]  After our regenerated spirit is strengthened by calling on the name of the Lord and by praying to contact God, to enjoy God, to fellowship with God, and to absorb God, as well as to bind the devil and loose people and situations for God's economy; after we are enriched and equipped with the Word by means of pray-reading, reading, studying, and memorizing, we have to learn to speak the word of Christ in spirit.
[124]  In previous lessons we have seen that life is God the Father in Christ Jesus the Son as the Spirit flowing into, through, and out of us.
[125]  By speaking the word of Christ, we allow God to flow through us and out of us to be life to others.
[126]  God created us with vocal chords, a tongue, lips, and teeth that we may be filled with Christ who is the Word of God.
[127]  SPEAKING AT EVERY TIME AND IN EVERY PLACE TO EVERY PERSON
[128]  Lesson Twenty-Three LIVING A NORMAL CHRISTIAN LIFE Scripture Reading Rev 2:4-5; 3:14-16; Psa 119:147-148; 2 Tim 1:6a; Rom 12:11; 1 John 1:6; 2 Cor 13:14; Gal 5:16; Rom 8:4; 1 Cor 6:17; Phil 1:19-21; John 7:37-39 Outline Loving the Lord Being revived every morning Living a victorious life every day Abiding in the fellowship with the Lord daily and hourly Being a praying person Walking by and according to our mingled spirit Living Christ for His magnification Text I. LOVING THE LORD
[129]  In this lesson we want to fellowship about having a normal daily Christian life that is in spirit and expresses Christ.
[130]  Lesson Twenty-Four HAVING A NORMAL CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading Heb 1:9; 3:14; 2 Tim 2:22; Matt 18:19; 28:18-20; 1 Pet 1:23; 2:2; 2 Tim 2:2; John 12:24; 1 Cor 14:1, 4, 12, 26, 39; Psa 45:1; Matt 16:18 Outline Having partners in Christ Preaching Christ to beget members for the Body of Christ Nourishing the new ones in Christ Perfecting the younger ones to function Building up the Body through prophesying in the church meetings Text I. HAVING PARTNERS IN CHRIST
[131]  We need to have a normal Christian life as well as a normal church life.
[132]  Individually, we need to grow in life; corporately, we need to be built up in life.
[133]  After they have believed and are baptized, they are saved Mark 16:16 , and have been born of God John 1:12 to be members of the Body of Christ 1 Cor 12:12-13 .
[134]  V. BUILDING UP THE BODY THROUGH PROPHESYING IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS
[135]  The final step is to prophesy and help your new ones to prophesy in the church meeting so that you may build up the church, the Body of Christ.
[136]  If you and all the saints in the churches will rise up to experience life, to grow in life, to deal with all the hindrances by repenting and confessing, to maintain a strong spirit by calling and praying, to be enriched with the Word of God by pray-reading, reading, studying, and memorizing, to speak Christ every day in every place to every person, to live a normal Christian daily life, and to have a normal church life, then the Body of Christ will be built, the Lord will return, you will enter into the millennial kingdom as a reward, and finally, you will be the New Jerusalem for eternity.
