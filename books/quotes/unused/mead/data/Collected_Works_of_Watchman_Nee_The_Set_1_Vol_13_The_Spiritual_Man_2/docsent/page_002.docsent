   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION FOUR THE SPIRIT CHAPTER ONE THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE BELIEVER'S SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The knowledge most lacking among believers today concerns the existence of the human spirit and its function.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many believers do not know they have a spirit in addition to their mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even after hearing that there is a spirit within man, they either think that their mind, emotion, or will is the spirit, or they are puzzled and do not know where their spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This ignorance is a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because of this, believers do not know how to cooperate with God, control themselves, and fight against Satan, since all these three things require the work of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The most important thing that a believer should know is that there is a spirit within him besides the thought, knowledge, and imagination of the mind; the feeling, love, and desire of the emotion; and the ideas, opinion, and determination of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The spirit is deeper than the mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A believer should know that he has a spirit; he also should know the feeling of the spirit, its working, its power, and the principle of its activity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only in this way will a believer be able to know how to walk according to the spirit, not according to the fleshly soul or body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>An unregenerated person's spirit and soul are constituted together.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Naturally, he only knows the feelings of the soul, which are strong and powerful, and does not know the existence of the spirit, which is dead and dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This ignorance started when he was a sinner and continues even after he becomes a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although a believer has life in his spirit and the experience of overcoming "fleshly things," he sometimes walks according to the spirit and sometimes according to the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He does not know what the spirit demands, how the spirit initiates, or how to nourish the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He does not know the feeling of the spirit and the meaning that these feelings represent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Naturally, he restricts the life of the spirit and lets the natural life of the soul continue to act as the principle of his living.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This matter is very serious; it is beyond the common believer's imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are some believers who faithfully seek higher and deeper spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After they have the experience of overcoming sins, they no longer go forward because they do not know the work of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, they pursue after "spiritual and biblical knowledge" in their mind; they seek after the Lord's presence in their feelings and a kind of burning feeling in their members; and they mostly behave and walk according to the power of their own will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This causes the believer to be deceived and over-emphasize his own soulish experience, thinking himself to be super-spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This will cultivate his "self" life soul to a great extent.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He subjectively thinks that his experience is spiritually solid, which will keep him from progressing in the spiritual path.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, God's children should humble themselves before God, subject themselves to the Holy Spirit and biblical teachings, and gradually examine the function and work of the spirit in order that they may walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE REGENERATION OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>COMPARE WITH SECTION ONE, CHAPTER FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why should a sinner be regenerated?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why should he be born from above and have a regeneration of the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because man is a fallen spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a fallen spirit, man needs a regeneration of the spirit to receive a new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Satan is a fallen spirit and man is also a fallen spirit, except that man has a body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Satan's fall was before man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By knowing Satan's fall, we may know our fall.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Satan is a spirit who was created by God to have a direct fellowship with God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, he fell, became the leader of the authority of darkness, and was separated from God and all the virtues of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nevertheless, Satan did not lose his existence because of his fall; rather, he just lost his normal relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Similarly, man, like Satan, fell into darkness and was separated from God, yet man's spirit still exists.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now his spirit is separated from God and cannot fellowship or reign.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Spiritually speaking, man's spirit is already dead.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Just as the sinful archangel's spirit exists forever, sinful man's spirit also exists forever.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, man has a body, and his fall caused him to become a fleshly man Gen 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No religion, ethics, culture, or law in this world can improve this fallen human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since man has now fallen into the position of flesh, nothing can enable him to become a spirit again.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, regeneration the regeneration of the spirit is a must.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only God's Son, who shed His blood to cleanse us from our sin and give us a new life, can bring us back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When a sinner believes in the Lord Jesus, he is regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God gives the sinner His own uncreated life to enliven the sinner's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The regeneration of a sinner is a matter in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All God's work begins within man, from center to circumference, unlike Satan who works from the outside to the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God's purpose is, firstly, to give life to man's darkened spirit, where man should receive God's life and fellowship with God, and to cause it to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then He works from there, spreading out to man's soul and body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Regeneration causes man to receive a new spirit on one hand and, on the other hand, causes his old spirit to be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Concerning regeneration, Ezekiel 36:26 says, "And a new spirit will I put within you."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>John 3:6 says, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The "spirit" mentioned in these two verses refers to God's own life, because this is not the spirit which we had originally but that which is given to us by God at the time of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This new life is "divine" 2 Pet 1:4 and "cannot sin" 1 John 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The spirit which man originally had, although it has been enlivened, may still be defiled 2 Cor 7:1 and needs to be sanctified 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When God's life which also is called the "Spirit" enters into our human spirit, it enlivens our spirit which was in a state like a drunken stupor.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Formerly our spirit was "alienated from the life of God" Eph 4:18 , but now it has been made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, "the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness" Rom 8:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What we lost in Adam was the spirit which died; what we receive at regeneration is this dead spirit which has been enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, we not only obtain what we had lost in Adam, we also receive a new spirit with God's life which Adam never had.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As a result of seeing this, we understand the vanity of self-improvement, exhortations to do good, revival, repentance, etc. No matter what man does on his own, he cannot enliven his spirit, nor can he receive a "new spirit." Regardless of how he improves, that which is dead is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Regardless of how he repairs, that which is old is still old.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Unless man receives a new life from above, no matter how diligently he studies religion and practices morality, he will not be able to make his spirit alive and new.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Only the new Spirit of God can enliven man's old spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Those who want to make their spirit alive but do not receive God's new Spirit of life will be dead forever.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A man without regeneration has absolutely nothing to do with Christ Rom 8:9 ; therefore, every so-called believer should ask himself whether he has been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Only those who receive God's surpassing life are God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Being His children and yet not being born of Him is an absurdity.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God's life is most often called "eternal life" in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This word "life" is zoe in the original language, which means higher life or spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus is regenerated and receives eternal life as soon as he believes.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>What is the function of the eternal life?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>"And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ" John 17:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Therefore, eternal life is not only a later blessing for believers' enjoyment but also a spiritual ability.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Without eternal life we do not know God, neither can we know the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Knowing the Lord by intuition comes after man receives God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This tiny bit of God's life within man can eventually develop and grow into a spiritual man.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After man's regeneration, all of God's purpose is that many, through His Spirit, may remove everything that belongs to the old creation; all of God's work in man is also in the spirit.</S>
