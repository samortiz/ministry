We shall also speak further on the six matters that form the extract of chapter one, which is a prologue of the entire book: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb of God, the Dove upon the Lamb, the stone, and the house of God.<h2 class=head1>I. JOHN&#8217;S WRITINGS</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Not Only Supplementary but Also Consummating</h2><p>Throughout the centuries, teachers and expositors have agreed that John&#8217;s writings were the last of the New Testament writings to be completed. All of the Epistles of Paul and Peter were completed approximately A.D. 65. It was about a quarter of a century later, that is, approximately A.D. 90, that John composed three categories of writings: the Gospel, the Epistles, and the Revelation. The Gospel of John, the Epistles of John, and the book of Revelation were the last books of the Bible to be written.<p>John&#8217;s writings are not only supplementary but also consummating. The Gospel of John consummates the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. John&#8217;s Epistles consummate all the other Epistles, and John&#8217;s Revelation consummates the entire New Testament, even the entire Bible. John&#8217;s writings, therefore, are both supplementary and consummating.<h2 class=head2>1. Supplementary to the Synoptic Gospels with the View of Christ&#8217;s Deity</h2><p>The Gospel of John supplements the synoptic Gospels with the view of Christ&#8217;s deity. Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called synoptic Gospels. The word synoptic means having one point of view. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke were written from the point of view of Christ&#8217;s humanity. Matthew reveals that Christ is the King; Mark, that He is the Servant of God; and Luke, that He is our Savior. The King, the Servant, and the Savior are all aspects of Christ in His humanity. But the Lord Jesus is God as well as man, divine as well as human. Therefore, there is the need of a supplement to the synoptic Gospels showing Christ&#8217;s deity. The Gospel of John is both supplementary and consummating, for it unveils the divine side of the wonderful Person of Christ. In John&#8217;s writings we have a view of Christ&#8217;s deity.<h2 class=head2>2. Consummating the Divine Revelation with the Divine Person, the Divine Life, the Divine Nature, and the Divine Accomplishments of the Triune God</h2><p>The writings of John consummate the divine revelation with the divine Person, the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine accomplishments of the Triune God. In John&#8217;s Gospel, Epistles, and Revelation we can see how much the divine Father has accomplished. Whatever He has accomplished is divine. In John&#8217;s writings we also see how much has been accomplished by the Son and the Holy Spirit. Whatever is accomplished by the Triune God is divine and mysterious.<h2 class=head2>B. Not Only Polemical but Also Unveiling</h2><p>Some theologians say that John&#8217;s writings are polemical or argumentative. The word &#8220;polemical&#8221; is derived from the Greek word for war and denotes a controversial argument, in particular an argument against some opinion or doctrine. John&#8217;s writings are polemical in that he was fighting against the heresies regarding Christ&#8217;s Person. However, his writings are not only polemical but also unveiling. They unveil the mysteries of the divine economy of the Triune God. In the writings of John one veil after another is taken away. The book of Revelation is a book of unveiling. (In Greek, the word &#8220;revelation&#8221; means unveiling.) Even now, God&#8217;s administration is being carried out in the universe. Unbelievers do not see God&#8217;s administration and do not have any knowledge of it. But because the veil has been taken away, we can see that Christ is on the throne in the heavens carrying out God&#8217;s administration. This is one of the mysteries of the divine economy of the Triune God. John&#8217;s writings are not merely polemical or argumentative, but even the more, they are unveiling.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
