   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>P. The Wife of Uriah Bathsheba</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>David murdered Uriah and took his wife, Bathsheba.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She was the wife of a Hittite, a heathen 2 Sam 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>She was remarried as a result of adultery 2 Sam 11:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Q. Solomon</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After David committed murder and adultery, he was rebuked by the prophet Nathan, whom God sent purposely to condemn him 2 Sam 12:1-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After he was condemned, David repented.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Psalm 51 is David s psalm of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>David repented and God forgave 2 Sam 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There was repentance and there was forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Altogether we have three items here: transgression, repentance, and forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we put all three together, the result is Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First there were transgression and repentance plus forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After that, there was Solomon 2 Sam 12:24 , the one who built God s temple.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Solomon is the result not only of transgression and repentance, but of transgression, repentance, and God s forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here we see two marriages.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first was a marriage between David and Bathsheba.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The second was a spiritual marriage, the marriage of David s transgression and repentance with God s forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God s forgiveness married David s transgression and repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This marriage brought forth the man named Solomon who built the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church is always built up by this kind of person, Solomon, the issue of man s transgression and repentance plus God s forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After David received God s forgiveness and the joy of his salvation was restored, he prayed for Zion, for the building of the walls of Jerusalem, for the strengthening of his kingdom Psa 51:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, as the result of God s forgiveness of his sin, God gave him a son to build the temple of God for God s presence as the center of the city of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I hope the Lord will show you what human words cannot say.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you have been and still are a typically good person who has never murdered others, who has never transgressed, and who has never needed to repent, then God does not need to forgive you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If this is the case, then there will never be a Solomon, and the temple of God will never be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we have seen, the building up of God s temple comes from man s transgression and repentance plus God s forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One day I said to the Lord, Lord, my transgression and repentance need Your forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But, Lord, You know better than I that Your forgiveness also needs my transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My transgression needs Your forgiveness, and Your forgiveness needs my transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If I have no transgressions, then You don t have a place to spend Your forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I said this to the Lord, it seemed that He said, Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because of your transgression and repentance, I do have an opportunity to spend My forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am happy about this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But you should never say, Let us do evil that good may come.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You must do your best.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But no matter how hard you may try to do everything right in the eyes of the Lord, sooner or later something will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Suddenly, you will murder, take over others, transgress.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, after you transgress, there will be a way for you to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you repent, God will be ready to forgive you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then you will beget a son and name him Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The name Solomon means peaceful 2 Sam 12:24; 1 Chron 22:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But Solomon also has another name, Jedidiah 2 Sam 12:25 , which means beloved of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To you, Solomon means peaceful, but to the Lord, he means beloved of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This son will be the one who will build up the house of God, today s church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You need to be right in the eyes of God all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But be assured that your being right is not good for building up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, you should not say, Let me do wrong!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I tell you, even if you try to be wrong, you will discover that you are not able to do wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I do not know what kind of sovereignty this is.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But one day you will do something awful.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All the brothers will shake their heads, unable to believe that you could have done such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nevertheless, you have done it!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then you need to read Psalm 51, make it your psalm, and go to the Lord, saying, Lord, I repent.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Against Thee and only Thee have I done this evil thing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After this repentance, you will have another marriage, the marriage of your transgression and repentance with God s forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This will bring forth a Solomon, one who is peaceful to you and beloved of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This person will build up the church, God s temple.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At that time you will be very useful in the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You may say, What about today?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What shall we do wait for that kind of person to come?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>No, do not wait.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Your waiting does not avail.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should just walk in the presence of the Lord and let the Lord do it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As Charles Wesley said in one of his hymns, Tis mercy all!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Yes, it is altogether a matter of God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Forget about your background, your situation, or what may happen in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You simply need to trust in the Lord s sovereign mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you have a heart for Him and for His people, He will work everything out.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He will give you the full enjoyment of the birthright of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>These verses in the genealogy of Christ are very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They are not milk or meat; they are bones.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we spend an hour or two praying over these verses and over the points covered in this message, we shall see something more.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We shall see that we need to be a person with a real seeking heart, a heart seeking God and God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then we shall be today s Boaz, Ruth, Obed, Jesse, David, and eventually today s Solomon, building up the house of God.</S>
