THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY BEING THE LABORING WAY</H2><P>The God-ordained way is the laboring way (Col. 1:29; 1 Cor. 15:10, 58). To labor is more than to work. Without our laboring, there can be no practice of the God-ordained way. The New Testament tells us clearly that Paul was a laboring apostle. In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul said that he labored more than all the other apostles. In Colossians 1:29 Paul used a word that is even stronger than the word labored. There he said that he was struggling according to God's operation, which operated in him in power. In his use of these terms, Paul was probably alluding to the competing of athletes in the Olympic games. In every event in the Olympics, the athletes are struggling to gain the crown (1 Cor. 9:25).</P><P>In Romans 15:16 Paul said that he was a laboring priest of the gospel of God. In that verse the word laboring has the same root in Greek as the word energizing. Energy is the noun, whereas energize is the verb. There Paul said that he was energizing himself. To energize yourself is to use the last ounce of your strength. In other words, it is to pour out the last drop of your blood. It also means to exhaust yourself. In carrying out his ministry for God's economy, Paul exhausted himself. If we do anything by taking the way of laboring, struggling, and energizing ourselves, we will surely have a success.</P><P>I have participated in the Lord's work in His recovery for more than sixty years. In this work I have never suffered a defeat. I would not be defeated. I may be defeated today, but I will persevere in the same thing for another period of time.</P><P>My ministering on the God-ordained way has been like a coach's instructing of his players. At the present time there is the need for some to develop my teaching into a practical, detailed way. One of the points that I stressed repeatedly is that every local church should have one-third of its members going out in a regularly scheduled way to visit people for the gospel. In Taipei one brother picked up a burden for this matter. Within half a year he stirred up the entire church in Taipei, which has over five thousand regular attendants each Lord's Day morning. Through this stirring up, one-third of the saints began to practice the regular going out for the preaching of the gospel. That was a great help to Taipei. Now Taipei has seventeen hundred people going out regularly in a scheduled way to gain people. If they do not gain one within a year, surely they will gain one within two years. If we would go to visit people according to a regular schedule, we cannot care for our "climate." Whether we are happy or full of anxiety, whether we are victorious or defeated, we still must go. I doubt that many of us have ever practiced this way. We are all easily directed by our "climate." Just a little "rain" and we stop going. We may intend to go out to contact people, but then something may happen to stop us. We do not go, because the "weather" is not good. This causes us to change our schedule.</P><P>In my ministry concerning the God-ordained way, I also stressed very much that we need to learn how to prophesy, and we need to train the saints how to prophesy. Another brother in Taipei picked up this burden, and today the saints in his district in Taipei are excelling in the matter of prophesying.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Practice of the Church Life according to the God-ordained Way &nbsp; pg 59</div><br></body></html>
