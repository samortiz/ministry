   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN CRUCIAL POINTS CONCERNING THE ADVANCE AND PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY LEADING FOR THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since we began to change the system to the new way in October 1984, we have released almost fifty messages concerning the practice of the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, because I was busy working on the Recovery Version of the New Testament in Chinese, I was not able to give the church much leadership or help, nor was I able to give much help to the full-time training.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the Lord allows, we will use the next four months to lead the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We will not hold message meetings or training meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>During the last two and a half years our labor was concentrated on the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Last summer we spent all our energy on a college conference and training, and about ten days ago we had a special gospel meeting for the young people in a stadium.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The stadium had seating for eleven thousand, but fifteen to sixteen thousand young people came to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There were thirteen thousand high school students present.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In addition, one hundred fifty people were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was the result of the work among the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even though we did a good job, we should not be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul said that we do not have anything that we did not receive.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we should not be proud 1 Cor 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church in Taipei has neglected the elderly saints, the working saints, and the housewives.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to make up for this lack and meet with these saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the meantime, the trainees will go to the campuses to gain students.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Recently the trainees have been saying that the fire of the gospel on the campuses is of eternal value.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The trainees will spend the next six months preaching the gospel on the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They want to baptize one-tenth of the university students in Taipei into the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The young people are full of potential.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If they begin to run on the new way, none of us will be able to keep up with them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The campus work is truly of eternal value.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should all rejoice because the young people s work is full of hope.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We will meet with the elderly saints and the working saints because we have neglected them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must seek the Lord s leading concerning these meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We will meet for four or five weeks or even longer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In any event, we must seek the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Please pray for this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE WORLD SITUATION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>WORKING FOR THE LORD S MOVE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 1984 we began to change the system to the new way because we saw a clear picture in the Bible concerning the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We also examined the world situation in light of the prophecies in the Bible that we had studied in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 1962 I began the work in America.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The following year I pointed out that according to the prophecies in the Bible, the world situation will eventually come to the day when the whole world is focused on the Middle East, because everyone will depend on the Middle East for oil.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 1973 there was a global oil crisis.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today the situation in the Middle East is the object of concern to the entire world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may also become anxious after reading about certain situations in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even though we may become anxious, we should take heed to the prophetic word, because it is like a lamp shining in a dark place 2 Pet 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have the prophetic word, which shines as a lamp in the night.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, we do not need to walk in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have light; we are not like the people in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 1958 I was invited to give conferences in England and Denmark, and I visited some countries in Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Denmark I visited a few saints who did not have a clear view of the world situation and who therefore had the concept that Taiwan s situation was not favorable.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everything that I said to them in fellowship has become a fact of history.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Taiwan is standing strong and is recognized by all the civilized countries in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Taiwan has even become one of the leading economic countries in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are truly in the last days, and we must be faithful to continue in the way that the Lord has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must see that the Lord wants to move quickly in these days and that we need to endeavor to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE ENTIRE EARTH BEING OPEN</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>TO THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is another point that we should pay attention to.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to our observations, during the past two thousand years of church history the gospel work was able to gain only small areas.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hudson Taylor went to China, but he was able to gain only the interior of China, and the missionaries who went to Africa gained only isolated places in Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In contrast, today all six continents are open to the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In order to facilitate the work of the gospel in every country, we recently translated the booklet The Mystery of Human Life into thirty-six different languages.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This means that if one thousand brothers and sisters are trained in the truth, are experienced in the divine life, and know some languages, they can take The Mystery of Human Life all over the world to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All of South America is open to the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There are about two hundred localities in the country of Brazil, and the countries in Central America are open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Countries are opening to us, not just cities.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Mexico and Puerto Rico are open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>West Africa, North Africa, East Africa, and South Africa are open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we could send one to two hundred brothers and sisters to Africa, they would help to meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Europe, Australia, and New Zealand are also open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The entire earth is open to the Lord s recovery.</S>
