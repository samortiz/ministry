<h2 class="head2">The &ldquo;Bachelor&rdquo; God</h2>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we have the divine Word, including both the Old Testament and the New Testament, from Genesis through Revelation. Genesis 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; Although this verse is wonderful, it indicates that God was alone. God was the &ldquo;bachelor&rdquo; God. God was not content in Genesis 1:1, because He was a bachelor and desired to be married. Genesis 2:18 says, &ldquo;Jehovah God said, It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper as his counterpart.&rdquo; This verse is not merely part of a story; it is the expression of God&rsquo;s desire. By saying that it was not good for the man to be alone, God was declaring to the universe that it was not good for Him to be alone, that God needed a wife.</p>
<p>Regrettably, it is very unlikely that we would hear such a word among Christians. If this word seems to be too strong to us, it may be because we are caged by a religious concept. In John 3:29 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;He who has the bride is the bridegroom.&rdquo; Christ is the Bridegroom, and the church is the bride. We need to see not only that Christ is the Lamb of God (1:36) but also that Christ is the Bridegroom who will have His bride. Revelation 19:7 says, &ldquo;Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Marrying a Corporate Bride</h2>
<p>At the end of the divine Word we can see that God marries a corporate bride, a city-lady. The apostle John wrote, &ldquo;I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband&rdquo; (21:2). Our destiny is not to go up to heaven but to come down out of heaven to the earth as the bride whom Christ will marry. Thus, we should not remain in Genesis 1 but should go on to the last two chapters of the divine Word, where God is no longer a bachelor but a &ldquo;married&rdquo; God. In Revelation 21 and 22 Christ marries a corporate bride who includes all His believers.</p>
<p>The Bible is truly the divine book. Genesis 1:1 is necessary, but there was no Hallelujah when God created the heavens and the earth. The Hallelujah comes in Revelation 19:6-7 when the time has come for the marriage of the Lamb. A wedding is the happiest time in human life. Because a wedding is a type or a figure of the marriage of the Lamb, it is the time to say Hallelujah! We should not say Hallelujah merely because we receive a good job, are healed, or move into a nice house. The only thing that is worthwhile of saying Hallelujah is a wedding. However, a human wedding is only a shadow. The real wedding is the marriage of the Lamb, the wedding of Christ and the church. When we meet as the church today, we are joyful because we experience a foretaste of the wedding feast of Christ and the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Two Becoming One in Marriage</h2>
<p>The thought of God marrying a corporate bride is not a human concept but the revelation of the divine book. Genesis 1 through Revelation 22 reveals that the &ldquo;bachelor&rdquo; God marries a city-lady composed of all His redeemed people. Thus, for eternity God has a wife; He is the married God. In type, a husband and wife are always one. Genesis 2:24 says, &ldquo;They shall become one flesh.&rdquo; First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; The Lord and we are no longer two; we are truly one. I once asked an older brother what time he had arrived at the meeting hall. He replied that the first half of him arrived at a certain time and that the second half of him arrived a little later. We should all learn to speak this way. A complete person is two halves. An unmarried brother is only a half. When he finds a sister who matches him and they are married, he becomes a whole. It takes two halves to make a whole melon. Without a counterpart we are like half a melon. The church as the bride of Christ is truly one with Christ. Christ is the first half, and we are the second half. This is the reason that the Hallelujah does not come until the end of Revelation. When the time has come for the marriage of the Lamb, the Hallelujah comes. The church life today is a foretaste of that wedding day. We are happy because we are enjoying the foretaste of that wedding day.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
