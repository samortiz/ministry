<h2 class=head2>For the Drawing of All Men to Christ</h2><p>In 12:32 the Lord Jesus said, “And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself.” This indicates that Christ’s all-inclusive death was for the drawing of all men to Himself.<p>All those who are drawn to Him eventually become the fruits produced by His death and resurrection. On the one hand, we are those who have been drawn to the Lord. On the other hand, we are grains produced by the death and resurrection of Christ. Praise the Lord that we are the grains and that we are the drawn ones! Praise the Lord that the church life has been multiplied! In fact, this multiplication is still taking place, for many are still being drawn to Christ.<p>What we have covered in the foregoing message and in this message is an extract of chapter twelve of the Gospel of John. In this extract we have a miniature of the church life, which is the outcome of Christ as the offerings. In this church life we enjoy Christ as the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering. The quality of this miniature of the church life in John 12 is perfect, but the quantity is too small, too limited. Therefore, there is the need of multiplication through Christ’s death and resurrection. The very One who is the offerings is here portrayed as a grain of wheat falling into the ground to die in order to release the life from within Him to produce many grains. As we have pointed out, through His death many have been drawn to Him. Whoever is drawn to Christ will become a grain as Christ’s reproduction. These grains will be blended together to be one loaf, which is the church, the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF RELIGION’S BLINDNESS</h2><p>In 12:35-50 we have the negative sign of religion’s blindness. In verses 35, 36, and 46 we see the rejection of the light, and in verses 37 through 50, the unbelief of the hardened heart. Religion always is a matter of blindness. If you are religious, you are blind. Religion may be the highest product of human culture, but as far as Jesus Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, is concerned, religion is blind. Religion preoccupies people, veils them, and blinds them. In the previous message we pointed out that in the Gospel of John there were two kinds of worship: one in the temple in Jerusalem and the other in the house in Bethany. The worship in the temple in Jerusalem was religious, a worship according to religious regulations, rituals, ceremonies, and forms. The worship in the house in Bethany was without rituals, regulations, or forms. Where was God at that time? He was not in the midst of the formal worship in the temple in Jerusalem; rather, He was in the midst of the informal feasting in the house in Bethany.<p>According to John 12, those who were blinded by religion were even plotting to kill the incarnated God and also Lazarus, one of those who were enjoying Him. Do not think that the religious situation is different today. In principle, it is the same now as it was in John 12. We know this from our own experience. Although we love the Word of God and spend much time in it, we are criticized, slandered, and falsely accused. We are opposed by certain ones who do not see the matter in the Scriptures concerning the Triune God dispensing Himself into our being to be our life and life supply so that we may be His expression. Today also, the religious ones are blind and hardened in heart. This is the significance of the sign in John 12 of religion’s blindness.
