	<li>As a cluster of henna flowers&mdash;Christ in His resurrection for her to express&mdash;1:14.</li>
	<li>As her Husband in the divine life as the couch, in Christ in His resurrection as the beams, and in Christ in His death as the rafters for their shelter&mdash;1:16-17.</li>
	<li>As an apple tree as the bountiful supply of life to her and its shade overshadowing her&mdash;2:3; 2 Cor. 12:9.</li>
