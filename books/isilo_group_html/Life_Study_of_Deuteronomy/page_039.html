In the New Jerusalem there is just one street, which is of pure gold (Rev. 21:21), signifying that the nature of God is our way. The river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb and flows in the midst of the street (Rev. 22:1). This indicates that God is both our life and our way. We take God as our life, and His life with His nature then becomes the way in which we walk. Today we all should fear God and walk in His ways.</P><P>In Deuteronomy 10:12 Moses also charged the people to love God. This word love implies a great deal. For instance, it implies the matter of affection, which is something very tender. God Himself has set an example of loving by setting His affection on His people. Moses refers to this in verses 14 and 15. "Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens belong to Jehovah your God, the earth and all that is in it. But on your fathers Jehovah set His affection to love them and to choose their seed after them, that is, you above all the peoples, as it is this day." Now we should love God by setting our affection on Him.</P><P>In verse 12 Moses speaks of loving and serving God with all our heart and with all our soul. Our heart is linked to our spirit, for our conscience, which is of our spirit, is also a part of our heart. Thus, to love and serve God with all our heart and soul indicates that we love and serve Him also with our spirit. Furthermore, according to 6:5, we are to love Him also with all our might, that is, with our physical strength. Today, if we would serve God by practicing the new way, we need to serve with our spirit and with all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our strength. To visit people in order to get them saved and baptized and then to care for them afterward requires all our heart, soul, and strength.</P><P>In 10:13 Moses went on to say, "So that you would keep the commandments of Jehovah and His statutes, which I am commanding you today, for your good." Instead of "for your good," we could also say "that you may be blessed." Today we need to keep Christ and the riches of Christ which have been ministered to us so that we may be blessed.</P><P>Moses continued his charge by saying, "Circumcise then the foreskin of your heart, and do not be stiff-necked any longer" (v. 16). Because the children of Israel were a peculiar people to God, His treasure, they were required to cleanse themselves, to circumcise the unclean thing in their heart.</P><P>In verse 20 Moses says, "You shall fear Jehovah your God; Him shall you serve and to Him shall you hold fast and by His name shall you swear." Today we must hold fast to the Lord Jesus. In holding fast to Him, we may say, "Lord, I will not let You go. You must live for me."</P><P>In this verse Moses speaks not only of holding fast to God but also of swearing by His name. I believe that for the children of Israel to swear by the Lord's name was to call on His name. This was the ancient way of calling on the name of the Lord. Today we all need to hold fast to the Lord Jesus and call on His name.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Deuteronomy &nbsp; pg 39</div><br></body></html>
