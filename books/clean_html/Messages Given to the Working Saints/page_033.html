<h2 class=head3>Being Found in Christ</h2><p>Not only did Paul suffer the loss of all things and count them refuse, but he pursued to be found in Christ (Phil. 3:9). He desired to be seen by others as a man in Christ. In all things, great or small, and especially in his daily living, he was seen by others to be a man in Christ. When we love the world and pursue after it, others will surely not recognize us as Christians, because our goals, inclinations, and tastes are all worldly. Christ is not manifested that much in us. Paul desired earnestly for Christ to be manifested in him. Not only was he free from sin and the world, but he was full of Christ. This was what he was pursuing after.<h2 class=head1>REWARDS FROM GAINING CHRIST</h2><p>The rewards received from gaining Christ are twofold. One is in this life, to be gained while one is alive on earth. The other is in the coming life, to be gained in the kingdom when the Lord comes back.<h2 class=head2>Moses—Becoming the One to Usher in the Old Testament Ministry</h2><h2 class=head3>Establishing the Law—a Testimony of God among Men</h2><p>Moses was made a person to usher in the Old Testament ministry. Although Abraham was noble, he did not bring in the Old Testament ministry. What is the Old Testament ministry? First, it is the establishing of the law. Today, we are too familiar with grace and have therefore overlooked the law and have even despised the value of the law. Actually, the law is not only the Ten Commandments with their many regulations and ordinances for man to keep; the law is a description depicting the nature of God. Before Moses brought in the law, not one patriarch could describe God in a way that could compare with the way the law did. In God’s laws, especially in the Ten Commandments, God’s characteristics are fully depicted. The Ten Commandments depicted God as the One who is love, light, holiness, and righteousness. Today, the whole world bases its laws on the Roman law. But the Roman law has as its basis the Ten Commandments of Moses. Hence, the reward of Moses was a tremendous one. He was the one who brought in the Old Testament ministry. The first thing this ministry did was to bring the law of God to man, as a testimony of God among men.<h2 class=head3>Building the Tabernacle—a Habitation of God among His People</h2><p>The second item in the Old Testament ministry was the building up of the tabernacle. None of the patriarchs, including Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, brought God’s habitation to earth. It was Moses who built a habitation for God on earth among the Israelites, making it possible for God to dwell with His people. This was the second great reward which Moses obtained in this world.<h2 class=head2>Moses—Being Qualified to Enter the Kingdom</h2><p>Moses may have been the first one to enter into the kingdom. The Lord said in Matthew 16:28: “There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.” After six days, the Lord took Peter, James, and John to a high mountain, and He was transfigured before their eyes. There He unveiled His glory. Moses and Elijah were also there conversing with Him. This was a miniature of the millennial kingdom. There was the law represented by Moses. Hence, Moses took the lead to enter into the kingdom.
