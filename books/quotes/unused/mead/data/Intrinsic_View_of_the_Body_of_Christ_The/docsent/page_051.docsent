   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Such Divisions Being Condemned</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>by the Apostle's Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Such divisions were condemned by the apostle's teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul said that those who make divisions are fleshly and walk according to the manner of man 1 Cor 3:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1 Corinthians 1:13 Paul said, "Is Christ divided?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Was Paul crucified for you?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The answer to all of these questions is "no."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ, of course, is not divided.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This unique and undivided Christ, taken as the unique center among all the believers, should be the termination of all divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Corinthians were also puffed up on behalf of one, against the other 1 Cor 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul and Apollos were simply ministers of Christ who should not have been appraised beyond what they were.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Otherwise, their appraisers, like the fleshly Corinthians, might be puffed up on behalf of one, against the other.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we say that one brother is better than another brother, this can create division.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such Divisive Ones Coming Together</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>to Take the Lord's Table</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not for the Better Not for Profit</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>but for the Worse for Loss</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When divisive ones come together to take the Lord's table, it is not for the better, not for profit, but for the worse, for loss 1 Cor 11:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How we come to the Lord's table is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must have the assurance that we do not have any divisive thoughts or considerations about the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To come to the Lord's table in a divisive way will cause us to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who partake of the table in an unworthy manner fail to discern the bread as a symbol of the Lord's physical body that needs to be regarded by them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The bread on the table should also be discerned as a symbol of the Lord's mystical Body that requires us to keep the oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The denominations have their communion, their table, with the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But their bread does not signify the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It only signifies a part.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That bread signifies division, so we cannot partake of it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we participate in the Lord's table, we must discern whether the bread on the table signifies the one Body of Christ or any division of man any denomination .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In discerning the Body of Christ, we should not partake of the bread in any division or with any divisive spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Otherwise, we will eat judgment to ourselves 1 Cor 11:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul said that because of this many among the Corinthians were weak and sick physically, and even a number were sleeping v. 30 . Here sleeping means that they had died 1 Thes 4:13-16 . First, they were disciplined to be weak physically.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then since they would not repent of their offense, they were further disciplined and became sick.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because they still would not repent, the Lord judged them by death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This shows that we have to be careful in coming to the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we come to the Lord's table, we have to discern the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It first signifies the physical body of Christ He gave for us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not consider this bread in a common way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should also consider that this bread signifies Christ's mystical Body, which comprises all the believers in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We do not take a divisive bread, but we take a bread of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we take divisive bread, we eat to our own judgment, to our own condemnation.</S>
