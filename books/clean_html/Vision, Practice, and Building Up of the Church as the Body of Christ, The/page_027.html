<h1 class="title">THE MAIN ITEMS NEEDED<br />
FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:1-16; Psa. 68:18; 1 Cor. 3:9</h1>
<p>The proper practice of the church life is revealed in almost a full way in Ephesians 4. However, this chapter has been mostly neglected by Christianity in the past. We must be clear about the main points in this chapter, and we must put all of them into practice. If we are not clear about these points or if we do not practice them, we are still not in the proper practice of the church life.</p>
<p>As we have seen, the last half of chapter 3 is Paul&rsquo;s prayer. Paul makes such a prayer because, having presented a full revelation and vision of the Body, he is about to speak concerning the practice of the church. To have only the vision of the church is to have something &ldquo;in the air.&rdquo; We need the vision brought down to the earth and put into practice. When people today speak about the church in Ephesians, they are mostly limited to the first part, talking about the church in the way of vision. However, there are not many books and messages that deal with chapter 4. Even when people talk about oneness, it is still in the way of vision, not in the way of practice. We must realize that while the first section of this book is the section of vision, the second section is a matter of practice. That is why the writer, before he begins the section of practice, realizes the need of prayer. He bows his knees before the Father that we may be strengthened into the inner man and that Christ may make His home in our hearts, that is, that Christ may occupy our whole being (3:14-17a). After this prayer he goes on to speak concerning the practice of the church life.</p>
<p>We need to be clear about the main points in Ephesians 4:1-16, and we must put them into practice. Otherwise, we are not in the practical church life. What we are dealing with in these messages is not merely a lesson or teaching. Rather, we are being trained and prepared for the future. Some may not have the proper discernment about the church. In the Far East, in Europe, and in the United States I have observed that not many Christians, even the seeking ones, are truly clear about the church life. It is difficult for people to understand what a division, sect, or denomination is. We ourselves may be clear about these things now, but when some go to start the church life in other places, they may lose their direction. Perhaps after being in a new locality for two years, they will create a division, a small denomination. Although they will do this only unconsciously, it will still cause damage.</p>
<p>In 1:17 Paul prays that we may have a spirit of wisdom and revelation. Revelation always comes from wisdom. We first have wisdom and then revelation. This is why we need training. This training affords the wisdom, and then the revelation can come. Sometimes people question why I repeat myself many times in my messages. However, even if I repeat something ten times, some people are still not impressed. If the audience would be properly impressed, there would be no need to repeat. It is the ministering Spirit, not my mentality, that knows the situation. The ministering Spirit is very sensitive, and we cannot cheat Him. When we come to a meeting with the ministering Spirit, we immediately realize what the actual situation is. There is no need for people to say that they do not understand. The ministering Spirit already knows that they do not understand, and the ministering Spirit also realizes when there is opposition.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Seven Items of Oneness in Ephesians 4</h2>
<p>The first main point in chapter 4 is the oneness. This oneness is related to the mystery of godliness, which is God manifested in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:9, 15-16). The seven &ldquo;ones&rdquo; in Ephesians 4:3-6 include four persons&mdash;one Father, one Lord, one Spirit, and one Body. These four persons become one. The Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit is in the Body (John 14:11; 1 Cor. 15:45; 1 Cor. 12:13; Rom. 8:9, 11). The Father, Son, and Spirit are the Triune God, who is three in one. Now this Trinity is in the Body, which is related to the flesh. Therefore, this is God manifested in the flesh. The Father in the Son, the Son as the Spirit, and the Spirit in the Body, which is composed of all the regenerated and transformed persons, is a universal unit, a universal person. This is the mystery of the faith and the mystery of godliness. The mystery of the faith is the very mystery of godliness, which is the Triune God manifested in the corporate Body. This is the real oneness. Nothing else constitutes the genuine oneness.</p>
<p>The other three factors of oneness in Ephesians 4 are one hope, one faith, and one baptism. The way the universal unit of the Triune God and the Body is formed is by faith and baptism. Faith is for being identified and joined with the Triune God, and baptism is to separate us from the old creation. By faith we are joined to the new creation, and by baptism we are separated from the old. Baptism is a burial (Rom. 6:3-4). The best way to have a thorough clearance is to be buried. To be buried means that we are finished with the old things. Faith brings us into an identification with the Triune God, and baptism separates us from the old relationships in the old creation. Now we are in the Body, and we are the Body. We need only one thing more&mdash;to be transfigured in our physical body. We have this hope ahead of us. We are the Body, and we hope for nothing but the Lord&rsquo;s coming, in which our physical body will be transfigured into a glorious body (Phil. 3:21). The foregoing are the seven ones in Ephesians 4. All Christians agree with these seven ones. Thus, they become our oneness. We should not bring in anything else. We need only to keep these seven ones.</p>
