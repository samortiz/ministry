If we get into the depths of these books, we shall find that they are sister books and that both are concerned with the experience of Christ
The book of Philippians, however, does not charge us to live according to ethics or virtues; it charges us to live according to Christ
Since the book of Philippians is concerned with the experience of Christ, some may think that there is no need to consider the background
As we consider Paul's statements and exhortations in this book, we detect certain hints regarding the background
At the time the book of Philippians was written, the Judaizers were exercising their influence over the believers in Christ
The most zealous of the Judaizers were the Pharisees, those who were most orthodox in the religion of their fathers
In Paul's time there was just one group of 'dogs,' the Judaizers, but today there are many different kinds of 'dogs'
Whenever these dogs exercise their influence perhaps by spreading evil rumors about the Lords recovery we may find it difficult to rejoice
According to the construction of 3:2, the dogs, the evil workers, and the concision all refer to the same people
The fact that the 'dogs' are associated with the evil workers and the concision indicates that the 'dogs' are religious people
Wherever the gospel was preached and churches were established the Judaizers came as barking biting religious dogs to trouble the saints
The barking and biting of the Judaizers was one aspect of the background against which the book of Philippians was written
The Philippians had to deal with only one ism, but we must deal with many isms, with many groups of barking religious 'dogs'
The writings of the opposers, in which many false accusations are made against us, may be regarded as the 'barking' of religious 'dogs'
Because of the influence the Judaizers were exerting over the saints, Paul was compelled to warn the saints at Philippi to beware of 'dogs'
Since, in principle, our situation is the same today, we must consider that Philippians was written for us also
Since the Judaistic believers still held to these religious things, they were preaching Christ out of envy and strife
Paul admitted that even those who preached because of envy and strife and out of rivalry were still preaching Christ
Many Christians are preaching Christ, but they are not preaching Christ with God's economy concerning the church
In Paul's time, the Judaistic believers preached Christ out of a concern for Judaism, not out of a concern for the church
Paul was persecuted not mainly for simply preaching the gospel, but in particular for defending the gospel and confirming it
In 1:7 he speaks of 'the defense and confirmation of the gospel' and in 1:16 he says that he was 'set for the defense of the gospel'
Today we are also preaching the gospel in a way that is different from that followed by many in organized religion
The gospel in which they had a share was not the low, narrow, superficial gospel preached by many Christians today
The Philippian believers had the privilege of sharing in the spread and furtherance of the gospel that is according to God's economy
They had no problem in the spirit, but there were at least some problems in the soul, particularly in the mind
No matter what the circumstances are in which we find ourselves, we need to express Christ in such a way that we magnify Him
It is not sufficient merely to be awakened and stirred up to stand against the opposition; we must go on to live Christ and to magnify Him
As we experience Christ, He becomes our perception and tact, the discernment by which we see through the intentions of others
Through Paul's first ministry journey to Europe , a church was raised up in this city, the first church in Europe
He claimed that the elders are local and that the overseers, bishops, exercise authority in an area greater than a locality
Paul did not say 'to all the saints and the overseers and deacons'; he said 'all the saints with the overseers and deacons'
The New Testament reveals that in a local church there is a unique group, and this group is composed of all the saints
Writing under the leading of the Holy Spirit Paul wrote in a deliberate cautious way using the preposition with and not the conjunction and
It indicates that in any locality there should be just one church, which must include all the saints in that locality
The saints in Philippi had fellowship unto the gospel, participating in the furtherance of the gospel through the apostle Paul's ministry
The Christexperiencingandenjoying life is a life in the furtherance of the gospel a gospelpreaching life not individualistic but corporate
The church in Philippi also prayed for Paul , made his joy full and caused him to rejoice , and supplied his material need
Christians frequently speak of being one in the Lord or one in the Spirit, but have you ever heard believers speak of being one in the soul?
The differences in their thinking were probably not concerning secular matters, but concerning God's move on earth
They do not think the same thing as the rest of the saints, they do not have the same love, and they are not joined in soul
The same thing is Christ Himself, and the one thing is the pursuing of Christ to gain Him, lay hold of Him, and possess Him
To think the same thing-Christ-and the one thing- the seeking after Christ to gain Him-causes our mind to be dealt with and renewed
To be renewed in our mind is to have a metabolic change in which the old element is discharged and a new element is supplied
If our mind is not renewed, there will be dissension among us as there was among certain of the Philippian saints
The excellence of Paul's writing is shown in the way he did not directly point out the defect of the Philippian saints
Paul admitted that the Philippian believers had a certain amount of love but there was still the need for their love to abound more and more
Paul prayed that their love would abound in full knowledge and all discernment, both of which are related to the mind
Either a brother loves his wife foolishly, or, being clear in his understanding and sober in his mind, he becomes cold in his love for her
He encouraged them to love with a mind full of knowledge and discernment, sensitive perception, and moral tact
Deep within, Paul realized that some of the Philippians had been distracted by the preaching of the Judaistic believers
He encouraged the Philippians to love, but to love in knowledge and discernment, not in foolishness and in blindness
Paul also prayed that the Philippians would prove by testing the things which differ and be pure and without offense unto the day of Christ
The fruit of righteousness is the living product of a proper life with a righteous standing before God and man
If we experience Christ, our love will abound, we shall prove things by testing, and we shall be pure and without offense
In preaching the gospel according to Gods economy Paul renounced religion law culture ordinances customs habits and every kind of ism
Even though his preaching of the gospel slaughtered everything contrary to God's economy, Paul referred to the gospel as the gospel of peace
In Ephesians 2:17 Paul points out that Christ, after His crucifixion and resurrection, came to the Gentiles preaching the gospel of peace
In order for there to be peace between us and God and with one another religion politics culture ordinances and the law had to be terminated
Because Paul preached a gospel that involves the slaughter of so many things, his preaching was not pleasing to men
As long as we remain in the Lord's recovery, caring for the accomplishment of God's economy, our destiny is to suffer for the gospel
Those who preach the gospel for the carrying out of God's economy on earth will suffer for the sake of the gospel
To be sure, those Judaistic believers who preached the gospel in rivalry with Paul did not have the enjoyment of Christ as grace
Some may question this understanding of grace, wondering whether it is true to say that grace is the Triune God processed for our enjoyment
We have seen that the gospel is related to God's economy, to His move on earth for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose
When Paul wrote to the Philippians, certain preachers were perverting this gospel of God's economy and distorting it
Paul confirmed the gospel by preaching two mysteries: Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ
If you simply preach the gospel in a superficial way without defending it or confirming it, you will be warmly welcomed
Many of us can testify that before we came into the church life, we knew very little of the enjoyment of Christ
In the church life we experience suffering for the gospel, but we also have grace, the processed Triune God for our enjoyment
What we enjoy is much better than any of those things which are slaughtered by the preaching of the truth of God
Although Paul was a prisoner, his prison became a house of wine, a banqueting house, for there Paul was enjoying the Lord
Although Peter had received the vision concerning the Gentiles in Acts 10, he withdrew from eating with the Gentile believers in Antioch
According to the record of the New Testament he was the one who stood the strongest against anything that perverted and distorted the gospel
In the writings of Paul, the two great mysteries-Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ- are unveiled
Of dealing with the major points of God's economy, certain of these preachers simply deliver sugar-coated messages to make others happy
The Greek word rendered advancement refers to the advancement made by pioneers who cut the way before an army to further its march
We expect that if the young people are faithful to the Lord, they will be able to march forward on a clear highway
For many years we have been helping to clear the way, and we trust that the young generation in the Lord's recovery will march on
Destruction here refers to the destruction of all the opposers are and do, whereas salvation denotes the salvation of all we are and do
In 1:29 Paul says, 'Because to you it has been given on behalf of Christ not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer on His behalf'
The key to understanding these verses and all the terms and expressions they contain is the experience of Christ
It is possible to preach the gospel and even to mention Christ quite often without having the reality of Christ in our speaking
Christ is also the genuine confirmation of the gospel, for He is the centrality, the focal point, of the gospel
In reading the book of Philippians, we need to remember that the experience of Christ is the subject and main emphasis of this book
If we wish to understand Philippians, we need to read it in light of the fact that its subject is the experience of Christ
Even at Paul's time there were some who preached the gospel from envy of Paul's influence and in strife with him
In 1:17 Paul goes on to say that these 'announce Christ out of rivalry, not purely, thinking to raise up affliction in my bonds'
Paul's affliction in bonds was not mainly due to his preaching of the gospel, but to his defense of the gospel
It is very clear from Paul's word in 1:15-17 that even in the first century there were different ways of preaching Christ
They are not engaged in the defense of the gospel, and they do not exercise for the confirmation of the gospel
In seeking to know the Bible, we care for the pure Word, not for the centuries of tradition or for the opinions of church councils
We need to learn to dig into the depths of the Word, pursuing the right meaning of the different words, terms, and expressions
Paul's heart was so broadened by grace that he even rejoiced in his opposing ones' preaching of Christ in pretense
The experience of such a salvation is altogether related to the enjoyment of Christ and the experience of Christ
Paul utilized the situations caused by the different preachings of the gospel to experience Christ, to live Christ, and to magnify Christ
In this message we shall consider the first of these expressions, 'the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ'
The words bountiful supply are not simply a translation of the Greek, but an interpretation of the Greek term used
The choragus supplied all the needs of everyone in the chorus, the needs for food, clothing, lodging, and musical instruments
In using the expression 'the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,' Paul likens the supply of the Spirit to that of the choragus
It is not the Spirit of Jesus as in Acts 16:7 , nor the Spirit of Christ as in Romans 8:9, but the Spirit of Jesus Christ
The Spirit of Jesus is mainly for the Lord's humanity and human living; the Spirit of Christ is mainly for the Lord's resurrection
The Spirit to him was the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the Triune God
In his imprisonment Paul was enjoying the Spirit both as the Spirit of Jesus in suffering and as the Spirit of Christ in resurrection
After His resurrection, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Jesus Christ
Even though before the Lords death and resurrection the Spirit of God was the Spirit of Jehovah and the Holy Spirit the Spirit was not yet
Of saying the Spirit of God or the Holy Spirit, Paul often said 'the Spirit'-the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit of the Triune God
Although this term cannot be found in the Bible, it cannot be reasonably denied that the Bible reveals that God is triune
Matthew 2819 speaks of baptizing people into the name of the Father of the Son and of the Holy Spirit a clear indication that God is triune
Another indication is 2 Corinthians 13:14, which speaks of the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
In the same principle, based upon the facts in Scripture, we may properly speak of the Spirit as the compound Spirit
According to Exodus 30:23-24, a hin of olive oil was compounded with four spices to produce the holy anointing oil, the holy ointment
In typology, oil signifies the Spirit of God, and the compound ointment, the oil blended with four spices, signifies the Holy Spirit
Through a compounding process, the oil became an ointment and was used to anoint the tabernacle and everything related to it
Before Exodus 30, this compound ointment was 'not yet,' but after Exodus 30, such an ointment was definitely in existence
Before Christ was crucified, resurrected, and glorified, the Spirit as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit was 'not yet'
After Christs resurrection these elements were compounded into the Spirit of God and the Spirit of God became the Spirit the compound Spirit
These seven Spirits are the seven lamps of fire burning before God's throne and also the seven eyes of the Lamb
According to the traditional understanding of the Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are regarded as three distinct Persons
In The Principles of Theology he said this concerning the Trinity: 'The term Person is also sometimes objected to
Those who press the term persons too far will end up not merely with the three Persons of the Godhead, but with three Gods
For this reason, when Paul was suffering for the sake of the gospel, he enjoyed the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit
We need more and more experience of the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit who is the processed Triune God as everything to us
By such a Spirit Paul suffered for God's economy and simultaneously enjoyed a bountiful supply to strengthen him in resurrection
May we also experience and enjoy the Triune God supplying us and working Himself into us as the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit
Paul magnified Christ; he made Him great before the eyes of others, especially before the eyes of those who guarded him in prison
As Paul was held captive in a Roman prison, he magnified Christ, making Him to appear great in the eyes of his captors
Although teachers may not be able to preach the gospel to their students, they can magnify Christ in the classroom
Such an expression was a declaration of the unlimited greatness of Christ and a declaration that Christ is inexhaustible
Even though Paul must have been mistreated in prison, he could be happy and display to the guards the unlimited greatness of Christ
Rather, he was a living witness of Christ, testifying of His ability, power, patience, love, and wisdom, all without measure
The guards may have considered Paul to be strange or peculiar, viewing him as possessing something which they did not have
Although the matter of living Christ is of such tremendous importance, not many Christians have paid adequate attention to it
We should not care for holiness spirituality or victory as things in themselves and we should not care for our natural virtues or attributes
We should focus our whole attention on living Christ and care only to live Christ that He might be magnified in us
The normal experience of Christ is to live Him, and to live Him is to magnify Him always, regardless of the circumstances
If we experience the salvation mentioned in these verses, then when we undergo suffering, we shall magnify Christ and not be put to shame
If in our contact with this brother we had seen nothing but sorrow and tears, we would have had a sense of shame
Rather, the brother's experience in grieving over the loss of his wife would not have been different from the experience of an unbeliever
The experience of this brother in magnifying Christ after the loss of his wife illustrates Paul's experience in prison
According to Paul's earnest expectation and hope, Christ was magnified in him, and Paul enjoyed the Lord's salvation
Between salvation in verse 19 and the magnifying of Christ in verse 20, we have the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
If we would enjoy Christ and experience Him as our salvation in every circumstance, we need the bountiful supply of the Spirit
Although in a sense it may refer to Christ, it refers to Christ in a different way, not to the Christ we experience by living Him
Probably you have thanked the Lord for His presence, but have you ever thanked Him for the experience of living Him?
There certainly is a difference in verse 21 between living Christ and gaining a greater degree of His presence
Paul knew that as a result of physical death he would be with Christ to a greater extent than in his earthly life
The faith here refers to what the saints believe in ; progress, to the growth in life; and joy, to the enjoyment of Christ
It is possible to be a Christian for years without having any progress or joy, without growing in life and without enjoying the Lord
All the elders in the local churches should be factors of the saints' growth in life and of their enjoyment of Christ
Whether or not the elders are such factors of progress and joy depends on whether or not they magnify Christ by living Him
It may be better to place 'in me' before 'in Christ Jesus,' since this arrangement corresponds more closely to Paul's thought
If he had been lost to the Body, the Body would have been deprived of a very important means of spiritual blessing
Because Paul lived Christ and magnified Him in this way, he could transfuse Christ into the saints and minister Christ to all the churches
Whether or not this is so depends on the degree to which we live Christ, minister Christ, and infuse others with Christ
If we experience Christ and enjoy Him in this way, it will make a difference to the church whether we remain or go to be with the Lord
Rather, there need to be some members to function as channels through which others may enjoy Christ and grow in life
To be with one soul for the gospel work is more difficult than to be in one spirit for the experience of Christ
Concerning our standing, we need to be firm in one spirit; concerning striving together, we need to be with one soul
Because of the background, Paul did not tell the Philippians to stand firm and strive, but to stand firm, striving together with one soul
Because the Judaizers were so active, it was necessary for the believers to stand firm and not be distracted, shaken, or moved
In our experience we realize that there is a great difference between being in one spirit and being with one soul
The different opinions, thoughts, and concepts will lead to dissension, and this dissension will undermine the oneness and cause division
When we return to our spirit, stay there, and close our being to negative questions and doubts, there are no problems
If we realize that this is our situation, we must immediately return to our spirit and close the door to Satan's attack
The leading ones in a local church should not ask whether or not others agree with them in a particular matter
Wanting to be 'spiritual,' they always act nice, kind, and humble, never striving with their soul in the faith of the gospel
The sisters are usually troubled by the 'giant' of the emotion, whereas the brothers are troubled by two 'giants'-the mind and the will
Our problems, therefore, are found in the soul-in the mind and will for the brothers and in the emotion for the sisters
Since this book is concerned with the experience and enjoyment of Christ which issue in joy it is also a book filled with joy and rejoicing
Because Paul was rich in the experience of Christ, he could present an account of his experience to the believers in chapter one
In other words, Paul was not troubled by his imprisonment, but he was troubled by the situation among the believers in Philippi
According to the context of the entire book, the one thing must refer to the subjective knowledge of Christ and experience of Christ
Out of heaviness of heart, he appealed to the Philippians to make his joy full by being joined in soul and by thinking the same thing
Because we may love a particular brother only to a small degree, we may not be inclined to render much service to him
Because we love another brother to a very high degree, we may serve him too much and even spoil him by our love
They had Christ in their spirit through regeneration, but they did not have Christ fully in their soul through transformation
If there had not been rivalry and vainglory among the Philippian believers, Paul would not have mentioned these things in 2:3
If you have any consolation of love toward me, please make my joy full by not doing anything by way of rivalry or vainglory
The kind of lowliness Paul speaks of is not our natural lowliness; it is the lowliness of Christ, as illustrated in verses 7 and 8
According to this book, the experience of Christ is a matter of mutuality between the apostle and the believers
If we consider the book of Philippians as a whole, we shall realize that the experience of Christ involves mutuality
If the apostle did not have proper fellowship with the saints, his experience of Christ would not have been normal
In the same principle, if the apostle is out of line concerning his attitude toward the believers, his experience of Christ will be abnormal
Although the Philippian believers loved the Lord and were in the church, their experience of Christ was abnormal
If the believers took Paul's word and acted on it, they would become balanced and normal in experiencing Christ
Paul's appeal was that the believers would show a proper attitude and spirit toward him so that the fellowship between them would be normal
The apostle still would not have been happy, even though the saints had such an excellent attitude toward him personally
The only thing that could make the apostle's joy full was for the saints to take his word to experience Christ adequately and normally
Apart from being saturated with Christ in this way, no two people, not even a husband and wife, will be able to think the same thing
We point out that this is possible only when the believers are occupied by Christ and allow Him to saturate their whole being
These matters will always test to what extent we have actually been occupied by Christ, taken over by Christ, and saturated with Christ
We shall be joined in soul, and our mind will be occupied with knowing Christ, experiencing Christ, pursuing Christ, and gaining Christ
In order for this to be accomplished in our experience, the pattern must be subjective to us as well as objective
The fact that salvation is a living Person and that this Person is our pattern indicates that the pattern is subjective as well as objective
Paul's word about God operating in us is a further indication that the pattern is subjective as well as objective
Although in ourselves we cannot work out our salvation, the One who is able is now operating in us to will inwardly and to work outwardly
To experience Christ, we need to be one with Him to such an extent, that is, in His tender inward feeling and in His thinking
Verse 7 goes on to say that Christ 'emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men'
In His incarnation, the Lord did not alter His divine nature, but only His outward expression of the form of God to that of a slave
The form of God implies the inward reality of Christ's deity; the likeness of men denotes the outward appearance of His humanity
Verse 8 continues And being found in fashion as a man He humbled Himself becoming obedient even unto death and that the death of a cross
When Christ became in the likeness of men, entering into the condition of humanity, He was found in fashion as a man by men
He emptied Himself by putting aside the form, the outward expression, of His deity and becoming in the likeness of men
After becoming a man and being found in the appearance of a man, Christ humbled Himself even unto the death of the cross
If we did not have the crucified life within us, we could never live according to the pattern presented in Philippians 2
If we still do things out of rivalry and vainglory or are still ambitious to be leaders or elders, we are not living a crucified life
According to 3:10, Paul aspired to know the power of Christ's resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings
In the foregoing message we pointed out that in 2:5-8 we have Christ as our pattern and that this pattern is the crucified life within us
The experience of Christ as the pattern of a crucified life and the experience of the resurrection power which exalts Him is endless
He still aspired to know, to experience, the power of Christ's resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings
In the church life we either take the crucified life as our pattern or automatically live a life of rivalry and vainglory
If we do not take the crucified life as our pattern, we shall automatically live in the way of rivalry for vainglory
Nothing was more troubling to the apostle Paul than to learn that the saints in Philippi were living in the way of vainglory
Taking this crucified life as our pattern opens the gate of resurrection and brings us into the power of resurrection
Whenever we live a crucified life, God will bring us into the power of resurrection, and in this power we shall be exalted
Paul presents this pattern in Philippians, not in other books, because in Philippi rivalry for vainglory was a definite problem
He did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men
We must admit that the rivalry for vainglory found among the saints in Philippi can also be found in many local churches today
We need to be enlightened and take this crucified life as our pattern so that we may experience the power of resurrection
Just as we need to experience the Christ who emptied Himself and humbled Himself, so we need to experience the Christ who has been exalted
His expectation was that the believers would experience Christ as the crucified life and then experience Christ in His exaltation
We should not simply be those who are saved, but we should be those who are exalted through Christ's resurrection power
Now that Christ has been exalted by God to the highest peak in the universe, we need to experience Him also in His exaltation
It is also the power of resurrection in 310 and the power referred to in 413 where Paul says I can do all things in Him who empowers me
That with which we are empowered is the power of resurrection, the exalting power, and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
Philippians 2:9 says, 'Wherefore also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name'
In the New Testament we are not told to worship Christ, but there is the clear indication that we are to call on the Lord's name
When Paul was Saul of Tarsus, he received authority from the chief priests to bind those who called on the name of Jesus
Those who are in heaven are angels, those who are on earth are men, and those who are under the earth are the dead
We have seen that the name is the expression of the sum total of what the Lord Jesus is in His Person and work
Paul's word about bowing our knees in verse 10 and confessing in verse 11 implies that as we bow our knees to the Lord, we call on His name
Many of us can testify that before we began to call on the Lord's name, we did not have much experience of Him or enjoyment of Him
When we call on the Lord, we spontaneously exercise our spirit and thereby touch the Lord who dwells in our spirit
We would encourage all those who have recently come into the church life to practice calling on the name of the Lord
We need to carry out this salvation, to bring it to its ultimate conclusion, by our constant and absolute obedience with fear and trembling
In verse 13 Paul goes on to say, 'For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure'
In verses 12, 13, 15, and 16 we have four wonderful matters: salvation , God operating in us , lights or luminaries , and the word of life
It is simply not possible for someone to be born of a particular person and not have the life and nature of that person
In the same principle, it is not possible for us to be genuine children of God, born of Him, and not have His life and nature
When we say that as children of God we have the life and nature of our Father some accuse us of teaching what they call evolution into God
We definitely teach according to the Word of God that, as true believers in Christ, we have experienced a divine birth
In order to prove that God in 2:13 is the Triune God, we need to consider the context of the whole book of Philippians
Using this as an illustration of God's good pleasure, we may say that God's good pleasure is to love us in a way that makes Him happy
In verse 12 Paul charges us to work out our salvation, and in verse 13 he tells us that God is operating in us
Murmurings are out of our emotion, mostly on the part of the sisters; reasonings are out of our mind, mostly on the part of the brothers
Both frustrate us from carrying out our salvation to the fullest extent, from experiencing Christ to the uttermost
From experience Paul knew that if we would work out our salvation, we need to do all things without murmurings and reasonings
In verse 15 Paul refers to 'children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation'
If the Philippian believers did this, Paul would be able to boast in the day of Christ that he had not labored in vain
Just as the Philippians could boast in Paul in Christ, so Paul wanted to be able to boast, rejoice, and glory in them in the day of Christ
If such were their situation, Paul would be able to rejoice and even boast at the time of the Lord's coming back
We have five important interrelated matters working out our salvation obeying God living Christ expressing Christ and holding forth Christ
Using these expressions will help us in ministering Christ to others, especially to young ones who have just received the Lord
We need to use expressions based on Paul's word to the Philippians to stir in others the desire to experience the Lord in their spirit
Some brothers have learned that one way to eliminate a wife's murmuring is to use two simple expressions: 'I'm sorry' and 'thank you'
If a brother never tells his wife that he is sorry or if he never says thank you, there is apt to be murmuring
We do not have words adequate to express the deep relationship between us and God that has been produced by God's being conceived within us
The Lord Jesus said that He is the bread which came down from heaven and also that the ones who eat Him will live because of Him
We can truly say that the food we eat and the water we drink are not merely united to us, but also mingled with us
We simply cannot deny the fact that the food and drink we take in and digest are mingled with us and eventually saturate us metabolically
In the same principle, when we take in the Triune God as our food and drink, He is mingled with us, and we are mingled with Him
We must be clear that this mingling of God and man does not produce a mixture, or a confusion, of divinity and humanity
If you have truly seen the vision that you are a child of God, you will be filled with joy, wonder, and praise
According to Paul's word in 2:15, we are to be children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation
Although we cannot fully define the divine nature, we know that as God's children we partake of it and have it within us
In this way we shall become the wine to be poured out as a drink offering upon the offerings we present to God
Paul's ministry resulted in the all-inclusive faith of the believers, the faith which Paul offered to God as a sacrifice
When we experience Christ in these different aspects and enjoy Him as these basic offerings, this experience and enjoyment become our faith
There is no better word to signify the enjoyment and experience of Christ in its various aspects than the word faith
The saints have a faith which is a constitution of their experience of Christ and enjoyment of Christ over the years
The ministry has resulted in a constitution which comes out from the saints' enjoyment of Christ and experience of Christ
Both the believers' faith as the basic offering and the drink offering are something which has been constituted over a period of time
Faith does not grow and develop suddenly, for it is a constitution of the believers' enjoyment of Christ and spiritual experience
What a tremendous matter that sinners such as we can be constituted into heavenly wine for God's satisfaction!
As a result of their experience of Christ and enjoyment of Christ, the believers have a constitution which Paul terms faith
In the eyes of God, this faith is so excellent, beautiful, and marvelous that He considers it a sacrifice offered to Him
Those who had the constitution of faith rejoiced with the one who had been constituted into a drink offering poured out upon this faith
Paul expected that the Philippians would share their joy with him by congratulating him in his martyrdom for the sake of their faith
According to Romans 15:16, Paul viewed himself as a priest offering the Gentile believers to God as an acceptable sacrifice
According to 2:17 and 18, Paul and the believers in Philippi rejoiced mutually, sharing their joy with one another
The Philippian believers rejoiced in Paul's drink offering and even congratulated him in his martyrdom for the sake of their faith
On the side of the believers, there is the peak of faith, and on the side of the apostle there is the peak of martyrdom
Paul congratulated the believers for their success in faith, and they congratulated him in his success in martyrdom
We may wonder why Paul turned to such a matter, which seems to have no relationship to the experience of Christ
If we get into the depths of this portion of the book of Philippians, we shall see that it is definitely related to the experience of Christ
Where today can you find believers who are truly seeking after Christ with a concern for the churches and the saints?
Or, on the other side, we may think that because we are so busy in caring for the church, we have no time to enjoy Christ
The concern for the church which issues from the experience of Christ is not a distraction from the enjoyment of Christ
In the gospel work, in the fellowship among the believers, and in the Lord's interests, our soul is always a problem
It must be transformed especially in its leading part the mind that we may be of one soul joined in soul and likesouled in the Body life
If we would experience Christ, we need to be one with others in the soul; that is, we need to become like-souled with others
If we exercise our spirit to be one in soul, our mind will be sobered, our emotion will be regulated, and our will will be adjusted
If our experience of Christ results in a concern for the churches and the saints, it will be impossible for us to be individualistic
Even though the elders in this church loved the Lord and experienced Christ in the spirit, they were not able to be one in the soul
The wife may eventually recognize that her husband is the head and go along with him, but inwardly she still does not agree with his concept
Since the elders are not one in soul, they lack the genuine oneness in the concern for the church and the saints
Those co-workers who were not like-souled with Paul could experience Christ, but not to the extent to which Paul and Timothy experienced Him
Sooner or later, we shall all be tested whether or not we are one in soul with the leading ones and with those who have more experience
If you are one in soul with these saints, you will be protected, and you will not have any problems in experiencing Christ
Paul also tells the Philippian believers that Epaphroditus was their apostle one sent with a commission and a priestly minister to his need
The Greek word rendered risking means 'venturing, recklessly exposing one's life, like a gambler throwing down a stake'
As we all know, there are a great many divisions among Christians today, divisions that number in the thousands
In virtually every case, these divisions have been caused by Christians who have a heart for the Lord and who truly love Him
The serious problem is that when Christians endeavor to do something for the Lord Jesus out of their love for Him, they are not like-souled
It is commonly thought that divisions among Christians have their source in doctrinal differences, and apparently this is so
Actually the true source is found not in disagreement over doctrine, but in the differences in the souls of believers
Some may keep the proper standing on the ground of oneness and stay in the recovery, but they may become negative, dissenting, or cold
Rather, our experience of Christ will be limited to what we experience in our fellowship with Him in the spirit
Because of the differences of our emotion, understanding, or decision regarding certain matters, we are different in soul
They could excuse their lack of involvement by saying they do not want to cause trouble, but want to keep the situation calm
The true reason for their holding back is that they are not like-souled and are not willing to risk their souls in the church life
Because of their difference of opinion, because of not being like-souled, they eventually forsook the Lord's recovery
On the one hand they do not leave the Lords recovery on the other hand they do not go on with the church in a strong positive aggressive way
Paul said that, apart from Timothy, he had no one like-souled who would genuinely care for what concerned the believers in Philippi
For this reason, Timothy was the only co-worker Paul could send to Philippi to care for the things concerning the saints
He says of Epaphroditus that he risked his life, his soul, in order to fill up the lack of the Philippians' service toward Paul
When the time comes to be martyred, such a person can actually become a martyr by laying down his physical life
If we desire to be one with the Lord for His recovery, we must be willing to sacrifice our mind, feeling, and intention
In 2:30 Paul said to the Philippians that Epaphroditus risked his life that 'he might fill up your lack of service toward me'
Epaphroditus risked his soul in order to fill up what was lacking on the part of the Philippian believers toward Paul
Whenever we sacrifice our soul for the sake of the Body, we have an opportunity to experience Christ in the Body
If we daily risk our soul in the church life, we shall be ready for martyrdom should this ever be required of us
Eventually, some of those dear co-workers who were not like-souled with Brother Nee were distracted from the Lord's recovery
If we are not like-souled with others, we shall not have the full enjoyment of Christ, even though we stay in the church life
In order to experience Christ to the full extent in the Body, we need to be like-souled and we need to risk our soul
He knew that the Judaizers were disturbing the churches, damaging the church life, and trying to turn the saints away from the faith
As we have pointed out, in the first two chapters we see the believers' concern for Paul and Paul's concern for the saints
According to 1:7, Paul realized that the believers in Philippi had him in their heart and that they were partakers of his grace
Remarks about the sending of co-workers to visit the saints are usually found at the very end of Paul's Epistles
After telling the believers to rejoice in the Lord, he charges them to beware of the dogs, the evil workers, the concision
In nature they are unclean dogs, in behavior they are evil workers, and in religion they are the concision, people of shame
Those who are the circumcision here are the New Testament believers, the ones genuinely circumcised by Christ's crucifixion
Our boasting, glorying, and rejoicing are not in our outward deeds, not in our behavior or conduct, but in Christ alone
The Judaizers had confidence in the flesh, whereas the true believers in Christ have no confidence in the flesh
The fact that the Judaizers had confidence in their circumcision was a sign that their confidence was in their flesh
We serve by the Spirit of God, we boast in Christ, and we have confidence not in the flesh, but only in the Lord
The denial of the flesh is the real circumcision, the true cutting off of the flesh as revealed in Colossians 2:11
In verse 5 Paul says that he was circumcised the eighth day, the day for a genuine Israelite to be circumcised
As a Pharisee, Paul was a member of the strictest sect of the Jewish religion , a sect exceedingly zealous for the law of Moses
When Paul says, 'as to zeal, persecuting the church,' he refers to zeal for the law of Moses and the Jewish religion
Paul presented this list of qualifications for the purpose of showing the Philippians that they should not have any trust in the Judaizers
We also should be those who have no confidence in the flesh, in our natural ability, or in our heritage or tradition
Rather, we should be those who serve God by the Spirit, who boast in Christ, and who put no trust in the flesh
We have pointed out that in 3:2 the dogs, the evil workers, and the concision refer respectively to the fallen nature, deeds, and religion
As a result, we shall cause problems in the church, and we shall not be able to progress in the experience of Christ
All the things which were once gains to Paul hindered him and held him back from participating in Christ and enjoying Him
Whereas in verse 7 Paul refers specifically to religious things, in verse 8 he goes on to say, 'I count also all things to be loss'
Paul counted as loss on account of Christ not only the things of his former religion, but all other things as well
Paul realized that the things which truly frustrate people from experiencing Christ are mainly the things of religion philosophy and culture
At the time the book of Philippians was written, most of the people in the Roman Empire were for religion, philosophy, or politics
The three main elements of Western culture, then as well as now, were Jewish religion, Greek philosophy, and Roman politics
Although the more simple people may be hooked by material things, the more thoughtful ones are hooked by religion, philosophy, and culture
Satan has used religion, philosophy, and culture both to occupy these people and also to nail them on his wall
To people like Saul of Tarsus, wealth or material things mean nothing compared with their religion, philosophy, and culture
The 'all things' in verse 8 must certainly include the three categories of religious things, philosophical things, and cultural things
Although it is easy to overcome the influence of material things, it is very difficult to overcome religion, philosophy, and culture
As a result of all the different kinds of logic and philosophy, Christ does not have a way with any group of people on earth today
People of every nationality have been taken over by Satan and hooked by him through religion, philosophy, and culture
Those from one part of the country hold to their logic, and those from another region cling to their philosophy
Wherever you may go in the world today, you will find that Christ simply does not have a way with any nationality or group of people
In a sense, they receive salvation, but, experientially speaking, they may not receive Christ and allow Him to have a free way in them
In verse 3 Paul says that we are the circumcision who serve by the Spirit of God boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh
He goes on to give the reasons he once had for confidence in the flesh listing seven items related to Jewish religion philosophy and culture
It is because they were all substitutes for Christ, hooks used by Satan to keep people from Christ and from the experience of Christ
To some extent at least, we still have within us certain things which are a substitute for Christ in a subtle, secret way
The reason for this lack of experience is that, until now, we have not probed into the depths of Paul's thought in this portion of the Word
As we have indicated, it is very difficult for us to set aside these things in order to give ground to Christ and experience Him
In 3:8 Paul says, 'I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord'
The excellency of the knowledge of Christ and Christ Himself are in contrast to all other things, including the law
It is important to realize that in 3:8 Paul does not speak of the excellency of Christ, but of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ
Many readers of Philippians take the word excellency to refer not to the knowledge of Christ, but to Christ Himself
The addition of the words my Lord indicates that as Paul was writing, he was filled with intimate, tender feelings concerning Christ
Tender feelings concerning the preciousness of the Lord Jesus rose up within him, causing him to speak of 'Christ Jesus my Lord'
On account of this, not only did he count the law and the religion founded on the law to be loss, but he counted all things loss
The knowledge in 38 is not the knowledge that belongs to Christ the knowledge that Christ Himself has it is our subjective knowing of Christ
According to doctrine or opinion, you may say that the Person of Christ is more excellent than the knowledge of Christ
We have pointed out that the excellency of the knowledge of Christ is derived from the excellency of His Person
Perhaps you knew only that Christ is the Son of God sent by the Father in His mercy to die on the cross for the salvation of sinners
Although Christ's all-inclusiveness is clearly revealed in the Bible, many believers are greatly surprised when they hear us speak of it
One day, as he was on the road to Damascus, Christ appeared to him, called to him, and said, 'Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me'?
If you testify that Christ is excellent but do so without having the knowledge of Him, you will be speaking merely according to tradition
You will be speaking something you do not know, because you yourself have not received the excellent knowledge concerning Christ
Gaining the excellency of the knowledge of Christ may be illustrated by the experience of tourists shopping in Hong Kong
The merchants there know how to display their products, especially jade, in a way to make them very attractive to tourists
Once they saw them and gained the excellency of the knowledge concerning them, they were willing to pay the price to possess them
My burden in this message is not related to doctrine; my burden is that we see a vision and receive a revelation of the excellency of Christ
If we have a revelation of Christ's excellency, we shall automatically have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ
According to these verses, Paul suffered the loss of all things and counted them to be refuse in order to gain Christ and be found in Him
At his conversion he was transferred from the law and his former religion into Christ, and he became 'a man in Christ'
He was a person who lived in Christ, and his aspiration and expectation were that he would be found by others in Christ
Paul suffered the loss of all things and counted them refuse in order to gain Christ on the one hand and to be found in Him on the other
The righteousness of the law is the righteousness which comes from man's own effort to keep the law, as mentioned in verse 6
Faith is the basis, the condition, for us to receive and possess the righteousness out from God, the highest righteousness, which is Christ
If you visit another country and stay in a brothers home you will probably find it impossible to avoid the national flavor prevailing there
When Paul wrote Philippians 3, deep within him was the realization that the traditional forms of human living occupy everyone
Rather, they find us in something other than Christ, in some aspect of man's six thousand years of traditional living
Even in the prayers of the saints it is sometimes possible to sense the flavor of the six-thousand-year tradition
The book of Philippians was written by Paul in his later ministry, not long before he was to depart from this earth
If we would be found in Christ, we need to be watchful moment by moment, continually on the alert to live in Christ
Salvation here is Christ Himself, the very Christ in whom we may be found by others and even by angels and demons
Satan Gods enemy uses this tradition as a means to occupy us to frustrate us and to keep us from the higher and richer experience of Christ
All the words between be found in Him in verse 9 and to know Him in verse 10 describe in what condition Paul aspired to be found in Christ
He was willing to suffer the loss of all things and count them to be refuse that he might gain Christ and be found in Him to know Him
To know Him in verse 10 is by experience-to have the experiential knowledge of Him, to experience Him in the full knowledge of Him
Paul first received the revelation of Christ and then sought for the experience of Christ-to know and enjoy Him in an experiential way
Once we have gained Christ and are found in Him, we shall know Him; that is, we shall enjoy Him and experience Him
We may illustrate this difference by the difference between buying groceries and eating food which has been purchased and prepared
First we have the excellency of the knowledge of the groceries, then we gain them by buying them, and finally we enjoy the food by eating it
Paul realized that to gain Christ and be found in Him always results in knowing Him, in enjoying and experiencing Him
The excellency of the knowledge of Christ will attract us to Christ and motivate us to lay aside everything other than Him
Although we know this as a doctrine, in our daily life much of the time we do not live one spirit with the Lord
How much have we gained Christ, how much are we found in Christ, and how much do we experientially know Christ?
Because of our urgent need to experience Christ, it is not my burden in these messages to present Bible teachings
To experience the power of Christ's resurrection, we need to live a crucified life according to the pattern of His life
Our conformity to His death affords a base for the power of His resurrection to rise up that His divine life may be expressed in us
With us, the power of His resurrection comes first, then the fellowship of His sufferings and conformity to His death
By this power we are enabled to participate in His sufferings and live a crucified life in conformity to His death
By participating in Christ's sufferings, we are ushered into a position to experience the power of His resurrection
To know that Christ is the arbitrating peace in our hearts does require the excellency of the knowledge concerning Him
We need to enjoy the fellowship of Christ's sufferings that we may be conformed to His death and know the power of His resurrection
May we all forget the things behind and go on to something higher, deeper, and more profound concerning Christ
The book of Philippians is not an elementary writing; it is a book in the 'graduate school' of spiritual experience
It is easy to see that material things may be substitutes for Christ in our lives or may frustrate us from enjoying Him
It is not easy to see that things that are not material, such as religion, philosophy, and culture, may also be substitutes for Christ
Although they were progressing spiritually to a certain extent, hardly any lived outside their national culture
A more serious problem is that they do not know the difference between Chinese philosophical ethics and Christ
Even those who have some measure of discernment may still unconsciously and subconsciously live more in the realm of ethics than in Christ
A first step toward living apart from ethics and in Christ Himself is to develop the discernment between ethics and Christ
What is true of Chinese Christians concerning ethics is also true of Christians of different nationalities concerning their cultures
When Paul said that he counted all things loss, he meant not only material things, but also things such as religion, philosophy, and culture
We may be willing to count material things as loss for Christ, but we may not count as loss our culture or our national characteristics
If we have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, we shall see that He far surpasses the best national characteristics
Only the excellency of the knowledge of Christ will rid us of the influence of all the things that are not Christ Himself
Although we may know Him as the mystery of God's economy, it is not easy for us to apply Him in this aspect in our daily walk
The excellency of the knowledge of Christ annuls the influence of our national characteristics and domestic philosophy
Since this life element is already in the seed, there is no need for power to be added to the seed from without
Should the seed pass through death, its shell will be broken, and life will be released, not from on high, but from within the seed
In order for resurrection life to be released from within the seed, the outer shell of the seed must be broken
During His entire life, Christ underwent a process of breaking so that the life power could be released from within Him
Eventually, this process of the breaking of the outer man will result in full conformity to the death of Christ
Christ's death is a mold to which we are conformed in much the same way that dough is put in a cake mold and conformed to it
The mold of Christ's death refers to the continual putting to death of His human life that He might live by the life of God
If we allow our circumstances to press us into this mold, our daily life will be molded into the pattern of Christ's death
When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He always put His human life to death so that the divine life within Him could be lived out
According to this pattern, Christ continually put to death His human life so that His divine life could flow out
As those who believe in Christ and who have been regenerated by the Spirit, we have both the human life and the divine life
According to their understanding, a person would not need to put his human life to death if every aspect of it were good
Every aspect of the human life, the good as well as the bad, must be put to death so that the divine life can be released
As long as something belongs to the human life, it must be put to death in order for the divine life to be lived out
If we put to death our natural life, we shall have the consciousness that we have another life, the divine life, within us
The Chinese may pride themselves on their philosophical ethics, whereas Americans may boast of their frankness and openness
Although we may be willing to put so many other things to death, we hold these national characteristics as a priceless treasure
The reason for this shortage is that they have not put to death their national characteristics and counted them as refuse
Some may proclaim that they count all things as refuse, but at least this one matter remains, hidden within them
Instead of speaking of up-to-date experiences, you try to live on your past experiences and speak of them again and again
All believers who are dead in Christ will participate in the resurrection from among the dead at the Lord's coming back
Paul's meaning here is that he was still growing, for he did not regard himself as one who had reached maturity
Have you ever heard anyone say that at the time he was converted Christ gained him so that he might gain Christ?
Some have testified that they tried to get away from the Lord for many years, but eventually had to return to Him
If we have the assurance that we have grown in life to an advanced degree, we probably have not grown to that extent
To dwell on our past experiences, no matter how real they may have been, frustrates our further pursuing after Christ
He, of course, had obtained the common salvation by the common faith , but he was still pursuing Christ in order to gain Him
In order to have this portion of resurrection, called the out-resurrection, we must pursue, run the race, and finish our course triumphantly
Following this, we need to do one thing: forget the things which are behind and stretch forward to the things which are before
The goal toward which we are pursuing is the full enjoyment of Christ, and the prize is the extra enjoyment of Christ
Although hundreds of students may graduate at the same time, only a small number will enjoy this special portion
Many Christians hold the concept that as long as they are resurrected when the Lord comes back, they will not have any problems
Some Christians may not agree with the interpretation that the goal and the prize in 3:14 are related to the millennial kingdom
Do not be under the influence of the teaching popular with Christians today that all believers will be kings in the millennium
No matter how we may interpret Paul's word concerning the goal and the prize, we cannot deny that both are facts with certain points
Do not be distracted by the effort to understand just what kind of prize you will obtain when you reach the goal
What is crucial is that you realize that, according to the divine revelation, God has set forth Christ as your goal and prize
After he was saved, he pursued Christ to such an extent we may even say he persecuted Christ, but in a very positive way
After he was saved and had been gained by Christ, he still persecuted Him, but positively, for he refused to let Christ go
In verse 15 Paul uses the expression 'full grown' in a relative sense, meaning relatively mature, neither childish nor absolutely mature
God wants always to adjust our mind to His center by revealing to us the need of such a mind, a mind focused on the pursuing of Christ
Because of this assurance he could say that if in anything we were otherwise minded, this also God would reveal to us
If we do not have a fixed goal, the unique goal, the goal set up by God in eternity, and hold to it, we shall eventually be distracted
The only thing that can keep us on God's way is His unique goal-Christ for our highest enjoyment and ultimate gain
Among the ancient Greeks, there were, as there are today, societies or organizations which followed certain basic principles
We have pointed out that this word is derived from a word which means to range in regular line or march in military rank
Paul uses this term in Romans 4:12, where he speaks of 'those who walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham'
To walk in the steps of Abraham's faith is to conform to his faith, to conform ourselves to certain virtue or piety
Paul's main thought in 3:16 is that, as Christians, the most important principle of our Christian life should be to pursue Christ
As this hymn indicates, the governing principle of the Christian life is not gifts or healing-it is Christ Himself
It is crucial for us to see that the basic and governing principle of the Christian life is that we gain Christ
Paul's use of this Greek word indicates that by the same path we should walk according to the elementary principle
In verse 7 he says that certain 'things were gains,' and he speaks of having counted such things loss on account of Christ
By 'this mind' Paul means a mind focused on pursuing Christ, a mind centered on enjoying Christ and gaining Him
The governing principle of our Christian life should be the pursuing after the enjoyment of Christ and the experience of Christ
Pursuing Christ in order to experience Him and enjoy Him should be the basic and elementary principle of our Christian life
The reason for the confusion and the divisions among Christians today is that so few are willing to walk according to this basic principle
Today's Christianity is without impact, power, and authority because it has been cut into pieces and made subject to confusion
We should not allow these things to remain as rocks hidden deep within us, occupying a place which belongs to Christ
As we have pointed out elsewhere, our national characteristics are used by the enemy, Satan, as substitutes for Christ
If we would deal with the soul, we need to count as refuse all religious matters, philosophical things, and cultural elements
In our psychological stomach a tumor has grown and has taken over nearly all the room which should be reserved for Christ
Believers from every country, and even from different regions in a particular country, have a tumor characteristic of them
Why do Christians who truly love the Lord and seek Him earnestly go on year after year without growing in life?
The lack of growth in life and shortage of revelation in reading the Word are caused by a tumor in their psychological stomach
We should not think that Paul deals only with the soul and leaves the body free to indulge itself in its lusts
To deal with the soul, they had to count as refuse all religious, philosophical, and cultural things and not treasure them
Nothing philosophical can compare with Christ, and no cultural element should be allowed to be a substitute for Him
They were enemies of the cross of Christ, which has terminated the indulgence of the lusts of the physical body
In promoting the enjoyment of eating and drinking, the Epicureans were more concerned with physical indulgence than with ethics or morality
According to the book of Colossians, Paul did not agree with asceticism, with the practice of treating the body severely
The Stoics taught that a person should be content in all circumstances, caring neither for enjoyment nor for suffering
There was the danger that the believers would be misled by the Epicureans into the indulgence of physical enjoyment
Concerning our body, we need to eat properly and be nourished in order to have a long life for the Lord's expression
In verse 20 Paul goes on to say, 'For our citizenship is in the heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ'
Because our citizenship is in the heavens, we should not be occupied with earthly things, with the physical things needed for our existence
If we love the earthly things needed for human life, this is an indication that we do not treasure our heavenly citizenship
May we all remember that our citizenship is in the heavens and that we are a heavenly people sojourning on earth
Christ's body of glory is His resurrected body, saturated with God's glory and transcendent over corruption and death
You may allow your body to rest on the best and most expensive bed, but it is nonetheless a body of humiliation
One day, the Lord Jesus will come and transfigure the body of humiliation and conform it to the body of His glory
To deal with our body, we should take care of our physical need, but not indulge in excessive physical enjoyment
While we are waiting for the Lord's coming, we should take care of our physical needs without indulging in material things
Verse 10 says, 'To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death'
We need to study carefully Paul's word about being conformed to Christ's death and solve the puzzle raised by this expression
We also need to ponder the goal and the prize in verse 14, not assuming that we have a full understanding of these two items
In the first two chapters of Philippians we see the fellowship, the spiritual traffic, between the apostle and the believers
As we have pointed out, the third chapter is concerned with two kinds of dealing-the dealing with the soul and with the body
Although you have received Christ, you may confine Him to your spirit and not allow Him to spread out into your soul
Your soul may have been filled with the things of religion, philosophy, and culture, in particular with your national characteristics
The contents of chapter four are related to what Paul has already written and are a confirmation of these points
Philippians 4:1 says, 'So then, my brothers, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, beloved'
According to the foregoing chapters, to think the same thing is related to pursuing Christ in order to gain Him and enjoy Him in full
In writing to the Philippians, Paul was seeking a genuine yokefellow, one who would bear the same burden as he, under the same yoke
Those who had not been yoked together with Paul would not have been able to help him with Euodias and Syntyche
Paul was burdened to help these sisters to think the same thing-to pursue after Christ that they might gain Him and experience Him
Paul expected that among the saints in Philippi there would be at least one who was the same as he was in pursuing Christ
In reading the book of Philippians it is important to find out what are the basic factors which motivated Paul in his writing
As he was composing this concluding word, Paul was still motivated by those factors which caused him to write the first three chapters
The same is true with respect to Paul's word in chapter three concerning counting all things loss, even refuse, in order to gain Christ
Although Philippians is a short book, the factors which motivated the writing of this book are rich and profound
In these messages we have been exercised to dig into the depths of Philippians and bring these factors to light
Why does he continue with naming certain virtues, and why do these virtues not include such things as holiness, victory, and patience?
Paul considers forbearance and the lack of anxiety as the first two aspects of the expression of a life that lives Christ
Some saints are given to the pursuit of rivalry and vainglory, whereas others are given to murmurings and reasonings
Whenever we have rivalry, vainglory, murmurings, and reasonings, there is no calm, no tranquillity, no forbearance
Of speaking outwardly, calm yourself, call on the Lord inwardly, and wait until the situation is tranquil before you say anything
When we live Him, taking Him as our pattern and counting all things loss in order to gain Him, we sense that He is present with us
Be assured that whenever you live Christ, you will show forth such a forbearance, such a moderate and tranquil attitude
When you are striving in rivalry for vainglory or when you are murmuring or reasoning, you do not have this forbearance
The factor which motivated him to write these verses was his desire to show the expression of a life that lives Christ
Of being anxious, in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving we should make our requests known to God
In verse 6 Paul charges us 'in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God'
In our prayer to God there must be the essence of worship and fellowship, and also petitions for particular needs
Even if we do not have specific needs, we still need a time of prayer day by day to worship the Lord and have fellowship with Him
As we worship the Lord and have fellowship with Him in prayer, we enjoy communion with Him and practice the organic union with Him
The issue, the result, of practicing the organic union with the Lord is that the peace of God guards our hearts and thoughts in Christ Jesus
From experience we know that through prayer we receive this antidote to anxiety when the peace of God is infused into us
In Christ Jesus the peace of God patrols as a guard who goes back and forth before our hearts and our thoughts
Toward man we need the forbearance mentioned in verse 5, and with God we need the fellowship to which Paul refers in verses 6 and 7
As two leading aspects of the expression of a life that lives Christ, forbearance and fellowship cause us to remain calm inwardly
To say that we should be forbearing and free of anxiety does not mean that every day we shall receive only good news
We need not be troubled by this bad news, for we have the peace of God, God Himself as peace, within us, guarding our inner feelings
He simply points out two important aspects of a life that lives Christ-that we have forbearance, but no anxiety
In this message, a continuation of the preceding one, we shall go on to see six governing aspects of a life that lives Christ
Our human virtues are a vessel made to contain the divine virtues, just as a glove is made in the image of a hand to contain the hand
Human virtues such as truthfulness, dignity, purity, and loveliness are all aspects of man as a vessel to contain Christ as the reality
Since Paul himself lived Christ, he certainly would not charge the saints to live something else instead of Christ
In chapter two we see Christ as the pattern, and in chapter three, the pursuing of Christ with a view to gaining Him
If we consider carefully the virtues listed in 4:8, we shall have to confess that there is no way for us to live such a life in ourselves
The ethical teachings of Confucius are very high, but they are inferior to Paul's instructions here in Philippians
Based on the whole context of the book of Philippians, we can say that the six virtues in 4:8 are the expression of the living of Christ
The principle is the same with praise: there is something worthy of praise in all these six aspects of the Christian life
In verse 9 Paul concludes, 'The things which you have also learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things'
He says that the peace of God will guard our hearts and thoughts, then that the God of peace Himself will be with us
If you read the four Gospels carefully, you will see that the Lord lived a life absolutely outside religion, culture, and philosophy
He was not occupied in the least by the elements of religion, culture, philosophy, habit, custom, and tradition
The Gospels speak of a life, the living of the Lord Jesus, which was occupied purely and entirely by God the Father
If we live according to this pattern, we shall count as loss, even as refuse, all religious, cultural, and philosophical things
According to the context of the book of Philippians as a whole, these verses must be interpreted in such a way
The divine forbearance, truthfulness, and dignity are the reality and substance of human forbearance, truthfulness, and dignity
Our virtues are an empty vessel, an empty glove, until Christ comes into us and occupies every part of our being
After Christ has occupied us inwardly, filling every part of our inner being, then the 'glove' is filled with the living 'hand'
Probably the best ethical teachings are those of Confucius, who taught people to cultivate, to develop, their human virtues
When Christ is added to our virtues, they are no longer empty, but are filled with Christ as their content and reality
We wish to emphasize the fact that human virtues are a vessel, a container, to express Christ as the real content
The young people may not realize how much they are blessed to receive such a word concerning the Christian life
More than fifty years ago, many of us were earnestly seeking the Lord, but had no opportunity to hear the word you can hear today
In Philippians there is a vast territory for us to explore and inexhaustible riches for us to search out and experience
In doing many things we must first know the secret and also have the power, the strength, the energy, to accomplish those things
To change the figure of speech, because we do not have the key, we cannot open the door to the experience of Christ
On the one hand, Paul says, 'I have learned the secret' ; on the other hand, he testifies, 'I can do all things in Him who empowers me'
The metaphor is that of a person being initiated into a secret society with instruction in its rudimentary principles
By using this metaphor, Paul was saying that a church, which is rather mysterious, has certain basic principles
Although the church, the Body of Christ, is somewhat mysterious, the church definitely is not a secret society
Because the church has a mysterious aspect, there is the need of a spiritual initiation in order to learn the principles of the church life
When we are saved and come into the church, the Body of Christ, we need to be initiated by learning certain basic principles
The secret of the Body is to take Christ as our life to live Christ to pursue Christ to gain Christ to magnify Christ and to express Christ
Although they have been converted to Christ, baptized, and have joined a denomination, they have not been initiated into the Body of Christ
As a prisoner in Rome, he was far away from many of the believers and from many churches which had been raised up through his ministry
No doubt, when Epaphroditus came with the supply, making a large deposit into the heavenly account, that was the time for Paul to abound
My reason for dwelling on this matter is to point out that our circumstances are always sovereignly arranged by God
Sometimes His sovereign arrangement puts us in a low situation, and at other times in circumstances that are quite good
Paul realized that even though the supply had come from the church at Philippi, his circumstances were still in the hand of God
He had the assurance that he knew both how to be abased and how to abound, both how to abound and how to be in want
In verse 13 we find a basic principle related to the apostle's secret of sufficiency in Christ: 'I can do all things in Him who empowers me'
It is the converse of the Lord's word concerning our organic relationship with Him in John 15:5: 'Apart from Me you can do nothing'
In 3:9 Paul aspired to be found in Him; in 4:13 Paul declared that being in Him he could do all things in the One who empowered him
Whether or not there was any difference in enjoyment or in taste, it is certain that Paul had learned the secret
Only those who are truly in Christ in their experience and who are inwardly empowered by Him have no need to worry or to be anxious
We have pointed out that when the church at Philippi did not have the opportunity to supply Paul, he was in want
On the one hand, we can say that Paul was not worried, for he tells us that he had learned the secret both to be abased and to abound
On the other hand, there is an implication that, in referring to his situation, he must have had some human feeling of worry or anxiety
If Paul did not have any feelings of worry or anxiety why would he find it necessary to write such things in his Epistle to the Philippians
When many Christians give something as a gift, they do not have the deep sense that in this transaction there is the ministry of life
Between the two parties, the apostle and the believers, there was the fellowship of life and the mutual ministry of life
It might have been circumstances which kept the Philippian believers from continuing to send the material supply to Paul
According to Paul's feeling, the sending of a gift with Epaphroditus was the blossoming again of their concern for him
Paul's use of the word blossom implies that the believers' thought of him was a matter of life, something that expressed life
blossom anew' implies that the believers' concern for Paul had been dormant for a time, having passed through a winter season
For a plant to blossom anew requires that it undergo a period of withering or dormancy during the winter season
Whenever we give material things under the leading of the Lord, we should experience such a fellowship in life
The gospel includes not only the good news of salvation, redemption, forgiveness, justification, and eternal life
In the Epistle to the Philippians Paul deliberately uses the word account in referring to the heavenly banking system
Paul speaks of this in verse 19: 'And my God shall fill every need of yours according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus'
In the apostle's experience, he had the conviction and assurance that God was his God through his being one with Him
Which side of the ledger do you think would be bigger- the debit side or the credit side, the giving side or the receiving side?
If you open such an account with the intention of enriching yourself, God's repayment may not be given to you in this age
In these verses Paul was encouraging the believers to keep their account active, to have no gaps in the giving and receiving
The Philippians' material gift to supply the apostle's need was considered by him a sacrifice to God, acceptable and well-pleasing
We see that whenever we receive a gift, we need to have the assurance that this gift is presented not only to us, but also to God
Paul told the Philippians that God would fill every need of theirs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus
The apostle assured the Philippians that God would abundantly supply all their needs so as to bring them into His glory
Having learned the lesson not to tell others of the need, she called the oldest child and prayed together with her concerning the need
Truly the Lord's repayment of those who make deposits into the heavenly account is always according to His riches and in glory
Paul's Epistle to the Philippians ministered life not only to them, but to countless believers throughout the centuries
God comes in to visit both the ones who give and the one who receives in such a way as to express His splendor, His glory
It is important for us to realize, however, that it is only when we give in Christ that God becomes indebted to us
Whenever in Christ we give something to the church, to the needy saints, or to the Lord's work in His recovery, God becomes indebted to us
In verse 19 the word fill is modified by three phrases: first, according to His riches; second, in glory; and third, in Christ Jesus
Paul concludes this portion of Philippians with the words, 'Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever
When we give material things in Christ for God's interest, life is ministered to the Body, and God's glory is brought in
On the part of the believers in Philippi, this brought in the full supply; on the part of Paul in Rome, it brought in full satisfaction
When we send greetings to others or ask others to greet certain ones on our behalf we may greet them with our best regards or with our love
Paul had just written, 'And my God shall fill every need of yours according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus'
They greeted the believers not with their best regards, but with the assurance of God's repayment and with His glory
We may even say that Paul and those with him greeted the saints in Christ Jesus with the entire contents of the whole book of Philippians
Seen in the context of the whole book, Paul greeted every saint with all the profound aspects of the experience of Christ
Paul wanted the saints to be greeted in the very Christ whom we live magnify take as our pattern hold forth as the word of life and pursue
It is puzzling because we are not altogether sure to whom it refers; it is encouraging because it shows the furtherance of the gospel
Based upon his use of the word household, we believe that certain members of Nero's family actually were saved
It is significant that in writing to the Philippians Paul deliberately refers to 'those of Caesar's household'
Grace is God in Christ as our supply and enjoyment conveyed to us and realized through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
Because of this neglect of the regenerated human spirit, there is very little experience of Christ or enjoyment of the all-inclusive grace
In 2 Corinthians 1314 Paul says The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all
In contrast, when we call on the Lord, pray in a proper way, and pray-read the Word, we truly exercise our spirit
It is hardly necessary to speak of the exercise of the soul, especially of the mind, since this is emphasized so much in the schools
In this message we shall consider four very important terms used by Paul in Philippians: grace, salvation, the Spirit, and Christ
In 1:7 Paul tells the Philippians, 'Both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel you are all partakers of my grace'
Familiar with such terms as grace, salvation, the Spirit, and Christ, they may assume that they understand them
The wives need a certain kind of salvation, and the husbands need another kind of salvation, for both face different situations and problems
If we are troubled by our temper or face difficulties in our married life, we need still further kinds of salvation
Paul, a Jew, was not a prisoner in an ordinary jail; he was a prisoner of Caesar's royal guard, the praetorium
His weeping would have indicated that he was defeated, that he had lost his faith, confidence, and trust in the Lord
In order to maintain such a victorious standing as an apostle of Christ, Paul needed a particular kind of salvation
The first aspect was that Paul would not be put to shame in anything; the second, that Christ would be magnified in Paul's body
Paul's grace was not God in an objective way; it was God subjectively and experientially, the Triune God processed to be his portion
When this hymn was written, the experiential knowledge of God among the Lord's people had not come to this point
Even as recent as fifty years ago, Christians did not have the understanding of grace as the Triune God experienced and enjoyed by us
Standing on the shoulders of those who have gone before us, we have come to know that grace is far more than merely unmerited favor
Those with a background in systematic theology may be troubled by the expressions 'processed God' and 'raw God'
The crucifixion, which led to resurrection, and the resurrection, which led to ascension, were also steps in God's process
God has passed through a process not only to redeem us, but also to make it possible for us to enjoy Him as grace
Today the One we enjoy as our grace is the Triune God who has passed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection
When this grace becomes ours in our experience, we then enjoy the Triune God, and we can speak of my grace, our grace
A brother may testify that even in helping to arrange the chairs in the meeting hall he experiences God as his grace
Also, a married sister may testify that in her life at home with her husband and children she experiences the Lord as her grace
In 1:7 Paul speaks of 'the defense and confirmation of the gospel'; he does not here mention the preaching of the gospel
As we have pointed out again and again, it is actually a living, divine Person, the Triune God, processed to become grace to us
Paul must certainly have been a patriotic Jew, one who loved his nation and intensely disliked Roman imperialism
Because of his preaching of the Lord Jesus Christ, he became a prisoner under the control of the Roman imperialists
Certain ones among his contemporaries, out of rivalry with him, were glad that Paul was in prison and restricted from carrying out his work
If Paul could rejoice only in that kind of environment but not in prison, he would not have been a true overcomer
Paul rejoiced not only when the work in Philippi was flourishing, but he also rejoiced in prison when his work for the Lord was restricted
Paul's grace was his salvation, and his salvation was the Triune God sustaining him in a most difficult environment
He also said that those who believed in Him would have rivers of living water flowing out of their innermost being
The reason the Spirit was not yet was that Jesus was not yet glorified; that is, He had not yet been fully processed
We would not have this experience by calling on the name of such persons as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Plato, or Confucius
By calling on the Lord's name or by praying over even a few words in the Bible, we enjoy the Spirit with His bountiful supply
In this message we shall go on to consider the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ for magnifying Christ
As we have pointed out, many Christians have the habit, perhaps unconsciously, of taking things for granted in reading the Bible
Because they are familiar with the words they read, they take them for granted and assume that they understand them
In reading 1:19 we should ask why Paul speaks of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and not of the Holy Spirit nor of the Spirit of God
Paul knew that his situation would turn out to be for him a particular kind of salvation, a daily, personal, and instant salvation
In addition to this salvation, we still need a daily salvation, a salvation we can experience moment by moment
The salvation of which Paul speaks in 1:19 is not eternal salvation; it is not salvation from God's judgment or from hell
If this brother, in the presence of guests invited for dinner, expresses unhappiness or anger toward his wife, he will be put to shame
If we have the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, we shall experience instant and constant salvation
It is worthy of note that in 1:19 Paul speaks first of the saints' petition, then of the bountiful supply of the Spirit
The reason Paul speaks of the supply of the Body before the bountiful supply of the Spirit is that the Spirit is upon the Body
If the Body would be exercised to supply him, the bountiful supply of the Spirit would come to him through the Body
Whenever we stand apart from the Body as we pray, even our prayer will be dry, and our intercession will be ineffective
We see a wonderful picture of this supply of the Spirit in Exodus 30:23-30, a portion of the Word which speaks of the compound ointment
In Genesis 12 we read of the Spirit of God in Philippians 119 of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and in Revelation 2217 simply of the Spirit
The Spirit of Jesus Christ is not for creation or incarnation, but for our experience of the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ
In this Spirit we have the sweetness of Christ's death, the effectiveness of His death, and Christ's resurrection with its power
The second and third spices cinnamon and calamus form one unit whereas the first and fourth spices myrrh and cassia are each a complete unit
In the measurements of the spices and in the numbers pertaining to the ointment we have man and the Triune God
Even though many of us have heard messages on the compound Spirit, we may have little more than doctrinal knowledge
If this brother applies the compound Spirit and beholds the Lord, the elements of the ointment will be applied to him
Both the death of Christ and the resurrection of Christ will operate in him, and he will be anointed with the compound Spirit
It is common for pastors to use Paul's words in Ephesians 5 in giving instructions to a bride and groom during a wedding ceremony
If a brother and his wife both learn how to experience the bountiful supply of the Spirit, they will surely have a proper married life
If we are not in the Body or if we do not care for God's service, it will be very difficult for us to partake of this compound Spirit
To enjoy the Spirit we need to be part of the tabernacle and of the priesthood, part of God's dwelling and of His service
Believing in the reality of the compound Spirit, we may cry out to the Lord to have mercy on us, and we tell Him how much we need Him
The reason is that we have severed ourselves from the Body and are not part of the tabernacle in a practical way
Many of us can testify that before we came into the church, we did not have any enjoyment of the bountiful supply of the Spirit
If we are one with the church and stay in the priestly service, we enjoy the rich anointing of the all-inclusive Spirit
Even a little praying or calling on the name of the Lord, perhaps simply saying 'amen,' causes us to enjoy this anointing
The more we contact the Lord in this way, the more we sense the anointing and the more we become happy and released
By the petitions of the Body and by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, our circumstances turn out to be for our salvation
Referring to the Word made flesh, John the Baptist declared, 'Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world'
Finally, in John 20:22 we see that the very One who is the Word, God, the Lamb, and the vine is also the breath for us to receive
Unfortunately, many of today's Christians know only to reason and consider; they do not have any experience of breathing the holy breath
Eventually, having passed through crucifixion and resurrection, He became the holy breath for us to breathe in
On the one hand, He is the Lamb for accomplishing redemption; on the other hand, He is the tree for imparting life
The Word is for expression, the Lamb is for redemption, the tree is for the impartation of life, and the breath is for our living
No one can say that because he has become so knowledgeable or mature, it is no longer necessary for him to breathe
We have a life of coinherence with Christ because He is not only the Word, the Lamb, and the tree, but also the breath, the Spirit
Praise Him that today He is not merely the Word, the Lamb, and the tree, but also the pneuma,the breath, the Spirit!
Although we may eat several meals a day and although we may drink many times during the day, no one can eat and drink without ceasing
After Paul charges us to pray without ceasing and to give thanks in everything, he tells us not to quench the Spirit
We have seen that, according to the New Testament, the Spirit is the Triune God processed to become the life-giving Spirit
It is not sufficient simply to pray several times during the day, in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night
After living on earth for thirty-three and a half years, He was crucified on the cross to redeem us by taking away our sins
The Bible also reveals that in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit: 'The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit'
When you are angry over a car that will not start or over a broken shoelace, can you honestly say that you are fine?
Let us practice to build up a habit of calling on the Lord's name until we call unconsciously and unintentionally
We should be those who do not care for systematic theology, but care for the proper and rich enjoyment of our living Lord
As branches of the vine, we are one in life with the vine and experience the inward flowing of the life of the vine
In 1:19-21a we have salvation, the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the magnifying of Christ, and the living of Christ
In 2:12, 13a, and 16a we have the matters of working out our own salvation, of God operating in us, and of holding forth the word of life
If he enjoys the supply of the Spirit, he will experience an instant salvation, and Christ will be magnified in him
For the problems we face day by day, especially in our family life and in the church life, we need God's salvation
When Paul tells us to work out our own salvation, he is not speaking of salvation from hell nor salvation from God's condemnation
If our married life and church life are filled with murmurings and reasonings, this is proof that we are lacking God's salvation
How marvelous it would be if in the church in our locality there were no murmurings or reasonings, but an abundance of salvation!
What Paul speaks of in 1:20 is the magnification of Christ, but in 2:16 he speaks of holding forth the word of life
On the other hand, we see from chapter two that we need to work out our salvation by cooperating with God's energizing
We need to be impressed with the fact that the Spirit in 119 equals God in 213 and that Christ in 120 and 21 equals the word of life in 216
At other times in our experience we first receive the Word, and then the Word becomes the Spirit moving within us
Whether we first experience the Spirit and then the Word, or first the Word and then the Spirit, the Spirit and the Word are one
At the beginning of the Gospel of John, Christ is the Word, but at the end of this Gospel, He breathes out the Spirit
If we have the Spirit without the Word or the Word without the Spirit, we shall not be able to receive the divine transmission
In Ephesians 6:17 and 18 Paul tells us to receive the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition
Whenever we come to the Word of God, we should not merely exercise our eyes to read or our mind to understand, but also exercise our spirit
According to the Greek text, we must say that we should receive the Word of God either by means of prayer or through prayer
You may have read the words, 'God so loved the world,' and then prayed, 'O God, thank You for loving the world
When we exercise our spirit in pray-reading the Word, we apply the Word to us and mingle the Word and the Spirit
In His ascension He was glorified, crowned, and enthroned; He received the headship, the lordship, and the kingship
In addition to these crucial matters, the Bible also reveals that Christ in His resurrection became the life-giving Spirit
Through the Word we realize that we receive Christ's divinity, humanity, human living, all-inclusive death, resurrection, and ascension
The basic thought of the Bible is that the Triune God desires to work Himself into man so that man may take Him as life and live Him
The relationship between God and the man created in God's image may be illustrated by a glove designed to contain a hand
After passing through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Triune God was ready to come into man
To baptize believers into the name of the Triune God is to immerse them into the very Person of the Triune God
According to the Bible we teach that we are one with God because, through regeneration, we have the life and nature of God
Those who are occupied with ethics and religion will pay attention to those matters in the Bible which they regard as ethical or religious
In his reading of the Bible, he may pay special attention to those portions of the Word which seem to be concerned with ethics
He may appreciate Paul's words concerning the behavior of husbands and wives, for these sound much like the teachings of Confucius
A believer with a different cultural background may appreciate the Bible because it teaches us not to make a display of ourselves
He may pay attention to those matters in the Word which seem to be in line with his national characteristics and cultural background
When we come to the Bible, we should forget about ethics, culture, and different kinds of national characteristics
Paul even uses the expression 'healthy teaching' , referring to teaching that nourishes us and makes us healthy
We need to read the Word of God without wearing any kind of colored glasses, that is, without any preoccupying concepts
With respect to Christ, there are the unsearchable riches, but with respect to the Spirit, there is the bountiful supply
If we would touch the unsearchable riches of Christ and partake of the bountiful supply of the Spirit, we must come to the Bible
Matthew 4:4 says, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God'
After a carnation seed is sown into the earth, it sprouts, grows, and develops, and eventually a carnation blossom appears
In the illustration of the carnation seed we see not only the growth of life but also the life shape the life function and the life power
The New Testament reveals Christ's divinity, humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and glorification with enthronement
Let us use Psalm 133 to show the difference between analyzing the Bible and enjoying the nourishment contained in it by pray-reading
As they read, they may begin to analyze and to ask about the precious ointment, the beard, the skirts, the dew, and Mount Hermon
On the one hand, the food we eat each day nourishes us; on the other hand, it contains elements that kill germs
Through pray-reading the Word, we experience both nourishment and the putting to death of the negative things within us
If we receive the riches of Christ by pray-reading the Word, it will not be necessary for us to decide to do good or to improve ourselves
In our living there will be divinity, humanity, the experience of Christ's death, and the strengthening in His resurrection life
Christ's resurrection life will release the divine riches into you, strengthen your spirit, and edify your whole being
As far as food is concerned, the important thing is not to know-it is to receive the food into our bodies by eating
If we are to live a proper Christian life, God desires that we realize that we have been born of Him and are now His children
Daily we must come to the Word with a praying spirit to receive both the riches of Christ and the bountiful supply of the Spirit
Nourished by the Word in this way, we shall grow and spontaneously live a life full of all the different elements of Christ's riches
In our living there will be an uplifted humanity, the operation of Christ's wonderful death, and the fragrance and power of His resurrection
How marvelous that the Triune God has wrought Himself into us and has also given us His holy Word without and His Spirit within!
The reason for this is that the concept of receiving help from God to improve our behavior is contrary to God's economy
He is our food to nourish us; our drink to quench our thirst; our air to refresh us; and our life supply to enrich us
Having passed through the steps of a divine process, the Triune God is now a universal, all-inclusive drink, prepared and available
Whether or not a particular meeting is of the Lord can be determined by whether or not there is a 'dining table' in that meeting
In every meeting there is a dining table set for us, and we have the opportunity to eat and drink of the Triune God
For the word of Christ to dwell in us richly means that it inhabits us in the way of nourishment and enrichment
The food may be rich in nourishment, but its entering into us is not rich if we suffer from indigestion after eating it
Paul indicates that we should teach and admonish, not in an ordinary way, but in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs
As we admonish one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, we should sing with grace in our hearts to God
If we sing these verses with the exercise of the spirit, this portion of the Word will inhabit us richly, and we shall receive nourishment
By singing with our spirit we have a way to let the word of Christ inhabit us with all its riches to nourish us
Many of us can testify that, as we were enjoying a certain portion of the Word, spontaneously a melody welled up from within
We need to see that the Word, the bountiful supply of the Spirit, and unceasing prayer with singing and thanking all go together
Because we are one with the Spirit, with the Word, and with Christ, we live Christ, we are truly one with Him in all we say and do
Gradually, the killing element in the Word will deal with the negative things in us-the flesh, the self, and the natural life
At the same time, the Word will nourish, strengthen, and enrich us, supplying us with all the elements we need for our spiritual growth
On the one hand, we are saturated with the Word and the Spirit; on the other hand, the negative things are gradually reduced
It is to testify according to Colossians 2:16 and 17 that Christ is the body, the reality, of all positive things
Even during difficult times, we may experience a true holiday if we have Christ as our joy, enjoyment, and rest
On the one hand, as life He has been supplied once for all; on the other hand, He is supplied to us continually as life
Ethics may be very good and a high standard of morality is no doubt excellent, but there is no comparison between these things and Christ
Although as human beings we are not very different from others, there is something mysterious and even special about us
To baptize the believers into the Triune God is to place them into an organic union with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
We praise the Lord that, as Christians, we have both the Holy Bible in our hands and the Holy Spirit in our spirit and heart
When Christians are asked about the Holy Spirit, they often say that the Spirit is the third Person of the Godhead
Although it is true to say that the Holy Spirit is the third of the Godhead, this understanding is not adequate
It is very important to see that the Father and the Son are fully realized in the Spirit as the third of the Godhead
When the Son came, the Father came with the Son not in an outward way, but inwardly, subjectively, within the Son
Do not think that when the Holy Spirit reaches you only He the third of the Godhead comes and that the Father and the Son remain in heaven
Of believing that Christ is in us, they claim that Christ sent the Holy Spirit to function as His representative in us
According to the Bible, we may say that the Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow
According to the Bible when we believed in the Lord Jesus called on His name and received Him as our Savior the Holy Spirit entered into us
One definite indicator that we have received the Holy Spirit is that we have a sweet sense within when we call on God our Father
Brother Nee pointed out to him that he could call his own father 'Daddy' in a sweet way because he had been born of him
Whether or not we ever speak in tongues, we may have the assurance that we have received the Holy Spirit and are now children of God
On the one hand, the Bible is the embodiment of the Spirit; on the other hand, the Spirit is the reality of the Bible
As a result, in our experience the Spirit and the Word are one enjoyment, and this enjoyment is the Triune God
Four basic verses in the New Testament are Colossians 2:9; Ephesians 3:8; Philippians 1:19; and Colossians 3:16
In these four verses we have the fullness, the riches, the bountiful supply, and the Word dwelling in us richly
The fullness of the Godhead is actually the riches of Christ, and the riches of Christ are the bountiful supply of the Spirit
When the Word of God inhabits us with the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, it truly inhabits us richly
When we read the Word and prayread it we can touch the essence and substance of the Word the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
As a result, we enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit, the riches of Christ, and the fullness of the Godhead
Oh, we need to be immersed in and saturated with the fullness of the Godhead, the riches of Christ, and the bountiful supply of the Spirit!
We all need to be permeated with the bountiful supply of the Spirit, the riches of Christ, and the fullness of the Godhead
By pray-reading the Word, we shall touch the supply of the Spirit, the riches of Christ, and the fullness of the Godhead
We may liken the bountiful supply of the Spirit to electricity, which reaches us by means of an antenna and a ground wire
Of praying like this, simply enjoy the Word and the Spirit, allowing the heavenly electricity to infuse you with the Triune God
As you receive the infusion of the bountiful supply of the Spirit, the will of God will become clear to you automatically and spontaneously
When we touch the bountiful supply of the Spirit, we shall live a life that expresses Christ, a life which actually is Christ Himself
Some may wonder how we, little human beings, can abide in God, and how the great, almighty God can abide in us
Recently, some tried to tell us that because God is unlimited in His greatness and man is so small, it is impossible for Him to abide in us
Christ abides in us, then He lives in us, and then He settles down in us, making His home in our whole inner being
Even though the Lord who lives in his spirit does not agree, the brother, living according to his emotion, insists on doing that thing
He reasons with the Lord, trying to persuade Him to stay in his spirit and give him the freedom to live according to his emotion
He will not only abide in us and live in us, but spread into every part of our inner being and settle down there
He abides in us, He lives in us, and He desires to make His home, to settle Himself, throughout our inner being
For Christ to be formed in us means that He abides in us, lives in us, settles down in us, and then saturates every part of our being
We are here to live Christ, to have Christ wrought into us until our mind, emotion, and will are constituted of Him
In Romans 12:2 Paul charges us not to be conformed to this age, but to be transformed by the renewing of the mind
To be conformed to this age is to be fashioned outwardly according to the style of the age, according to the trend of the world
Day by day and meeting by meeting, something divine, spiritual, holy, and heavenly is being transfused into us
They may work diligently for Christ, but not realize that Christ is not only in heaven, but also dwelling within them
Some have even received the wrong teaching that Christ does not dwell in the believers, but is merely represented in them by the Holy Spirit
They think of the Holy Spirit as an agent sent by Christ to represent Him, to work in them, to move in them, and to inspire them
He dwells in us, He lives in us, He is seeking to settle Himself in us, and He is also working to saturate our entire being with Himself
For Paul's environment to turn out to be for his salvation means that it would turn out for the magnification of Christ in him
On the negative side, Paul expected that he would not be put to shame; on the positive side, he expected Christ to be magnified in him
In 1:19-20 Paul speaks of something turning out for salvation, but in 2:12 he tells us to work out our salvation
In verse 13 he goes on to explain, 'For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure'
When we murmur or reason, we may have the sense deep within that we are offending the operating God, grieving the indwelling Spirit
We may have the sense that the indwelling Spirit is telling us not to reason or murmur, but to work out our own salvation
The operating God equals the Spirit with the bountiful supply, and shining as luminaries is equal to magnifying Christ
To hold forth the word of life is to offer such a word to others, to present it to them, and even to apply it to them
Your answer should be that you offer Christ to them, present Christ to them, and apply Christ to them in their situation
To magnify Christ is to shine as luminaries without murmuring or reasoning, and to live Christ is to hold forth the word of life
The word of life infused into us will wash away the elements of culture and become the new constituent in our inner being
Paul almost personifies the word of Christ; he tells us to let this word inhabit us, as if it were a living person
Knowledge is related primarily to the function of the mind, whereas wisdom is related to the function of our spirit
Memorizing Bible verses is a function of the mind related to knowledge, not a function of the spirit related to wisdom
For the Word to dwell in us in all wisdom refers to its indwelling every way possible through the exercise of the spirit
The brother may also show wisdom by exercising his spirit to share a helpful testimony he heard recently in a church meeting
What issues from the exercise of the spirit is wisdom, but what comes through the exercise of the mind is knowledge
Paul does not speak of teaching and admonishing in an ordinary way, but of teaching and admonishing in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs
Nowhere in the New Testament are Christians told that we should gather together and sit quietly, waiting for someone to start the meeting
The church meetings should begin not in the meeting hall, but either in our homes or on our way to the meeting
Even though we have been reading Colossians for years, we have not paid adequate attention to taking the Word by singing
As we psalm the Word, we dwell upon it, muse on it, and enjoy it, thereby giving more opportunity for the Word to saturate us
If we only read the Word, there is little opportunity for the portion we read to sink into us and saturate our being
We shall participate in the bountiful supply of the Spirit and enjoy the riches of Christ by receiving the Word of God
We may not understand very much about the water we drink and especially about the food we eat, but we need to drink and eat nevertheless
Now we must go on to see that there is no better way to receive the Word into our being than by singing the Word
The more we sing and psalm the Word of God, the more it will sink into the depths of our being and saturate us
If we take even a little time to sing the Word, we shall sense that we are inwardly filled and saturated with it
When the element of Christ has been infused into us by our singing and psalming the Word, we live Christ spontaneously and automatically
When we sing and psalm the Word, we are saturated with the divine element contained in the Word and conveyed to us through the Word
The fullness of the Godhead and the unsearchable riches of Christ are realized by the Spirit and in the Spirit
Colossians 3:16 refers both to these riches and to the matter of the word of Christ inhabiting us, indwelling us
According to Ephesians 3:19, if Christ makes His home in our heart, we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God
Now this Christ with His unsearchable riches is making His home in our hearts so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of the Godhead
Concerning the Spirit, there are two extremes, one found among fundamentalists and the other among Pentecostalists
Because they are afraid of the experience of the Spirit, certain fundamental Christians care primarily for Bible doctrine
Fundamental Christians are often afraid to hear about the experience of Christ, the Spirit, and the inner life
Just as our life and our physical body are one entity, one complete living organism, so the Spirit and the Word are one
Just as it is the invisible life within our body which makes our body vigorous and active, it is the Spirit who causes the Word to be living
Many of us can testify that when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus with faith and love, we receive the Spirit
We see the connection between the Lord's word and the Father and the Son coming to us and making an abode with us
Because Christ is God, He is real; because He is the Spirit, He is living; and because He is the Word, He is very practical
When we are filled with the word of Christ, we are automatically filled with the riches of Christ and the fullness of the Godhead
In singing and psalming the Word, we may use any kind of melody, even a spontaneous one of our own composition
In the meetings of the church we sometimes sing, 'Therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall return, and come with singing unto Zion'
We should not think that Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians are merely words written by Paul and are not the word of Christ
For this reason, we should regard all the words written by Paul, in fact the whole New Testament, as the word of Christ
My concern is not with formal singing it is with the spontaneous singing of the Word a singing which causes our whole being to be exercised
We did not even exercise our emotion adequately to love the Word, or exercise our will strongly to receive the Word
If we exercise our whole being to take in the Word, eventually we shall be filled, occupied, and saturated with the living Word
Our thinking will be Christ's thinking, our speaking will be Christ's speaking, and our actions will be Christ's actions
For the Lord to do works in the name of the Father is to be one with the Father and to do things in the person of the Father
The thought here is that the Lord Jesus was one with the Father and therefore was in the person of the Father and in the Father's name
All these verses indicate that, according to biblical usage, to be in a person's name means to be one with that person
As the extensive, all-inclusive One, the One anointed by God, Christ wants not only to dwell in us, but also to make His home in us
It is not adequate merely to speak of Christ dwelling in us, for this does not convey the full meaning of the Greek word
We definitely agree that we need good behavior which is the product of the Christian life transformed with Christ
John 1423 proves this If anyone loves Me he will keep My word and My Father will love him and We will come to him and make an abode with him
Our thinking needs to be renewed with respect to the meaning of praying in the Lord's name and of doing things in His name
It is vital for us to see that to be in the name of the Lord Jesus means that we are one with Him, that we are in Him and He in us
As the Son is in the Father and the Father in the Son in the way of coinherence, we also must be one with the Lord in this way
Doing all things in the name of the Lord Jesus is related to letting the word of Christ saturate us and permeate us
Because the Lord has saturated us, permeated us, and mingled Himself with us, making us one with Him, we can do all things in His name
Colossians 3:17 corresponds to Philippians 4:13, where Paul tells us that he can do all things in the One who empowers him
If we are not in the name of the Lord Jesus, one with Him by having the word of Christ dwell in us richly, we cannot submit or love
The fulfillment of all the charges given by Paul in this portion of Colossians comes out of being 'in the name of the Lord Jesus'
A wife must submit to her husband in the name of the Lord, and a husband must love his wife also in the name of the Lord
Having become one with the Lord by singing, psalming, praying, and thanking, we need to preserve this oneness by persevering in prayer
They neglect the Triune God dispensing Himself into the believers and mingling Himself with them that they may live Him
The Word will enter into us, stir us up, and become mingled with us, causing us to be one with the Lord in an actual and practical way
In verse 12 Paul speaks of working out our own salvation, and in verse 13 he goes on to say that God is operating in us
We have Christ as the pattern of our salvation and we must work out our own salvation according to God's operation in us
Even though He is equal with God, He 'emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men'
Although He subsisted in the form of God, He took on the form of a slave and became in the likeness of men and in the fashion of a man
On the other hand, being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross
Philippians 2:9 says, 'Wherefore also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name'
After His resurrection, He was uplifted to the heavens and with His human nature was brought back to the form of God in glory
The pattern of the Christian life is the God-man Savior who emptied Himself and humbled Himself and who was exalted and glorified by God
To work out our salvation is to work out this pattern and to become in our experience a reprint of the pattern
We have pointed out that the sisters have a particular problem with murmurings, and the brothers, with reasonings
We have seen that, as our pattern, Christ emptied Himself and humbled Himself and also was exalted and glorified by God
Now we must obey this pattern, realizing that Christ does not murmur or reason, but empties Himself and humbles Himself
When the brothers are tempted to reason, they need to remember the pattern of the self-emptying and self-humbling Christ
Whenever we obey Christ as our pattern, we automatically work out our salvation from our murmurings and reasonings
Philippians 2:13 says, 'For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure'
The pattern is Christ, the God-man who emptied and humbled Himself and who has been exalted and glorified by God
Often when a sister is complaining or murmuring, she may sense that something within is constraining her and urging her to stop
Many of us can testify from our experience that whenever we come to the Bible and open ourselves, we touch God, and God works within us
Whenever we touch the word of life, we experience God operating in us, moving in us, to produce a reprint of the pattern
Paul enjoyed daily salvation through the bountiful supply of the Spirit, and we may enjoy daily salvation by the word of life
Paul says that to enjoy salvation through the bountiful supply of the Spirit is to magnify Christ and to live Christ
In the same principle, when we enjoy salvation daily through God operating in the word of life, we also live Christ
For this reason, Isaiah 9:6 declares that unto us a child is born and that this child is called the mighty God
We may enjoy the three-one God as the Spirit because He has come into our spirit and has made us one spirit with Him
As a result of God's doings, we have the life-giving Spirit, and as a result of God's speaking, we have the Word
By means of an antenna and a ground wire electricity may be applied in different ways and the electricity will flow
Many, especially those in the seminaries and Bible colleges, study the Bible, but neglect the Spirit, the antenna
At the other extreme are the Pentecostalists who emphasize the Spirit the antenna but do not adequately care for the Bible the ground wire
We in the Lord's recovery should be balanced and have both the antenna and the ground wire, both the Spirit and the Word
If we are balanced concerning the Spirit and the Word, we shall experience the transmission, the flowing, of the divine electricity
We praise the Lord that through His doings He has become the Spirit and that through His speaking He has become the Word
When we contact the Word in a proper way by reading and praying, we experience the current of the divine electricity
Probably something is defective in our experience of the antenna, the Spirit, leaving us with only the Word as the ground wire
As a result of God's operating in us, we spontaneously have a life in which the word of life is held forth to others
As we prayread a portion of the Word we sense that something inwardly is moving operating in us to comfort strengthen satisfy and refresh us
Those around us may be surprised at the change which takes place in us as a result of contacting the Word in this way
Now we have both the antenna and the ground wire, both the Spirit and the Word, for us to contact and enjoy the heavenly electricity
The more we experience the word of life as the embodiment of the living God, the more God will become our enjoyment
We may say that they are twoone even though there is not such an expression in our language because there is not such a fact in our culture
According to the Bible, we may say that the Father, Son, and Spirit are distinct, but They definitely are not separate
Verses such as these indicate that we need to be delivered from the natural, traditional, and religious way of understanding the Bible
It is crucial for us to realize that, having passed through the various steps of a process, the Triune God today has become the Spirit
In the past we have pointed out that for Christ to be the Word of God means that He is the definition, explanation, and expression of God
In the previous message we pointed out that the Spirit is the consummation of the process through which the Triune God has passed
Applying this illustration to the Bible and the Spirit, we may compare the Bible to the match and the Spirit to phosphorus
Because a match is made of phosphorus and is the embodiment of phosphorus, it makes phosphorus available to us
Even though the Word is the embodiment of the Spirit, many Christians do not contact the Word through the Spirit
In the same principle if we would contact the Spirit embodied in the Word we need to strike the match of the Word by exercising our spirit
Suppose someone tried to light a match by analyzing it or by exercising his emotion to express his love for it
If we want to contact the Spirit through the Word, we should not merely analyze the 'match' of the Word or express our affection for it
One of those who practiced praying the words of the Bible was George Whitefield, a contemporary of John Wesley
He said that when we speak to others, especially in giving a message, we need to send forth our spirit by exercising it
He pointed out that if we use a certain part of our being while speaking to others, we shall touch the same part in them
Because man is fallen, his spirit is dormant, whereas the mind and the emotion of the soul are extremely active
If they exercise their spirit instead of the emotion, they will pray in a very different manner about their problems
Our spirit may even be dormant when we come to the Bible, whereas other parts of our being, especially the mind, may be extremely active
We can testify that by taking the Word in the proper way, exercising our spirit, we experience the burning in our spirit
In the Bible light is one with life, life is one with love, love is related to holiness, and holiness, to righteousness
When we contact the Triune God as the Spirit through the Word we experience Him as our light life love holiness righteousness and power
To us the Bible may be either a book of knowledge or a book of life, either the tree of knowledge or the tree of life
If we exercise our spirit to feed on the Word, the Bible will become in our experience a book of life, even the tree of life
In verse 7 He says, 'If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall come to pass to you'
When we exercise our spirit to contact the Word, the Word becomes identical to the Lord Himself in our experience
The Word is living, energizing, and filled with the divine attributes of light, life, love, holiness, righteousness, and power
Eventually, when in our experience the Word, Christ, and the Triune God are mingled together as one, we live Christ
The Lord Jesus said, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God'
We have pointed out that the Lord Jesus said that man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God
The words murmurings, reasonings, and crooked and perverted generation in these verses can supply us with life if we pray-read and sing them
We should not only eat these words, but also digest them and assimilate them so that they may become part of our constitution
To be blameless is to be without defect in our outward behavior, and to be guileless is to be pure in our inward character
If we are filled with the riches of the living Word day by day, spontaneously we shall hold forth the word of life
We should not only pray-read the words children of God; we should also sing them, either using a familiar tune or making up our own melody
We are not only children of God, but are also luminaries with the heavenly function of reflecting Christ as the real sun
The function of an apple tree is to bear apples, and our function as luminaries possessing the divine life and nature is to shine
Because we are supplied with this life and energized by it, we can shine as luminaries by holding forth the word of life
Spontaneously, unconsciously, and even unintentionally, we shall live a life that expresses Christ and holds forth the word of life
To say that this salvation is constant means that it is a salvation we may experience every day, every hour, and every moment
It certainly must have been an insult for an educated upperclass Jew to be chained to a guard in a Roman prison
What Paul has in mind here is a very subjective, experiential salvation, a salvation experienced not once for all, but moment by moment
When Paul said that he expected his situation to turn out for his salvation, he did not have in mind release from prison
It means that, no matter how difficult Paul's situation was and no matter how insulting, he would not be put to shame in anything
Possibly Paul's enjoyment of Christ in prison may have been a factor in bringing Onesimus, a runaway slave, to salvation
Far from being found complaining or weeping, he could be found rejoicing in the Lord, singing praises to Him, and testifying concerning Him
Every aspect of God's salvation brings us out of something on the negative side and ushers us into something on the positive side
From verses 14 and 15 we see that these things include murmurings reasonings blame guile blemishes crookedness perverseness and darkness
No matter where we may be, there will be murmuring, reasoning, blame, guile, blemishes, crookedness, perverseness, and darkness
By working out this salvation we shall be saved from murmurings reasonings blame guile blemishes crookedness perverseness and darkness
Just as the salvation in 1:19 has both a negative side and a positive side, the salvation in 2:12 has two sides
The negative side is in verses 14 and 15; the positive side is in verse 16, where Paul speaks of 'holding forth the word of life'
To hold forth the word of life is to present it to others and offer it to them, applying it to them in their situation
What we offer to those around us should not be words of murmuring or reasoning, nor anything related to crookedness or perverseness
When we experience this salvation, we spontaneously hold forth, present, apply, the word of life to those around us
Being a person in that kind of situation afforded him an excellent opportunity to experience and enjoy constant salvation
As we have pointed out, the daily situation of fallen man includes murmurings, reasonings, and many other negative things
You may not be a particular person with a particular case, but you certainly are an ordinary person in a common situation
To live Christ means that no matter what our circumstances may be, Christ is magnified in us and we are not put to shame in anything
Philippians presents God's salvation in a way that is more practical and experiential than the way it is presented in Romans
We need a salvation that can be applied to our daily situations, especially to our married life and family life
The book of Philippians reveals a salvation that we can experience day by day, a salvation that we can enjoy in the 'prison' of married life
In the church there are saints of many different nationalities and with all kinds of dispositions and personalities
If we are still crooked in some way, then, whether or not we are Christians, we are part of today's crooked generation
According to Philippians the means are two the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and the inward operation of the indwelling God
Please notice that the means of our daily salvation are not the bountiful supply of the Spirit of God and the operation of the visiting God
On the other hand, he charged the saints to work out their own salvation according to the inward operation of God
We were born of God when the Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, came into our spirit
The bountiful supply also includes an uplifted humanity, a humanity with a proper life, living, nature, and person
All that the Lord passed through in thirty-three and a half years of life on earth is now in the all-inclusive Spirit
Divinity and humanity, including the human living of the Lord Jesus, are in the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit
Now in the bountiful supply of the Spirit we have Christ's divinity, humanity, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
As we enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit, we partake of the ingredients of this supply without being aware of it
Whenever we try to behave ourselves apart from enjoying the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ we are political and hypocritical
As a result, Paul could realize that with this Triune God there is the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
In chapter two he goes on to point out how the believers may experience a constant salvation in the ordinary things of daily life
If a brother lived alone, without a wife as his companion, he might have little occasion for murmuring and reasoning
Should a husband come home from work and find the house not in proper order, he may find it difficult to be silent
If we are to experience constant salvation, we need to realize that this salvation is God Himself operating within us
By the time we come to the book of Philippians, God has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
The One who was born in a manger in Bethlehem and who lived in a carpenter's home in Nazareth was the mighty God
For the accomplishment of redemption, He was crucified, entered into death, took a tour of Hades, and came forth in resurrection
The indwelling God energizes us from within to be the source, power, strength, and energy for our constant salvation
In Philippians 2 Paul refers to murmurings, reasonings, blame, guile, blemishes, crookedness, perverseness, and darkness
To be saved from gross sins is relatively easy, but to be saved from murmurings, reasonings, crookedness, and perverseness is very difficult
We may not commit gross sins, but day by day we are still bothered by the negative things listed by Paul in Philippians 2
We need salvation not only from gross sins, but also from sins that may be considered somewhat refined, such as murmuring and reasoning
Now in the book of Philippians we see that we have a constant salvation both for particular situations and for ordinary daily life
In Philippians 1 we have the all-inclusive, life-giving, compound Spirit, and in Philippians 2 we have the processed God
The source of our constant salvation is the processed God who is the all-inclusive, life-giving, compound Spirit
By means of this wonderful source we are saved from our particular situation and from the common situations of daily life
In 2:5-16 Paul not only speaks of constant salvation and its source, but also shows us the divine and rich provision for this salvation
Although the Lord subsisted in the form of God and was equal to God, He did not consider this equality a treasure to be grasped and retained
Of feeling resentment toward his wife for having to lay aside his headship, he should humble himself before her
As we consider the pattern and the standard found here, we see that we need to be partners with Christ in His pattern and standard
How could I, a fallen human being, one who lacked even the proper human element and entirely lacked the divine element, follow this God-man?
If we were not children of God with the divine life and nature, we could not understand God's operation within us or cooperate with it
Figuratively speaking, because we have the divine life and nature, we are running a three-legged race with God as our partner
His operation within us is based on the fact that He has regenerated us and deposited into us His divine life with the divine nature
Now He is motivating, operating, and energizing within by His divine life and nature according to the pattern with the standard
He regenerated us, imparting His divine life with the divine nature into us to make us God-men, children of God
Whenever we cooperate with God's inward operation according to the divine life and nature, we shine with the light of Christ
Such contact, based on the divine life and nature, is very different from reading the Bible merely with the exercise of the mind
As we experience the word of life in this way, we should hold forth the word to others, presenting it, offering it, and applying it to them
We have the word of life, and we may enter into this word, enjoy its riches, and declare it to those around us
If we would know the secret of experiencing Christ as revealed in this book, we need to understand these expressions
According to verse 17, Paul was willing to be poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and priestly service of the believers' faith
It is very important for us to understand what kind of faith can become the sacrifice on which the drink offering is poured
If we take a portion from Paul's Epistles and dwell on it for a period of time, we shall sense something rising up in us with power
As we have pointed out elsewhere, faith is the appreciation of Christ and the reflection of what He is and does for us
If we would enjoy Christ making His home in our hearts, we need to read Ephesians 3:15-19 and dwell on these verses
If we do not get into Paul's words in these four books, our enjoyment of Christ through faith will not be adequate
Today my faith is not simply the issue of verses such as John 3:16 and 5:24; it is the issue of these four books written by Paul
You may realize that all things are vanity, and you may earnestly desire that in your living nothing will be vanity
You probably enjoyed something of Christ as revealed in Luke 15, but not the all-inclusive Christ revealed in Paul's Epistles
It is a fact that in Daniel 7 we do not enjoy as much of Christ as we do in Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians
Paul was constrained by two things: the desire to depart and be with Christ and the need to remain in the flesh for the sake of the saints
Eventually he concluded that he would remain and continue with the believers for their progress and enjoyment of faith
Paul's expectation was that he would minister more of Christ to the saints so that they would have more experience of Him
We shall not have the enjoyment of Christ, and the ministering one will not have the sacrifice of faith to offer to God
As used in 2:17, faith stands for the enjoyment of Christ, the experience of Christ, and the gaining of Christ
The ministering one will be happy to offer this sacrifice to God and at the same time pour out himself upon it as a drink offering
We need to 'strike the match' and experience the 'burning' that we may gain Christ, experience Christ, enjoy Christ, and possess Christ
When the believers hold forth the word of life, Paul has a basic sacrifice on which to pour out himself as a drink offering
Even at present, in the day of man, Paul could have the sacrifice of faith as a basic sacrifice upon which to be poured out
Paul could boast in the believers' holding forth of the word of life and rejoice in the sacrifice of their faith
The excellency of the knowledge of Christ does not refer to Christ's knowledge; it refers to our knowledge of Christ
From that time onward Paul turned from the excellency of the knowledge of the law to the excellency of the knowledge of Christ
Peter received the revelation concerning Christ as the Son of the living God for the building up of the church
On account of the excellency of this knowledge, Paul was willing to suffer the loss of all things and count them to be refuse
There will be no reality in these times unless we fulfill the condition of having the righteousness of God through the faith of Christ
Speaking of his past, Paul says in 3:6 that 'as to the righteousness which is in the law,' he had become blameless
The righteousness which signifies a living that is truly right with God and man must be a righteousness which is of God
The living which is right with both God and man must be God as our expression in our daily living, God Himself lived out through us
If we are to be found in Christ, we must be in such a condition that God is expressed through us and becomes our daily living
The issue of this infusion and function is the faith which brings about an organic union between us and the Triune God
By means of the organic union which joins us to the Triune God and makes us one spirit with Him, we have the righteousness of God
In the organic union produced by faith we live out God, and God lives out from within us and becomes righteousness to us
To have a proper understanding of 3:9 we should consider it according to the context of the whole book of Philippians
The very God who has been infused into us becomes our daily living, the living which Paul describes as the righteousness of God
When we have the supply of the Spirit, the word of life, and the righteousness of God through faith, we are infused with God
Spontaneously Paul lived God out as his daily living and could be found in Christ, having the righteousness of God
The four books which make up the heart of the divine revelation-Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians- are an inexhaustible mine
According to verse 12, Paul's desire was to lay hold of that for which he had been laid hold of by Christ Jesus
If we would know the power of Christ's resurrection, we must share in His sufferings and know the fellowship of His sufferings
In Colossians 1:24 Paul regarded his own sufferings as the filling up of what is lacking of Christ's sufferings for His Body
To know Him we must share His sufferings and be conformed to His death that we may experience the power of His resurrection
To gain Christ he had given up everything, including religion and culture, and counted it all as refuse, trash, dog food
Paul was seeking to gain Christ that he might obtain Him by knowing Him, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings
Eventually, Lazarus died and was again buried in the tomb, but Christ's resurrection was a resurrection that brought Him to the throne
There is also a difference between those sufferings which are for our transformation and those which are for the Body
As we undergo this kind of suffering we also can experience the power of Christs resurrection but not as much as when we suffer for the Body
All the dead will be resurrected, some to the 'resurrection of life' and others to the 'resurrection of judgment'
When we suffer for the sake of the Body in the name of Christ, we also shall experience the power of His resurrection
If you are ashamed to say that you are a Christian, especially a Christian in the church life, you will have no power
When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was dead to everything other than God, including His family and relatives
When we are willing to suffer for Christ and His Body, we also shall be dead to everything other than Him, and we shall live only to Him
We, human beings of blood and flesh, can experience it, if we share in Christ's sufferings and are conformed to His death
As the One who has passed through death never to die again Christ has manifested in His resurrection the intrinsic power of the divine life
Paul admits that he had not yet attained the out-resurrection, but he continued to pursue that he may lay hold of it
For this out-resurrection, Christ had laid hold of him, and now Paul's desire was to lay hold of the out-resurrection
He pursued toward the goal, the goal of the out-resurrection, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus
Even though Lazarus was raised from the dead and came to life again, nothing of the new creation was wrought into him
The resurrection Paul was pursuing in Philippians 3 was something absolutely apart from the old creation and in the new creation
What Paul terms the out-resurrection refers to a resurrection out of the old creation and into the new creation
The principle here is that nothing which belongs to the old creation has anything to do with the kingdom of God
The Lord's living of a crucified life is illustrated by an incident which took place when He was twelve years of age
When His mother and father found Him after spending days looking for Him, His mother said, 'Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us?
Instead of living according to this old creation life He died to it and lived according to another life according to the life of His Father
The old creation began in Genesis 1:1, a verse which says, 'In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth'
He lived the life of the new creation while in a body belonging to the old creation and in the environment of the old creation
One day, with the help of Satan and his followers, the body of the Lord Jesus was put to death actually and absolutely
As a body in the old creation, it was a body of flesh and blood, but as a body in the new creation, it became a spiritual body
It is far better to know Christ in the power, sphere, and element of His resurrection and in the fellowship of His sufferings
Only when we are occupied with the Body and by the Body are we able to be free from spending so much time thinking about ourselves
Being conformed to Christ's death is related to knowing both the power of Christ's resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings
The words being conformed indicate how we may know the power of Christ's resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings
On the day we began to live the Christian life, we, like a piece of dough, were put into the mold of Christ's death
By being conformed to the death of Christ, we experience the power of His resurrection and enter into the fellowship of His sufferings
If a brother attains to the out-resurrection in his experience, even his love for his wife will be in the new creation
God does not want a natural love or a natural submission, a love and submission which are not in the out-resurrection
As Paul was writing the Epistle to the Philippians, he did not regard himself as having attained to the out-resurrection
Now we must run this race to attain to the out-resurrection from the dead and all the things of the new creation
In verse 10 Paul speaks of knowing Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings
On the day of His resurrection angels told the women that Christ could not be found in the tomb, for He had risen from the dead
Because Christ is now in resurrection, we cannot know Him experientially unless we know the power of His resurrection
For this reason, Paul adds the prefix ex to the Greek word for resurrection to show that Christ's resurrection is extraordinary
There is only one kind of resurrection which brings us out of the old creation and into God, and this is the resurrection of Christ
In the foregoing message we pointed out that Christ lived in an old creation body and environment for thirty-three and a half years
His physical body belonged to the old creation and living in a carpenters home in Nazareth He lived in the environment of the old creation
Forgetting the things behind and stretching forward to the things before, he pursued toward the goal of the out-resurrection
For us to live should also be the out-resurrection, for the very Christ whom we should live is Himself the out-resurrection
Have you ever asked yourself how much of your daily conversation is natural and how much is in the out-resurrection?
It is easy to improve our character, behavior, ethics, or morality, but it is extremely difficult to live in resurrection
Anxiety belongs to the old creation, and it cannot enter into the realm of resurrection, into the sphere of the new creation
Paul knew from experience that it is not easy to live a life which is wholly out of the old creation and in God
The Greek word rendered 'first' is the same word used for the 'best' robe given to the returned prodigal in Luke 15
In this message we shall see that, as Christians, we should have the unique mind inwardly and the unique walk outwardly
We have pointed out that the goal is to live, walk, and have our being absolutely out of the old creation and in God
To pursue toward the goal of the out-resurrection is to pursue a life which is out of the old creation and wholly in God
When He was buried, He brought the old creation, which was symbolized by the graveclothes, with Him into the tomb
Throughout the centuries, from the first century until the present, this matter has not been proclaimed adequately
How we thank the Lord that, in His mercy, He has opened our eyes to see what is the out-resurrection from among the dead!
As long as we have our living in the old creation, we do not live Christ, even if the things we do are very good
We must seek not only to overcome sins, but also to overcome the best aspects of the old creation, including the ethics of the old creation
We need to pursue toward the goal-the goal of the out-resurrection, which is our dear and excellent Christ Himself
For a young person to pursue this goal is not merely to improve his behavior or character or to become a better student
For this reason, Paul does not say in verse 15 that God will teach us; instead, he says that God will reveal this to us
Even though the religionists searched the Scriptures, they were not willing to come to Christ that they might have life
The situation among Christians today is a repetition of that of the religionists when the Lord Jesus was on earth
Although there are hundreds of different minds among Christians today, it is not our goal to unify the believers
At this point, we need to be reminded that Paul did not write the book of Philippians at a time when he was welcomed by the multitudes
The practice of religion and ethics is altogether different from the realization of God's goal and the resolution to pursue it
To have this mind is to have a mind to pursue Christ in His resurrection that we may live Him as the out-resurrection
The Greek word rendered walk in verse 16 is not the ordinary word for walk, but the word found also, for example, in Galatians 5:25
The Greek word, stoicheo, derived from steicho, means to walk orderly, to march in military rank, to keep step
Some may wonder how it is possible for saints with different degrees of experience to walk in the same steps or in cadence
How, for example, can a brother with over fifty years' experience in the Lord walk in the same steps as one who has recently been saved?
Both for those who, spiritually speaking, are in kindergarten and for those who are in graduate school, the Bible is our only textbook
The words whereunto we have attained indicate that all the saints, regardless of their degree of maturity, are included
If we see this revelation and have this resolution, we shall have the unique walk controlled and directed by the unique mind
What is the meaning of forbearance, and why does Paul mention forbearance in 4:5 instead of some other virtue?
After telling us to let our forbearance be known to all men, Paul goes on to say, also in verse 5, 'The Lord is near'
In ourselves, we are not able to make our forbearance known to all men, to be free from anxiety, or even to make our requests known to God
In 4:1 he says, 'So then, my brothers, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, beloved'
Paul seems to be saying, 'These two sisters are my co-workers, but at least temporarily they are not in the Lord
These sisters were co-workers who had labored with Paul and contended with him in the gospel and whose names were in the book of life
Formerly Euodias and Syntyche could rejoice, but now, because they are not in the Lord, they cannot rejoice in Him
When we exercise forbearance, we can rejoice in the Lord, and when we rejoice in the Lord, our anxiety disappears
To forbear is to make no demands on others; it is to be satisfied with whatever another party does to us or for us
Suppose a brother's wife serves him a cold drink when he preferred a hot one, and, very dissatisfied, he rebukes her for what she has done
When a brother's wife serves him a cold drink instead of a hot one, will he care for the drink or for the Lord?
If he cares about the drink instead of the Lord, then in his experience only the drink will be at hand, for the Lord will be far away
Forbearance is actually the expression of a living which is in the out-resurrection, in the new creation instead of the old creation
The sister who wants to offer help needs to consider whether or not the sister she intends to help is able to receive correction
We can damage brothers and sisters in the church and also members of our family by being too hasty in dealing with them
When he says, 'Let your forbearance be known to all men,' he is saying, 'Let Christ be manifested and magnified before all men'
Otherwise, he would have been hypocritical in exhorting others to make their forbearance known when he himself did not practice forbearance
The fact that Paul says that he can do all things in Him who empowers him is an indication that forbearance is Christ
In chapter four Paul speaks of standing firm in the Lord, rejoicing in Him, and letting our forbearance be known to all men
A life that expresses Christ certainly is loving, submissive, patient, humble, and kind; however, it includes much more than this
When Paul says that we should make our forbearance known to all men, he indicates the fullness of our forbearance
A forbearance which can be made known to all is not a limited or partial forbearance; it is the fullness of forbearance
Realizing that we are not able to do this, he goes on to say, 'I can do all things in the One who empowers me'
In chapter one Paul speaks of magnifying Christ and then, toward the end of the book, of making our forbearance known
Since Paul encourages us to pursue Christ, in 4:5 he must not be telling us to make something other than Christ known to all men
Since Paul speaks so much of Christ in the first three chapters of the book, what he says in chapter four must also be related to Christ
If we do not make known our forbearance we shall have Christ only in doctrine or terminology but we shall not have Christ in our experience
To let our forbearance be made known is to make known to others the Christ whom we experience, live, and magnify
It includes love, patience, kindness, humility, compassion, considerateness, and submissiveness, a willingness to yield
A forbearing person is one who always fits in, whose behavior is always suitable, no matter what the circumstances or environment may be
Luke 24:15 says that while these disciples 'communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them'
The Lord Jesus said to them, 'What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad'?
They proceeded to tell Him about Jesus of Nazareth, One they described as a 'prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people'
They went on to say that the chief priests and the rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death and crucified Him
After walking quite a distance, 'they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further'
The sister serving with her faces at least four options: walk away, join her in serving in her poor way, correct her, or try to improve her
Eventually, she may have an opportunity to speak not according to her own intention, but according to the leading of the Spirit
Perhaps now we can understand why Paul speaks of forbearance toward the end of a profound book on the experience of Christ
When Paul exhorts us to let our forbearance be made known to all men, he is saying something of great significance
To make known our forbearance is to live a life which expresses Christ; it is to express the Christ by whom we live
If you are ignorant of mathematics, it will not be possible for you to give them a fair and reasonable judgment
If a husband and wife show forbearance toward each other and toward their children, they will have an excellent married life and family life
Because your carelessness afforded him the opportunity to do something wrong, you should not put the full blame on him
A father should ask himself whether or not he should rebuke his child in front of other children or even in front of the mother
If he is truly forbearing, he will wait for the right time to speak, a time when the conversation will be constructive
In the same principle a wife needs to be patient with her husband and wait for the proper time to express her feelings about certain matters
As an all-inclusive virtue, forbearance implies not only understanding, wisdom, and patience, but also mercy, kindness, love, and sympathy
If we would exercise forbearance in our married life and family life, we would have a pleasant married life and an excellent family life
We know from Ephesians 4 and Colossians 3 that the church is the new man, made up of believers with different nationalities and cultures
If the elders lack understanding and wisdom, they will not be able to exercise forbearance and may cause a great deal of damage
For the accomplishment of His eternal purpose, for the carrying out of His economy, God has always exercised forbearance
If a parent charges his children to do a certain task but does not supply them with what they need, that parent is not forbearing
Some students of the Bible say that in the Scriptures there are different dispensations, different ways God deals with man
If God had dealt with fallen man in the way we deal with others, there would have been no way for Him to fulfill His purpose
God Himself set up an example, a pattern, of forbearance, making known His forbearance to men throughout all generations
God certainly is forbearing and full of understanding wisdom patience consideration sympathy mercy kindness love and the supply of life
We may even say that the Bible is a book of forbearance and that, as revealed in the Scriptures, God Himself is forbearance
Those who received the half-shekel for the poll tax came to Peter and asked, 'Does not your teacher pay the half-shekel'?
No doubt, when Peter was waiting for a fish with a shekel in its mouth, he had a good opportunity to be forbearing
In dealing with this situation the Lord exercised much understanding, wisdom, consideration, mercy, and kindness
For some reason, according to the Lord's sovereignty, there was a period of time when the Philippians seemingly forgot Paul and his need
If a brother is not forbearing toward his wife and children, he should not expect his children to know what forbearance is
Of commanding others to be forbearing, he himself should establish a pattern of forbearance for his children to follow
No matter how he was treated by others, no matter whether the saints in Philippi cared for his need or not, Paul was satisfied
The more the elders in a church become mature and content, the easier it will be for them to exercise forbearance in the house of God
The more a father is mature and content, the easier it will be for him to exercise forbearance with the members of his family
In the following messages we shall see that when our living is full of forbearance, we shall be free from anxiety
In the foregoing message we emphasized the need of forbearance in our married life, family life, and church life
When the preposition epi is added to other Greek words as a prefix, it often bears the meaning of full or extensive
The Greek word rendered forbearance in 4:5 is not actually a noun; it is an adjective used as a noun with a definite article
In the previous message we pointed out that forbearance requires understanding, wisdom, patience, and many other virtues
Because Paul had learned the secret of contentment, he was able to forbear with all the churches and all the saints
Although Paul alluded to his winter experience and the saints temporary neglect of him he exercised great understanding in writing to them
Paul, however, had a full understanding of God's economy and His move; he also understood the subtlety of Satan's attack
Paul needed to exercise wisdom in writing to the Philippians, and there is the need for us also to exercise wisdom in our married life
Husbands need wisdom in speaking with their wives, and wives need wisdom in sharing matters with their husbands
Before saying more, she should consider the atmosphere and discern whether it is the proper time for her husband to hear more
She may share something at one time, something further at another time, and the remainder at still another time
In verse 6 Paul says In nothing be anxious but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God
There does not seem to be a relation between the words 'Let your forbearance be known' and 'Let your requests be made known'
If a sister prays before sharing a particular matter with her husband, she will know what to say to him and when is the proper time to speak
We need to build up the proper married life and family life, and then we shall be able to build up the church life
We may be polite to the brothers and sisters in the church, but be very impolite to our husband or wife or to our children
Do not think that simply because a certain brother is nice kind and polite with the saints in the church he is necessarily that way at home
Oh, how much we need forbearance in our married life and family life that we may build up the proper church life!
The more we realize the need of forbearance, the more we shall see how difficult it is to be a proper human being
If we all exercise forbearance, we shall have a pleasant married life, an excellent family life, and a wonderful church life
After covering these aspects of the experience of Christ, Paul, somewhat to our surprise, speaks in chapter four of forbearance and anxiety
Why at the conclusion of such a profound book on the experience of Christ does Paul mention forbearance and anxiety?
Apparently there is no connection between the matters covered in chapters one, two, and three and Paul's word about forbearance and anxiety
Most parents can testify that as far as their children are concerned, their days are filled more with anxiety than with happiness
In Genesis 3:17 the Lord said to the man, 'Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life'
God has ordained all the circumstances of human life, even though these circumstances give rise more to anxiety than to happiness
If you ask an older person about anxiety, he will tell you that he has known anxiety almost every day of his life
To be a proper human being we need to be Christians, and to be normal Christians we need to have the church life
The extent to which Christ is present in our daily life is determined by the amount of forbearance and anxiety
No doubt the one visiting him would have said, 'What a shame to see the very apostle who ministered Christ to us so sorrowful and anxious'!
In a previous message we pointed out that happiness and contentment are two elements which produce forbearance
Because Paul was full of happiness and contentment, with him there was no anxiety, but an abundance of forbearance
Because Paul had no anxiety, no worry about his circumstances or future, he could rejoice in the Lord and be forbearing
If we would have a life free of anxiety, we need to realize that all our circumstances, good or bad, have been assigned to us by God
Perhaps losing money will benefit him more than earning money, for through such a loss he may be perfected and built up
The first prerequisite to having no anxiety is to have the full assurance that all the sufferings we experience are God's assignment
Those who are in business should seek to make money, and those who are employees should try to get a promotion
In chapter four, the concluding portion of this book, Paul seems to descend to a lower level in emphasizing forbearance and anxiety
In recent years the light on the issue of forbearance versus anxiety has gradually become brighter and brighter
Those who are unusually dull or insensitive may not have much anxiety, but those who are sensitive usually have many anxieties
Just as anxiety is the totality of common human life, so forbearance is the totality of the proper Christian life
If we are a Christian according to the divine standard, we shall have a life full of forbearance and without anxiety
He has a purpose for us individually, a purpose for us in relation to our family, and a purpose for us in the church life
Without forbearance we shall not allow God to fulfill His purpose with us, with our family, or with the church
We have seen that forbearance means to be utterly reasonable, considerate, and understanding in dealing with others
If we do not exercise forbearance in our family life, we shall not be able to build up our family for the fulfillment of God's purpose
To say that anxiety comes from God's assignment is quite different from saying that anxiety is God's assignment
Job 1:6 says, 'Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them'
God used Satan to accomplish this work, allowing Satan, within certain prescribed limits, to do certain things to Job
According to the first chapter of the book of Job, soon after Satan received permission to afflict Job, he sent calamities
Immediately the report came of another calamity: fire had fallen from heaven and had consumed Job's sheep and other of his servants
For the momentary lightness of the affliction worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory'
Forbearance comes from God for the fulfillment of His purpose, but anxiety comes from Satan for the frustration of God's purpose
From experience, not from doctrine, we have come to understand that when we exercise forbearance in full, all anxiety disappears
If by God's mercy and grace we forbear with everyone, everything, and every matter, we shall not be anxious in anything
In 1:20 Paul says that Christ will be magnified in him, but in 4:5 he tells us to let our forbearance be known
When we put these verses together, we see that to let our Christ be magnified is to let our forbearance be known
The words live Christ may merely be a doctrinal term, a way of speaking, not our actual living in a practical way
Now in this message we shall consider some further matters related to a life full of forbearance but without anxiety
Since everything depends on His will and since we are one with Him in a practical way, there is no reason for us to be anxious
If we would make our forbearance known to all men and not be anxious in anything, we need to practice being one with the Lord
If we are truly one with the Lord in our experience and something negative happens to us, we need not be anxious or troubled
If we are not one with the Lord in a practical way, virtually every person, every matter, and every thing will bother us
When we are one with the Lord we can be satisfied with our circumstances and we can be forbearing with everyone every thing and every matter
If we would not have any anxiety we must recognize that all afflictions sufferings calamities disasters and catastrophes are assigned by God
Prayer is general and includes the essence of worship and fellowship; petition is special and is related to particular needs
It is significant that in 4:6 Paul does not speak of prayer, petition, and thanksgiving, but of prayer and petition with thanksgiving
The Lord denied Paul's request, and said to him, 'My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness'
If we do not accept the Lord's will but insist on making petitions according to our own will, we shall not be able to escape anxiety
Although he contracted this disease before he was thirty years of age, he lived with that illness for nearly forty years
Although he knew that he could die from that disease at any time, he accepted the Lord's will and was not anxious
If the thorn had been taken away from Paul, Paul probably would not have trusted in the Lord as much as he did with the thorn
Whether or not we can exercise forbearance in difficult situations depends on the kind of realization and practice we have
For the momentary lightness of the affliction worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory'
We need to realize that just as anxiety is the totality of human life, so forbearance is the totality of the Christian life
