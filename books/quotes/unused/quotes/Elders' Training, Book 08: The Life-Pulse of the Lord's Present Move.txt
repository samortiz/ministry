You must understand what is in Matthew especially in chapters five six and seven as well as chapters thirteen twentyfour and twentyfive
You surely must know what are the real contents of the Epistles of Paul and of John as well as the book of Revelation
Some Christian groups meet according to the natural, social way which is not according to the design in the Bible
The predicate here is not in the active voice, but in the passive voice, saying that two or three are gathered
According to the best use of the English idiom, no one would say 'into the name'; there is no such idiomatic expression
The translators took care of the language idiom, but they damaged and sacrificed the real meaning of the Greek text
We need a powerful One to rescue us, to bring us out from all these occupations, and to gather us into His name
Whenever we meet, we should be gathered out of many different occupations and gathered into the very living Person of the Lord Himself
When we are meeting, we are meeting in Him because we have been gathered out of so many occupations and gathered into this living Person
We need to be rescued by the Lord out of so many occupying things and gathered into His name, that is, into Himself as a living Person
All the denominations hold their meetings with one or two speakers plus several assistants helping in music prayer and in reading the Bible
In 1 Corinthians 1426 one has a teaching another has a revelation another has a psalm another has a tongue and another has an interpretation
Ephesians 5:19 says, 'Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord'
The teachers must be speaking, the prophets must be speaking, and all the saints attending the meeting must function by speaking
On the day of Pentecost the first message that came out of Peter's mouth was quite high, full of mysterious points
Some may point out that this message was given to the Jews, who had much knowledge of the Bible in the Old Testament
When Paul was speaking on Mars' Hill, facing the Greek philosophers, he surely had to give a higher, deeper, philosophical preaching
We have to be restricted within the boundary of God's New Testament economy, and be uplifted to the standard of His New Testament economy
An architect would never allow a high tower to be erected in the middle of a building, unrelated to the rest of it
Eventually, the fire department awarded us an extra ten percent in seating capacity because the stairways and doors were so good
To see the basic principles of meeting in the Word is not easy, but to use these principles in the meetings will never cause any division
It is altogether an enjoyment through partaking of the processed Christ through His death and in His resurrection
Whenever we remember the Lord, we have to be in His resurrection through His death that we may enjoy Him as a feast
Have you ever heard that the believers constituting the church worship God with Christ in them as their worshipping Person?
The real worship the Father wants today is His Son worshipping Him from within all the believers as the church
The only verse that you can find telling us so particularly how to worship the Father in the church is Hebrews 2:12
To read the Epistle to the Colossians in the meeting is simply to read the Bible, to read the Word of the Lord
In today's Christianity the understanding of Christian meetings is almost entirely based upon the natural concept
The temple was the house of God, but now the Lord called it 'your house' because they had made it a den of robbers and God had forsaken it
Suddenly on the day of Pentecost under the power and leading of the Holy Spirit, they began to meet from house to house
When they were saved, they were all gathered by the Holy Spirit, so they began to meet in their homes, probably on the same day
It could not have been a baptism done in a concentrated way with a large gathering and 'one pastor and an assistant' to do the baptizing
These new ones did not have any training, they did not receive any instruction, and they gathered from house to house
It is superstitious to think that the Holy Spirit assigned a leader to each of the homes, pointing out certain ones to be the leaders
They did speak in tongues before a big congregation, but there is no hint in the Word that they also spoke in tongues in the home meetings
If the Bible translators could have translated all the Bibles miraculously, there would have been no need of any labor
When the Lord's move went to a certain country, was there a miracle performed to produce a new translation of the Bible instantaneously?
Consider the tremendous amount of labor of the translators of the Bible to collect and train people to learn the foreign languages
To us Peter's message in Acts 2 may be quite familiar, but it was surely a shock to those three thousand new converts
Peter quoted Psalm 16 which says, 'You will not leave my soul in Hades, nor will You permit Your Holy One to see corruption'
He also talked about the Lord's ascension when he said that 'God has made Him both Lord and Christ- this Jesus whom you crucified'
In the heavens He received the consummated Spirit and poured Himself out as the Spirit upon the hundred and twenty
Joel 2 needs two fulfillments-one at the beginning of the New Testament age and another at the end of the New Testament age
Zechariah 12:10 says that God will pour out upon the house of David 'the spirit of grace and of supplications'
They probably had no heart to do anything except come together to have a gathering in every house to talk about this message
The New Testament reveals to us that the way the early believers took for their meetings was the home gathering way
The church in Colosse, the church in Rome, the church in Ephesus, and the church in Laodicea all were meeting in some homes
After this, Acts tells us that in Jerusalem 'believers were all the more being added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and of women'
Surely the church in Jerusalem could not build a hall, and eventually they were not allowed to meet in the temple
It is always hard for human beings to have a change, and it is easy for them to do things according to their habit
Many children of Chinese parents in the United States have been transferred out of the old Chinese way of speaking into the new English way
The way of home meetings annuls clergy, swallows up and gives no opening to any ambition, and kills the hierarchy to the uttermost
They have been faithful to the church life the churchs standing and they have even sacrificed many things but suddenly a new way comes in
To come together with three hundred and pray together is to them full of impact, and the 'amens' and 'hallelujahs' are like thunder
No one else was there for the home meeting except us and the older brother's granddaughter who was arranging the chairs
You could tell the new ones and the other saints something about the hymns and using the piano ask them to sing some hymns in a learning way
The most important thing, however, is to train everyone, old and young, brothers and sisters, new ones or old ones, to learn how to speak
You have to select good portions from a number of messages and notes to compile a message of about three or four pages
For every home meeting we need to use speaking material, but we always have to avoid anything official, formal, or ritualistic
Do not follow the old way where we all take turns reading, and then someone stands up to give a concluding word
In the home gathering one person could say, 'Brothers, this note shows us that the word destroys means ruins, corrupts, defiles, mars
We have to realize that to build the church of God with these natural things is to destroy, to ruin, the temple'
You may explain something as we illustrated above, but you do not need to explain every clause or every sentence
You have to believe that this kind of meeting will edify, nourish, enlighten, encourage, comfort, and even reprove people
You could have a meeting for two hours, so there is plenty of time to do many things in the meeting to cover so many needs
To them all the local churches should be different and the teaching and leadership of the Lord's ministry do not fit into their situation
We should consider the churches who want to be different as local churches, but we cannot bring them in to fight the battle for the recovery
Suppose the six hundred churches throughout the globe were all different from one another and that each church went its own way
When Gideon chose three hundred men to fight the battle for the Lord, they all became the same and they fought the battle for all of Israel
They have such a good point, but they do not realize that what they are doing is the exercise of their own spirit
In order to encourage all of us to exercise our spirit, to some extent we had better adopt the Pentecostal way
To speak an intelligible language, you have to exercise your mind, but to speak in tongues, you do not need to exercise your mind
Many of them realized that what they were doing was false, but the effect is that they stir up the main part of their being
They do not have the term 'the spirit' nor do they talk about the exercise of the spirit, but they have some enjoyment
We have the term 'the spirit' and we talk about the exercise of the spirit, but mostly we do not have the enjoyment
The pastor had to ring a bell a number of times in order to get them to stop to give Brother Nee a chance to speak
Brother Nee stepped up to the platform and he spoke concerning the prodigal son coming back to the Father in Luke 15
When most Christians hear the word prophesy they always think of it in the sense of predicting or foretelling the future
To prophesy is to speak for God, to speak forth God, from your spirit in which, through which, and with which the Holy Spirit speaks in you
Sometimes even the one who gives the message speaks in the way that a typical gentleman converses, with no exercise of the spirit
In the church meetings what we can see is mostly dead bodies, which is a little bit better than scattered bones
Some proper messages need to be given to the saints to edify them, to enliven them, and to tell them that they need to 'shake the chairs'
Especially a half hour before meeting time we should exercise our spirit to get ourselves prepared for the meeting
Tell the saints for what purpose we have to fastfor the deadness the coldness the lukewarmness the indifference and the spiritless situation
We do not promote chair shaking or tongue-speaking, but we like to see what is taught and revealed in 1 Corinthians 14
Since to prophesy, to speak forth the Lord, ministers Christ to people, it builds up people and gives them encouragement and consolation
According to 1 Corinthians 11:5 women can prophesy, and the book of Acts gives us illustrations of sisters being prophets
You need to speak on these matters continuously as a kind of training for at least seven days; it is better to take two weeks
After their talk about the nephew, they might begin to talk about the political situation abroad and in the United States
Eventually, one of the brothers realizes that it is five minutes to ten, and he tells the other brother, 'We have to go
We need to tell the saints that this is the natural act to keep the oldness of the pitiful situation of Christianity
Early in the morning on the Lord's Day you should rise up and say, 'Lord, thank You for a new day, even a day of the Lord
If every member of the local church would be like this, what kind of wonderful meeting in the heavens we would have!
At the beginning of 1 Corinthians Paul stressed that Christ is God's center, that Christ should be our portion, our enjoyment
The elders should not think that they are so experienced that they do not need the young ones to shepherd them
Also, our door had a crack in it and we did not know what to do with it; nor did we know where to get a carpenter
When you have small gatherings of ten or twelve, all coming together at least once a week, they shepherd one another
If we would do all these things in the home gatherings, all the attendants would feel very much benefited in different ways
We should not have the attitude that a certain meeting is not for the unbelievers, so we do not preach the gospel in this meeting
We should not have the attitude that in a certain meeting we would not say anything for the outsiders and that this meeting is for ourselves
Do not expect the rest of the saints to necessarily be on fire unless the elders, the leading ones, and the leading sisters are on fire
Simply to set up big gatherings for the Christians to come together to listen to messages would not be sufficient to catch people
Even though we had our halls, we still continued to have the small groups in the first six years of the church life there
They lost their taste for the home gatherings because the big gatherings fit in with their natural concept and slothfulness
They had not finished their conversation, and even after coming to the meeting, they still continued their talk in their thoughts
Not only their spirit, but even their heart, their soul, and their mind, were altogether not there for the meeting
Our slogan should be 'Home meetings are first-we give our first love, first attention, and best time to the home meetings'
They must be capable in the riches of Christ, capable in the rich word of the Bible, and capable to present Christ in such a living way
You may prepare a Sunday morning meeting with no consideration for the unbelievers and no intent to have the preaching of the gospel
History proves this, today's situation testifies to this, and our experience over the last ten to sixteen years also confirms this
In the matter of the riches in the Word and the riches of Christ, the others who practice the home meetings cannot compare with us
Within eleven years another group in the eastern United States gained a hundred homes with fifteen meeting in each home
Within only eleven years in a little town of only thirty thousand people, one Christian group grew to fifteen hundred
We must not merely have a routine church in a routine way where everything is set up with a routine schedule year round every year the same
Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation
You elders should bear the burden and the blame because you did not do your duty to train the flock under your care
We must labor on Christ, our good land, that we may reap some produce of His riches to bring to the church meeting to offer
The psalm should be the praise of God for giving Christ as wisdom and power to us for our daily life and church life
The teaching from a teacher and the revelation from a prophet should teach and minister Christ with the church as His Body to people
They had some produce of the good land on hand to bring to the feast and offer to God to enjoy with God and with each other before God
In a sense my laboring nearly every day is my suffering, but to my sensation this is not a suffering to me; it is a joy
The church also needs to feed the saints at the Lord's table; after they come to the table, they still need spiritual food to nourish them
Everyone would like to be the President of the United States, but if you would be, you may suffer high blood pressure after three weeks
You may think it is so easy to be an elder; you think you only need my consent to be an elder, without bearing any responsibility
Without this we are not qualified; we have no standing and even no right to copy what is happening in the Far East
Come together to pray and find a way to get one or more persons charged to prepare messages, a living word for each kind of meeting
In every local church there must be at least one or two brothers to cook these points with some points from other messages as well
Some of the saints will try to take the opportunity for a long utterance, to pour out all that is on their heart
You have to restrict this, telling them that this message is about three pages, and should only take forty-five minutes
Within these forty-five minutes let all the attendants, perhaps ten or twelve, speak this one message on the three pages
In 2 Timothy 2:15 Paul said, 'Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth'
There is such a need to have the prevailing home meetings, but the key, the crucial point, is the preparation of a living message
Thank the Lord, because we have so many rich groceries it is easy to cook a meal and distribute this meal to every home
Although in principle all the local churches should be the same, in this aspect all the churches could not be the same
We should hate to see this going on, all the time the same, with no change, while no one is caring for the situation
When one stands up speaking in a poor way, the elders would allow this poor situation to go on for fifteen minutes or more
If you could not handle the speaking for one group so well, how will you be able to handle the speaking for many groups?
Also, the ones who are going to take care of the home meetings should be trained and should learn how to be flexible
We expect that all the home meetings would do their best to bring their neighbors, relatives, friends, colleagues, and schoolmates
The home meetings should be very flexible since we should always expect to have some new ones there and some unbelievers
For the Lord's table meeting it would be good to select some good messages on life and on the life supply according to your study and memory
After the remembrance rendered to the Lord, a half an hour can be spared in the meeting to speak that short, nourishing message
You should also select some spiritual messages from our publications on another line-the spiritual principles of the Lord's service
At the end of each prayer meeting take half an hour to speak a short article on the spiritual principles of the Lord's service
The saints will receive enlightenment through the speaking of some messages on the spiritual principles of the Lord's service every week
For us it takes time, especially in the matter of building up the church, which is altogether a matter in life
The Lord will lead you to have a fresh way to apply all these principles, and what you do will be quite living
We have fellowshipped that for the prayer meeting, the home meeting, and the Lord's table, we need to cook a living message
Everyone who wants to use the materials from Living Stream Ministry in such a way should write to the ministry office for permission
Your application should make it clear that you want to use the material for the purpose of the church meetings
The office will then give you a written answer with directions on how to give the proper credit for the material
It is much more prevailing if you digest portions of the written ministry and then put these excerpts together to make a message
Basically speaking in this century, regardless of what country a person lives in, he must have a basic education
Throughout the past years what we have been practicing was like the giving of lectures by experts and specialists
To have a school to educate the young people, we need classes, we need grades, we need lessons, and we need a textbook
The saints have heard many messages concerning Christ's death, but who can speak something concerning the seven aspects of Christ's death?
It is even harder for many of the saints to speak the deeper truths concerning God's economy, God's dispensation, and God's dispensing
The good point of this educational system is that it gives people the popular, the common, and the normal basic knowledge
The one hundred ninety-two lessons of this series are meant to be covered in four years-forty-eight lessons per year
My burden is not to give people lessons concerning the history, the geography, or the literature of the Old Testament
The lessons on Adam, Abel, Enosh, and Enoch unveil the spiritual significance seen in these Old Testament saints
Through two lessons we are given a key view of the Old Testament in the entire book of Genesis from Adam to Noah and from Abraham to Joseph
We must use the Lord's Day or what is popularly called Sunday since this day is generally a holiday throughout the earth
Every Lord's Day morning we may have a general meeting to take care of the 'Sunday goers' and general attendants
At the same time and on the same day, if possible in the same building, you must set up classes to teach the truth
The best way is to ask the saints to register for the level they would like to be in based upon their discernment
You may have thirty or more in one class, and the teaching of the lesson should only occupy fifty to sixty minutes
We should teach the students in the class by first asking them to open up their copy of the truth lessons and read
Only go as far as the text of the truth lessons with the accompanying questions to impress the saints with the main points
If the first lesson only requires the students to add the first four numbers, the teacher should just impress them with that much
The first lesson is to impress the students with the proper, common, necessary knowledge concerning the Bible's coming into existence
You can assuredly receive two things from the ministry- the ministry of life and the way to open up the holy Word
It will always help people into the right way of God's New Testament economy according to His entire revelation
In the first twenty years or more we have gone through at least two or three stages, so our practice has changed at least two or three times
In Brother Nees writings especially The Normal Christian Church Lifethere are indications that the practice in the Lords recovery did change
Until then most of the co-workers stayed in one place, not going out to spread the gospel to establish the churches
In those messages he charged us all not to stay permanently in one place, but to go out from one city to another
In those six years he did not minister as usual; he only did a small amount in the interior of China during the war time
It was marvelous to us that we could cross the entire Pacific and arrive at San Francisco within twenty-four hours
In previous centuries travel by wagon from the east coast to the west coast may have taken about one hundred days
In the Far East in at least three or more places some Christian groups increased from one thousand to a hundred thousand
In 1958, the same year the church in Taipei began to drop the small group meetings, a church in Seoul, Korea started
Another little group in Singapore was started by a student who returned from the United States within the last ten years
Today in Taiwan all those who do business, establish factories, and produce and export articles do not follow their fathers' way
Not only in this country but even the more in the Far East, people take my ministry and use it for their own way
In Taiwan the others use these materials, but many in the church life just put them on the shelf and are indifferent towards these treasures
In every corporation or big bank, the employees in the office may do things according to routines, but the managers have to 'fast'
They all went to China to exercise their imperialism, but none of the major powers could carry out their imperialism in Japan
There was not much spreading or evangelizing on that island, even though the church there owns properties and has many halls
For the thirty-seven and a half acres of land in Lin-Ko we had to pay eight hundred and fifty thousand American dollars
If you do not have a change in the way of practice in the Lords recovery yet you would imitate the points this will burst your church life
The new way is first to build the church in, through, and based upon the home meetings, having the church life in the home meetings
According to our experience and observation the proper adequate one hundred percent church life could only be possible in the home meetings
It is impossible for the elders to care for ten thousand people, and it is not fair to charge them with such a burden
The main thing needed for the new way is for the fulltimers to be trained in two thingspreaching the gospel and helping the small gatherings
There are many ways and many objects for our preaching including our schools and home the people on the street our neighbors and many more
The only way to annul all the position, leadership, and ambition is to have a strong practice of the home gatherings
We must use the Lord's Day morning to train our people with the truth, while the small meetings in our homes are for home nurturing
You should have a period of time for training, at least two weeks, to train the saints in your locality with all these points
It is not sufficient to merely set up some homes and make a schedule and an announcement concerning the home gatherings
For the general meeting you must cook a message and charge one among you who is able to present this message in an adequate way
In Matthew 24 and 25 there is the parable of the ten virgins, denoting life, and the parable of the talents, denoting service
You should learn, you should labor, and you should practice not only to speak but to prepare some good messages
We need to have a purifying change, a purification of our thought and idea which has been with us for so many years
Chapter nine of The Normal Christian Church Life has a long section concerning the home meetings, the small group meetings
He even suggested annulling the Lord's Day morning meeting, and asked all the saints to preach the gospel on the Lord's Day
In his writings concerning the parable of the talents he said that the most dangerous one is the one-talented member
The new way we are now considering to take is altogether constituted with the same basic points which he stressed
He illustrated in these many ways to vindicate himself, proving that he did have the right to live of the gospel
If you are thinking to take the full-time way, you must realize that it is only possible for you to do it in Christ who empowers you
Do not think, 'Well, it might be all right because in my locality the church has over one hundred fifty people
When all those thousands of scattered saints from Jerusalem went to Samaria, how could the Samaritans support them?
Many times we have gotten into temptation because of our mistakes, but the Lord Jesus was brought into that temptation by the Spirit
When you go full-time, sometimes you also will be led by the Spirit into a hunger, with nothing to eat and nothing to live on
They traveled around, going through the villages with no certain place to stay and no assurance of something to eat
The Lord said that 'the foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have roosts, but the Son of Man has nowhere that He may lay His head'
Thousands of people got helped, healed, and saved by the Lord, but eventually only a hundred and twenty remained with Him
A teacher in high school could only make about twelve to fifteen dollars a month, which was only good for two or three persons to live on
There is no word even as a hint in the New Testament telling us that the church paid somebody to be their preacher or to be their elder
If you still have a job, you will not be able to labor so well in your leisure time, after office hours, or on weekends
Sometimes when such a one who makes a lot of money is happy with God, with the church, and with the elders, he would decide to write a check
When his wife finds out that he is giving the church five thousand dollars, she says, 'The church doesn't need that much
When the husband tells her that they have a lot in savings bonds, she will not agree with his selling the savings bonds
The husband replies, 'If that is the case, we'd better write a check for five hundred and cancel the other one'
Through church history and even among us we have seen some, although not too many, real full-timers who made money for God
When you encourage all the saints to go full-time, these ones will take the lead to say, 'I will be a full-timer; wonderful!
Your income may be five times what you need yet you would only spend that onefifth for your living and give the other fourfifths to the Lord
In all these cases is the truth of all the saved ones needing to be absolute for God, to be full-timers, regardless of what they do
No mortal tongue can e'er describe The freedom of the soul, When passed beyond all earthly bribe To God's complete control
All things are his, yes, life, and death, Things present or to come; In Christ he draws in peace each breath, In Christ he finds his home
When such as we the King can choose, To share with Him His throne, 'Tis passing strange that we refuse To be our Lord's alone
The holy bargain strike- The fragment for the whole- All men and all events alike Must serve the ransomed soul
All things are yours when you are His, And He and you are one; A boundless life in Him there is, Whence doubt and fear are gone
When we serve Him, everyone and everything serve us-'All men and all events alike must serve the ransomed soul'
The verses in the Scripture reading can be considered as a cluster of the divine Word, a cluster of grapes, so precious and so sweet
It does not mean that you give up your business and become one who preaches the gospel or who labors in the word all the time
A full-timer is one who lives to the Lord; every believer, as one bought by the Lord with a price, should be a person living to the Lord
The husband may have the confidence in the wife to be one with her and to be everything to her, but the wife may still be doubting
Most of us in the Lord's recovery do love the Lord, and we would say that whatever we are and whatever we have are all for the Lord
Regardless of how much you say that you are for the Lord, the Lord has no right to touch anything of yours because it is yours
Could you differentiate between these two expressions-'I have something for you' or 'I bring something to you'?
When you see a vision through your subtlety, you may realize that in the past you have always been living for the Lord and not to the Lord
When you feel happy or when you feel it is convenient, you give something for the Lord and do something for the Lord
Mary altogether lost her possession to John at their wedding, and John lost his possession, his ownership, altogether to Mary
When the ancient Romans referred to the believers as Christians, they meant that these people belonged to Christ
The practical meaning of the title Christian is not that we are men for Christ but that we are men belonging to Christ
You know whether you have to remain in a job or leave a job or whether you need to get married or remain single
It does not mean that if you remain single, you are full-time and that if you get married, you are not full-time
If the Lord really wanted you to drop your job and you would not do it, you could still say that you were for the Lord
Just check within as to whether you can say you are leaving your job to the Lord or remaining in your job to the Lord
Every human being on the earth needs to hear the truth, but our spreading of the precious truths we have received has been strongly limited
The points in our publications are full of life and light, but these brothers would not present them as they are
The Lord has commissioned us with His recovery, and He has surely opened up the New Testament to reveal many dear and precious truths to us
What the Lord needs is for thousands of His dear saints who love Him, who live to Him, and who know nothing but His recovery to take one way
If we spread these truths, we will become the faithful servants to serve food to the Lord's people at the appointed time
It is not sufficient to use the Seventh-Day Adventists as an example, reminding the saints how they practice ten percent tithing
We would not be ruined; therefore, we have to pass far, far beyond all earthly bribes to God's complete purpose
Of course, we do not rob them, but we make a gain of the world's riches by our labor, laboring day and night to be very successful
If the people of the world can establish a factory which earns ten million dollars, we had better go today to earn fifty million dollars
Go back to tell the saints to make a gain of the world in the righteous way, to make more money-the more the better
Because you are taking care of God's need, God would give you a great blessing in filling every need of yours according to His riches
They will realize that they must not waste one cent, but save every penny for the giving to further the kingdom in God's economy
Paul did not seek a gift from them , but what they gave became a sweet savor for Paul to put on the altar for them
The church called a large gathering in a basketball stadium, which was filled with about twelve thousand people
In any church out of twenty there must be one who drops his business or profession to take the full-time way to preach and to teach
It is better to separate the amount for each month into four equal portions and put one portion every Lord's Day into the offering box
Train everyone among us to practice the putting aside of an extra five percent, putting it aside uniquely for the fellowship unto the gospel
We simply need a regular, weekly practice of giving in this way, designated for the fellowship unto the gospel
We must also encourage some to make money and separate five percent monthly, purposely for the account of the fellowship unto the gospel
Let every church examine, discern, and make a decision as to whether one is right and proper to drop his job and go full-time
Some are like those spoken of in 2 Thessalonians 3:6-15, idle, working at nothing, but busybodies, eating other's food
We like to see that the young ones in school are good students, all the time making high scores and having characters so straight and right
They would consider that in the United States they have ten thousand supporters, and that they do not need to labor or worry about anything
All the job-dropping full-timers will be discerned, judged, decided upon and sifted by their own respective churches
Do not say that because a certain full-timer is not working for the church in your locality, you would not care for his support
Whether or not he is the one determined discerned examined judged sifted and eventually recommended by you you must take care of his support
All the saints from Taiwan can go to Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and even to India, Ceylon, Pakistan, and the Arabian countries
If fifty would go to the Philippines under my instruction, they could conquer the entire country for Christ and the church
They seem to make the preaching of the gospel something different from the proper preaching instructed, revealed, and ordained by the Lord
At the end of those forty days He came and spoke to them saying, 'All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth'
To disciple the nations means to make them disciples, to make them persons who belong to God in Christ and who are disciplined all the time
Vincent in his Word Studies of the New Testament gives a marvelous and excellent interpretation when he comes to Matthew 28:19
To baptize the disciples into the name of the Triune God means to baptize them into the Person of the very Triune God
We should charge the full-timers to go out to preach the gospel by 'discipling the nations, baptizing them into
In our gospel preaching we need to tell them who the Triune God is, who the Father is, who the Son is, and who the Spirit is
Translators generally agree that the best manuscripts do not have Mark 16:9-20, but they also agree to leave this portion here
Verses 16-18 say, 'He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned
Luke 24:46 says, 'And He said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and rise up from the dead on the third day'
Verse 47 continues the Lord's word to the disciples, 'And that repentance for forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in His name
We have to endeavor to stir up all the churches to be this kind of church and all the saints to be this kind of person
Preaching the gospel and teaching the truth includes the one accord much prayer the power of the Spirit and all the riches of the holy Word
We realize that if the Lord is to go on to make His recovery prevailing, there is no other way but this present move
If a church meeting properly would not take this present new way, then we still respect them as a proper church
When they say that they are no longer a church in the recovery, then that is their cutting off the fellowship, not us
The present tongue-speakers cannot deny that there are false prophesies, as well as a lot of other false things
