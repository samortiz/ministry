<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A BRIEF REPORT ON THE WORK<br>IN FOOCHOW</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>MISCELLANEOUS NOTES (8)</H1><P>Date:April 16, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Chan Keh-san</P><P>At present, the services in the church in Foochow are divided into two areas, the spiritual part and the human part.</P><P>With the spiritual part, at present we have two categories of services: the preaching of the gospel and the perfecting of the believers. On the perfecting side, there are the care for the elderly ones, the care for the young ones, and the visitation services. Visitation is further subdivided into visitation of the sick, visitation of the poor, visitation of the backsliding ones, and visitation of the newly saved ones.</P><P>With the human part, we also have a few items of services. They are the cleaning group, the ushering group, the office group, the purchasing group, the accounting group, and the maintenance group.</P><P>Other than the different items of services, the church is divided up into different districts for its meetings. Every district has a name roster, and the names of all the brothers and sisters are on the roster. Every district has some responsible brothers who share the responsibility of taking care of the brothers and sisters. The gospel meetings and the prayer meetings are conducted in the districts.</P><P>For the general church meetings, there is the edification meeting on the Lord's Day morning, the gospel meeting on the Lord's Day afternoon, and the Lord's table meeting on the Lord's Day evening. During the week there is the midweek service meeting for perfecting the services. On Saturday there is the fellowship meeting.</P>
