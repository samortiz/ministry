   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible ultimately shows us one thing: God passed through creation, incarnation, more than thirty-three years of human living on earth, and death on the cross; then He came out of death and was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this wonderful resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit as the consummate expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This Spirit is on the throne today and is also moving on the earth, waiting for people to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Wherever one is, as long as he is willing to repent and believe into the Lord Jesus by calling on His name, the Spirit will immediately enter such a one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This wonderful Spirit thus becomes one spirit with the spirit of this believing one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the mystery of mysteries in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is also the greatest, highest, deepest, and richest mystery in the universe.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He has divinity with humanity; in Him are the effectiveness of His marvelous death, the power of His resurrection, and the transcendence of His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, He is the Ruler on the throne with all authority; both the kingdom and glory belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All positive things are concentrated on Him and in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is truly all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As long as you receive Him and let Him come into you, the riches of His all-inclusiveness also will come into you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is within you today as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit, the rich Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit, the Spirit who passed through death and was raised from the dead, the Spirit with the effectiveness of death and the power of resurrection, is now in you.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He and we, and we and He are one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this one Spirit there are divinity, humanity, power, life, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the fullness is in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>LIVING AND WALKING ONLY ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What then shall we do?</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is all that we need.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the crystallization of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is what the sixty-six books of the Bible are all about.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We know that when people cook food in a kitchen, the food goes through many processes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They have to kill some items and cut them into pieces; they have to put some items in a pot to be boiled and other items in the fire to be roasted; they have to add this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you go to the kitchen to take a look while they are busy there, you will find a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You will see grease, blood, water, and fire.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, after all these processes are completed, there will be many delicious dishes set before you for you to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Likewise, in His economy the Triune God had to pass through various processes that He might become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He passed through the processes of creating all things, becoming flesh, living on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, entering into death, passing through death to subdue and conquer death, coming out of death, and entering into resurrection.</S>

   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Brothers and sisters, this Spirit is the tree of life in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What is the tree of life?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is the Triune God who went through creation, incarnation, human living on the earth, death, and resurrection to become the Spirit presented to you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You should receive Him, eat Him, and enjoy Him, and you should live and walk according to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is different from religion, morality, and culture, which all require that you do something.</S>
