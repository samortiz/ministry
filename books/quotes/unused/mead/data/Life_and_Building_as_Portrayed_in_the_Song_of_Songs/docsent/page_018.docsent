   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NATURAL, WORLDLY STRENGTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to look at all eight figures in more detail.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A horse in the Bible always signifies strength and speed Psa 33:17; 147:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These are horses used for the Egyptian king.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots" 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These horses signify natural strength in a worldly way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord's seeker is using her strength to seek the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 7 she prayed, "Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She prayed for the Lord's feeding and for the Lord's rest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And the Lord answered her in verse 8: "If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>She followed in such a strong way that the Lord praised her saying that she was like a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is good, but good in a natural, worldly way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You are seeking the Lord, but you drag the world behind you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In your seeking of the Lord, others are impressed not with the Lord, but with something of Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You are not carrying Solomon, but Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many of the young people in the churches are really seeking the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet they pull "the chariots of Pharaoh" with them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Something from Egypt, something from the world, is being pulled behind them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not something evil, but something of Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes it is quite stately and royal, yet it comes from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The young people are attracted by the Lord, and they are loving Him, but they are still "the horses in Pharaoh's chariot," pulling something of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are not like Solomon's palanquin, carrying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Are we really seeking the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then whom are we carrying?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Are we carrying Pharaoh or are we carrying Solomon?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are bearing Pharaoh, we are a horse used to pull his chariot.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if we are bearing Solomon, we are a palanquin, a vessel for him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Solomon is contained in this vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For the horse to carry Pharaoh, there is no need of a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if we would carry Solomon, we must be a vessel, a container, as his palanquin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>GROWTH BY APPRECIATION</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After the Lord's first appraisal of the seeking one, she enjoyed the Lord more and more, and she appreciated the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Between 1:9 and 1:15, there are several verses showing how the Lord appreciated her and how she appreciated the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She said, "A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>My beloved is unto me as a cluster of henna flowers in the vineyards of Engedi" 1:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By these appreciations of the Lord there was the growth in life and the transformation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Real appreciation of the Lord always brings the growth in life and the transformation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>SPIRITUAL INSIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The next figure used by the Lord to describe her is the doves' eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes" 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She was worldly and natural, but now she begins to have spiritual insight and spiritual concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The dove signifies the Spirit Matt 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The doves' eyes signify the insight, the understanding, and the realization of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If I were to speak with some of the young people about their hair, they would be offended, no matter how much they love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is because they still hold a natural concept about their hair.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if they were to appreciate the Lord more and more, this appreciation would give them a spiritual concept and the insight of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Their horse's eyes would be transformed into doves' eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then they would look at their hair, their sideburns, their mustaches, their eye glasses, and their tee shirts in a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I know that today's young people are fond of all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They have their natural concepts, but this is like having the wild horse's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But the Lord Jesus is so real.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He can convert our sight.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He can change our horse's eyes into doves' eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The more we appreciate Him, the more our eyesight will be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The doves' eyes are the spiritual insights that come from continually gazing on the Lord and putting our trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We no longer trust in our natural horse strength, but now we trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the seeking one's eyes have become the eyes of the dove, she has lost her confidence in her natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>She has turned away from her natural strength to the Lord and is continually looking unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By her appreciation of Him, she receives the heavenly concept and spiritual insight.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now she has doves' eyes to see things in a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>She has not yet become a full dove, but she has the eyes of a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At least her concept, her insight, and her looking unto the Lord are like the eyes of the dove.</S>
