This year we are going to emphasize something corporate-the church. God&#8217;s full salvation is to redeem, regenerate, and transform His chosen people for the church. The Triune God desires to dispense Himself into His chosen people for the church. Christ&#8217;s person and work is to build the church. The Spirit&#8217;s regeneration and transformation work is to produce the church. Our knowing and experiencing the divine and eternal life of God is for us to be built up in the church. What God is, what God has, what He has passed through, what He has accomplished, and what He has obtained and attained are all for the church. We who are chosen, predestinated, redeemed, forgiven, washed, justified, reconciled, and regenerated to be sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified are material for the building up of the church. We are not only individual Christians, we are also a corporate entity-the church.<h2 class=head1>I. GOD&#8217;S ETERNAL PURPOSE BEING THE CHURCH</h2><p>[God&#8217;s eternal purpose is to have the church. His purpose is not just to create man, to rescue him from his fallen condition, and to bring him to heaven. Furthermore, God&#8217;s purpose is not simply to have us be holy, spiritual, and victorious. Creation, salvation, sanctification, spirituality, and victory are all part of God&#8217;s procedure to reach His goal, but they are not the goal itself.]<p>[Ephesians 3:10-11 unveils the fact that the existence of the church is according to the eternal purpose of God which He purposed in Christ. The church is something of God&#8217;s eternal purpose. It did not come into existence by accident, but was planned in eternity. Before time began, in eternity, God purposed to have the church.<p>The word purpose here in the Scriptures is equivalent to the word plan. God&#8217;s eternal purpose is God&#8217;s eternal plan. God has a plan which He planned in eternity-He is not purposeless; He is a God of purpose.<p>What did God plan? He planned to have a church composed of a group of human beings coordinated together as a corporate Body with which He may mingle Himself in His divine nature. In other words, this corporate Body would be a corporate vessel, into which He would put Himself. This is the very thing God planned and this is the very center of His purpose. God planned to have a corporate Body, a corporate vessel, with which he could mingle Himself and all that He is. This vessel is called the church.<p>The church, therefore, is the center of God&#8217;s eternal plan. Why is the church so dear, so lovable, and so precious to God? It is because the church is the desire of God&#8217;s heart, which He purposed before time began. God in eternity planned to have the church.]<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Lesson Book, Level 5: The Church-The Vision and Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
