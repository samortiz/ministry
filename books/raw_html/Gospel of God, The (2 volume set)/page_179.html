<P>I thank God that formerly I was a sinner. I, Watchman Nee, was not asking to be saved. I rejected and opposed Him. But unexpectedly, God brought me through and caused me to accept the word which I had formerly rejected. God took me and gave me to the Lord Jesus. Once I was given, I no longer had any way to escape. When God gave me to the Lord, I received Him as the Savior. From that day on, I was in the Lord's hands. Since we have been given by God and received by the Lord Jesus, how can we escape? If it were we working by ourselves, and if it were we trying and striving to save ourselves, a little negligence or carelessness and we would be through. But we must realize that it is God who has given us to the Lord Jesus and who has saved us.</P><P>Let me give you a somewhat imperfect illustration. We know that recently Szechuan had a very severe famine. I read many reports concerning it. Children two years old, who could not even talk yet, were stretching forth their little hands to beg. They begged for food and clothing and maintained their livelihood through begging on the street; they had no other way to go on. Suppose there was a rich person who had plenty of food and clothing at home. If I delivered one of these children over to such a person, in reference to the material things, the child could be said to be saved. Once I give the child over, he is saved. In the same way, we the sinners were dead in sin and perishing. But as soon as God gave us over to the Lord Jesus, we were saved. To be saved means to be given over by God. While we were dead in sin and were waiting for judgment under condemnation, God gave us over. As a result we are saved. This has nothing to do with you. Since God has received you, He could not forsake you again. You were a lost person. You had neither food nor clothing. God gave you to the Lord Jesus, and He received you. How could you be cast out again now? There is no way it can be done. God has given, and the Lord Jesus has received. The Lord said that whoever comes to Him will not be forsaken. Whoever is given to Him by God will not be forsaken by Him. Hence, there is no way for such a one to perish. If you were able to perish, it would mean that God would not be consistent. God has already given over; and the Lord Jesus has already received. How can you perish? It would be a miracle if it were again possible for you to perish. I can say to God, "God, I thank You. I was a sinner; I was dead in sin. While I was yet a sinner, I had no desire to be saved. But You gave me over, and the Lord Jesus has received me. Once You have given me over, and He has received me, I cannot help but be saved."</P><P>The Lord Jesus said, "Him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out." The phrase "by no means" in the original language is very emphatic. It means regardless of anything. "By no means" is a strong expression, but because of our familiarity with the words, we do not pay so much attention to it. It means regardless of any reason, the Lord will not forsake us. There is absolutely not a single Christian whom He has forsaken. We are saved because of the Lord Jesus; we can continue in our salvation and be preserved in our salvation also because of the Lord Jesus. If we think that salvation is of the Lord but that preservation is of ourselves, we will discover that no one can preserve himself for even a single day. I am putting aside man; I am putting down man, but I am exalting the Savior. Everything is accomplished by Him. This is a gift; it is a present. We will never be forsaken.</P>
