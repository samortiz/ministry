   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The title of this message is very simple but what it conveys is inexhaustible.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The content of God's entire New Testament economy is Christ as the Son of Man cherishing us and as the Son of God nourishing us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The whole Bible is composed of both the Old and New Testaments.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Old Testament the revelation concerning God's economy with God, Christ, and the all-inclusive, compound, consummated Spirit is vague without the explanation and reality of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Mary McDonough wrote a marvelous masterpiece entitled God's Plan of Redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>She and some others used the word plan instead of economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word economy is not mentioned in the Old Testament, but it is mentioned in the New Testament by the apostle Paul Eph 1:10; 3:9; 1 Tim 1:4 the same Greek word is used in 1 Cor 9:17; Eph 3:2; Col 1:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's New Testament economy covers only one person the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He has two statuses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One is the Son of God and the other is the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The New Testament unveils to us the very God who is the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One day at the beginning of the new testament age, about two thousand years ago, God became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He came in a way to visit, to contact, His fallen creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Four thousand years before His first coming, He created the universe, and in the universe He created man as the very center in His image and after His likeness Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God created every creature after its kind, but He did not create man after man's kind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man was created in the image and likeness of God, so he looks like God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Man is a copy, a photo, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A photo does not have a person's element or life, but it does have that person's image and likeness.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>My burden is to show you that in the New Testament the first vision is that our God suddenly became a human being, and He was born as a man in the lowest status, not into a rich man's home, but into a poor man's home.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was born in Bethlehem, but He was raised up in Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His birth at Bethlehem was covered up by His being raised up in Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>People called Him a Nazarene Matt 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that He was a despised man from a despised city and a despised region.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Isaiah 53 says that He was a man without any outward beauty or attraction vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was just a poor Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such a poor man could contact every kind of man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If He had been born as a king, few would have been able to approach Him.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His coming in humanity made Him a very cherishing person.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sinners cannot save themselves, but Christ can take away their sins to cherish them.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If He came to us in His divine status, this would intimidate us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But even the most sinful tax collectors could sit with Him as friends, eating and talking with Him Luke 15:1; Matt 9:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The scribes and Pharisees, the self-justified ones, could not bear to see Him eating with tax collectors and sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They did not realize that they also needed Him to be their Physician.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I can testify that when I was a poor young man, Jesus came to me and cherished me.</S>

   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the Jesus in the four Gospels.</S>

   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we heard the story of His death on the cross, our tears came down.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We were attracted by Him.</S>

   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This Spirit is for nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As the all-inclusive Spirit from Acts through the Epistles, Christ nourishes us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This nourishing produces the church, builds up the Body of Christ, and will consummate the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Because of the church's degradation, Christ's nourishing becomes sevenfold intensified in the book of Revelation to bring forth the eternal goal of God, the New Jerusalem.</S>
