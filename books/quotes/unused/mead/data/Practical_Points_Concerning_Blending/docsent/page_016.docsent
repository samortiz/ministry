   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE REALITY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST 2 OUTLINE The corporate living by the perfected God-men, who are genuine men but are not living by their life, but by the life of the processed God, whose attributes have been expressed through their virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A corporate living of the conformity to the death of Christ through the power of the resurrection of Christ Phil 3:10.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The mingling living, in the eternal union, of the regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite God-men with the Triune God who is the pneumatic Christ as the embodiment of the processed and consummated Triune God, who is the all-inclusive Spirit as the reality of the pneumatic Christ and the consummation of the processed Triune God in the resurrection of Christ, of which the life-giving Spirit is the reality and which imparts the consummated God and releases the death-overcoming life into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Consummating ultimately in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth as God's increase and expression for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The crucial part of our fellowship in the previous chapter still remains here as a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this chapter we want to complete our fellowship on the reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I thank the Lord that in the last days He has unveiled to us the highest peak of His revelation in His holy Word concerning God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The blending conference is to bring us to reach this highest peak.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To do this I still have a burden which is very, very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE TRIUNE GOD'S INDWELLING WITHIN US</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although in this point what I am going to fellowship with you, doctrinally speaking, is quite common, it has not been practiced among us very much.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This point is the Triune God's indwelling within us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Romans 8 says that the indwelling Spirit ministers life into our mortal being v. 11 . There the word indwell is strongly stressed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, the Lord's word while He was on earth referred to this already.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In John 14:17-20 the Lord told us that by the Spirit of reality coming into us the Lord would live.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Where would He live?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He would live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And who is He?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is not just Jesus Christ, but the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>So no doubt, this means that when the Spirit of reality comes, the Lord Himself would dwell in us in order to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He said, "Because I live, you also shall live" v. 19b . He lives and we live.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you read this portion of the Word carefully, you can see that this is not a kind of individual living.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a corporate living that we live with the Lord since He lives within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We live together a corporate living.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>John 14:20 says, "In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These three ins indicate a strong fact which is very, very glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The eternal God, after His creation and after passing through the necessary processes, eventually became the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As such a Spirit, He lives in us that we may live together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>So this living is a mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These three ins I am in My Father, you in Me, and I in you indicate not only a corporate living but also a mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For us to reach the high peak of God's economy, that is, the reality of the Body of Christ, we must firstly see this divine indwelling within us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may know this already, but we have not paid sufficient attention to it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In other words, I do not believe anyone among us, including me, is constantly and instantly living with the indwelling Lord.</S>
