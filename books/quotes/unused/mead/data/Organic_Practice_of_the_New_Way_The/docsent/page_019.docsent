   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EVERYONE BEING A PRIEST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE GOSPEL TO SERVE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When you nourish the new ones in this way once or twice a week, week after week, in half a year the new ones will be greatly helped by you, and they will be established.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By that time, you can tell them that the life of a Christian is a communal one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All Christians like to be with other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are God s sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not like to live alone away from the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should meet with the brothers and sisters that live close to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this way, you bring them to the small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Soon after this, they will become a member of the small group.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our small group meetings do not have any set program or procedures.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In these meetings, we can sing, pray, or speak.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You can fellowship a little about the verses that you pray-read in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When everyone hears this, some may spontaneously begin to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Perhaps one would say that today he has a certain burden.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone will then pray for this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, in the small group meeting, there is fellowship, there is mutual intercession, and there is mutual care, including shepherding and help.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Among us there are no pastors or preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every one of us, whether young or old, male or female, is a priest and can serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul said in Romans 15 that he was a priest of the gospel offering up gospel sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The priests in the Old Testament offered up bulls and goats for offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The priests of the New Testament offer up souls.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul offered up the Gentiles as gospel sacrifices v. 16 . When we meet in the small group meetings, everyone is a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everyone can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If anyone asks a question, it is best if everyone can say something, rather than nominating one to give the answer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After the first one finishes, the second one can add a little.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then the third one can add more words.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If seven or eight people would all speak for a minute or two concerning what they know and experience, the result will be most beneficial to the listeners.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This will make the group meeting living and rich.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every attendant becomes a speaker, and every speaker is a listener.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this way, everyone speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone listens.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everyone learns, and everyone teaches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those who have been saved for thirty years can speak something deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But those who have been saved for three months can also speak a few words from their experience, that is, from what they know in their elementary stage.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Everyone is a teacher, and everyone is a student.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the new ones see this in the small group meetings, their eyes will be very much opened.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In half a year, they will pick up all these matters related to the feeding, the care, the questions, and the answers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By that time, the small group meeting will have over twenty people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You can then divide the group into two and encourage them, saying, Now we have to bring others to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not need to get help from others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And we do not need to hold any big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The simplest way is to go out to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Earlier, we knocked on your doors and helped you to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the same way, now you need to knock on others doors and help them to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There may be some older ones in the group who cannot go out.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They can stay at home to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After you go out to visit people for three or four weeks, every group can bring in three or four people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then you can start another cycle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Begin by nourishing the new ones in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then bring these new ones to the small group meetings to equip and perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In half a year, the small group will reach thirty in number again, and you can divide into two groups again.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No one takes the lead in the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every attendant in the small group is a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this way, the church will have the increase and the spread.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After four and a half years of studying, we have found the way for believers to be revived every morning and to be renewed every day.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In our daily lives, we have the gospel preaching, the home meetings, the small group meetings, and the Lord s Day morning meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the past, the big meeting on Lord s Day was for one person to speak and all the others to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now the brothers and sisters are divided up into districts.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Every district has about fifty people.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Every one of these fifty can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Everyone can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Everyone can call a hymn, and everyone can say something.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We do not encourage too many testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Testimonies often become story-tellings, and the time is wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We hope that those who want to testify would speak for half a minute only and would put emphasis on the words they have pray-read in the morning and the experience they have had from them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When everyone speaks something, spontaneously it will become a message that speaks forth the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In a meeting of fifty people, at least twenty can stand up to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is no gossiping.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There is no opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There are no arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Everyone speaks the Lord s word and expresses the Lord s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Such a meeting is an exhibition of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In the meeting some may speak about one aspect of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Another may speak about another aspect of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This kind of meeting will supply, enlighten, comfort, and perfect all the attendants.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The result is that the riches of Christ will be dispensed into all the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>These members will then become the materials for the building, and the church will be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Lord s recovery on earth must arrive at this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we would live this way every day, going out to visit people, bringing others to salvation, attending the small group meetings, enlightening others, and functioning in the Lord s Day meeting by presenting the riches, the church will be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taichung on March 29, 1989</S>
