<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>GOD IN CHRIST AS OUR FOOD</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Col. 1:15a; 3:4a; John 6:57; 1 Cor. 8:1; Rev. 2:7b, 17; 22:2a, 14</h1><p>From the beginning God has had an intention, but this intention was neglected by the entire human race. When the Lord Jesus came, He labored to restore God’s intention and to bring people back to the beginning. Eventually, the church was produced in order to pay its full attention to the original intention of God. Shortly after the church was established, however, the church also neglected God’s intention.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD’S PROMISE TO THE OVERCOMERS CONCERNING EATING</h2><p>After the degradation of the church, the Lord sounded a call for overcomers in the book of Revelation (2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). He promised to give these overcomers to eat according to His original intention, that is, to eat of the tree of life (2:7), to eat of the hidden manna (v. 17), and to dine, to feast, with Him (3:20). The Lord’s promise to the overcomers reminds us of three significant times of eating in the Old Testament: 1) the eating of the tree of life in the garden of Eden as a sign to the man created by God; 2) the eating of manna as a blessing to God’s people while they wandered in the wilderness; and 3) the eating of the produce of the good land in the yearly feasts.<p>To eat of the tree of life is to eat according to God’s original intention in the garden of Eden, to eat the manna is to enjoy the daily food of God’s people in the wilderness, and to feast with the Lord is to enjoy the rich produce in the good land. When the children of Israel entered into the good land, they began to enjoy the rich produce from the good land (Josh. 5:12). Then they were commanded by God to hold three feasts a year: the feast of the Passover (the Feast of Unleavened Bread), Pentecost (the Feast of Weeks), and the Feast of Tabernacles (Deut. 16:16). The Lord’s promise in the book of Revelation brings us back to God’s original intention in the beginning.<h2 class=head1>GOD’S INTENTION IN THE BIBLE</h2><p>God’s intention in the Bible is very basic, but it has been hidden for centuries. Genesis 1 tells us that God created man in His own image and gave him dominion over all the created things (v. 26). Two words here are very important: image and dominion. God created man in His own image, and God gave man dominion over all things, especially over the earth and the creeping things. The Bible then tells us that God put this man in front of the tree of life (2:9). Many trees were in the garden, and all were good for food, but only one tree was designated with the name the tree of life.<p>Colossians 1:15 tells us wonderfully that Jesus is the image of God. This verse brings us back to Genesis 1 where man was made in the image of God. Who is the image of God, and what is the image of God? According to Colossians 1:15, Christ is the image of God. Man was created in God’s image, and God’s image is Christ. Man, therefore, was made according to Christ. This is wonderful! We must be deeply impressed with the two words image and dominion. God made man in His own image and gave man dominion over all the earth.<p>In Genesis 2 God formed Adam’s physical body with the dust of the ground (v. 7a). According to medical doctors, man’s physical body contains all the elements of the dust, including salt, copper, iron, sulfur, and many other items. This proves that man is simply dust. Then after creating man’s body, God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life (v. 7b). According to the Hebrew text, the word breath in Genesis 2:7 is the same word translated spirit in Proverbs 20:27, which says, “The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah.” God breathed the breath of life into man’s body of dust, and this breath is the spirit of man. After God breathed into man’s body, forming his spirit, man became a living soul.
