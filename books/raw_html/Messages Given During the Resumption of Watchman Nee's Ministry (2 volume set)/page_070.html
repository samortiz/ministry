<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Need for the Church to Be Filled<br>with Men Who Would Listen</H2><P>Some brothers have asked me, "What is the requirement for me to come to the church in Shanghai?" The requirement is to listen to others. If you are not told to say something, do not say it. It is not a question of whether or not a thing should be said, but a question of learning to listen to others. One brother by the name of Geh was a college student. He had had some experience of working for others. He stayed in Shanghai for a number of days, and the church assigned him some work to do. Every morning he had to come from ten o'clock until twelve o'clock to transcribe messages. He could not be even one minute late. This was an exercise and a restriction for him. None of us is an expert. It is through serving that we become skillful. There is the need for the church to be filled with people who would listen to others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Listening to Others Saves Much Trouble</H2><P>Whenever the different denominations in Chefoo came together, they would argue with each other. Among us, we did not have a large number at the beginning. After some trainings, the number increased to eight hundred or one thousand. Yet there was very little opinion or criticism, and we made very few mistakes. We must cultivate this atmosphere in the church. We do not like to see many people making proposals concerning a matter. The brothers have a lot to say; the sisters have even more to say. Sometimes the sisters would even persuade the brothers to agree with them that something ought not be done. If there is the talking, it is better that we do not do anything. If we are to do anything, it is better that we stop the talking and start listening. We have to learn to do the works without having the talking. No one in Chefoo can move the chairs around at will. It is not a matter of why, but a matter of who gives the orders. Everything must be done by first checking with others. This is not being troublesome. Rather, this saves trouble. In the baptismal service, once we baptized one hundred twenty people in one hour and twenty minutes. Another time in Shanghai, we baptized one hundred thirty people in a little over an hour; it took only one minute to baptize each one. It took each one only fifteen minutes for the whole procedure, including the time to change clothes; after fifteen minutes the baptized ones were back in their seats already.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THINGS THAT ELDERS SHOULD LEARN</H2><P>The church is different from the home. What the responsible ones discuss in their meetings cannot be taken outside the meetings. If anyone wants to know anything, he should first ask the elders. Those in the world are used to meetings without discussions, and discussions without decisions, and decisions without actions. But the church should not be like this. Once there is a decision, we have to take action. After the elders make the decision, they should assign someone to execute the decision. Any decision that is made must not be announced independently. A brother cannot even tell his wife about the decision. After the meeting is over, the matter should not be discussed any further. Before an announcement is made, no one should pass on the news privately. One time, words about a decision went out to the brothers and sisters. When I tried to trace the person who spread the word, I found out that the source was a certain wife. When I asked the wife about it, she told me that a responsible brother had told her about it. Later I asked that responsible brother, and he admitted that he had said it through an oversight.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Exercising to Be Dealt With in the Flesh,<br>Being in One Accord,<br>Having the Lord as the Center</H2><P>It is not a matter of doing the right thing, but a matter of having the proper exercise. If a person's flesh is not dealt with, he is not qualified to touch God's work. He can be a "pew-member" or a "Sunday-goer" in the church. He can even be a good brother. But he cannot be a member of the Body. In order for the church to be built up in every aspect, both the human affairs and the things of God as well have to be up to the standard. Here we need God to remove our presumptuousness and our looseness as well. When a brother or a sister moves to another locality, he or she should not go there to assume any headship or to disrupt the order of the church. Human organization is different from the church. A human organization works by voting and by the consensus of the majority. But spiritual oneness is something spontaneous. The secret to all the blessings in the church is to be in one accord and to take the Lord as the center in everything.</P>
