	 <h2 class="head1">THE POWER OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>We must ask the Lord to fill every part of our being for the sake of the gospel. The Lord is pure, holy, and righteous. When He says that we are wrong in a certain matter, we should confess that matter and ask Him to forgive us, cleanse us, and cover us with His precious blood. When we fellowship with Him in this way, our relationship with Him becomes transparent, peaceful, and bright. We are able to sense His presence and live in His presence. Then the Lord will be our person, and we will be able to follow Him in a simple way.</p>
<p>It may seem that there is a price to pay in following the Lord&rsquo;s leading, but there is actually no price to pay. Wherever He leads, we can simply follow, and however He moves in us, we can simply say Amen. This is the way to receive the power of the gospel. When we live a life of following the Lord, the people whom we contact with the gospel will be subdued. We may not be aware of it, but those whom we contact will be subdued by the power of the gospel and will believe in the Lord. They will feel compelled to believe. Believing in Jesus is something wonderful. Sometimes a person may not be convinced in his mind, but he feels compelled to believe. This indicates that the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit has reached him.</p>
<p>Christians always try to persuade others to believe in Jesus; however, it is very easy for people to believe in Jesus. Once a person believes, it is impossible for him to disbelieve. There is something in every genuine Christian that cannot be shaken, chased away, or beaten down. When some saints encounter difficulties, they say that they no longer believe in the Lord; however, eventually faith within them rises up. This is the Lord&rsquo;s grace; this is the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit reaching them. Hence, it does not matter whether we subdue people by our gospel preaching. What matters is that we are connected to the Lord. Then when we contact a person, the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit will reach him. Outwardly he may feel that our speaking does not make sense, but inwardly he will sense the preciousness of the Lord. This is the Lord&rsquo;s grace; this is the Spirit&rsquo;s confirming our speaking and reaching him. We must always be living and connected to the Lord so that our gospel preaching will also be living. Then there will be something like electricity that flows from us to our gospel contact. We will be like electrical wires that convey electricity. Whenever a person touches us, he will immediately be &ldquo;electrified&rdquo; and believe in Jesus. The Lord Jesus is the Spirit who flows through us into whomever we preach the gospel to. This is the power of the Holy Spirit that transcends human knowledge. We cannot explain it. Just as we are unable to explain electricity, we are unable to clearly explain the power of the Lord. However, our Lord is more real than electricity. Our experience of Him depends on our allowing Him to flow through us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETING WITH NEW BELIEVERS BY THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>If a young saint brings a classmate to salvation, he should begin meeting with the new one immediately. We do not need formality, nor should we expect others to lead us. The young saint and his classmate should meet together. They can meet at noon for half an hour or after school for half an hour. Such informal meetings should begin as soon as someone has believed in the Lord. When another classmate believes in the Lord, there will be two meetings, and when three classmates have believed, there will be three meetings. The meetings do not have to be held in a classroom; the meetings can be on the lawn. First pray with the new one, and then read a portion of the Bible. We can teach new ones how to pray-read and pray with them. The Lord&rsquo;s Spirit will follow us.</p>
<p>We must not take the old way of Christianity to rely on pastors and preachers. Neither should we depend on the responsible brothers or co-workers. We should depend on our spirit and on the operating Spirit. If our meetings with the new ones are good, three believers will become four, four believers will become five, and five believers will become six; our number will continue to multiply. If we are willing to take this way, the Lord will be with us. In such meetings the words in the Bible will be bright and clear, full of anointing, watering, and very sweet. Not only so, our temperaments and problems will spontaneously fall away. Whenever our relationship with the Lord is normal, all our problems leave us, we become bright and clear within, and it is difficult for Satan to touch us. Gradually, we can bring our classmates to the meetings of the church. We should also fellowship with the other brothers and sisters in our school in order to help one another bring our classmates into the church. We should also establish contact and fellowship between our saved classmates and the saints in the church as well as the other brothers and sisters in our school. In this way, the new ones will be brought into the church life.</p>
<p>If we all have this kind of practice, we will be effective. If there are two thousand brothers and sisters in a school, that is two thousand little speakers, who are more effective than one preacher. This is the Lord&rsquo;s way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EFFECT OF THE GOSPEL BEING CONTINUAL</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the parents of the young people whom we gain will be affected. When young people graduate from high school and enter college, it is very easy for them to lead their parents. It is not easy for the children to listen to their parents, but it is rather easy for the parents to receive what their children say. When young people hear the gospel in school, they will tell their parents what they heard, and it will be easy for the parents to follow. Gaining a classmate is equivalent to gaining a family. This is a continual cycle, and the effect is also continual. May the Lord have mercy on us. From this day onward the work with the young people should be carried out by the young saints.</p>
