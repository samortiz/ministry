   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE SIXTEEN BEING BURDENED WITH GOD S LOVING CONCERN FOR SINNERS AND WITH CONVERTING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SINNERS INTO MEMBERS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR THE CARRYING OUT OF GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous message, we pointed out five crucial points for our seeking in the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, we need to seek to be blended with the other members of our vital group by having an intimate and thorough fellowship with much and thorough prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second, we need to seek to be filled with the Spirit inwardly and outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Third, we need to pray unceasingly by exercising our spirit to redeem the time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Fourth, we need to learn to serve and work not in our own way but in the coordinated way by giving up our freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Fifth, we need to pray for the dealing with our disposition, character, and peculiar traits.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These five items are not like lessons which we can study and courses from which we can graduate.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are five daily necessities like our drinking, eating, breathing, sleeping, and exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we practice these things, our gatherings will be living and released.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Spontaneously, we will be persons in the meeting who are releasing the Spirit in our praying, praising, singing, and speaking for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We will be enlivened and enlivening persons.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need the vital groups because of our dead and dying situation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead of enlivening others, we may deaden them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our coming to the meeting may deaden the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should be those who enliven the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everybody should be released in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to be released persons, we must practice the above five items.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to exercise our spirit to pray unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that we should not waste our time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, we need to fill up the gaps in our time with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No one can say that they redeem and use every moment of every day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today, generally speaking, Americans have much free time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why they spend time pursuing entertainment and worldly pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whenever our time is empty, we should fill it with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that we should pray unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A person who prays unceasingly is a released person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have been helped in the Lord s recovery to realize the daily spiritual practices we should have.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We know how to call on the name of the Lord and how to talk to the Lord for the release of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The only need is for us to fill up our time with these practices.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whenever we pray, we must release our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I do not mean that we need to shout all the time, but when we pray in the meetings, our prayer should not be voiced in a common way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even our voice must be exercised when we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Prayer means to release our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If there is no release of our spirit, that is not prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To pray and to praise are different.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Praise requires us to be more released in our voice than prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In our translation of the Psalms, we use the term ringing shout Psa 71:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to the Bible, we people of God must be crazy ones who are joyfully praising Him every day Phil 4:4; 1 Thes 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If someone gave you a very expensive diamond as a present, you might be very excited, but we have something tremendously more valuable than this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ is so worthy and so rich.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is immeasurable, unsearchable, and untraceable.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have such a Christ, but do we have Him as our reality?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We sing about how wonderful and rich Christ is, but do we really see and experience Him in such a way?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Are we really crazy about Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not be old, cold, and stale, but fresh, living, young, and new in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In order to be living and vital members in the church life, we must practice the five aforementioned items all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then our meetings will be filled with joyful shouting and rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need much preparation before we can have the impact in going out to reach people for the increase of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although we may know the truth concerning the four steps of the God-ordained way, we have not properly practiced them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Few among us have properly practiced the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we do not know how to do something, we cannot be interested in it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When a child is at the beginning stages of learning how to play the piano, it is difficult for him and he may not be that interested in it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But eventually, as he practices and learns more and more, he will become addicted to playing the piano.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This shows that the more we practice, the more we learn, and the more we learn, the more we become addicted.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It seems that presently few among us have a real interest in the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We agree that the group meetings are eighty percent of the church life, but how many are really interested in the group meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are still mostly in the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have been practicing the vital groups for about ten weeks, and I am concerned that there are still some saints in your group whose full names you do not even know.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This shows that we surely have not entered into a thorough and intimate fellowship with one another in order to be blended together.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I hope that we would know not only the names of the ones in our particular group but also the names of the saints in all of the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In these days I am greatly burdened for the raising up and the going on of the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need to get ourselves prepared to go out to gain people for the increase and building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should get ourselves prepared by making a list of our relatives and close acquaintances.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then we need to pray and ask the Lord which ones we should concentrate on first as candidates for our gospel service.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord will lead us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In these months we need to continually pray for them, and then we can go to contact them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In order to carry out the Lord s burden in the vital groups, we must be renewed persons and we must learn how to serve the Lord in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>To learn to be a medical doctor is difficult, but to learn how to serve the Lord according to His way is much more difficult than studying medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I have been learning how to serve the Lord for over sixty years, and I have still not graduated.</S>
