There is much grace involved. A person who has been forgiven by God should at least have a little of God's nature. He should have an inclination for generosity and a tinge of the Lord's image. Yet this slave learned nothing after experiencing so much grace; he did not have a taste of the generosity of grace. In verse 27 he was forgiven, and he should have been rejoicing. Yet when he met his companion, he went after the hundred denarii (worth about three-tenths of a tael of gold) which was owed to him. He owed his master about three hundred thousand taels of gold. He was owed only a millionth of what he owed his master, yet he took hold of the other person and choked him, saying, "Repay me what you owe." In verse 22 the Lord wanted to show Peter that the matter of forgiveness is a matter of the spirit. If we are filled with a sense of forgiveness and the joy of grace when we are saved, we will be more than happy to forgive others. Peter's word exposed one problem&mdash;he did not realize that he had been forgiven. He did not have the feeling of being forgiven. This is the reason he could not forgive. If we are filled with the feeling of being forgiven, we will not say such things as "seven times." Peter's mind was on the number seven. This is the reason the Lord purposely spoke of ten thousand talents and one hundred denarii in verses 24 and 28. The difference between these two is a million times. The Lord seemed to be saying, "God's forgiveness cannot be measured by numbers. If you want numbers, you owe the Lord a million times more than what others owe you." A man who is good at accounting is one who is poor at reckoning grace. A man will not forgive because he does not have a sense of being forgiven; he does not have a feeling that he has been graced.</p><p>The one who was threatened with the demand to repay his debt fell down and begged the slave, "Be patient with me and I will repay you." His prayer and request was the same as the slave's request. Yet the grace which was shown to the slave did not effect a compassion in him for the man's need. He tried to throw him into prison until he repaid what he owed. Here we have three persons&mdash;two are debtors and two are creditors. The Lord showed that the second person was both a debtor and a creditor. The first creditor was concerned only with grace, not righteousness. The second creditor was concerned only with righteousness, not grace. This should be condemned. When he was a debtor, he hoped for grace. Once he became a creditor, he acted according to righteousness. When he was a debtor, he looked for forgiveness. Once he became a creditor, he granted no forgiveness at all. This is unreasonable. The Lord showed Peter his own sin. He showed Peter the immensity of the forgiveness he had received. Peter omitted the words "in a day"! This is unreasonable! What the other slave owed was only one hundred denarii (three-tenths of a tael of gold). It was such a small sum. Yet he was put into prison. How "righteous" was the first slave! He wanted others to be gracious to him, yet he would not be gracious to others. Was he wrong? Should his companion have repaid him? Of course, he was right, and there was nothing wrong in putting his companion into prison for failing to repay him. It was righteous for his companion to be put into prison, but he had just received grace from another. He had just tasted the experience of grace. It was wrong for him to do such a thing; it should be condemned. We have been forgiven of our sins. If we do not forgive others, how much will we be judged?</p><h2 class="head1">FORGIVING OTHERS AS THE LORD HAS FORGIVEN US</h2><p>At the beginning of verse 31 the Lord said, "Then his fellow slaves, seeing what had taken place, were greatly grieved." The Lord asked the other slaves to come forth to say a word. If a forgiven person will not forgive another, even the church will be grieved by such an act. The whole church knows that this is wrong. Everyone was grieved and came and explained this to the master. The master called the slave in and said, "Evil slave, all that debt I forgave you, because you begged me. Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave even as I had mercy on you?" (vv. 32-33). Among the brothers we should only speak of forgiveness, not of righteousness. We should only speak of mercy, not of repayment. We have to learn not to offend others or to take advantage of them. We have to learn to do our best to share grace with others. The Lord has been gracious to us with good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over. We have received so much grace. We should be gracious to others, also with good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over. The church should be filled with forgiveness. The Lord forgives us for two reasons. One is to absolve our debt, and the other is to give us the power to absolve others' debt. Should we not be merciful to our companions? Everyone who has received mercy should be merciful to others. The Lord expects us to treat others in the same way He treats us. Colossians 3:13 says, "Bearing one another and forgiving one another, if anyone should have a complaint against anyone; even as the Lord forgave you, so also should you forgive." Among God's children, we should never quibble according to righteousness. God has not reckoned our account with us; we should never reckon others' account with them.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING FULL OF THE SPIRIT OF FORGIVENESS</h2><p>Matthew 18:34 says, "And his master became angry and delivered him to the torturers until he would repay all that was owed." This verse means that the Lord delivers a man to God's governmental hand until he repays all that is owed. In terms of spiritual significance, repayment means forgiveness. Being delivered to the torturers means being delivered to God's governmental hand. God wants us to be filled with the spirit of forgiveness. This is the reason that verse 35 immediately follows, saying, "So also will My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts." This means that God wants us to be filled continually with a spirit of forgiveness. We have to forgive our brothers from our heart. What does it mean to forgive the brothers from the heart? If our brother owes us a hundred denarii, and we feel awkward in forgiving his debt, it means that we do not know God. We have been forgiven of a ten thousand talent debt. We should not be bound by a hundred denarii. We have received mercy from God. He has graced us with a generous and unmatched forgiveness, and He has created a generous and unmatched heart of forgiveness in us. This enables us to forgive our brothers from the heart. If a spirit of pettiness and calculation abounds in a church, trouble will increase in that church. We should submit to God's authority. His kingdom is full of the spirit of forgiveness. If we do not practice this, the church will be full of problems. May the spirit of forgiveness fill the church. May brotherly love fill the church. How glorious such a church will be!</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_066.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_068.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 60: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (2) &nbsp; pg 67</div><br></body></html>
