   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Soaking Our Behavior in the Enjoyment</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of the Riches of Christ's Life</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 11 also says, "He washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Years ago, I could not understand what it meant to wash our garments in wine and our clothes in the blood of grapes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Bible our behavior in our daily living is likened to garments.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Figuratively speaking, garments or clothes signify our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They represent our walk and acts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, to wash our garments in wine and our clothes in grape juice signifies that we soak our behavior, our daily walk, in the enjoyment of the riches of Christ's life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Both grape wine and grape juice are for nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Grape juice is mainly for quenching our thirst, whereas grape wine is mainly for stirring up our excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our thirst needs to be quenched, but our excitement needs to be stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every Christian must be "crazy," beside himself, in a proper sense.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every Christian who binds his donkey to the vine will be happy and excited.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the function of grape wine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The grape juice that we drink is for quenching our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the one hand, the rich Christ stirs up our excitement; on the other hand, He quenches our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to soak our behavior, our daily walk and actions, in the rich enjoyment of Christ's life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then our behavior will be permeated and saturated with the full enjoyment of the riches of Christ's life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then others will say, "Look at these Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Look at how they live and conduct themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Surely there must be something to what they are."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This something is the rich life of Christ as the cheering wine to stir us up and as quenching juice to satisfy us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such Christians are happy, satisfied, excited, and even beside themselves with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because they are so excited, they become exciting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Their behavior, their daily walk, and all their actions are full of Christ's life as wine and as juice.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Are you the kind of Christian who is always dissatisfied?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Are you a Christian who does not know how to be happy, who always has a wrinkled brow and a long face, who always looks sad?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All those in the kingdom of Christ must be smiling, happy, pleasant, excited, cheerful, and satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that we are soaking our behavior in the rich enjoyment of the life of Christ.</S>
