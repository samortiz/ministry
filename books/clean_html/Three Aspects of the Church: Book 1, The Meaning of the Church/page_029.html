<h2 class="head2">Zipporah&mdash;Typifying the Church in the Wilderness</h2>
<p>Moses is another type of Christ. Hebrews 3 explicitly says that Moses typifies Christ. Moses was the apostle sent by God to deliver the children of Israel from Egypt. He typifies Christ as the Apostle sent by God to save the children of God from their degradation, that is, from Satan&rsquo;s usurpation.</p>
<p>Moses typifies Christ in four aspects. First, Moses was persecuted soon after he was born because the Egyptians were seeking to kill every son born of the Hebrew women; consequently, many sons were killed (Exo. 1:16, 22). This type was realized when Christ was born. King Herod sought to kill Him, and as a result, many sons were killed (Matt. 2:16). Second, Moses was born of his parents in the flesh, but he was raised by another woman&mdash;Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter (Exo. 2:10). In the same way, the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit but was raised by a woman&mdash;Mary (Matt. 1:23). Third, in order to flee Pharaoh&rsquo;s persecution, Moses fled to the wilderness of Midian (Exo. 2:15). The Lord Jesus also fled to Egypt to escape Herod&rsquo;s persecution (Matt. 2:13-15). Fourth, Moses was sent by God to save God&rsquo;s people from the ill treatment of Pharaoh in Egypt (Exo. 3:7-10). This typifies Christ being sent by God to the earth to save God&rsquo;s people from the bondage of Satan. Hence, Hebrews 3 points out that Moses is a type of Christ as the Apostle.</p>
<p>Since Moses is a type of Christ, his wife Zipporah typifies the church. Zipporah is the wife whom Moses married when he was persecuted and wandering in the wilderness (Exo. 2:21). Thus, Zipporah typifies the aspect of the church in the wilderness, being gained by Christ when He was forsaken and wandering in the wilderness.</p>
<p>After Moses, Joshua typifies Christ. Nevertheless, because the Bible does not speak of Joshua&rsquo;s wife, it is difficult to speak of her as a type of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Ruth&mdash;Typifying<br />
the Church Being Redeemed</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Boaz Being the Lawful Heir<br />
of God&rsquo;s Inheritance</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament Boaz is yet another type of Christ. Boaz married a special woman who occupies a particular place in the Bible. Her name was Ruth. She typifies the aspect of the church being redeemed. The entire book of Ruth can be considered a story of redemption. Rebekah portrays the church as the called one, Zipporah portrays the church in the wilderness, and Ruth portrays the church in redemption.</p>
<p>The Old Testament pays much attention to the matter of the birthright. Boaz was a lawful heir of the inheritance of God. After God called Abraham, He gave Abraham every blessing: heavenly and earthly, material and spiritual, and even God Himself. Abraham received all the blessings that God prepared for man in His eternal plan, the blessings in both His creation and redemption. All the blessings of God&rsquo;s creation and even God Himself were given to Abraham.</p>
<p>There was a problem, however, of who would inherit the blessing that Abraham had received from God. Eliezer of Damascus was not qualified to inherit the blessing; neither was Ishmael, who was born of Hagar. Only Isaac, who was born according to the promise, could inherit the blessing. Of the two sons born of Isaac, Esau and Jacob, God chose Jacob to be the heir. In principle, only the one with the birthright could be the heir to inherit the blessing. Jacob was a crafty person, and he stole the birthright from his brother through trickery. Even if Jacob had not used any tricks, God&rsquo;s blessing and the birthright would still have come to him. Jacob had twelve sons, and since they were all born of Jacob, they all had a part in the blessing of Abraham. However, among these twelve, only the first one should have received the birthright.</p>
<p>According to the Old Testament, the blessing of the birthright consists of three items: a double portion of the land, the kingship of God, and the priesthood of God. These three items are the blessings of the birthright inherited by Jacob&rsquo;s sons. Reuben, as the firstborn of Jacob, should have inherited all three blessings of the birthright; however, he lost the birthright because he defiled his father&rsquo;s bed. Hence, the blessings of the birthright went to three of his brothers. The double portion of land went to Joseph (Gen. 48:22), the kingship went to Judah (49:8), and the priesthood went to Levi (Exo. 28:1).</p>
<p>At the time of Boaz, the inheritance of land was not an important issue, and the priesthood had become desolate. Only the kingship needed to be confirmed. Hence, at that time the kingship was the most important of the blessings related to the birthright, and Boaz was the lawful heir of this blessing. The Scriptures say that Boaz begot Obed, and Obed begot Jesse, and Jesse begot David the king (Matt. 1:5-6). The kingship of Judah came from Boaz because he was an ancestor of King David. Hence, the kingship among the Jews was produced through Boaz. Moreover, the Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious eternal King, was also a descendant of Boaz according to genealogy.</p>
