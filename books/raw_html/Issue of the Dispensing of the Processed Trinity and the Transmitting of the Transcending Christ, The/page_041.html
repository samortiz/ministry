<P>I believe that in the past five chapters we have seen God's economy. We have also seen that the way to carry out the Triune God's economy is by His threefold dispensing plus Christ's onefold transmitting. These two things work together. The threefold dispensing produces the many sons and transforms them into God's heritage of worth. This transformation will go on and on through the Spirit's continual sealing until one day the result will come out. That result will be the transfiguration of our vile body, which will bring all of us into God's glory. This is the issue of the triune dispensing to produce the materials for the building up of the church, the Body of Christ.</P><P>Then the church comes into existence through the transcending Christ's transcending transmission, and this transmission took place on the day of Pentecost. In the history of the universe, such a marvelous thing took place. Suddenly in one day, the church as the Body of Christ came into being. Now the church, the Body of Christ, is here. Today we are enjoying Him in His Body, His church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINGLED SPIRIT<br>IN THE BOOK OF EPHESIANS</H2><P>Before we speak further concerning the Body of Christ, I want to point out something crucial in the book of Ephesians. In each of the six chapters of Ephesians, the human spirit is mentioned. Our human spirit has been regenerated and indwelt by the compound, all-inclusive, consummated Spirit to make this spirit a mingled spirit.</P><P>In 1:17 the apostle Paul prayed that the Father would give us such a mingled spirit of wisdom to understand and of revelation to see. We need the revelation and the enlightenment to see the mystery of God's economy. We also need to understand, to apprehend, what we see by the divine wisdom. The economy of God is a real mystery, yet it has been revealed to us. We can see His economy and it is made known to us so that we can receive it, understand it, apprehend it, and participate in it.</P><P>Ephesians 2:22 says that all the believers are being built together to be God's habitation in spirit. God needs a dwelling place, not just in the heavens but on the earth, and this dwelling place must be organic in our spirit. This spirit is not the dweller; rather, it is the dwelling place. God mingled Himself with our spirit, and our spirit is His dwelling place. God is here dwelling in us. He is in our spirit, which is His resting place.</P><P>Ephesians 3:5 tells us that the economy of God, which is so mysterious, has been unveiled to the apostles and the prophets in their spirit. This revelation was given not in their mind but in their spirit. If we are going to understand, to realize, the reality of God's mysterious economy, we must learn to discern our spirit from our soul (Heb. 4:12). We should not be bothered by our soul. We should not be troubled, complicated, and perplexed by our mind. Instead, we should always turn to our spirit where we can meet the divine Spirit. In our mingled spirit, we have the capacity to see the mystery of God's economy, to understand it, to apprehend it, and to receive it and retain it as our portion.</P><P>Ephesians 4:23 says that we have to be renewed in the spirit of our mind. Our spirit can become the spirit of our mind. Actually, the fallen mind is a bad thing. There are a number of bad things within us, and the leading one is our mind. We have to hate our mind. When we exercise our mind too much, we get ourselves "hung on a tree" like Absalom (2 Sam. 18:9-10). But we have the best thing in us, that is, our spirit. This thing, our spirit, can even go into our mind. Our spirit can come into our mind, subdue it, take it over, and occupy it. It can then become the spirit of our mind. Then we have a wonderful mind, a mind that has the spirit within it. It is by this spirit of the mind that we are renewed every day into the image of our Creator (Col. 3:10). Day by day we are being renewed by the spirit who is taking over our mind. It is in this way that we are transformed and conformed to the image of our Creator.</P>
