   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPEAKING FOR THE LORD DEPENDING ON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OUR BEING EQUIPPED AND HAVING A RESERVE SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You need to exercise all wisdom to open your whole being to let the word of the Lord as a living person dwell in every inward part comfortably and freely.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then, when you want to speak for Him, this word in you will be living, rich, and available.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You will be able to use it freely.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because of the educational standard in Taiwan today, the level of knowledge of everyone in Taiwan has been raised.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The age has also changed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As Christians in the twentieth century we cannot speak for the Lord in an unsophisticated way, saying, It is so good to believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can eat and sleep in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After we die, we will go to heaven and not to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No one would listen to this kind of speaking today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You must have something substantial to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, you must be able to speak clearly on Romans 8:2, which says, The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Such a clear speaking would shock the knowledgeable university students.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They would ask, What is the law of sin and of death?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I want to hear about it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then you may show them a diamond by saying, All who sin are the slaves of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But if the Son of God shall set you free, you shall be really free.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When you let the word of the Lord dwell in you richly, you will have wisdom to bring out different verses for the different people you meet.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may read Genesis 1:26, which says, And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Or you may read John 1:1, which says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Try reading these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All those who hear will be amazed because they had no idea that such deep and mysterious things are in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I hope that through my fellowship with you today you will be enlightened to see that we must speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only through our speaking for the Lord can the Lord have a way to go on, and will we also have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To speak for the Lord, we must be equipped and we must have a reserve supply.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must use all wisdom to receive this living Lord, to let this living word dwell in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If so, we will have the words to speak at school and at work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even when the sisters go to the market or to the fabric store, they will have words to speak to whomever they meet.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They will be able to preach the word of God to others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>SPEAKING THE WORD OF GOD TO OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>AT EVERY TIME AND IN EVERY PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I exhort all of you always to carry a Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The older brothers and sisters who cannot read small print can purchase a Bible with large print and separate it book by book.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They can make a booklet out of the Gospel of Matthew and a booklet out of the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I did this when I was young.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I used to bring the Bible to work so that I could read it at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every word and every phrase of the Bible is a diamond.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is unfortunate that few would show these diamonds to others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I hope that each of you will learn to speak the word of the Lord, using all wisdom to receive the word of the Lord into you as you would receive a living person, that He may feel at ease and richly dwell in you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to equip ourselves daily.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to be those who have a reserve supply.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, when we meet an older person, first we need to consider what an older person would most like to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What the older Chinese people like to hear most is Children, honor your parents.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, when speaking to an elderly Chinese lady, I would open up my Bible and show her Ephesians 6:1-3: The children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise, that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This elderly lady would think to herself that she has never heard this kind of word in Buddhist teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She would think, This is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I want to believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After I believe in Jesus, my children and grandchildren will all have to honor me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They will all have a long life and will be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Perhaps the lady next door often quarrels with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The best verse for you to use to preach the gospel to her would be Ephesians 5:25.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You may say to her, Look at what the Bible says: Husbands, love your wives.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This word would be the gospel to her.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It would certainly touch her heart, and she would think, Not for any other reason, but just so that my husband will love me, I need to believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If I believe in Jesus, and he also believes, then he will love me.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The word in the Bible is too rich.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should use it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must have a reserve supply that we may use it freely.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When you meet a young person, you can read Proverbs 1:7 with him: The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need to receive the word of the Lord into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There are sixty-six books in the Bible with over 1,200 chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we would only choose one golden verse out of each chapter to be stored in us, we would have over 1,200 verses to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If every brother and sister in the church would do this, we would all become a house of scholars, and whatever we utter would be a scholarly composition.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I hope that the church in Taipei will become such a church where every saint, whether old or young, will speak the word of the Lord everywhere in a logical, meaningful, valuable, and skillful manner, speaking until others are attracted, until everyone has heard the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This must not be practiced in a rigid way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must spend time to research continuously.</S>
