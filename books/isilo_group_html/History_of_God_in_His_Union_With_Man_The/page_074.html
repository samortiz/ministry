In Exodus 3:15 this divine title was spoken by God Himself when He told Moses, "Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations" (cf. vv. 6, 16; Matt. 22:31-32).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. JEHOVAH ELOHIM</H2><P>The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is Jehovah Elohim (Gen. 2:4-22; Exo. 3:15). Genesis 1 uses only the title Elohim for God, not Jehovah. In Genesis 2 God's title became Jehovah Elohim. Elohim means the faithful mighty One. God is faithful and mighty. Jehovah means He who was, who is, and who is to be. Genesis 2:4-22 repeatedly mentions Jehovah Elohim, a divine title indicating God's relationship with His elect.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Self-existing and<br>Ever-existing Triune God</H2><P>Jehovah as the great I Am is the self-existing and ever-existing Triune God (Exo. 3:13-14). He is self-existing, without beginning, and ever-existing, without ending. The beginning and ending in the whole universe is God. God is the beginning, the Alpha, and He is the ending, the Omega (Rev. 22:13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Triune God Who Was,<br>Who Is, and Who Is to Be</H2><P>Revelation 1:4 speaks of "Him who is and who was and who is coming." In the past He was; in the present He is; and in the future He is to be. From eternity to eternity Jehovah is the One who exists, so He is the One who was, who is, and who is to be.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Great Eternal I Am,<br>the I Am That I Am</H2><P>Jehovah Elohim, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, is the great eternal I Am, the I Am That I Am (Exo. 3:14; John 8:24, 28, 58). As the I Am, He is eternal. In John 8 the Lord Jesus mentioned three times that He is the I Am. In John 8:24 He said, "Unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins." In verse 28 He said, "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am." Finally, in verse 58 He said, "Before Abraham came into being, I am." Strictly speaking, the English grammar in verse 58 is wrong. To keep the correct grammar, the Lord should have said, "Before Abraham came into being, I was," but the Greek text uses the present tense. Christ is the great I Am who, as the eternal, ever-existing God, was before Abraham. He is the eternal I Am, the I Am That I Am.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_073.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_075.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The History of God in His Union With Man &nbsp; pg 74</div><br></body></html>
