   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The rapture of the believers is a great matter and is emphasized strongly in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are two main aspects of the rapture: the rapture of the overcomers and the rapture of the majority of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Leviticus 23:10 presents a type related to the two aspects of the believers rapture; it is a type of crops ripening in the field.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some crops ripen earlier and others ripen later.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is a difference between the man-child and the firstfruits.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The man-child is for fighting and for defeating Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, the man-child deals with the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The firstfruits are not for fighting but for the satisfaction of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The enemy, the devil, must be cast down from heaven by the man-child, who will execute God s judgment over him.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The rapture of the overcomers will also include the rest of the overcoming believers who will be living at the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These believers are signified by the one of two men working in the field, by one of the two women grinding at the mill, and by one of the two on one bed.</S>
