<H2 CLASS=HEAD7>rr. The Network and the Chainwork on the Two Capitals<br>Being Seven on Each</H2><P>First Kings 7:17 says, "And nets of checkerwork, and wreaths of chainwork, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital." Here we see that the network and the chainwork on the two capitals were seven on each. This indicates that all the complicated situations are temporal, not eternal. All the crossing, breaking, and suppressing are temporary, yet they are complete, for they are in the number seven. One day, all this will be over, and there will be no more checkerwork and chainwork. Instead of network and an entwined wreath, we shall have a golden crown.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>ss. The Number Three Being Hidden</H2><P>Notice that in these two pillars the number three is hidden. This indicates that the Triune God is hidden. That the pillars are twelve cubits in circumference and capitals four cubits in diameter implies the presence of the number three. The number three, the Triune God, is real but invisible. In every situation the Triune God is real, but He is hidden.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>tt. The Brass, the Lily, and the Pomegranates<br>All Being on the Two Pillars</H2><P>The brass, the lily, and the pomegranates are all on the two pillars. This reveals that death, resurrection, and the expression of life are all a testimony in God's building. Today, we are here with this testimony. All these points are crucial, and I hope that you will spend time to pray and fellowship about them until they get into you and become your experience. Then we shall know what a pillar is and how we can become a pillar.</P>
