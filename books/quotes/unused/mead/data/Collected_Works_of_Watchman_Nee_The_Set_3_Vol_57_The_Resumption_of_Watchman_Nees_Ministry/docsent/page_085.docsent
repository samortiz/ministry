   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN FELLOWSHIP AND EXHORTATIONS Co-workers' Meeting Date: Wednesday, April 21, 1948, 6:30 a.m.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nature: Testimonies and questions by the co-workers, and exhortations by Watchman Nee INDIVIDUALS HANDING OVER</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>RESULTING IN THE BODY TAKING OVER</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Du Chung-chun: What occupations are considered proper?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Watchman Nee: Brother Chu once said, "If I hand something over to the Body, I do not have to take care of it any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is no longer my business, but the Body's business.''</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is rightly put.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Your burden is no longer on your shoulders, but on the shoulders of the brothers and sisters and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you hand yourself over, everything becomes the Lord's. If you make money, it is God who is making the money; and if you lose money, it is God who is losing the money.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our principle is to let the dead bury the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to know that serving God is not just a matter of serving God alone, but of serving Him in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today by the grace of God, we have handed ourselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we merely say with our mouths that we are serving God, nobody knows when we have stopped this service.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This kind of service is not definite.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, if we hand ourselves over, we cannot turn back even if we want to.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may say that we cannot walk, but many others will carry us; they can move us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If our service is for the church, we will be able to give up even the things that we could not otherwise give up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not a matter of our own arrangement, but a matter of the Lord's arrangement in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is a tremendous thing for a person to decide to consecrate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, this thing is not done individually, but in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brother Chow asked: In the future should the brothers engage in business by using the name of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No answer from Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>SISTER RUTH LEE'S FELLOWSHIP AND TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have asked for permission already from the other brothers concerning what I am about to say.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It all happened about thirteen years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At that time I wanted to have an apartment, but I cannot go into detail about the reason for having it....Although I have been negative in recent years, there was still a supply from the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Brother Chu gave me ten thousand dollars, and when Brother Chang Tze-jieh came from Tsingtao, he gave me a few thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From that time on I decided to set aside a certain amount from what I have received....When I moved back from the countryside, I saw many more white-haired people in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The next time I came back, there were even more with white hair....The sisters had given up all their savings, and some sisters had to stay in the hospital and could not go home....What I have can only become less; it will never become more.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the money that I have is enough to feed one more person for a month only; it will be gone by the second month.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I can sleep on the floor and let others sleep on my bed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But others will not feel comfortable sleeping this way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we have to provide a place for others to rest, it should be a place where others can rest comfortably.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I felt that somehow I have to have a place that is like a home, that others will not feel ashamed or burdensome to live in, and which is close to the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only then will such a place be able to render others some spiritual help....When a person gets older, she tends to develop her own peculiarities.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Others say that living together provides fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Actually, living together provides frustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is why I have hoped all the time to have a place that can provide hospitality for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Brother Lee said that perhaps they can provide a place for me in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today I ask Brother Nee to forgive me for all my past attitudes and words.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I also ask the responsible brothers to forgive me for my past attitudes and words.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I was sympathetic toward Brother Nee's venture into business.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Concerning the CBC Laboratory, I heard many words, and they made me angry.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually, these angers spilled over to Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brother Nee said, "The magistrates are the only ones that can light a fire; the common folks should not even light a lamp.''</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Translator's note: A Chinese idiom meaning that only a few are allowed to do something, referring to Brother Nee's venture into business.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am not Brother Nee, and I cannot speak for him in many things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When others said that Brother Nee was wrong, how could I take such words?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I could not single out Brother Nee for blame.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As a result I began to blame the other responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since they had promised that the business venture was God's will already, how could I stop other brothers and sisters?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Yet when others came to me, they were bothered to the point of a mental breakdown, and I could not help but sympathize with them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is God's grace that I have not had a mental breakdown today.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even if ninety-nine percent of the responsibility lies with others, I still hold one percent of the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Actually, I should say that I hold more than one percent of the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At one time some people criticized The Normal Christian Church Life and asked me to say something bad about Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>People wanted to use me as a tool to oppose Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Concerning the CBC Laboratory, I did tell people that it was a "gossip center.''</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>My motive concerning the business was bitter, and my attitude toward Brother Nee was also bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I would not say that I have never condemned anything; there were indeed things which I took offense in. Once a person got involved with the CBC Lab, their spiritual condition collapsed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If what has happened these few days had happened then, none of what I am saying would need to be said.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I wish that the tears I shed today would be my last tears.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I wish that when I leave the world one day, and others open up my closets, they will find them empty.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If my closets are full, it will be to my shame.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I realize that it is better to prefer poverty than to prefer wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>During these years, I did have the thought of selling everything I have.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Sometimes I cannot recognize my own belongings.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Others always push me to buy something for myself, but I always give this and that kind of excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I seldom buy things for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When I bought an overcoat, three people literally dragged me to the store to buy it.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I do not care much for my own clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I am not saving things in my closets and keeping them for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As for cash, I cannot come up with even a thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I do not have a single piece of gold with me.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I can testify for my conscience' sake that all that I have is worth nothing; everything I have is what I need for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Of course, I can hand over my rice and my oil.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I can give my last drop to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When the church proposed to buy a piece of land the last time, some people were blaming others, while others were plainly sitting back and watching.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>At that time twenty pieces of gold would have done the job.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But we waited and waited until all the money was gone, and everyone was still sitting there watching.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Because of this, we accomplished nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If everyone hands himself over today, what follows is the responsibility of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I open up myself this way today out of necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>My words end here.</S>
