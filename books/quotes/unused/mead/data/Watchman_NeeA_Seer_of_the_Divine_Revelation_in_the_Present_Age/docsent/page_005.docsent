   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE EDIFIED AND PERFECTED UNDER DORA YU</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After being saved, Watchman Nee had a strong desire to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although still in high school, he longed to be trained by Dora Yu in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His mother agreed, and Dora Yu accepted him into her Bible school.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, because he had certain habits of which she did not approve, such as sleeping late, Dora Yu decided not to keep him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On one occasion she sent him to deliver mail to the downtown post office in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because of the long distance and the poor condition of the road, it took him longer than she expected.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She assumed that he had gone to some amusement, which was actually not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But she dismissed him, and he returned home and finished his two years of college.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His Personal Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Given at Kulangsu, Fukien, October 18, 1936</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After being saved, I continued on in school, though I had little interest in books.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Others read novels in class, but I diligently studied the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later, desiring to pursue spiritual things further, I left school and entered Dora Yu's Bible Institute in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, before long she politely dismissed me, and I returned home.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The reason she gave for her action was that it was inconvenient for me to stay there any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I realized that my flesh had not been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I was still fond of good food and fine clothing, and I enjoyed sleeping until eight o'clock in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Dora Yu felt I was good material for the Lord's interest and had good prospects, but when she discovered my laziness, she sent me home.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At that time I was thoroughly disappointed and felt my future was doomed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At that time I even questioned my salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But surely I was saved!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I even considered that I was quite good and that I had been transformed in many ways, not realizing that there was much yet to be learned and much to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Confident that the Lord had saved me and called me, I could not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I admitted that I was not yet good enough, but I felt that with the passing of more time I would improve.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since the time was not ripe for me to continue my spiritual pursuits, I decided to return to school.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When my schoolmates saw me, they recognized that I had changed, but I had not changed thoroughly, for I still occasionally lost my temper and did some things wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There were times when I seemed very much like a saved person, but at other times I seemed very much like an unsaved person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
