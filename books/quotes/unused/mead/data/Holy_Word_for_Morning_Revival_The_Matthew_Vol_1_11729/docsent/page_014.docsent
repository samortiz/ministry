   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 2 DAY 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 4:1-10</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2 And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He became hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3 And the tempter came and said to Him, If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves of bread.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>4 But He answered and said, It is written, "Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>5 Then the devil took Him into the holy city and set Him on the wing of the temple,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>6 And said to Him, If You are the Son of God, cast Yourself down; for it is written, "His angels shall bear You up, lest You strike Your foot against a stone."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>7 Jesus said to him, Again, it is written, "You shall not test the Lord your God."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>8 Again, the devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>9 And he said to Him, All these will I give You if You will fall down and worship me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>10 Then Jesus said to him, Go away, Satan!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For it is written, "You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now we come to the testing of the newly appointed King 4:1-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 2 says the Lord fasted forty days and forty nights, a time of testing and suffering Deut 9:9, 18; 1 Kings 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first test was in the matter of human living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jesus was physically hungry, and the tempter came to Him and said, "If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves of bread" v. 3 . To this proposal the Lord replied, "Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God" v. 4 . This word reveals that while the Lord Jesus was fasting, He was eating.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Physically He was fasting, but spiritually He was eating.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here we see an important principle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Lord's ministry and economy, if we do not know how to lower our physical demands and take care of the spiritual demand, we are not qualified for His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A good living, good food, good clothing, and proper housing are all secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eating spiritual food is primary.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this first temptation the tempter tempted the new King to take His position as the Son of God v. 3 . But He answered with the Word of the Scriptures, "Man," indicating that He stood in the position of man to deal with the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Defeated in the matter of human living, the devil turned his second temptation to religion, tempting the new King to demonstrate that He is the Son of God from the wing of the temple vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>5-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Any thought of doing things miraculously in religion is a temptation of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we would defeat the enemy, we must be a nobody.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Never do anything to prove that you are somebody or something.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because the Lord Jesus defeated him the first time by quoting the Scriptures, the tempter imitated His way and in his second temptation tempted Him by also quoting the Scriptures, however in a subtle way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To quote the Scriptures concerning something in one aspect requires us to take care of the other aspect as well, in order to be safeguarded from the deception of the tempter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This was what the new King did here to counter the tempter's second temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many times we need to tell the tempter, "Again, it is written" v. 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The third test was in the realm of the glory of this world vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>8-9 , which is a matter of worldly glory, promotion, ambition, position, and a promising future.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Behind every ambition there is a hidden idol.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For this reason, the apostle said that covetousness is idolatry Col 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The new King rebuked the devil's presentation and defeated him by standing on the ground of man to worship and serve God only Matt 4:10 .</S>
