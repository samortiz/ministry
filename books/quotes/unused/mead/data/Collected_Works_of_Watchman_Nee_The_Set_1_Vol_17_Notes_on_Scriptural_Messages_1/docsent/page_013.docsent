   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SALVATION OF THE SOUL 2 Transcript of Lord's Day Meeting in Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>on July 19, 1930</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Issue No. 7 MATTHEW 10:34-39</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 34: "Do not think that I come to bring peace on the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why did the Lord say this?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was because people held the concept that He came to bring peace to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To counter such a thought, He told them clearly, "I have not come to bring peace."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Later we shall see that "peace" here refers not to the absence of war but to a situation in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"I have not come to bring peace, but a sword."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The sword here does not refer to a sword used in battle; neither does it refer to causing warfare on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the original text, it means to cast a sword to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many people do recognize this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Luke 2:35, Simeon said to Mary, "And a sword will pierce through your own soul also."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word "sword" here signifies that we will not be happy throughout our entire lifetime and that something like a sword will pierce through our hearts and cause us to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What the Lord meant is that He came not for our blessing but to cause us hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 35: "For I have come to set men at variance: a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This verse begins with the word "for."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This indicates that this verse explains the last verse; that is, it explains what it means "to bring...a sword."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Initially, there was a sweet relationship between father and son; now, there is alienation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The daughter is against the mother, and the daughter-in-law is against the mother-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 36: "And a man's enemies will be those of his household."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are enemies and there is bitterness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The loved ones within one's family have turned against him and have hurt him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Within the family there is enmity and malice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 37: "He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Not worthy" is mentioned twice in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Have you ever wondered why one should love the Lord above his parents and children?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you love just one person in this whole world more than you love the Lord, you cannot be His disciple.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You can only be His disciple on the condition that you love Him wholly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the condition for becoming the Lord's disciple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You cannot love equally the Lord and men at the same time; this is not possible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 38: "And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This verse sums up what has been said before this is a cross!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is it to take the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord did not say, "He who does not take up his burden and follow after Me is not worthy of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He said, "He who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A burden is not a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Burdens are unavoidable; taking the cross is optional.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How the first cross was, so will the hundreds and thousands of crosses thereafter be.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Just as the first cross was the Lord's choosing, the crosses should be something that we choose.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some people think that when they are in difficulties or in want, they are bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, this is not so because even if they were not believers, situations like these may naturally happen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every cross must be of our own choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, we must be careful that we do not create a cross for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We ought to take the cross, not make a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is a fallacy to regard everything which befalls us as a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is just as wrong to create a cross by producing our own suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>None of these are bearing the cross in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What then is the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It must correspond to what the Lord Jesus said, "My Father,...Your will be done" Matt 26:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord asked the Father to not do according to what the Son wills but according to what the Father wills; this is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To take the cross is to choose the Father's will.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Let me say an honest word: if we do not choose the cross daily, there will be no cross for us to take.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the Lord were to wait for the cross to come to Him before He would bear it, how could a cross go to Him in heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord chose the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He "emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord said, "No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again" John 10:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Accordingly, our cross must also be out of our own choice.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Concerning the necessities of life, we also have a choice.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We can choose what to wear, what to eat, and how to dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, we should seek these things only to the extent of meeting our physical needs.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If our emotion expects to derive pleasure and satisfaction from these necessities, we are not taking the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We cannot impose on others what sort of dress to wear, what kind of food to eat, or what type of house to live in. Nevertheless, whoever intends to be satisfied through these things is not bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>No one dares to say what one should or should not have, but everyone should ask himself whether or not his clothing, food, and shelter are, in fact, affording him soul pleasure and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Anything that is for the supply of our needs, God sanctions.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Clothing, food, and shelter are all necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Even the Old Testament shows us how God provided for the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He was mindful of their needs, yet He never intended that His children should indulge in those things.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we indulge ourselves in the matters of clothing, food and shelter, we are not taking the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Too often people dress and eat not to protect their body, or to fill their hunger, but for sheer pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Indeed, our physical needs must be met.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But we should not gratify our emotion and its demands in the least.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Does God really interfere with man's clothing, eating, dwelling, and all his dealings?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Yes, He does.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>And this constitutes the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Let us cite an example.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When Adam was in the garden of Eden, whatever he needed was supplied to him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He could freely eat of every tree, but he was not to eat of one tree, that is, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If one were to eat of that tree, not because he wanted to satisfy his need, but because the fruits were pleasant to the sight, good for food, and enabled one to know good and evil, that would be a lust.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>God allows whatever is within the bounds of the necessities of our human living and nothing more.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Clothing, food, shelter, and all such things of the world must be for the purpose of supplying our needs, not for gratifying our lust!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Regarding these matters, we should live absolutely according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we do not, we may ill-treat our own bodies according to the self-will of our flesh and may esteem ourselves holier than others when, in fact, we are practicing the doctrine of asceticism mentioned in Colossians 2, which is "not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh" v. 23 . At the same time, we should remember that God has not allowed us to indulge in the things of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Verse 39: "He who finds his soul-life shall lose it, and he who loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This verse concludes this portion of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>What is it to take the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It is to lose the soul-life for the Lord's sake and to be in sorrow and distress for the Lord's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Those who refuse to be sorrowful and do not restrain their emotions, choosing rather to gratify their souls, will lose their soul-lives.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>To lose the soul-life for the Lord's sake is to deny the soul its satisfaction, requests, and desires.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If, on account of the Lord, we choose not to pursue the things which we naturally enjoy and the things which we earnestly desire, we are losing our soul-life for the Lord's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The meaning of gaining the soul-life today must be the same as the meaning of gaining the soul-life in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Likewise, the meaning of losing the soul-life today must be the same as the meaning of losing the soul-life in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The meaning in both cases must be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>To lose the soul-life for the Lord's sake means not allowing the soul to have satisfaction and enjoyment in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>To lose the soul-life in the coming age means that the soul will not find satisfaction and enjoyment in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In that day, there shall be a kind of people whose soul-life will be satisfied and another kind whose soul-life will not be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Whoever has satisfied his soul-life in this age and has had all things his way, having taken a supply in excess of his needs and having enjoyed a great many things, will not find anything in the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Whoever loses all these things in this age for the Lord's sake will be satisfied by God in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Everyone who overcomes the world will definitely have satisfaction in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The salvation of the spirit is determined at the time we believed on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The salvation of the soul is determined by how we walk in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If you dress, eat, make friends, and do everything the way you like, I will tell you by the Lord's authority that you will have no share of the glory in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The Gospel of Luke says, "Blessed are those who weep now...Woe to you who are satiated now" Luke 6:21, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Why is it woe to those who are full?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>It is because they have already been filled.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Why are those who weep now blessed?</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>It is because they shall be filled in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Herein lies the distinction between woe and blessing.</S>
