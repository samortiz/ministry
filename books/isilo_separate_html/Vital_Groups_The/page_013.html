Speaking the Words of God</H2><P>Christ speaks the words of God for the dispensing of the Spirit without measure (John 3:34). Our speaking must be followed by the Spirit for dispensing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Ministering Spirit and Life</H2><P>His words spoken by Him and received by His believers minister spirit and life (John 6:63). When God's words spoken by us are received into others' spirits, they become spirit and life to them. Christ's multiplication spreads God through His speaking and our speaking. His speaking and our speaking should be the same. They should be followed by the Spirit. Christ is the Word of God, and we are the members of Christ. Therefore, we are members of the Word of God. As such we must be the oracle of God, the speaking ones, to spread God for the multiplication and increase of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE BROTHERS OF CHRIST</H2><P>The constituents of the vital groups are also the brothers of Christ. Romans 8:29 says that Christ is the Firstborn among many brothers. In John 20:17 the resurrected Christ told Mary, "Go to My brothers." Before His resurrection Christ never called His disciples His brothers. But in resurrection He recognized that all of His disciples were His brothers. He is the firstborn Son of God and we are the many sons of God, His many brothers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Speaking in the Son</H2><P>In His New Testament economy, the speaking God speaks in the Son (Heb. 1:2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Divine Sonship of Glory Being Corporate</H2><P>The divine sonship of glory is a corporate matter. Romans 8:15 and 23 speak of the sonship. Then John 17:22 gives us the definition of the sonship. The sonship is the divine right to express God in His life and nature for His glory. The divine sonship of glory is corporate, consisting of Christ as the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29) and His believers as the many sons of God (Heb. 2:10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Many Sons of God Being Members of the Word of God to Be God's Oracle</H2><P>As the firstborn Son of God being the Word of God (John 1:1) is God's oracle for the speaking and dispensing of God to carry out His eternal economy, so the many sons of God being members of the Word of God are God's oracle speaking and dispensing God for the spreading of God and the increase of Christ. The firstborn Son of God is the oracle of God, and we are the many sons. This means that all the sons are God's oracle so that God may have a spread and Christ may have an increase.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE PROPHETS OF GOD</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Ones Who Speak God, Speak for God, and Speak Forth God</H2><P>The constituents of the vital groups are also the prophets of God (1 Cor. 14:1, 31). Since all the sons of God are God's oracle, they become God's prophets, the ones who speak God, speak for God, and speak forth God. A prophet is a speaking one. The Greek word for prophesy means to speak for or speak forth.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> </body></html>
