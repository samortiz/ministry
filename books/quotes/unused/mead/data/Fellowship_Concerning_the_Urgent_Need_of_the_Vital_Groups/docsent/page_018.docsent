   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Principles for Grouping the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In grouping the saints together, we do not need to legally follow a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We can group the saints together according to the Spirit and according to the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In certain instances it may be more convenient to group the saints by geography.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, in some situations that way may not yield the best result.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It may be better to group people according to the situation, taking into account factors such as geography, age, status, character, and spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In some situations grouping the young ones together with the old ones may not be a help to the young ones, but in other instances grouping the young ones with certain elderly saints will make the young ones more living.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It would not be good to group seven people of weak character together, nor would it be good to group too many people of strong character together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In grouping the saints, the elders need to study the situation of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In forming the groups, all preferences should be annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to our past experience, some of the saints have a strong preference to be together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, we need to realize that a particular group may stay together for only six months.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After six months the groups should increase to the point that they need to divide into two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, we should forget our personal preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In some cases if a husband and wife are put in different groups, they will be made alive and they will be more able to help others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to put all these matters into our consideration, and we need to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In a certain sense, in the church life the husbands and wives are not couples but are individual members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to be coordinated not according to the natural relationship but according to the membership in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At home the husbands and wives are couples, but in the church they are individual members, irrespective of their marital status.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In our homes we enjoy our married life, but when we come to the church, we are all members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the church we enjoy the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This should be the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Otherwise, the groups will not be prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is better if the Caucasians are grouped with other Caucasians.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those of the other races can also be grouped together according to race and language.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In addition, we can have a general English-speaking group, including those from different races who can speak English well.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As much as possible it may be better to keep the Caucasians separate and particular to serve the purpose of gaining Caucasians.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Relationship of the Vital Groups</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>with the Present Church Life</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must be clear that the vital group meetings should not interfere with the present church life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We still respect and honor the present church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If possible those in the vital groups should attend the church meetings, mainly the Lord s table and the prophesying meetings on the Lord s Day morning, and the prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, it may not be practical for those in the vital groups to attend the existing group meetings, because they will be meeting at least once a week in the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE TRAINING FOR THE VITAL GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who attend the training meetings for the vital groups must be punctual.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, when they come to the meeting, they must pray audibly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They should not come in to the meeting and sit and be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We will have much prayer; this is our real need.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nothing in our Christian life can touch our life, open our eyes, and usher us into the reality of what Christ is more than prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Among us we are not short of the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, the thing that troubles me continually is our shortage of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the training meetings every member must function to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The third requirement on the trainees is that each one must speak in the training meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After four months of training concerning the group meetings, every group will be ready to act.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every group will be a small army.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The first thing we need to do is to go out and gain new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Without new ones, we have no one to work on.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This time we will not get the new ones in a quick way, and we will not baptize them in a quick way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As I mentioned in a previous message, every Lord s Day the groups may come together to have a separate Lord s Day meeting at a time different from that of the regular church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>During those meetings we can baptize the new ones in the church s baptistry.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This will make the baptism of the new ones somewhat stately and full of spiritual weight.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After the baptism, we can have the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our success in having a definite beginning in the practice of the vital groups depends on our faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to be faithful to coordinate with the Lord in order to match the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then the Lord will have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If in all the churches a good number of the saints will be trained to take this way and to move in a trained way, surely we will gain the adequate increase.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Concluding prayer: Lord, thank You that we can match You in Your move.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Lord, do grant us the rich blessing, and send the rain that we need.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are going to till the ground and sow the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Surely, we need Your rain, the latter rain and the former rain, at the proper time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Amen.</S>
