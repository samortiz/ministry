   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RESULT OF EATING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we eat Christ, He as the Spirit comes into us and operates in a number of ways.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ Revealed in Us</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, the Spirit reveals Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Galatians 1:16 includes the phrase to reveal His Son in me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more we are filled with the Holy Spirit, the more we will sense the presence of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ dwells within us, but it is because the Holy Spirit is within us that we know this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Radio waves bring messages to us which we receive and play on the radio.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As long as we have the radio waves, we have the message, because the radio waves contain the message and bring it to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The radio waves in this example signify the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With the Holy Spirit there is the presence of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As long as we have the Holy Spirit indwelling us, we have the presence of Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, the Holy Spirit reveals Christ to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our experience confirms that whenever we are filled with the Holy Spirit, we feel Christ s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not only so, the more we are filled with the Holy Spirit, the more we sense the glorious presence of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is because the Holy Spirit reveals Christ in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ Living in Us</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second, Christ lives in us as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Spirit indwells us, Christ lives in us, for Christ is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Galatians 2:20 tells us that Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This Christ lives in us to be our life Col 3:4 that we may live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because we are regenerated, we possess two different kinds of lives the natural life and Christ Himself as life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since Christ is life to us and lives within us, we must daily live by Christ and not by the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ Being Formed in Us</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Third, the Spirit works within us so that Christ is formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Galatians 4:19 Paul writes, My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can use the example of an egg to understand what is meant by the word formed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we place a fertilized egg in an incubator and observe the egg day by day by holding it up to the light, over a period of time we will see a chick form within the egg.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At our regeneration, Christ came into us as a seed 1 Pet 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now He needs to be formed within us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not enough that Christ has been revealed in us and now lives within us He must be formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For Christ to be formed in us means that He becomes everything to our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Christ is formed within us, our whole soul mind, emotion, and will is full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is why 1 Corinthians 2:16 says that we have the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a mind that Christ fills until it is full of Him, a mind in which Christ is formed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many times we can tell just by the way a person thinks that his mind is full of Christ and that Christ occupies his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is the same with the emotion and the will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When Christ occupies the emotion of a person, whatever he loves is what Christ loves.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Likewise, whatever a man who has Christ formed within him chooses or decides, we sense that with him is the presence of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ Making His Home in Our Hearts</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ being formed in us is very much related to Christ making His home in our hearts Eph 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our heart is a composition of the three parts of our soul the mind, emotion, and will plus one part of our spirit, the conscience Matt 9:4; John 16:22; Acts 11:23; Heb 10:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For Christ to make His home in our heart simply means that Christ occupies all the parts of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not enough for us to declare how glorious it is that we are in Christ and how sweet it is that Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to realize that Christ wants to make His home in every part of our heart; this will give Him the ground to occupy our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The simple way to give the Lord the ground to make His home in our hearts is to deny ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Matthew 16:24-25 the Lord Jesus says, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To deny the self means to lose the soul-life, that is, the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The terms self, soul, natural man, and old man are, for the most part, synonymous in that they all relate to one thing the old life, the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to deny our soul-life; that is, we have to deny our natural mind, natural emotion, and natural will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we deny the self, that is, the soul-life, and put it to death, we will give Christ the ground to take over and possess our mind, emotion, and will and thereby make His home in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At that point, all the parts of our heart will be full of Christ, and we will have the mind, emotion, and will of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To deny the natural life of the mind, emotion, and will and let Christ occupy all the parts of our being is to live by Christ, take Christ as our life, let Christ live in us, and take Christ as everything in a very practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is easy to say that we are in Christ, that Christ is in us, and that Christ is everything to us, but we need to experience these things in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we are in the midst of thinking, we must reject our natural mind.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we love something or someone, we must give up the natural emotion and deny the self.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we make choices, we must deny the self and reject our natural will.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In all the parts of our heart, we need to give Christ the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Unless we deny the self, bear the cross, and put our natural life to death, it will be impossible for us to live by Christ and take Him as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The way to take Christ as our life in a practical way is to reject the natural mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I ask you to practice this matter day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When you think about a certain thing, remember that you are a Christian and have Christ living in you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As such, you must deny your self and reject your natural mind.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By doing this, you yield your mind to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When you love something or someone, remember that you have Christ living in you, and deny your self, rejecting your natural emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To do this is to yield your emotion to Christ and let Him occupy it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must do the same in regard to the natural will.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to reject our self and let Christ occupy our entire being, thereby allowing Him to make His home in our hearts completely.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Christ is real, living, and active.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This active One is in you, waiting to occupy your whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But He can do this only if you give Him the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you give Him the ground, He will take it and occupy it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As a result, you will experience Him as life moment by moment, He will be gradually formed in you, and you will be conformed to the image of Christ.</S>
