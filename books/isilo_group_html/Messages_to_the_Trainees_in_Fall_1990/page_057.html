Our Dwelling Place</H2><P>Christ is also our dwelling place, our abode (John 15:7a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Our Enjoyment and Rest</H2><P>Christ is our enjoyment and rest (Col. 2:16-17; Matt. 11:28). According to Colossians 2:16-17, He is our food, our drink, our feast, our new moon, and our Sabbath. He is the body of all the shadows, the reality of every positive thing in the universe for our enjoyment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Divine Provision</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Power</H2><P>As the divine provision, Christ is God's power to us (1 Cor. 1:24a) for carrying out and accomplishing what He has planned and purposed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Wisdom</H2><P>Christ is also wisdom to us from God (1 Cor. 1:24b; 30b). Day by day we need Christ to be wisdom to us. Christ as wisdom should unceasingly flow from God to us to be our present and practical wisdom in our experience.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Righteousness</H2><P>Christ is our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30b). He is the righteousness by which we have been justified by God so that we may be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life. Furthermore, as our subjective righteousness, Christ is the One dwelling in us to live for us a life that can be justified by God and that is always acceptable to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Sanctification</H2><P>Christ Himself is our sanctification (1 Cor. 1:30b). This means that Christ is the element that produces transformation. Apart from Him we cannot have the element that, when added to our being, produces a metabolic change.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Redemption</H2><P>According to 1 Corinthians 1:30, Christ is even our redemption, that is, the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23). As the One who is our redemption, Christ "will transfigure the body of our humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory" (Phil. 3:21).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_056.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_058.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages to the Trainees in Fall 1990 &nbsp; pg 57</div><br></body></html>
