   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CHURCH Scripture reading: 2 Timothy 2:19-21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After seeing something of the church ground, we must go on to see the fellowship of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Fellowship is based upon oneness, and fellowship is equal to oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Oneness includes and covers all the saints, regardless of the background from which they come.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>ONE IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today there are many different backgrounds of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some have a Presbyterian background, some a Baptist background, and some have other kinds of background.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But regardless of the background, if they are saved, they all have the same faith, for they all believe in the same Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They all have been redeemed by the same blood; therefore, they all have the same life within.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all are one in this all-comprehensive faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Fellowship is based upon this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have fellowship with one another because we all have the same divine life, we all have the same Lord, and we all have the same redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not ask what kind of baptism others have had.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not talk about all those doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As long as they are saints who are not sinful according to 1Corinthians 5, we must recognize all of them as dear brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We believe in the Lord Jesus, and they do also.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have the same divine life as they.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have been redeemed by the blood of Christ, and they also have been redeemed by His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may be quite different from other Christians in background and in many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They may not believe in partial rapture, and we may be for it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But regardless in which kind of rapture we believe, as long as we believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of God, who was incarnated as a man, died on the cross for our sins, and resurrected from the dead, we are all redeemed, justified, regenerated and saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And we all have the divine life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, we are all of one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is based upon this that we have fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may speak somewhat regarding certain things, but we must not go too far, and we must not argue.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must base our fellowship only on the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE BASIS OF FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the problem is this: if one believes in a certain kind of rapture, he will try day and night to convince others of this doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If some speak in tongues, we should not say anything to criticize them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Though they speak in tongues and we do not, we are still brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Tongues should not divide us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may differ in the matter of tongues, but we are the same in life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are all born of the same Father; so we must be one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not look down upon them for speaking in tongues, and they should not look down upon us for not speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But this is the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Could we receive grace from the Lord to be so general in our attitude?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must all realize that they are our brothers regardless of how much they differ from us in certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must love them because we are the same as they are in redemption and in life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the basis and ground of our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may even take the unique ground of the church while others do not.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But regardless even of this, we still can have fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, this really requires grace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must say, "Lord, by Your grace and mercy, I do not care for all the differences.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I simply care for You.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I only care for Your redemption and Your life nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Regardless of how much this brother differs from me, I still love him."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Of course, we cannot go along with any divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But that should not hinder our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Regardless of whether others are in the divisions or not, we must recognize that they are our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This does not mean that we go along with their divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No, we cannot do this, but we must love all the saints, even those in the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There are some real believers in the Roman Catholic Church, and they all have the same divine life as we.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They may wear their clerical robes, but in redemption and in life we are all the same.</S>
