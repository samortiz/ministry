<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Eating It with Unleavened Bread<br>and Bitter Herbs, Leaving None of It until<br>the Next Morning, and Not Breaking a Bone of It</H2><P>"They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break a bone of it; according to all the statute for the passover they shall keep it" (vv. 11b-12). Here we see that the children of Israel were to eat the Passover with unleavened bread. Unleavened bread signifies the Christ who is without sin. Whenever we receive Christ as our life supply, we receive a life that is without sin. Thus, to eat the Passover with unleavened bread means to eliminate all sinful things. When we enjoy Christ as our Passover, we must purge away everything sinful.</P><P>The Passover was also to be eaten with bitter herbs. The bitter herbs signify regret and repentance with a bitter sense regarding sins. To eat the Passover with bitter herbs means that we need to regret and repent, to experience a bitter taste regarding sinful things.</P><P>None of the Passover was to be left until the next morning. This indicates that we should enjoy the Passover in its freshness. This also indicates that we are to receive Christ in a full way, not partially. Instead of allowing anything of Christ to be left over, we should take Him in full.</P><P>Furthermore, the people were not permitted to break a bone of the Passover lamb. The unbroken bone indicates that Christ's divine life is unbreakable. When the Lord Jesus was crucified as our Passover lamb, His legs were not broken (John 19:33, 36). This signifies that in Christ, the Passover lamb, there is something unbreakable and indestructible. This unbreakable and indestructible element is His eternal life. In Christ as our Passover lamb there is the divine life, the eternal life, the unbreakable and indestructible life, that can impart life into us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Man Who Was Clean and Not on a Journey<br>Not Refraining from Keeping the Passover</H2><P>"The man who is clean and is not on a journey, yet refrains from keeping the passover, that person shall be cut off from his people, because he did not offer Jehovah's offering at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin" (Num. 9:13). This signifies that the redeemed believers are required to take the Lord's table (Luke 22:19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. A Stranger Being Permitted<br>to Keep the Passover with the Sons of Israel</H2><P>"If a stranger sojourns among you and will keep the passover to Jehovah, according to the statute of the passover and according to its ordinance, so shall he do; you shall have one statute, both for the sojourner and for him who was born in the land" (Num. 9:14). A stranger being permitted to keep the Passover with the sons of Israel signifies that the believing Gentiles have been destined to partake of the Lord's table.</P>
