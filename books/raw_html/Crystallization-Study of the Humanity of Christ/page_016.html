<P>In the previous message we saw that there is a difference between Christ as the man and as the Son of Man. The man is simple with no relationships or involvements. When Christ came to visit Abraham, He was a man in humanity, without any involvements. When He came to wrestle with Jacob, He was simply a man without any involvements. But Christ as the Son of Man coming to seek and save sinners is full of involvements. Psalm 80:17 uses both of these terms for Christ. On the one hand, Christ was the man; on the other hand, Christ was the Son of Man. As the Son of Man in His humanity, He was one with the children of Israel.</P><P>In the previous three messages we have seen the humanity of Christ in the prophecy concerning the eternal economy of God in the Old Testament. In the following set of three messages we want to see the humanity of Christ in the fulfillment of God's eternal economy in the New Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE FLESH</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Christ as the Very God Becoming Flesh</H2><P>John 1:1 and 14 reveal that Christ as the very God became flesh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Be a Man with the Human Nature</H2><P>Christ became a man partaking of human blood and flesh with the human nature (Heb. 2:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. In the Likeness of the Flesh of Sin</H2><P>Romans 8:3 says that God sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin. Christ did not become sinful flesh but came in the likeness of the flesh of sin. According to John 3:14 He was the reality of the bronze serpent lifted up by Moses in the wilderness (Num. 21:4-9). The bronze serpent had the form of the serpent but was without the serpent's poison. In the same way, Christ was made in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He did not participate in any way in the sin of the flesh (2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Tabernacling among Men</H2><P>As the very God who became flesh, Christ was the real tabernacle. The tabernacle was God's dwelling place on this earth among men. The incarnated Christ became God's dwelling place among men, the tabernacle of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Full of Glory</H2><P>The incarnated Christ was full of the glory of the only begotten Son of God.</P>
