   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>H. The Ancient Serpent</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The ancient serpent is the subtle, deceiving one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whenever the Bible speaks of the serpent, it denotes the subtle one Gen 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By the time of Revelation 12, the serpent is not new; he is ancient, being close to six thousand years old.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I. The Devil</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 9 says that the great red dragon is called the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Greek word for Devil is diabolos, meaning accuser, slanderer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Devil accuses us before God and slanders us before men.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Devil accused Job Job 1:9; 2:4-5 and Joshua Zech 3:1-2 and is now accusing the believers before God, even day and night v. 10 . The Devil not only accuses us to God, but he also slanders God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the Devil goes to God, he accuses us before God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But when the Devil comes to us, he slanders God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not think that his slander is apparent, for often he slanders God in a subtle way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, he may slander God by raising within you the question, Why does God do this to me?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This questioning is a form of slander.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Something in you may ask why God treats you in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not think that this issues from you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No, it is the speaking of the Devil in you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Any question about the word of God in the Bible is also a slander.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you take a small slander, the Devil will give you a greater one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then you would say God probably is not faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What slander this is!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The significance of the title Devil is that he is the accuser and the slanderer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>J. Satan</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The great dragon is also called Satan 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Greek, the word Satan means adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Satan is not only God s enemy outside of God s kingdom, but also God s adversary rebelling against God from within God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The enemy denotes the foe outside of God s realm; the adversary denotes the foe within God s realm.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Satan was once within God s realm; he was not an outsider.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, he was and still is the adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Where is this adversary?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is inside of you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is not only the outside enemy, but also the inside adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is easy to defend yourself against an enemy, but it is difficult to defend yourself against an adversary because he is within you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The adversary is in your house.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You need to realize that this adversary is inside of you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many times he will pretend to be you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not realizing that it is he, you may think that it is you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Often when you are wrong, you should not blame yourself that much.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, you should say, Satan, you must bear the blame because this is not I, but you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Dare you say this to Satan?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You may not be bold to say this because you have been deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before 1936, I was deceived for over eleven years.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When filthy thoughts entered my mind, I confessed them, telling the Lord how bad I was and asking Him to forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But the more I confessed, the more these unclean thoughts came in. One day, in 1936, I saw that I was being cheated.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These thoughts were not mine; they were the thoughts of the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From that time onward, I have not confessed these things anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Instead, I say, Satan, take this away.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I refuse to be cheated by you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is not my thought; it is yours.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now get rid of it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Satan, you must be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not be kind to Satan and do not be cheated by him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Be bold to speak this way to him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Satan is within you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because of this, he pretends to be you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, you must say to him, Satan, this is not I it is you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I don t care whether you are outside of me or inside of me you are you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You are the adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Learn to say this to him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not be cheated into believing that you are that bad.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Satan, not you, is the bad one.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Before we repented, we did not admit that we were bad.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Rather, we were arrogant, saying, I m not sinful I m perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But after we repented, were saved, and received grace, the adversary subtly came to us, causing us to think that we were so dirty and so bad.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>That is the thought of the adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For many years, I did not know the difference between the enemy and the adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As the adversary, Satan is even in the church pretending to be something that he is not.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In Matthew 16:22 we see that Peter was cheated.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Peter thought that he was speaking, but actually it was Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord exposed the adversary, saying, Get behind Me, Satan Matt 16:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Likewise, in our experience, many times it is not we who do certain things; it is Satan, the adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>K. The Deceiver</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>of the Whole Inhabited Earth</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Verse 9 says that the great dragon, who is called the Devil and Satan, deceives the whole inhabited earth.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>No one is an exception; everyone has been cheated by him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Everyone on earth, from the highest to the lowest and from the greatest to the least, is being deceived by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we would know who the great dragon is, we must know all these aspects regarding him.</S>
