[1]  From the beginning of the Lord s recovery in Los Angeles until now, the church service has never been adequately built up among us.
[2]  Although our church service has gone through a number of changes, not that much has been built up.
[3]  What do we mean when we say the church service?
[4]  To say that the church service refers to ministering Christ for the building up of the Body is very good, but it is too spiritual.
[5]  The Lord has given some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ Eph 4:11-12 .
[6]  Although we may say that the church service is to take care of the needy saints and care for the needs of the church, this is too general.
[7]  Even in our neighborhood there must be a children s meeting that should not be considered as the children s meeting of the church.
[8]  The Lord has definitely and clearly shown us in these days that our New Testament service in the church must be a kind of priesthood of the gospel.
[9]  Prayer: Lord, we pray for the service of the church that all of the saints might be stirred up.
[10]  Lord, do open to us and give us the mercy and the grace that we need for the present way.
[11]  How much we need Your grace that we may have a prayer life to pray for Your interests on this earth and for the increase and spread of Your church.
[12]  Then we can bring them to the small group meetings and the church meetings to instruct them and lead them to do the same thing we do.
[13]  We must all realize that a proper Christian life is a life of handling the gospel to produce the members of Christ.
[14]  We must continue to feed them, perfect them, edify them, and build them up.
[15]  According to our physical life, if we do not have children, we become miserable, especially when we grow old.
[16]  Third, we must educate and perfect them that they may know how to live the Christian life, function as living members, and do the work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ as the gifted persons do.
[17]  In this chapter we want to continue our practical fellowship concerning the church services.
[18]  As we have realized in earlier chapters, the first step in God s ordained way to serve is to preach the gospel as New Testament priests by visiting people in their homes.
[19]  In the previous chapter we saw the need to carry out our priestly service in a regular and diligent way.
[20]  Although many of us have been faithful in the church life for years and love the Lord, the results of our labor have not been that satisfactory.
[21]  As we are burdened to take the new way, we should consecrate ourselves to the Lord and have a time with the Lord each morning in order to be revived.
[22]  The most crucial step in carrying out the God-ordained way is to have group meetings.
[23]  If we would take care of a group meeting in this way, the church where we are will be a great success.
[24]  CHAPTER TEN BUILDING UP THE GROUP MEETINGS PARTICULARLY AND DEFINITELY
[25]  In the previous messages we have seen that the church service is primarily composed of five main things.
[26]  In addition, we must study the truth and seek after the truth; we must have a thorough knowledge of the Bible.
[27]  Our church service, then, must consist of the gospel, the truth, life, the children s work, and the student work.
[28]  Among us, not one of these basic aspects of church service has adequately been built up because our church practice was too general and too much in tradition.
[29]  We must all pick up a definite burden to be the New Testament priests of the gospel to take the Lord s new way.
[30]  When we begin to practice the Lord s new way, we should not carry it out in a general way.
[31]  If we do mean business with the Lord to take the God-ordained new way, we should practice it regularly and consistently.
[32]  We need to not do too much or too little, but we must have a schedule; we must have a particular schedule.
[33]  It would be very helpful if we would make a definite decision and pray, Lord, for Your new way I offer to You three hours of my time per week, either in the afternoon or evening.
[34]  The elders in the church must especially exercise themselves that the Lord may lead them to pick up a particular part in the church service.
