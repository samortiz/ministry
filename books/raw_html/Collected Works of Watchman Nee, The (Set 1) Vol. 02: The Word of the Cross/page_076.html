<H1 CLASS=MSG>LESSON TWENTY-SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SALVATION</H1><P>Salvation manifests that Christ Jesus is the wisdom of God. The following verses compare the wisdom of men to the wisdom of God. Since the world comes short of God's wisdom concerning salvation (1 Cor. 1:21), salvation must be preached through God's wisdom, Christ. What is salvation? Salvation has three stages:</P>	<ol class="upper-roman">	<li>"Righteousness" (1 Cor. 1:30)<br>	The first stage of salvation is to save people from the punishment of their sins. This was done in the past:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>Freed from the punishment of sins:			<ol class="decimal">			<li>"Save...from their sins" (Matt. 1:21)</li>			<li>"Forgiveness of their sins" (Luke 1:77)</li>			<li>"Forgiveness of offenses" (Eph. 1:7)</li>			<li>"Gave Himself for our sins" (Gal. 1:4)</li>			<li>"Being justified freely" (Rom. 3:24)</li>			<li>"Was accounted to him as righteousness" (Rom. 4:22-25)</li>			</ol></li>		<li>This righteousness is gained by the sinner by believing in Christ:			<ol class="decimal">			<li>"Through faith in Christ" (Phil. 3:9)</li>			<li>"Through His name" (Acts 10:43)</li>			<li>"Through Him" (Rom. 5:9)</li>			<li>"Through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus" (Rom. 3:24-25)</li>			<li>"Accounted to him as righteousness" (Rom. 4:22-25)</li>			</ol></li>		<li>Such faith renders three results:			<ol class="decimal">			<li>Forgiveness of sins</li>			<li>Imputation of righteousness</li>			<li>Freedom from the punishment of sins forever.<br>			A sinner is reconciled to God through faith. "Have peace toward God" (Rom. 5:1)</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	<li>"Sanctification" (1 Cor. 1:30)<br>	The second stage of salvation is to be freed from the power of sin. This is for the present. Sanctification is a definite 	experience for the believers. It is gained through three things:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>New birth, the beginning of victory over sin:			<ol class="decimal">			<li>"Were begotten...of God" (John 1:12-13)</li>			<li>"Born anew" (John 3:3)</li>			<li>"Begotten of God" (1 John 5:1)</li>			<li>"Having been regenerated...through the living and abiding word of God" (1 Pet. 1:23)</li>			<li>"Through the washing of regeneration" (Titus 3:5)</li>			</ol>		Through this same Spirit, we can resist unrighteousness and all the fleshly lusts.</li>		<li>Dying with Him, the accomplishment of victory over the power of sins:			<ol class="decimal">			<li>"Into His death" (Rom. 6:3)</li>			<li>"Grown together with Him in...His death" (Rom. 6:5)</li>			<li>"Has been crucified with Him" (Rom. 6:6-7)</li>			<li>"Have crucified" (Gal. 5:24)</li>			<li>"Reckon" (Rom. 6:11)</li>			<li>"Put to death" (Rom. 8:13)</li>			</ol>		Sin has its power. This power often operates within man. It cannot be washed, repaired, improved or cultured. 				The only way is to put it to death, for if it dies, there will be no more power. Those who are willing to 				apply faith to "reckon" themselves crucified with the Lord (Rom. 6:11) will have the experience of victory 				over sins.</li>		<li>The Holy Spirit, the practice of overcoming sins:			<ol class="decimal">			<li>"The Spirit of God dwells in you" (Rom. 8:9-10, 13)</li>			<li>"The Holy Spirit, whom He poured out upon us" (Titus 3:5-6)</li>			<li>"Led by the Spirit" (Gal. 5:16-18)</li>			<li>"God who operates in you" (Phil. 2:12-13)</li>			<li>"I in him" (John 15:5)</li>			<li>"He who is in you" (1 John 4:4)</li>			</ol>		On the negative side, the believers have died with the Lord Jesus. On the positive side, they should submit to the 		indwelling Spirit in order to be saved from the power of sin. Sin has various temptations and traps. The Holy Spirit 		will apply to the believers what the cross has accomplished and will make them overcome.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Redemption (1 Cor. 1:30)<br>	This is the third stage of salvation. The redemption, which frees us from the presence of sin, will be the future experience 	of the believers. There are three elements in redemption:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>The complete sanctification of the Spirit:			<ol class="decimal">			<li>"Spirit" (1 Thes. 5:23)</li>			<li>"For now is our salvation nearer" (Rom. 13:11)</li>			</ol></li>		<li>The glorification of the body:			<ol class="decimal">			<li>"The day of redemption" (Eph. 4:30)</li>			<li>"Will transfigure" (Phil. 3:20-21)</li>			<li>"We will be like Him" (1 John 3:1-3)</li>			</ol></li>		<li>Partaking of the glory of Christ:			<ol class="decimal">			<li>"Obtaining of the glory" (2 Thes. 2:14)</li>			<li>"Glory...I have given to them" (John 17:22)</li>			<li>The "glory" obtained through sufferings (Rom. 8:17-18)</li>			</ol>		In brief, by the blood of Christ, we are saved from the punishment of sins; by the Spirit of Christ we are freed from 		the power of sin; and by the glory of Christ we are delivered from the presence of sin:			<ol class="decimal">				<ol class="lower-alpha">				<li>Righteousness, by His first coming.</li>				<li>Sanctification, by His present interceding.</li>				<li>Redemption, by His coming again.</li>				<li>Faith is related to the cross and the things in the past.</li>				<li>Love is granted by the Holy Spirit in the present.</li>				<li>The hope of glory will be obtained in the future.<br>				Please notice that the word "appear" occurs three times in Heb. 9:24-28, KJV. Only the Word of God can 				give us wisdom to know the three stages of salvation (2 Tim. 3:14-17).</li>				</ol>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	</ol>
