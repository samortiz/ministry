   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH BEING INDIVISIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church is one universally and also one locally.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The nature of the church is one, and there is only one kind of church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, the church is indivisible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Church as the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not Being Divided</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a physical body is divided, dismembered, it will fall apart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since the church is the Body of Christ, the church cannot be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Church as God s Dwelling Place</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not Being Divided</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church is the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A dwelling place is a house.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a house is divided, it will not be able to stand Mark 3:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, as God s dwelling place, the church cannot be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>REASONS FOR DIVISION</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Deformed Christianity, however, uses many invalid reasons for division, resulting in the current state of confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must realize that the church cannot be divided, and we must also beware of the following reasons for confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Being Divided on the Basis of Spiritual Giants</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lutheran Church took Martin Luther as their basis and divided.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Methodist Church took John Wesley as their basis and divided.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Martin Luther and John Wesley were both greatly used by the Lord, but they should not have become the basis for division.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First Corinthians 1:12-13 and 4:6 explicitly condemn division on the basis of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some believers in the church in Corinth said, I am of Paul, others said, I am of Apollos, and yet others said, I am of Cephas.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that they took spiritual giants as the basis for dividing themselves from others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, even though they were divisive, they had not yet established a church of Paul, a church of Apollos, or a church of Cephas in the way that people today openly put up Lutheran and Methodist signs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since the Holy Spirit condemned the divisiveness in the church in Corinth, will He not even more condemn the denominations today?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Being Divided on the Basis of the Person Who Is</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instrumental to Our Salvation or Edification</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the church in Corinth some probably said they were of Paul because they were saved through Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There were others who probably said they were of Apollos because they had received edification from Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the same as someone saying, I was baptized by Pastor So-and-so; therefore, I belong to his church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the apostle Paul said that we should never consider ourselves as belonging to those who are used by God in order to separate ourselves from others 3:3-8, 21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We belong to only One our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Belonging to those through whom we were saved, by whom we were baptized, or from whom we received edification is condemned by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Being Divided Because of Spiritual Facts</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those in the Pentecostal Church have received the gift of the Holy Spirit; hence, they call themselves the Pentecostal Church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those in the Holiness Church stress holiness; hence, they call themselves the Holiness Church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These denominations use a certain spiritual fact to promote themselves and make this a reason to separate themselves from others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Division on this basis is also not right.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 1 Corinthians 1:12-13, the Holy Spirit not only condemned those who claimed to be of Paul, of Apollos, and of Cephas, but He also condemned those who claimed to be of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is because they separated themselves from others based on the fact that they belonged to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although it is right to belong to Christ, it is not right to make this the basis of division.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, there is no reason that allows us to be divided from other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is, however, nothing we can do if believers decide to divide themselves from us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In such a case, even though there is division, it is not our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Being Divided Because of Differences</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>in Doctrinal Views</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There was a group of believers in northern China who insisted that believers would all be raptured after the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, they became a post-tribulation rapture sect.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There were others who believed in rapture before the tribulation and became a pre-tribulation rapture sect.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These two groups of believers were divided.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some groups insist on keeping the Sabbath, but other believers say that since the Sabbath is of the Old Testament, they should keep the Lord s Day in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Still other groups are divided because of different views concerning immersion and sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then there are some who divide because of different opinions concerning head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even items related to the breaking of bread, such as using a large or small cup, eating wafers or bread, or drinking grape juice or grape wine, are the basis for divisions among believers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Forgive me for saying this there are too many divisions among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the sixty-six books of the Bible there are so many points that can cause contentions.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>May the Lord preserve us that these points would not be reasons for division.</S>
