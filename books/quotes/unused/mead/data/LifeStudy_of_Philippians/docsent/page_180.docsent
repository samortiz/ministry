   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE SIXTY A LIFE FULL OF FORBEARANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BUT WITHOUT ANXIETY 5 Scripture Reading: Phil 4:4-7; 1:18-21; 4:10-13</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have repeatedly emphasized that the book of Philippians is a book on the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To experience Christ we need to live Him that we may magnify Him 1:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then we need to take Him as our pattern and pursue Him as our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In our Christian life we should have the unique mind the mind to pursue Christ and gain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After covering these aspects of the experience of Christ, Paul, somewhat to our surprise, speaks in chapter four of forbearance and anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the positive side, we need forbearance; on the negative side, we should not have any anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why at the conclusion of such a profound book on the experience of Christ does Paul mention forbearance and anxiety?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Apparently there is no connection between the matters covered in chapters one, two, and three and Paul s word about forbearance and anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Years ago, I did not consider it worthwhile for Paul to speak of anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to my concept, he should have continued to speak about higher things, although I was not clear what these higher things should be.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE CIRCUMSTANCES ASSIGNED BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Ephesians 1:3 and 2:6 Paul talks about the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In your experience day by day are you in the heavenlies or in anxiety?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>More often than not, we are in anxiety, not in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After the fall of man, human life became a composition of anxiety and worry.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you read Genesis 3 carefully, you will see that anxiety comes from the environment assigned to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, we have anxiety with respect to our children.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From the moment a child is born, his parents worry about him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who do not have children may dream of having a child one day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But they do not realize the worry and anxiety associated with giving birth to a child and raising him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everything that affects the living of our children gives rise to anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may worry about their breathing, their diet, and their clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Most parents can testify that as far as their children are concerned, their days are filled more with anxiety than with happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Genesis 3 indicates that fallen man is also anxious about making a living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Genesis 3:17 the Lord said to the man, Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 19 the Lord says, In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because man must labor to maintain his existence, he is full of anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every farmer is anxious about his crops.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He worries about the weather and also about damage caused by disease and insects.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually there is not one kind of work which leaves us free from anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even those who are successful in their profession are anxious about their work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Anxiety is unavoidable.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is also a good deal of anxiety related to married life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Young people desire to be married.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Married life is good, but it involves more worry and anxiety than happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I encourage all the young people to get married at the proper time, but they should not expect a married life free from anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Human life is full of anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Angels, however, are not subject to anxiety because they do not have any circumstances to worry about.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They do not marry, and they do not need to be concerned about earning a living or taking care of a family.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not even necessary for angels to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some people make the mistake of trying to live as if they were angels.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But God has ordained all the circumstances of human life, even though these circumstances give rise more to anxiety than to happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It seems that sorrow always lasts longer than happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There may be a short period of happiness and then a much longer time of sorrow, worry, or anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is God s purpose in assigning circumstances to us which cause anxiety?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to Romans 8, in addition to redemption and the indwelling Spirit, we need all things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Verse 28 says, And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to the purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To be sure, included in all things are sufferings, anxieties, and worries.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In order for God to perfect us, sufferings are necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From our experience we know that virtually every matter included in all things involves anxiety.</S>
