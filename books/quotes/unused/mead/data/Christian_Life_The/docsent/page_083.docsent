   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous message, we saw that we need to be those who live and walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we want to see our need to live and walk under the crucifixion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To live and walk by the Spirit is to walk in Christ's resurrection, through His crucifixion, and by the compound Spirit Phil 3:10; 1:19b .</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The objective aspect of Christ's death refers to His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He died for our sins to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In other words, Christ died a vicarious death for us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was the objective aspect He accomplished on the cross apart from us about two thousand years ago in the distant land of Palestine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is also the subjective aspect of the death of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He died with us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>People have different opinions about who actually died on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some unbelieving Jewish scholars would say that a martyr by the name of Jesus died on the cross for his religious teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They would say that he was martyred on the cross by the Jewish religionists through the hands of the Roman government.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Other unbelievers would say that Jesus was a great man with the highest ethics of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to their opinion, such a great, good, and wise man, whose teachings were on the highest plane of human ethics, was killed by his opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Among the believers of Christ, there are also a number of views concerning who died on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many believers of Christ are shallow and superficial, and in their spiritual understanding they are just at the threshold of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They know only that Christ died for them on the cross as their Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To them Christ was not merely a martyr or a good man but a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This understanding is right, but it is only partially right.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word for means that He died a vicarious death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We needed Him to die for us as our Substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As our Savior, He represented us to die for our sins to accomplish redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is right, but this is not a deep understanding of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are to be those who live and walk under the crucifixion of Christ, we need a deeper understanding of Christ's death.</S>
