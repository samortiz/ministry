   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When Jesus was on the earth, everything He did expressed God's love toward men.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you read the life of Jesus, you will find out that He is not only a good man but God from heaven becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We thought that God hated us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But He became a man in order to show us that God is the same as Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was on the earth for thirty-three and a half years; during this time He expressed God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God is the same as Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The way Jesus treated men is the way God treats men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once, a man full of leprosy came to worship Jesus and said, "Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me" Luke 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Jesus very easily could have made him clean by one of His words.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead, He stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed!" v. 13 . A man full of leprosy is unclean and smelly! But the Lord put forth His hand and touched him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He sympathized with this man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He seemed to be saying, "If others are not willing to come to Me, and you are willing, I will touch you."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Another time, a woman caught in adultery was brought to the Lord John 8:3-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the law, such a woman should be stoned to death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus could not say that she did not commit sin, yet He did not want to see her stoned to death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, He said, "He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her" v. 7 . They were all convicted in their own consciences and left one by one, from the oldest to the youngest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then Jesus was left alone, and the woman stood before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What did the Lord say?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He said, "Has no one condemned you?" v. 10 . She said, "No one, Lord." Jesus then said, "Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more" v. 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>O friends!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you have not believed, let me tell you that God does not hate you; rather He loves you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On another occasion, a publican named Matthew invited many publicans and sinners to his house, and he also invited Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At that time the publicans were a very despised kind of people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Jews had lost their country and were under the domination of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For a Jew to work for those who conquered his country and dealt harshly with his own people, was something very despicable.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If it were us, we would not have eaten or drunk with them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But Jesus ate and drank with them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Would you as a college student be willing to sit with such people?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You might think that if a newspaper reporter found out that you were socializing with such people, it would be a big disgrace to you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But in any case, Jesus went.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At that time there was another kind of people called the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When they saw this, they spoke to Jesus' disciples, saying, "Why does your Teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They were debating and criticizing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But how did Jesus reply?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He said, "Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners" Matt 9:10-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Jesus opened up God's heart to men.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some may wonder, "Does God still want me?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am such a terrible sinner."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Others may wonder if God would want persons like themselves because they have robbed others, committed adultery, told lies, and been unclean and filthy sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But Jesus has opened up God's heart and shown us that God wants us and loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is, in effect, saying, "I am like a doctor, and I am not afraid of patients."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Are patients afraid of doctors?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Of course they are not afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some may think that God does not like them and wants them to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But I must tell you that God wants you because He loves you!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Friends, please do one thing today: remove the veils from your eyes so that you can see that God has no evil intentions toward you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He loves you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord Jesus once spoke a parable about the prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When he was a great way off, his father saw him, had compassion on him, ran, fell on his neck, and kissed him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This expresses God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God is calling you home today.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Jesus has died for you, and the Holy Spirit has come.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You do not need to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But if you do not accept the Lord, there is no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I hope you can remember that God is love!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you will say to God, "I am a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I am willing, and I want to accept You," you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then God will rejoice, and you will also rejoice together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God is love!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>From The Collected Works of Watchman Nee, Set 1, Vol. 18, pp.</S>
