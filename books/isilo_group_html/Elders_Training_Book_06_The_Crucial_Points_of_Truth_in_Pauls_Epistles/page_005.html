WHO GIVES LIFE TO THE DEAD AND<br />
CALLS THE THINGS NOT BEING AS BEING</h2>
<p>Romans 4:17 says, &ldquo;(As it is written, I have appointed you a father of many nations,) before the God whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls the things not being as being.&rdquo; Justification by faith is the crucial point in this chapter, but the crucial element is not justification by faith. We are justified by faith in the very God who gives life to the dead and calls the things not being as being. It is this kind of faith by which God justifies us. Usually we understand justification by faith in Jesus Christ, who died for us and who resurrected for us. In Romans 4, however, we see justification by faith in the One who gives life to the dead and who calls not being as being. When we believe in the Lord Jesus we are justified by the very God who gives life and who calls not being as being. When He justifies you, He gives you life and He calls not being as being.</p>
<p>When the very God justifies you, at that time He makes you a new creation. This is to call not being as being. At one time nothing was within you as a new creation. But when God justified you, at that very moment He called not being as being. Now within you there is the new creation. At the same time He gives you the eternal, divine life. If you get into this point with much labor, you will be brought into the central thought of Romans 4. In the past we only saw that when we were justified by God He forgave us of all our sins and reconciled us back to Himself. As a result, we have no more condemnation but peace toward God. We never thought that justification involved the new creation being called into being and the divine life given to us. When we go as a gospel team to a campus to preach the gospel, we need to tell others this wonderful truth. We may say, &ldquo;Today you can be justified by the One that justifies, the Justifier. When He justifies you, He gives you life, and He calls not being as being to make you a new creation.&rdquo; The presentation of such a wonderful truth would be powerful. Such a gospel would be the power to convince many professors on the college campuses. We all have to learn to labor in such a truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN ADAM</h2>
<p>The crucial point in chapter five is &ldquo;in Adam.&rdquo; In Adam we were born sinners, we were constituted sinners, and we inherited sin and death (5:12). The contrast to being in Adam is to be in Christ. In Christ we receive righteousness versus sin and life versus death. In this life we can reign as kings (5:17). These are the main aspects of this crucial point.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>The way we got into Christ was by being baptized into Christ (6:3). This point must be stressed in the gospel. We must tell others: &ldquo;Since you have believed, you must be baptized. When we baptize you in the water, we are actually baptizing you into Christ. You were in Adam and now we are transferring you out of Adam into Christ. Since you are in Christ, you are identified with Christ in His death and in His resurrection. In His death you are out of the sinful flesh and out of the power of sin. In His resurrection you are in newness of life, so you can live a life that is out of the flesh and out of sin and in His resurrection life with its newness.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN THE FLESH</h2>
<p>Romans 7 reveals the bondage in the flesh under the law by the indwelling sin unto death and wretchedness. In the flesh you are sinful because in the flesh you have been sold under sin (7:14). In the flesh sin is your master, sin is your director, sin is your boss. Because you are in the flesh there is no way to get out of sin. This sin masters you, governs you, enslaves you, and eventually kills you (7:11, 17, 20). Your weakness is fully exposed in the flesh. You become a wretched man and this issues in death (7:24).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In Romans 8 is the freedom in the Spirit without law by the indwelling Christ unto life and peace. In the Spirit you are set free from sin and death. In the Spirit you enjoy life because you have the law of the Spirit of life (8:2). This divine life can be enjoyed in all three parts of our being. First, this life is in our spirit (8:10). Then we enjoy this life in our mind (8:6). Finally, we can enjoy this life in our mortal body (8:11). If we walk according to the spirit, the righteous requirements of the law will be fulfilled (8:4) and we will be led as the sons of God (8:14).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 06: The Crucial Points of Truth in Paul's Epistles &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
