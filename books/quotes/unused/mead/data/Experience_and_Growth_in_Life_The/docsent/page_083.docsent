   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE THIRTY THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE 16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message I will give a further conclusion to the fellowship concerning the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This conclusion has two parts that we should remember.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first part is to remember that we now have Christ within us as our Partner all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We no longer live, behave, act, and have our being by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must remember that the Lord is living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The second part is that we must remember what kind of person we are.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>REMEMBERING THAT THE LORD IS WITHIN US</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Christian life is a life of man being mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is a life of two persons being mingled together and living together.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not a matter of living a life by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a Christian you must always keep in mind that you are no longer by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Another One is always with you as a Partner, both in the small things and in the big things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The unbelievers do not have such a One with them in their experience; therefore, they do not understand this kind of language.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As you are in your daily activities, you should realize that another invisible One is with you and indwelling you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sometimes, we do not like the fact that He is dwelling within us because we are not able to do or say things so freely.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we are about to lose our temper, we have to consider Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must consider whether or not He likes to lose the temper with us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have another One living within us, so we must live a life which never neglects, forgets, or disregards Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must learn to always live a life with another Person inside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This should always be our spontaneous experience, but today it is still only our occasional experience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Without remembering that the Lord is within us, we may be free to like or dislike anyone according to our own choice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But when we remember that He is with us, our freedom is greatly reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Marriage reduces our freedom because we have to learn to live with another person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before a brother marries, he is free to exercise his own likes or dislikes and to go wherever he likes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But after he is married, he always has another one with him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Quite often, the husband is frustrated from doing what he likes by his wife, and the wife is also frustrated by the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The husband may want to laugh, but because of his wife, he may not be free to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before marriage, he had no such restrictions or frustrations, but after marriage, he has a lot of restrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Having a wife or husband really restricts our freedom, but our wife or husband can also be a great benefit to us, especially in the way of companionship.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From my youth, I have sought to know how to live the Christian life, how to be holy, and how to be victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have read many Christian publications on this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, I found out that not one of the ways presented in these books was really prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to my own experience, only the way of remembering that He is within us really works.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The problem we have is that we often forget that He is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>During our daily life, we just do not remember that the Lord as another One is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But when we do remember and realize that He is within us, everything is okay.</S>
