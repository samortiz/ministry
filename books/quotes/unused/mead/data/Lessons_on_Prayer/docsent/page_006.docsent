   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PRAYER IS MAN COOPERATING AND CO-WORKING WITH GOD, ALLOWING GOD TO EXPRESS HIMSELF AND HIS DESIRE THROUGH MAN, AND THUS ACCOMPLISH HIS PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If a brother or sister has really learned the secret of prayer covered in the preceding two points, spontaneously there will be the following result: such a praying one will certainly cooperate with God, work together with God, and allow God to express Himself and His desire from within him and through him, ultimately accomplishing God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is according to Romans 8:26 and 27, which tell us that we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Holy Spirit intercedes in us according to God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Actually, we do not know how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We know what people ordinarily call supplication, but we know little about the prayer which is spoken of in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first time I read these two verses in Romans 8, I questioned their meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I was sick, I thought, did I not pray to God asking him to heal me?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When I was in want, did I not pray to God asking Him to send me provision?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How could the Scriptures say that we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Gradually, the Lord showed me that we really do not know anything about the kind of prayer that God desires.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We know those prayers which people generally consider to be prayers but which are below the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not know those prayers that touch God's desire and are up to the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is our weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thank God, in this matter of our weakness, the Spirit Himself joins in to help us and intercede for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brothers, real prayers are the Holy Spirit within man expressing God's desire through man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, real prayers are prayers involving two parties.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are not simply man alone praying to God, but they are the Spirit mingling with man, putting on man, and joining with man in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Outwardly it is man praying, but inwardly it is the Spirit praying.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means two parties express the same prayer at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Please remember that this alone is the prayer which is spoken of in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We often speak of Elijah's prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>James 5:17 says, "Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"Prayed earnestly" in Greek means prayed with prayer, or prayed in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a very peculiar expression in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Please remember, this is what we mean by prayer of two parties.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When Elijah was praying, he was praying with or in a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In other words, he prayed with the prayer of the Spirit within him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus we can say that Elijah's prayer was God praying to Himself in Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Andrew Murray once said that a real prayer is Christ Who indwells us praying to Christ Who is sitting on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That Christ would be praying to Christ Himself sounds strange, but in our experience this is really the case.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us look again at Romans 8:27.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is a clause which says, "the Spirit intercedes according to God."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that the Holy Spirit prays in us according to God; that is, God prays in us through His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, such a prayer certainly expresses God's intention as well as God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By these illustrations we can see that real prayers will certainly cause our being to be wholly mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We will become a person of two parties, i.e. God mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When you pray it is He praying, and when He prays it is also you praying.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When He prays within you, then you express the prayer outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He and you are altogether one, inside and outside; He and you both pray at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At that time you and God cannot be separated, being mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Consequently, you not only cooperate with God but also work together with God that God Himself and His desire may be expressed through you; thus ultimately accomplishing God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the real prayer which is required of us in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, Jude verse 20 says, "praying in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means you should not pray in yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In other words, it means your prayer should be the expression of two parties, you and the Holy Spirit, praying as one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Ephesians 6:18 says, "By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is hard to say that the spirit here refers solely to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All those who read the Bible from an orthodox viewpoint admit that the spirit here does not refer solely to the Holy Spirit; rather, it also includes our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we pray we must pray in such a mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From our fellowship in this chapter we can see that the Bible is God breathing out Himself, while prayer is our breathing in God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Bible reading and prayer are our breathing before God and thus our breathing in of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, we should not be those who only read the Bible and fail to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we only read the Word, we do allow God to breathe out Himself, but we still do not breathe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus we still need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, in our prayer our supplications for people, happenings, and things are but the outer skin, the framework.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Real prayer always matches the Scriptures; it is an exhaling and inhaling before God, causing us and God, God and us, to contact one another and to obtain one another.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Consequently, we wholly cooperate and work with God, and God expresses Himself and His desire through us, ultimately accomplishing His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is a fundamental meaning of prayer in the Bible.</S>
