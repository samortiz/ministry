   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Father gives the Spirit in answer to the Son's request.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is according to the Lord's word in John 14:16: "I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that the Father sends the Spirit at the request of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once again we see that the Spirit's coming is a matter of the coming of the Three of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is indicated by the fact that the Spirit is given by the Father in answer to the request of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We wish to emphasize the fact that when the Spirit comes, the Triune God comes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The reason for this is that the Spirit, the Son, and the Father cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, in our experience of the divine dispensing, the Spirit is the Son, and the Son is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This understanding may be contrary to religious tradition and systematic theology, but it definitely is according to the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I encourage you to study chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John in the light of the ten points we have given concerning the Father, the seventeen points we have given concerning the Son, and the total of eleven points we shall give concerning the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All these points will help you to know the Trinity as revealed in these four chapters of John's Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Proceeding from with the Father</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to John 15:26, the Spirit proceeds from with the Father: "But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The sense in Greek of the word translated "from" is from with.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Spirit of reality is sent by the Son, not only from the Father, but also from with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Comforter comes from the Father and with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Father is the source.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For the Spirit to come from the source does not mean that He leaves the source; it means that the source comes with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Spirit comes, the Father also comes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit cannot be separated, because all Three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not have language adequate to describe this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, it is a divine fact that the Father, Son, and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To Abide with the Son and the Father in Us</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit abides in us with the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the Spirit comes, the Son and the Father also come.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the Spirit abides in us, both the Son and the Father abide in us with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As John 14:17 makes clear, the Spirit of reality abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we compare this verse with John 14:23, we see that the Father and the Son also abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, Romans 8:9-11 also indicates that the Spirit abides in us with the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we exercise our spirit to call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit moves within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because the Father and the Son abide in our spirit with the Spirit, we sense that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we call on the Lord Jesus, we may have the sense that the Triune God is abiding in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To Testify concerning the Son and Glorify Him</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit also testifies concerning the Son and glorifies Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>John 15:26 says, "The Spirit of reality who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since the Spirit is sent by the Son and comes with the Father, the Spirit's testimony concerning the Son is a matter of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John 16:14 says that the Spirit will glorify the Son: "He shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Spirit glorifies the Son by revealing Him with all the fullness of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that the Spirit glorifies the Son by revealing Him to us.</S>
