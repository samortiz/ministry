   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WALK IN HIM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 4:17: "Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here is a man who walks in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You will discover that not only here, but in numerous passages, it is mentioned that the Christian walk should be one that is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>HIS DOCTRINES ARE WHAT HE IS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let us look at something very important concerning our faith:</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Corinthians 15:12-14: "But if Christ is proclaimed that He has been raised from the dead, how is it that some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is vain; your faith is vain also."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verses 16-17: "For if the dead are not raised, neither has Christ been raised.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It does not say what we will get for good or bad behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Everything in our faith is based upon the person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If He had died without being resurrected, His doctrines would be lifeless, and everything would be over.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our faith would be of no effect.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can see here that His doctrines are what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But praise the Lord, He was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, our preaching is not in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All is reality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everything of our faith is tied to the resurrected Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>DOCTRINES CAME OUT</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>OF THE RESURRECTED CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We will skip over 2 Corinthians because it is not a book that deals with doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Books that deal with doctrines are Galatians, Ephesians, and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, we can only briefly mention them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We will show that all doctrines come out of the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Galatians 2:4: "And this, because of the false brothers, brought in secretly, who stole in to spy out our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into slavery."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our freedom is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verses 16-17: "And knowing that a man is not justified out of works of law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, we also have believed into Christ Jesus that we might be justified out of faith in Christ and not out of the works of law, because out of the works of law no flesh will be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also have been found sinners, is then Christ a minister of sin?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Absolutely not!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Justification is due to our being in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not a result of our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once we are joined to Christ, we are justified.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I IN HIM</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Galatians 2:20 is another precious verse: "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I did not kill myself; I was crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When He died on the cross, I died also, because I am in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>ALL SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS GIVEN IN HIM</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ephesians 1:3: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All spiritual blessings are given to us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For this reason everything that follows is received in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verses 4-7: "Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love, predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, with which He graced us in the Beloved; in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Again read Colossians 1:14: "In whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Redemption and forgiveness of sins are in the Beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Colossians 3:1-3: "If therefore you were raised together with Christ, seek the things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Set your mind on the things which are above, not on the things which are on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Again, only by Christ can we receive a resurrected life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The relationship God has with us is based upon the relationship He has with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>ALL TEACHINGS AND DOCTRINES ARE TIED TO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From the book of Romans on, we have discovered a fact: not one doctrine and teaching concerning our faith is related to our work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rather, every one of them is tied to the person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whether it is forgiveness of sins, regeneration, holiness, or freedom, etc., there is no doctrine that is disassociated from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Without Christ we have no faith.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Without Christ we have nothing to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the difference between our faith and all the other religions.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Without passing through Christ, we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Without being related to Him, we cannot have any doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Everything depends on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some may ask: are not there some exhortations in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Is Christianity not concerned with right and wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Yes, the Bible does have exhortations; it also tells people how to behave and walk.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For example, the book of Romans contains some words of exhortation and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But they appear after chapter twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Before chapter twelve, however, are all the doctrines that are related to Christ and how we can be joined to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Only afterwards are there exhortations for our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>THE EMPHASIS IS ON</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Ephesians settles the relationship between us, God, and Christ in chapters one through three.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then chapters four through six deal with some teachings on behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Even when speaking of our walk, the basis is our relationship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The same principle can be found in all other books.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, genuine Christianity does not first exhort us to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Rather, it tells us to establish a relationship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>After a relationship is established, then the practice comes.</S>
