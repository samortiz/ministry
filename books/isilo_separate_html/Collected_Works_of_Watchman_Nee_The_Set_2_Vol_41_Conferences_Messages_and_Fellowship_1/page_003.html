H. Weigh during the same period. The two messages cover deliverance from sin and the law and the relationship between life and light. The notes from Brother Weigh's fellowship are fragmentary in nature and do not have a particular theme. Instead of being published chronologically, these fragments have been grouped into related topics and published as four chapters. The first chapter deals with general spiritual topics. The second chapter deals with biblical exposition. The third chapter includes topics related to the church, and the fourth chapter deals with local problems in the assembly in Foochow and questions related to division.</p><p>Section Two contains three chapters of notes from fellowship given by Brother Watchman Nee. The dates and places are not known. Based on the content of the second chapter, however, there is reason to believe that they were spoken in 1934.</p><p>Section Three contains twenty-one messages given by Watchman Nee at a conference in Chuenchow in November 1935. According to Brother Weigh's notes, the meetings and fellowship followed the schedule that is listed below. The notes from a few of these meetings cannot be located, and at least one message was published in Volume 24, The Overcoming Life.</p><ol class="decimal"><li>November 11, Evening: He Fills the Hungry with Good Things</li><li>November 12, Afternoon: Brother Nee's Testimony (unavailable)</li><li>November 12, Evening: The Overcoming Life</li><li>November 13, Afternoon: Christ as Everything (unavailable)</li><li>November 13, Evening: The Characteristics of the Overcoming Life (unavailable)</li><li>November 14, Afternoon: How to Experience Christ as the Overcoming Life</li><li>November 14, Evening: How to Experience the Overcoming Life (The Overcoming Life, Volume 24 of The Collected Works, chapter four)</li><li>November 15, Morning: Living by Faith (unavailable)</li><li>November 15, Evening: A Believer's Relationship with Christ</li><li>November 16, Morning: What is Faith</li><li>November 16, Afternoon: The Way of a Christian</li><li>November 16, Evening: Confession (unavailable)</li><li>November 17, Afternoon: Consecration</li><li>November 17, Evening: The Guarding of the Overcoming Life</li><li>November 18, Morning: Temptations, Failures, and Progress in the Overcoming Life</li><li>November 18, Afternoon: A Word of Explanation concerning the Outpouring of the Holy Spirit</li><li>November 18, Evening: The Conditions for Receiving the Outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and Things to Watch Out For</li><li>November 19, Morning: The Manifestations and Evidences of the Outpouring of the Holy Spirit</li><li>November 19, Afternoon: The Works of the Holy Spirit and the Benefit of the Outpouring of the Holy Spirit</li><li>November 19, Evening: The Tone of an Overcoming Living</li><li>November 20, Morning: The Holy Spirit and the Law</li><li>November 20, Afternoon: Talks (1)</li><li>November 20, Evening: Being beside Ourselves to God</li><li>November 21, Morning: A Report on the Various Regions of Work in China</li><li>November 21, Afternoon: Gifts, Ministry, and Operations</li><li>November 21, Afternoon: Talks (2)</li><li>November 22, Afternoon: Talks (3)</li></ol><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
