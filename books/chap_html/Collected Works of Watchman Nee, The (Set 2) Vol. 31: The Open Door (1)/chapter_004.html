<h1 class="title">ISSUE NO. 4</h1><h2 class="head4">(P.O. Box 84, Hankow, February 1938)</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS CONCERNING THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">The Footsteps of Brother Simon Meek, Manila</h2><p>Dear Brother Watchman:</p><p>I gladly received and read your letter. I was comforted to find out about the condition of the co-workers in China through reading The Open Door. When will you travel abroad? It would be best if you could take the steamer that passes through Manila so that the brothers and sisters here may have the opportunity once again to receive your teaching and learn about the details of the work in China. I went on a trip to preach the gospel in October and sowed seeds in thirty-nine localities in ten provinces. A new assembly was raised up in one locality. A brother in business is responsible there. I hope I can go out again next spring. I am comforted by the fact that most of the brothers and sisters in the church in Manila are growing spiritually. Several brothers have moved from here to other places. Lei Chun-yung and Huang Lien-sheng have also gone to other places on business. This locality has lost its strong arms, but we hope that the Lord's Word and work will spread through them. When you have time, I would appreciate you writing to me. When Brother Luk passed through Manila, I was out and was away from home. He came ashore and stayed for several hours. When Brother Luk is finished with the work in Singapore, perhaps he can stay for a short time in the Philippines. Peace.</p><p>Your brother, Simon Meek<br />December 7, 1937<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Letters from Singapore</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Brother X:</p><p>Brother Huang Ren-shan (from Foochow) and I arrived in Singapore on the twenty-eighth of last month. There have been meetings here every night since we came. I spoke for nine evenings in the meeting hall. Next Monday I will preach on a rooftop at the invitation of my classmate, Mr. Lee Bang-han. Please pray for me. The brothers here hope that Brother Kaung will come quickly. Only then they will let me go. They said that you promised to ask him to come here in the past. Sister Ting will come to Singapore from X on December 4. The sisters want to keep her here for awhile. I deeply want to be taught concerning the difference between the church and the work; please guide me in this. Greet each of the co-workers for me. Peace!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Faithful Luk<br />November 28</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>The Lord has opened a greater door of grace for us in Singapore. This week we are in the gospel hall. When will the Lord send Brothers Nee and Kaung to us? We invite you to come south whenever you can. I ask you to place this matter in prayer. Sister Ting has already come here. Peace to you! Please greet Mr. Nee and the others also!</p><p>Wang Kai-sen and Faithful Luk<br />December 7</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Brother Luan:</p><p>Just as I was thinking about you, I received your letter. Thank you very much. I heard that you were not feeling well. Have you already recovered your health? May the Lord strengthen you greatly, amen (3 John 2). I am comforted to hear that Miss Lee and the others are in Chungking. The letter you wrote to all the brothers and sisters was very clear; both myself and all the saints said amen to it. The new light which Brother Nee received in Acts 13 and 14 really released me. I have dreamt about this for more than ten years in my heart, and now Brother Nee has spoken it. I read it word by word and plan on reading it several more times. Please pray much for me and ask the Lord to save me from a vain life, empty works, and a false testimony, amen. I went to Yung P'ing Harbor to work for one week last week. The calling from the southern island is strong. May the Lord send you and the others to come. Peace to you! Greetings to your wife also! Greetings to senior Brother and Sister Nee.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Faithful Luk<br />January 5<br />[Address omitted]</p>
