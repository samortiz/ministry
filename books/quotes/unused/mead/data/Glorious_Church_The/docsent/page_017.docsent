   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We must realize that God takes into account the source of things, not whether they are good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Men always ask, "Is this good or bad?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But God asks, "Where does it come from?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That which came from Adam was called Eve; likewise, that which comes from Christ is called the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Anything which is not out of Christ is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Men ask, "Do you have love?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But God asks, "Where does your love come from?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Men ask, "Are you zealous?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But God asks, "What is the source of your zeal?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to solve the matter of origin, not good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The question of good and evil came in after Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Perhaps someone would say, "Do I not have some ability?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Am I not zealous?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the problem is, where does your ability and zeal come from?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We often feel that we are quite able to love and help others by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To love and help others, of course, is good, but "if I deliver up my body that I may boast, but do not have love," Christ's love, "I profit nothing" 1 Cor 13:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Is it wrong to give ourselves to help others?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The issue is still: Where does it come from?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only that which comes from Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Anything that is not out of Christ has nothing to do with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In our Christian life, the first lesson and last lesson we need to learn is to discern the source of things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first lesson is to reject anything that comes from ourselves, and the last lesson is still to reject anything that comes from ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This does not mean that we should not strive or be zealous, but the issue is that our striving and zeal must come from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are not saying that we should not work, but we want work which is initiated by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are not saying that we should not seek after power, but that we should seek the power which is from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the whole issue: From where does it originate?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus once said, "The Son can do nothing from Himself" John 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the Greek text, the word "from" can also be translated "out of."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that the Son can do nothing out of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If this was the case with the Lord, then how much more it should be with us!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How can we ever do anything from ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to see before God that we can do nothing from ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He must bring us to the place where we realize that we truly can do nothing from ourselves everything must be by Him and out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we serve the Lord, it is not enough to be zealous.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No, we must do that work which the Lord assigns to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Colossians 1:29, Paul said, "For which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is working within us so we can work without.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We often do many things outwardly, but not much has been done inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has not done that much within; most everything has been done by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This kind of work, even though it may be considerable, is of no use.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the matter of serving the Lord, God must bring us to a place that we do not want anything that is not from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the Lord is not moving, then we will not dare move.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eve was bone of Adam's bone and flesh of his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This signifies that the bones inside and the flesh outside are all out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everything on the inside and everything on the outside are of Him; nothing can be from ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Everything of Eve was out of Adam, and everything of the church is out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No matter how well we may do something, it is absolutely useless in achieving God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No matter how good something is, it cannot possibly glorify God if it issues from ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The first woman represents the woman who is after God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There was not only a man who expressed God's heart, there was also a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is not only Christ who satisfies God's heart; it is also the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ satisfies God's heart, because He allows God to be His head.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It must be the same with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>She also must allow God to be her head.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When the church reaches this position, the will of God will be done.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God intends to have this kind of people on the earth, and when He does, His heart's desire will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let us remember that whatever comes out from man's self is just dust and not worthy of being the material for the help meet.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Only that which comes out from Christ is the church.</S>
