   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God created the heavens and the earth with man as the head and center.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then man fell.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the eyes of God, man s fall involved the entire creation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To redeem this fallen creation God came in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Redemption was not an afterthought.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was pre-ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Peter 1:19-20 tells us that the Redeemer, Christ, was foreknown by God before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this verse world refers to the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before the foundation of the universe, God knew that man would fall.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, God preordained the Son, Christ, to be the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can see from this that God s redemption was not accidental.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, Revelation 13:8 says that the Lamb, that is, the Redeemer, Christ, was slain from the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From the time creation came into existence, in the eyes of God, Christ, as the Lamb ordained by God, was slain.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In our eyes Christ was crucified less than two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in God s view He was slain from the day creation came into existence because God foreknew that His creation would fall.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These verses show that God s redemption was not an afterthought, but rather something ordained, planned, and prepared by God in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How we should treasure this fact about the redemption we enjoy in Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>GOD INCARNATED</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first step in God s accomplishment of redemption was the incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was surely a marvelous thing for God to come into man and to be born of mankind through a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our God became a man!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In creation He was the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But though He created all things, He did not enter into any of the things He created.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even in creating man He only breathed the breath of life into him Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was still outside man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His breath, according to Job 33:4, gave man life; however, He Himself did not come into man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Until the incarnation He was separate from man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But with the incarnation He personally entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was first conceived and then remained in the virgin s womb for nine months, after which He was born.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Word Becoming Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to John 1:14, He became not only a man; He became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The flesh in this verse refers to man after the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man in Genesis 1 and 2 had not fallen, but after Genesis 3 he had.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The word flesh, referring to man after the fall, always bears a negative denotation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No flesh can be justified before God by works Rom 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Flesh refers to fallen man, and Christ as the Son of God became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He became flesh.</S>
