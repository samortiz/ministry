NEEDING TO BE FITTING AND PROPER</h2>
<p>Those who release the word must learn to pay attention also to their manner of speaking. This refers to posture and is related to our temperament. Of course, we do not pay attention to outward things, but the way we speak can greatly affect the release of the word. It is possible for our posture to reduce the weight of our message. For example, too many hand gestures can be distracting and should be corrected. We can correct this by practicing to speak in front of a mirror. Then we will know how to correct ourselves.</p>
<p>A worker of the Lord should not pretend; however, every worker should maintain proper deportment. Deportment refers to one&rsquo;s manner of speaking. The first lesson a diplomat must learn is deportment. A diplomat cannot act like a child in the midst of a major event. Even an athlete maintains proper deportment. He has a certain bearing whether he is walking or running. When an athlete stands, he has a certain bearing that enables others to recognize that he is an athlete.</p>
<p>A worker should never pretend but be genuine. Nevertheless, we should have proper deportment. The sisters should have a bearing that is proper for a sister. This is different from the bearing of a brother. The elderly ones should have a deportment that is appropriate to them. The same applies to new ones. Some elders are careless when they contact the saints; they do not have proper deportment. An elder should not carry himself like a bureaucrat, being special and above others. An elder should behave becomingly. He should be sincere, unpretentious, and artless, not putting on airs. At the same time he should be neither light nor loose. People should feel that he is weighty and that he has the deportment of an elder. These qualities are related to a person&rsquo;s birth, disposition, education, environment, and family background.</p>
<p>Every diplomat needs to learn three important lessons. He must first learn proper deportment. Then he must improve his language ability. A diplomat must be good with words. He should be able to turn any situation around with a few words. We are all ambassadors of the kingdom of God, diplomats, who interact with the devil&rsquo;s kingdom on earth every day. We have had the experience of turning those who oppose us with just a few words. They even receive the Lord after a few words even though they initially had no desire for Him. Therefore, the second thing a diplomat must learn is how to speak.</p>
<p>Third, a diplomat must learn magnanimity. A magnanimous person does not necessarily let others know when he is happy or sad. A magnanimous person always allows others to retreat. For instance, when he is offended, he does not immediately become angry. Instead, he exercises magnanimity to withdraw and consider the situation to see if he has the basis to give a clear response. He does not become angry immediately after he has been offended, nor is he willing to do things for others based on his mood. A magnanimous diplomat always consults many experts, such as his advisors, supervisors, secretaries, and counselors to examine the advantages and disadvantages of a situation before responding.</p>
<p>A person who cannot learn these three matters cannot become a good diplomat even if he has a wealth of knowledge. Knowledge is secondary for a diplomat. The most important matter is his deportment. Then he must have an ability to speak and to be magnanimous. When he is provoked, he will not lose his temper, and when he is praised, he will not freely oblige others. Every serving one should learn these three matters. It is absolutely inappropriate for us to lose our temper when we are offended by a brother. It is also not suitable for us to readily agree to a brother&rsquo;s request when he is favorable to us.</p>
<p>We must pay attention to our deportment when we contact others and when we minister the word. It is rather difficult for others to correct us in this matter. It is best for us to stand before a mirror, observe ourselves, and make the necessary corrections. For example, there is a brother who always frowns, with one eyebrow cocked high and the other low, when he stands up to speak. Then he shakes his head twice before he utters his first sentence. This brother has been doing this for more than twenty years. He has never changed his deportment in speaking throughout all these years. There is another brother who is often nervous and excited when he receives foreign guests, and even though he is warm, his behavior is unbecoming. It is possible to remain calm and dignified when we shake hands. If we behave unbecomingly, we give others a poor impression.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we should not all have the same posture when we speak. For example, there was a preacher who wore a robe and did not move much when he spoke, but when he opened his mouth to say &ldquo;For God so loved the world...,&rdquo; it was full of touching power. Another preacher would run down from the platform, around the meeting hall, and then back up to the platform when giving a message. He would cry and laugh, shout and yell, and kneel or lie down. Sometimes he would mimic the way women walk and the way they talk to show that it was unbecoming. People usually found it difficult to accept his behavior, but after listening to the message, they were subdued and conceded that his behavior was right; it was not unbecoming. Therefore, every one who ministers the word has his own deportment.</p>
<p>This matter of deportment is a problem to nearly everyone. Ten years ago there was a brother who continually lifted his trousers while speaking. Another brother was oblivious to the fact that his belt was crooked whenever he finished speaking. Still another brother liked to grab his tie when he spoke. Although these are not important issues, they can affect our speaking of the word. A brother who likes to frown should not speak in a wedding meeting or a memorial service. Weddings are happy occasions, and his frowning would not be appropriate. Likewise, people are sad enough in a memorial service; they do not need his frowns. In fact, it is unseemly for such a person to speak in any occasion.</p>
<p>Some people always have an appropriate deportment. On a happy occasion their speaking is proper even though they do not speak concerning happiness. When they speak in a memorial meeting, the relatives of the deceased are greatly comforted. They may not speak much, but their deportment has much weight.</p>
<p>At one time I thought that Brother Nee was too spiritual to pay attention to a matter as small as appearance. One day, however, as he was teaching me how to typeset hymns in Chinese, he said that if we printed the hymns horizontally, they would be less effective in touching people, but if we printed them vertically, there would be more impact. We then typeset a hymn horizontally and vertically. When we read and sang the hymn, we found that there was indeed a difference. As human beings, we are affected by many things. The ability to touch people is basically the work of the Holy Spirit; however, certain things can frustrate this work. Reading something horizontally can frustrate this work whereas reading the same thing vertically can assist this work. In the same way, proper deportment not only removes people&rsquo;s resistance to the Holy Spirit but also assists the work of the Spirit. If our deportment is poor, it will become a cause of resistance to the Holy Spirit. Sometimes our poor deportment can completely nullify the impact of our speaking. When people do not like our deportment, they do not listen to what we say; their heart is closed, and they cannot receive anything from the message.</p>
<p>In addition, young people should never behave like old people. They should be proper and natural, maintaining an appropriate and proper deportment. We should be beside ourselves before God and sober-minded before men (2 Cor. 5:13). However, being sober before our parents is different from being sober before our children. Even though we are sober, our behavior is different. Being sober before our parents expresses one kind of deportment, but the deportment before our children is different. We need to study this matter.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Administration of the Church and the Ministry of the Word &nbsp; pg 59</div><br></body></html>
