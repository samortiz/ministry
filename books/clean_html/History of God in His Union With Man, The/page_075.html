<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Complete Triune God of the Three Sections<br>of the Life of a Corporate Person</H2><P>The book of Genesis reveals the complete Triune God of the three sections of the life of a corporate person. Genesis does not consider Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as three separate persons but as one complete corporate person with three sections.</P><P>Our God is the God of three particular persons&#151;the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. In the final chapters of Genesis, another person is mentioned by the name of Joseph. Among the elect of God, four persons are covered in Genesis&#151;Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, but the Bible does not consider Joseph as a separate person. His life was actually the continuation and consummation of Jacob's life. Jehovah is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God the Father Loving Man and<br>Choosing Man, in the Section of Jacob</H2><P>We see God the Father loving man and choosing man in the section of Jacob (Mal. 1:2; Rom. 9:10-13). Jacob is the last of the three, yet he is used by God to signify the Father in His loving and choosing man. Malachi 1:2 says that God loved Jacob, and Romans 9:10-13 says that God selected Jacob, choosing him even before he was born.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God the Father Calling Man, Justifying Man, and Equipping Man to Live by Faith and Live in Fellowship with Him, in the Section of Abraham</H2><P>In the section of Abraham, we see God the Father who calls man, justifies man, and equips man to live by faith and live in fellowship with Him (Gen. 12:1; 15:6; ch. 17; ch. 18; 19:29; 21:1-13; 22:1-18). Genesis 12:1 shows us the Father's calling and 15:6 reveals His justification. Chapter seventeen shows us how God equipped Abraham to live a life by faith. Then chapter eighteen reveals how God made Abraham to live a life in fellowship with Him. It is a chapter of fellowship between God and His human friend, Abraham.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. God the Son Blessing Man with<br>the Inheritance of All His Riches, with a Life<br>of the Enjoyment of His Abundance, and<br>with a Life in Peace, in the Section of Isaac</H2><P>The section of Isaac represents God the Son, the Second of the Triune God, who blesses man with the inheritance of all His riches, with a life of the enjoyment of His abundance, and with a life in peace (Gen. 25:5; 26:3-4, 12-33).</P>
