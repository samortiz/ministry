   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject One Hundred Seven THE NEED OF THE DEAD Scripture: John 11 A man had died First mention that a man was sick, and his sisters came to ask the Lord for healing.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When he was sick, the Lord would not come to heal him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is to say that if a man only admits that he has some problems but will not admit that he is dead, the Lord will not come to save him, because the Lord s salvation is not to heal but to cause the dead to resurrect.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord s salvation is not to cause man to be healed, but to cause man to be enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Healing is a matter of correction, whereas enlivening is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord s salvation is not to correct man s problem, but to enliven man that man may receive His life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This point needs to be emphasized.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord is life The need of the dead is to receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The only way for a dead person to be healed is to receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only life can vanquish death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Give examples to prove that man is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A dead person is weak and impotent in doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A dead person has no consciousness in doing evil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fact that man is weak and impotent in doing good and yet has no consciousness in doing evil is a proof that man is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A dead person is in bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The dead Lazarus was bound with burial cloths and confined in a tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many today are bound in a theater, and the theater is their tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord said that He is life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only the Lord can meet the need of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How the Lord causes man to receive life The Lord s life is in His words.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The basic principle in gospel preaching is to cause man to receive the Lord s life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>So you must cause man to believe in the Lord s words.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord s words are the Lord s voice, which is the Lord s gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today the gospel is being preached to you so that you may believe in His words, for in His words there is the Lord s life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What caused Lazarus to be resurrected from death that day was the Lord s words, saying, Lazarus, come forth!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The dead Lazarus heard the Lord s words and was quickened.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John 5:25 says, An hour is coming and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear shall live.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today the words of the gospel are the voice of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Friends, if you will listen to this voice, you will live.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who believe are the ones who have really heard His voice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some of you here may have heard these words superficially, but you still do not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The reason you do not believe is that you have not heard.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who have really heard the words are the ones who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Quote to them the verses in the Bible regarding how to obtain the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The result of obtaining the Lord s life Lazarus lived when he heard the words of the Lord, and he came out of the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today as you hear the gospel, you have also heard the words of the Lord, and you live.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because you are living, you will surely come out of the movie theaters and other sinful pits.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Freed from the bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling are all bondages.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They cause you to be unable to move an inch.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you receive life, you will be freed from the bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Remarks</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The story about the resurrection of Lazarus in chapter eleven and the miracle of changing water into wine in chapter two are similar in figure.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Cana there was a wedding feast, signifying the joy of human living; the center of the feast was wine, signifying life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means, likewise, that there was joy in the house of Bethany, and the center of the joy was dependent upon life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the life of those three was as weak as the reed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When life was terminated, the joy of human living was gone, just as when the wine ran out.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>John chapter two is a picture, whereas John chapter eleven is a description of that picture.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The following is a comparison between these two chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Chapter Eleven There was joy in the house of Bethany.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Lazarus was dying.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Martha, Lazarus sister, came and told the Lord that Lazarus was sick.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord did not act according to Martha s words.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord acted in Bethany according to His own will.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Lazarus was absolutely dead and buried in the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord caused Lazarus to resurrect from death and to receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Chapter Two There was a wedding feast in Cana.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The wine was running out.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Mary, Jesus mother, told the Lord that the wine was running out.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord also did not act according to Mary s words.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord also acted in Cana according to His own will.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The wine ran out.</S>
