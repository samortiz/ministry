   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>DRAWN TO PURSUE CHRIST FOR SATISFACTION 1 Scripture Reading: S.S. 1:1-8</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the beginning of this life-study of Song of Songs, I would like to offer a word of appreciation and memorial of and an expression of gratitude to Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The outline with all the headings and subtitles and the interpretation of figures in this present life-study of Song of Songs are based on Brother Nee's particular study with a few co-workers in May 1935, in which I participated as one of not more than ten attendants, in a hotel on the shore of West Lake of the city of Hangchow, close to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The theme of Song of Songs is satisfaction of satisfactions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This book portrays the four stages in the experience of the lover of Christ and can be summarized by the following four sentences:</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1 A lover of Christ should be one who is attracted by His love and drawn by Him in His sweetness to pursue after Him for full satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>2 A lover of Christ should be one who is called by Him to be delivered from the self through his oneness with the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>3 A lover of Christ should be one who is called by Him to live in ascension as the new creation of God in the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>4 A lover of Christ should be one who is called by Him more strongly to live within the veil through His cross after the lover's experience of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the first stage the lover of Christ is attracted by Christ to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the second stage the lover of Christ experiences the cross for the breaking of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The cross saves us from the self in order to get us out of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the third stage the lover of Christ lives in ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To live in ascension is to experience the new creation of God in Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the fourth stage the lover of Christ lives within the veil, in the inner chamber of the whole universe, the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In experience the cross comes first, followed by resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet the experience of ascension is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After ascension there is still the need of another following stage living within the veil through further experience of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Song of Songs, a book of poetry, we cannot find the words cross, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Neither do we have the expressions new creation or within the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How, then, can we say that this book unveils different stages of the Christian life?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we would answer this question, we need to see that in Song of Songs the stages of the Christian life are revealed, or unveiled, through many different figures.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word cross is not used, but there are figures of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In like manner, instead of the words resurrection and ascension, there are figures of resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are also figures signifying the new creation and the life within the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In reading this book, the hardest thing is to interpret the figures.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this message we will first give an introductory word and then begin to consider the first stage the stage of being drawn to pursue Christ for satisfaction.</S>
