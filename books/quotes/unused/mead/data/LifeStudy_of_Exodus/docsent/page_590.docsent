   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY-FIVE THE ERECTION OF THE TABERNACLE 2 Scripture Reading: Exo 40 THE SEQUENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN ERECTING THE TABERNACLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 40:1-16 we have the commandments of the Lord to Moses concerning the raising up of the tabernacle, and in verses 17 through 33, the actual erection of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Regarding the erection of the tabernacle, we see the following sequence: the raising up of the boards v. 18 ; spreading the curtains and the coverings v. 19 ; placing the ark of the testimony into the Holy of Holies vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>20-21a ; putting up the veil to cover the ark of the testimony v. 21b ; placing the table in the Holy Place on the north side, outside the veil, and setting in order upon it the bread before the Lord vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>22-23 ; placing the lampstand in the Holy Place, opposite the table, on the south side, and lighting the lamps before the Lord vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>24-25 ; placing the golden altar in the Holy Place before the veil and burning upon it the incense of fragrant spices vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>26-27 ; putting up the curtain of the door of the tabernacle v. 28 ; placing the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle and offering upon it the burnt offering and the meal offering v. 29 ; placing the laver between the tabernacle and the altar and putting water there for washing the hands and the feet of the priests vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>30-32 ; raising up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar v. 33a ; and hanging up the curtain of the gate of the court v. 33b .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE CLOUD COVERING THE TENT OF MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>AND THE GLORY FILLING THE TABERNACLE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 40:34-38 we have a record of the glory of the Lord filling the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 34 says, Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This verse speaks of two aspects; it speaks of something that happened outside the tent of meeting and something that happened inside the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory filled the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The same structure was both the tent of meeting and the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With respect to man, it was the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But with respect to God, it was the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may also say that outwardly it was the tent of meeting and that inwardly it was the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the church life today there is a difference between the tent of meeting and the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may have the church life and be in the church life, but we may be on the outside and not on the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that our church life may be merely the tent of meeting, not the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we study the book of Exodus carefully, we shall see that the first mention of the tent of meeting was shortly after the children of Israel practiced idolatry by making a golden calf and worshipping it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Moses moved his tent outside the camp, and then his tent became the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the church life we may simply be gathered around the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may not be in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Exodus 40 the tent of meeting was covered by the cloud, but the tabernacle was filled with glory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who only gather around the tent of meeting may have the cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, we need to enjoy not only the cloud upon the tent of meeting, but also the glory within the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By the Lord s mercy I can testify that during the early years I was under the cloud, but today I am inside the tabernacle that is filled with glory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No longer is my enjoyment only that of the cloud, but it is also that of the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How about you?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Are you enjoying only the cloud upon the tent of meeting, or are you also enjoying the glory within the tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Certain saints who are very happy and bubbling in the church life may be under the cloud, not in the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such saints need more experience of the church life in order to enter into the tabernacle and see the glory that is inside.</S>
