Lord, the more we fellowship with You, the more we feel that we are filthy and defiled. We pray that we may be able to speak forth everything that You want us to speak. When Your presence is with the church, there is light, and men will touch You when they come in.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONSECRATION OF OUR BODIES<br>BEING THE DEFINITE CONSECRATION</H2><P>Among all the passages in the Bible, Romans 12:1 and 2 speak of consecration in a most explicit, thorough, precise, and definite way. This passage deals with consecration in a most emphatic and serious way. Many brothers and sisters have heard the subject of consecration before. But when Romans 12 speaks of consecration, it mentions at least three practical things. Of course, there may be more than three things, but at least there are three. Tonight, we will only speak concerning two of these three things. The consecration spoken of here is too precise, definite, and explicit; there is no way for anyone to avoid it. In other places, consecration may not be as definite. But the consecration spoken of here is very definite. Sometimes, when you ask others if they have consecrated themselves, they may say that they have done so. But when you look at these ones, they do not look like consecrated ones. This kind of consecration is too abstract.</P><P>The consecration spoken of here is the consecration of the bodies. Many people have changed the Bible. They tell others to consecrate themselves. But here it says that we have to consecrate our bodies. Why does it speak of the bodies? It is because the body is the most definite and practical thing. If Paul were to tell us to consecrate the heart or the soul, it would not have been so definite. The most definite thing is the consecration of our bodies. If a man has brought his heart and his mind here, is that person here yet? He is not necessarily here. But if his body is here, he is definitely here. If I ask whether or not you have consecrated your heart, everyone can raise up his hand. Some have consecrated their hearts, but they have not consecrated themselves. The desire of consecration has to spread from the heart to the body. It is like sickness which spreads from within a person to his body. With those who have only consecrated themselves in an inward way, their consecrations are intangible and impractical. Only those who have consecrated their bodies are practical. This is the only place in the whole Bible that speaks of the presenting of our bodies. The heart is abstract, and it is intangible. Only the body is practical.</P><P>Brother Suen, what is your consecration? Is it a consecration of the heart or of the body? Consecration is a familiar subject. Many may have been bored by the subject already. But this is the first time you have heard about the consecration of our bodies. The consecration of the heart can be haphazard, deceiving, and misleading. But the consecration of the bodies is as definite as a piece of rock; it is something that a person can touch. If I were to ask if you have consecrated yourself, you might be able to answer "yes" with confidence. But if I were to ask if you have consecrated your body, what would you say? Brother Suen said that part of it has been consecrated and part of it has not been consecrated. Miss Hsiao and Miss Kao, both of you have been Christians for many years. Have your bodies been consecrated yet? We are like the students who have not done their homework properly and who need to have make-up lessons. If we have not settled the question of the consecration of our bodies, we have not yet settled the question of consecration at all.</P><P>Both the New Testament and the Old Testament speak of consecration many times. But Romans 12 alone speaks of it in a most definite way. Many people love the Lord in their hearts, but they have not dropped the world. Heart consecration is the preacher's consecration, whereas body consecration is the consecration according to God's word. This is much more definite and practical. If you have it, you have it. If you do not have it, you do not have it. Many brothers and sisters say that their consecrations are not complete. This is terrible! We have so many brothers and sisters with incomplete consecrations! This shows that their consecration has never spread from their heart to their bodies.</P><P>Tonight I am not preaching a sermon here. I am presenting to you a visible, tangible, and touchable matter. Have you consecrated yourself or not? If our bodies are not consecrated, we have not yet taken a start in our consecration. At least one place in the Bible speaks explicitly of the consecration of our bodies.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_151.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_153.html">Next</a> </body></html>
