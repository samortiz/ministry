   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>by the Lord to a Particular Church</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>in a Certain Locality</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 were written as one book to the seven churches Rev 1:4a .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before the book of Revelation, every epistle was written and sent particularly to a certain church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, in Revelation, the Lord wrote seven epistles and put them together in one book.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These epistles were addressed by the Lord to the seven particular churches separately 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14 ; but they were sent not as seven books but as one book.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the Seven Epistles Being Closed as</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>the Speaking of the Spirit to All the Churches</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although the contents of the seven epistles differ, at the end of each epistle there is the same closing word: "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches" Rev 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Each epistle was written to a particular church in a certain locality, yet all the seven epistles were closed in the same way, as the Spirit's speaking to all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that each epistle was written to all the churches, and it indicates that all the churches should be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the second item as the base for all the churches to practice the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There must be the one accord among all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Apostle Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>the Same Thing in All the Churches An Epistle Written to a Certain Church</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Being Also for Other Churches</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Apostle Paul taught the same thing in all the churches 1 Cor 4:17; 7:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that all the churches in all the different localities should be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Colossians 4:16 Paul wrote, "And when this letter is read among you, cause that it may be read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you also read the one from Laodicea."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The epistle to the church in Colosse was also for the church in Laodicea, and the epistle to the church in Laodicea was also for the church in Colosse.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, every epistle was written not only for the receiving church but also for all the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that the Lord wants all the churches to have the one accord.</S>
