   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGE NINE DRINKING OF THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Eph 4:3-4; 1 Cor 12:13; 6:17; Phil 1:19b; Eph 4:23; 2 Tim 4:22a</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is one Body and one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I absolutely believe that at this time the Lord's Spirit has led us to touch the matter of the Body, and from the Body to touch the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What we saw in the past was not very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ephesians speaks of the Body at the very beginning and continues to speak of the Body, connecting it to the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever it speaks of the Body, it connects it to the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have seen not only the one Body but also the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now we can say, "One Body, one new man, and one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this message we will fellowship about the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE SPIRIT BEING THE LIFE OF THE BODY AND THE PERSON OF THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We know that the Body needs life, and the new man needs a person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With regard to the church as the Body of Christ, there is the need for Christ to be our life; with regard to the church as the new man, there is the need for Christ to be our person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At this time we want to point out clearly that on the one hand, the Spirit is life, and on the other hand, He is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit is not only life to us, but also a person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the New Testament, you can find certain passages that emphasize the Spirit as life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, the Lord said, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life" John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is no doubt that the Spirit here refers to life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This Spirit is not a matter of person but of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other words, the Spirit here is not with respect to making decisions but with respect to supplying.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Spirit is life to be our supply.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some passages, however, refer to the Spirit with the emphasis on the person and not on life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example: "But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit" 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The emphasis concerning the Spirit in this passage is not on life but on a person; the emphasis is not on life's supplying, but on a person's leading and making decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We admit that this point is new to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I fully believe that in the past we did not have this utterance, that the Spirit is, on the one hand, life to us and, on the other hand, a person to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the past we spoke something about life being in the Spirit, and we also spoke about the Spirit being the person of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jesus is the name, and the Spirit is the person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we call, "Lord Jesus," the Spirit comes; we immediately get the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the same time, when this Spirit enters us, He becomes our life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although we have spoken about these things, the light has never been as clear as it is today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today we can clearly see that with respect to the Body, the Spirit is life, and with respect to the new man, this Spirit is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One Body, one new man, and one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This one Spirit is the life of the Body and the person of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First Corinthians 12:13 says that whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, we were all baptized into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Where were we baptized?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, we were all given to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This passage refers to the Spirit twice: once for baptism and once for drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Baptism is our being put into this Spirit, and drinking is our getting this Spirit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The emphasis here is not on the Spirit as a person but as life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Another portion, Philippians 1:19, speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You must admit that this refers to the Spirit as a person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since it is He who comes to supply us, it is not just a matter of life but of person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must be clear that for both the Body and the new man, what we need is this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Without the Spirit, the Body is short of life and the new man is short of a person.</S>
