   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONFERENCE IN AMOY,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OCTOBER 1936 CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE FOOT-WASHING 1 Date: October 13, 1936, evening</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Place: Amoy</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Scripture Reading: John 13:1-17</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>During the past few days, I have been considering foot-washing in John 13.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some time ago when Brother Luk was in Shanghai we read this portion of the Word together.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We felt that the most difficult aspect to understand was the Lord's word concerning the necessity of foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our familiarity with this passage has not made it easier for us to understand its real meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the same time, since there are so many interpretations of this passage already, it is difficult to receive new light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this reason, we felt that it was necessary to thoroughly study this passage once more.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, we still did not understand it well because we were too familiar with the interpretation of this passage.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Later, I set aside the interpretation that I knew and came to the Word in a fresh way, as if I had never read it before.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thank the Lord that He granted me some light, and this chapter became a blessing to me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Last Lord's Day I spoke about it in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Tonight I will speak some more about it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE BACKGROUND OF THE LORD'S WASHING</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>OF THE DISCIPLES' FEET</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This chapter speaks of the Lord's washing the disciples' feet and of His commandment for the disciples to wash each others' feet.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First, we must ask: When did the Lord wash the disciples' feet and when did He charge the disciples to wash each others' feet?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Bible carefully records the history and the background of this incident.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This information is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us consider this passage verse by verse.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Hour Having Come to Depart Out of</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This World unto the Father</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 1 says, "Now before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that His hour had come for Him to depart out of this world unto the Father..."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord's washing of the disciples' feet happened before the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord said that the "hour had come for Him to depart out of this world unto the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If I were to depart out of this world unto the Father tonight, what would I do?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I might have to clear my debt with my co-workers or to the sisters, or I might have other important things to take care of.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I would have to settle all the unsettled matters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If I know that I will not depart from this world for five years, I may postpone these things until later.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But if I know that I am about to depart from this world, I will surely settle and conclude all of my important business.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I would surely not be concerned with insignificant matters, such as asking a child to go to the store and buy me some candy or going to a movie.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, I would do crucial and necessary things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This was true of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before He departed from the world unto the Father, He washed the feet of His disciples, that is, His students, and charged them to wash one another's feet.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There were many things in this world that He could have done at that time, but He chose to wash the disciples' feet.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This shows that foot-washing is a very crucial matter.</S>
