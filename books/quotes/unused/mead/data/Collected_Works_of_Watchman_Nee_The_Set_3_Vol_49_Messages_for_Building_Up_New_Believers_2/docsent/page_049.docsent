   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord has crucified you.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You should say simply, "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He has crucified you, and it is futile for you to try to be patient by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God knows you cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why He crucified you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even though you still try to be patient, God considers you hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He has even crucified you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is a great mistake to think you can make it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is also a great mistake to try to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God already knows that you cannot make it; the only way He has for you is crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even though you think that you can make it, God says that you cannot make it and that you should die.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How foolish it is to still make resolutions and to struggle!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God knows that you cannot make it, and it would be well with you if you agreed with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God knows that you deserve to die.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you would say, "Amen, I will die," everything would be well.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The cross is God's assessment of us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In God's view we cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we could make it, God would not have crucified us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He knows that the only way for us is death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is why He crucified us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we saw things the same way God sees them, everything would be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brothers and sisters, God must bring us to the point where we accept His verdict.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here we see two aspects: First, Christ died, and we were crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is something God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Second, we have to acknowledge this fact; we need to say, "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These two sides must work together before God's work can take effect on us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we constantly frustrate Him by trying to do good and be patient and humble, the work of Christ will have no effect on us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our resolution to be humble or to be patient only makes things worse.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, we should bow down our head and say, "Lord, You have said that I am crucified, and I will say the same thing; You have said that I am useless, and I will say the same thing; You have said that I cannot be patient, and I will no longer try to be patient; You have said that I cannot be humble, and I will no longer try to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is what I am.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is useless for me to try to make any further resolutions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I am only fit to remain on the cross."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we did this, Christ would live Himself out of us!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not think that this is a difficult thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Every brother and sister should learn this lesson after he or she is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From the beginning we must learn not to live.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead, we should let the Lord live.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The basic problem is that many Christians have not given up on themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They still try to solve their problems themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus has already given up on them, but they are still struggling and trying to come up with ways to live.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They stumble again and again, only to rise up to try again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They sin again and again, only to make more and more resolutions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They have not given up on themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The day will come when God grants mercy to them and opens their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On that day they will see that as God considered them hopeless, they should consider themselves hopeless as well.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since God has pronounced death to be the only way, they also should pronounce death as the only way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only then will they come to God and confess, "You have crucified me, and I do not want to live anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From now on, it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For years we have been so wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have committed so many sins and have been bound by so much weakness, pride, and temper.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is about time that we give up on ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should come to the Lord and say, "I have done enough; nothing has worked.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I give up.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You take over!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have been crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>From now on live in my place!"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the meaning of "it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>LIVING BY THE FAITH OF THE SON OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The other part of Galatians 2:20 is also very important: "And the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>From this point forward, we live by faith in the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We believe daily that the Son of God lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We say to the Lord, "I believe that You are living for me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You are my life; I believe that You are living in me."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we believe this way, we live this way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No matter what happens, we will no longer make any move.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The fundamental lesson of Romans 7 is that we should not make any resolutions.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The basic teaching is that it is better that we not will to do anything, because such a willing is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Since it is useless to do anything by ourselves, we should simply stop all our moves.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The purpose of Satan's temptation is not only for us to sin but also for the old man within us to move.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When temptation comes, we must learn to refuse to move and to say to the Lord, "This is not my business.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is Your business.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I look to You to live in my place."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Always learn to look to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Never try to move on your own.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We are saved through faith, not through works.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the same way our life is based on faith, not on works.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We were saved through looking to the Lord alone.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Today we live through looking to Him as well.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Just as salvation is accomplished by the Lord, without the involvement of any of our work, so also our living on earth today is a living of the Lord Himself, without the need for any involvement of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must look up to the Lord who saves us and say, "It is You alone, not I."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>After we say this, if we still move on our own, we are saying this in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We must stop our own activity before these words can be meaningful in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Brothers and sisters, we must remember that failure comes not because we do too little, but because we do too much.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>As long as man keeps on working, God's grace will not operate and man's sins will not be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the same way, as long as man is occupied with his own work, trying to do everything by himself, Christ's life will not be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is a rule.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The cross will not produce any effect on those who trust in their own work.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When we insist on our own goodness, we will not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But when we turn away from ourselves to the Lord, we will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The same is true today.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If we are working and operating, instead of the cross working in us and the life of Christ operating in us, this speaking will be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We must learn to condemn ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We must confess that we will never overcome by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Do not will and do not try to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Simply look to the Lord and say, "I look to You as the One who is living in me!</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Live on my behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I look to You for victory!</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>I look to You to express Your life through me."</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If we say this, the Lord will accomplish it for us.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>But if we frustrate our faith by our own work, the Lord can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We have to settle this question once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We have to believe daily and speak to the Lord daily in a definite way: "Lord, I am useless!</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>I take Your cross.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Lord, keep me from moving.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Lord, be my Master and live out of me."</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If we can believe, hope, and trust in this way, we will be able to testify daily, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives."</S>
