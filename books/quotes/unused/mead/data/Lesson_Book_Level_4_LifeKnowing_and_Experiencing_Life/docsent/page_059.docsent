   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>DEALING WITH THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whatever belongs to our being, because it is flesh, needs to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But how do we deal with the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We will discuss this in two aspects: the objective fact and the subjective experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. The Objective Fact</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The objective fact in dealing with the flesh is completely related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Galatians 2:20 says, "I have been crucified with Christ.''</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Again, Romans 6:6 says, "Our old man has been crucified with him.''</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These two passages clearly show us that when Christ was nailed to the cross, we were crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our fleshly being has been dealt with on the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The fact that we have been crucified with Christ is the basis of our dealing with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we had never been crucified with Christ, none of us could deal with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, our dealing with the flesh is to bring forth in experience the fact that we have died with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. The Subjective Experience By the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Galatians 5:24 says, "But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts.''</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Romans 8:13 says, "For if you live according to flesh, you are about to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.''</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although objectively, we have been crucified, like all spiritual realities, we must experience it in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is able to make all the objective facts real to us every day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we realize that we are lusting after something or someone, immediately, we need to call on the Lord and pray, "Lord forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That was the lust of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That does not please You.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You want to remove that, and so do I. Lord, I turn to You right now.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Free me from my flesh.''</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you pray like this, you are exercising your spirit to crucify the flesh and to put it to death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is simple and effective.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not say, "Wait until I grow in life, then the flesh will be put to death automatically by the Spirit.''</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No. The way to grow in life is to exercise our spirit to put the flesh to death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE DEFINITION OF SELF</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After seeing the matter of dealing with the flesh, we must go on to see that our self also needs to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a deeper dealing to cause us to grow higher in life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Remember, growth in life is the increase of God in us and the decrease of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To deal with the self is to decrease ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A. Self is the Soul Life</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is self?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Simply, self is the soul life with the emphasis on human thoughts and human opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can discover this from the Bible, where self is clearly mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Matthew 16:21-25 Jesus spoke about His going to the cross and being raised on the third day.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That was to accomplish redemption and to build up the church according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But Peter had a different opinion, and after voicing it, the Lord rebuked him and said, "Get behind Me, Satan!''</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Jesus continued to say, "If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.''</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To the Lord, the self is just the soul-life, the expression of the self is opinion, which is an expression of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Peter was concerned for the Lord's safety.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But in his concern, he did not care for God's will; rather, he allowed Satan to be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, the Lord rebuked him as Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>B. The Damage of Self</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A person who is full of self always brings many difficulties into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The reason for so many divisions in Christianity today is not only the sinfulness and worldliness of man, but more so the self of man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Throughout history, the church has not been as damaged by persecution or other things as it has been damaged by the self.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Martin Luther once said that although he was afraid of the pope, he was more afraid of the stronger pope, the self, within his own heart.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nothing damages and frustrates the building up of the church more than the self.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The self is the embodiment of the soul, which is expressed through the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, the self, the soul, and the mind are three-in-one.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Behind these three is Satan, who manipulates the self in order to damage the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We all need to heed this word for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we are not saved, we would be in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we do not love the Lord, we would be in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we love the Lord and we care for His church, we may express opinions to damage it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It does not mean that we should not say anything in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need to pray to be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then we should not insist on our own view, but should always speak in the fear of the Lord and be willing to be adjusted.</S>
