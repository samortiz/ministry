<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE DYNAMIC COMPLETE SALVATION OF GOD</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Taking the All-inclusive Christ of God<br>as Its Centrality and Universality</H2><P>Romans is full of Christ. Many expositions of Romans divide it into sections: condemnation, justification, sanctification, selection, and Christian behavior. But this way of exposition is not adequate. It is only by taking the all-inclusive Christ as the center and circumference of the entire book that our exposition can be thoroughly adequate. Christ is the centrality and universality of the entire book of Romans.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Based upon God's Righteousness, Which Is Christ</H2><P>God's complete salvation is based upon God's righteousness (Rom. 1:17a), which is Christ. God's righteousness is a great matter because it is the power of God's salvation. God's righteousness, which is solid and steadfast, is the foundation of His throne (Psa. 89:14) and the base on which His kingdom is built (Rom. 14:17). If there were no righteousness, God Himself would be finished, the entire universe would collapse, and we could not exist. The universe, including us, exists based on the righteousness of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Cover the Believers<br>That They May Be Justified Objectively</H2><P>Christ covers the believers that they may be justified objectively (Rom. 3:20-22). The best robe (Luke 15:22) put upon the prodigal son by the father signifies Christ as the God-satisfying righteousness to cover the penitent sinner (Jer. 23:6; 1 Cor. 1:30; cf. Isa. 61:10; Zech. 3:4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Be Given to the Believers<br>as Their Righteousness Subjectively</H2><P>Christ is given to the believers as their righteousness subjectively to become their living that they may be justified before God subjectively (Rom. 4:24-25). As the resurrected One, Christ is in us to live for us a life that can be justified by God and that is always acceptable to God.</P>
