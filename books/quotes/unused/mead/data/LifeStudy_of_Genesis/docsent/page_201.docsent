   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's People Saved from the World</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>by God's Judgment on the World</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's people are saved from the world by His judgment on it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With what does God save us from the condemned world?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With the same thing by which He judged the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The flood that God used to execute His judgment upon the ancient world saved Noah from that world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Red Sea that God used to judge the Egyptians saved the children of Israel from the evil power of the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The cross by which God judged Satan and his world also saves us from this condemned world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We Christians are saved by the judging cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The cross executed God's judgment upon Satan and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have been saved from God's judgment by the redeeming blood of Christ Rom 5:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We were saved from the condemned world by the judging death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Galatians 1:4 says, "Who gave Himself for our sins, that He might rescue us out of the present evil age."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although Christ died for our sins, the goal was to deliver us from this present evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have heard many messages concerning Christ's death as a salvation from sin, but I have hardly heard a message telling me that the goal of Christ's death was to save me from the present evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Galatians 6:14 says, "But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To Paul, the world was on the cross, and to the world, Paul was on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Is the world on the cross to you?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Are you on the cross to the world?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In our eyes, the world should be on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It has been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do you love something that has been crucified?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To the world, we are on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many times I have heard the parents of a saint say, "My son is dead."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some husbands may say that their wives are dead, and some wives may say that their husbands are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the Christian husbands, wives, sons, and daughters are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are dead to the world, and the world is dead to us through the judging death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Baptism with Water</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Signifying the Judging Death of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Which Saves Us from the World</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Condemned by God</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When you are baptized, you are buried.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nothing can remove people out of the world so effectively as a burial.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Likewise, what can get you out of the world more effectively than baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Suppose a certain man loves the world very much.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He has many attachments in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His wife, children, and all his relatives love him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He has money in the bank and several businesses under his control.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How can such a man get out of the world?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The easiest way is for him to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once his relatives have given him a good funeral, he will be through with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, nothing separates a person from the world more than his burial.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What is baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I am sorry to say that many people think of it as a ritual which makes a person a nominal member of a so-called church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before I experienced genuine baptism, I underwent such a ritual.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should never baptize people in a ritualistic way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever we are going to baptize people, we must pray and exercise our spirit with authority and with the powerful name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then we baptize people, putting them into a "tomb" and burying them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This burial separates them from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have been baptized into Christ's death Rom 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have been buried with Christ in baptism Col 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are dead and buried from the rudiments of this world Col 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have passed through the flood waters and the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The flood waters that judged Noah's generation rescued him, and the Red Sea that judged the Egyptians rescued the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the salvation that we need today.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every Christian needs the second aspect of God's full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Have you enjoyed this aspect of His salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I can shout and declare, "I have been separated from Egypt!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I have been separated from this evil, crooked, and perverse generation!"</S>
