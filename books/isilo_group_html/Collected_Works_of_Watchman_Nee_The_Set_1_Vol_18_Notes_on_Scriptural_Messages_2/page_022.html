Therefore, we will not speak about any doctrine today. Instead, we will relate some stories. A few days ago, we read the News Magazine, Issue No. 1517, page 7, which had an article on church news. The title of the article was "Conference of Western and Chinese Believers of the Little Flock." It mentions something concerning myself and the conference we had. The writer of this article was very polite, and he did not seem to have an evil intention towards us. However, what was reported, perhaps collected from interviews, was somewhat inaccurate in some of the facts. From his words we know that the writer is a brother. So within the next week, I will write a letter to him to inform him of some corrections. (At the time of the printing of this magazine, the letter has been sent, but I have not seen it published yet.)</P><P>The reason I want to speak about our past is that I hope the brothers and sisters among us today will not be robbed to follow others in calling ourselves the "Little Flock." Those brothers and sisters among us who are somewhat familiar with our history will, of course, not be affected. But because some brothers and sisters have only been with us for a few months and do not know our past history, I am afraid that some of them will be a little confused. This is why I want to take this opportunity to speak to all of you.</P><P>Many brothers and sisters are not clear about our background, our work, and everything about us. Many people do not know our history; therefore, I have to say something.</P><P>Three years ago I had to go back to Foochow because of my health. Some brothers and sisters at that time wanted me to tell them something concerning the work between 1922 and 1923. They asked how it was at the beginning, how we fought the battles, and what the testimony of the truth was. I will take this opportunity to speak about how the Lord showed us the truth and how He led us on in this way. Hopefully, this will make them (the Foochow brothers) and the brothers and sisters here (in Shanghai) more clear. We have to pay attention to our words and attitude in order to prevent others from calling us the "Little Flock." If we have already considered ourselves the "Little Flock," we cannot, of course, blame others for calling us the "Little Flock." By relating the story of our past, perhaps we can avoid much misunderstanding.</P><P>However, it is difficult to speak about the things of the past. First, many battles were fought in many areas at the beginning. If we mention names, it will hurt others. Second, many of the past events have to do with me personally. Third, anytime anyone speaks about the past, there is always the subjective influence of his background. For example, if we ask a brother from Nanking to say something, he will surely speak about God's leading, and how he has been taking this way in Nanking. If we ask a brother from Amoy to speak, he will surely speak about the way he sought after the Lord in Amoy and how he obeyed God to take this way. Therefore, whenever people speak about past events, personal flavors and personal backgrounds unavoidably come in. This is what I would like to avoid. I would like to reduce my personal flavor to a minimum. The name Watchman Nee should be cursed. I have said this before, and I will say it again today. I hope that personal flavor would be reduced to a minimum. At the same time, I would like to tell everyone our history. I will now read to you the article in News Magazine:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>The origin of this congregation began with a Fukienese believer called Nee To-sheng. Around 1922 to 1923, he came to Shanghai to establish his congregation and propagate his teaching. He based his principle strictly on the original text of the Bible, but was not well received by the Shanghai community. Because of the political turmoil, he was not able to establish anything, and subsequently returned to Fukien. Later he started The Christian magazine, which became very popular and widely circulated. Later, the magazine changed its name to The Present Testimony, which was also quite appealing and widely circulated. At the same time, he returned to Shanghai and gathered his few affiliates, purportedly to pray, while substantively expounding the Bible. Three years ago, they set up their meeting place in Wen-teh Lane of Hardoon Road in West Shanghai. At the beginning the number was not big, and they called themselves the "Little Flock." They meet about ten times every week. During the past three years, over ten Presbyterian congregations in Kiangsu, another ten or more China Inland Mission congregations in Chekiang, a few independent congregations in Yun- chia and Pingyang in Chekiang, plus a few other congregations in Fukien who were of the same mind were all affected by him. They all overthrew their original denominational names and changed the pastoral system to come under the banner of the "Little Flock." This season, as a result of a visit by six men from Australia, including a Dr. Powell, a missionary Mr. House, businessmen Mr. Joyce and Mr. Phillip, and two female believers who arrived from London, there was a gathering of the affiliates from Kiangsu, Chekiang, Fukien, and Shanghai. The attendance was about two hundred, with Wen-teh Lane hosting. The meetings lasted from November 7th to the evening of the 13th. Every day there were three meetings. I was able to attend the meetings as an observer. Every day Mr. Nee was the main speaker, while the Western and the Chinese believers engaged in discussions. A Mr. Chang and Mr. Chao were the translators. The morale was rich and sweet, and one came away with much help.</P><P>This report is well-intentioned. But as far as the facts are concerned, it is mostly inaccurate. This is why I have to relate to you the real facts so that you will know God's leading among us.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 18: Notes on Scriptural Messages (2) &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
